		<shortDescription>Sheesh... skip all the other reviews. Just read this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just wasted my time reading 20 IMDb reviews for "Tree of Life", both love-its and hate-its. They might as well be telling you how they feel about the colour blue. Subjective, subjective, subjective.So let's try something different. I'm not going to tell you whether I loved or hated this movie. I'm just going to tell you what to expect. Without either praising or disparaging this film, I'd describe it as being a mix of Fellini, Kubrick, IMAX and "Stand by Me".This film is presented in 4 distinct acts, each lasting between 30-45 mins. The acts are very disjoint, and although they are woven together by common thematic elements, the experience can be very disorienting. The director seemed to pattern this film after Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" with its 4 contrasting sections.Act 1: Setting. The film begins with a peek into the life of a 1950s American family that suffers a tragedy. It leaps forward and back in time, setting up the individual characters and their roles in the drama. Though presented in a very fragmented way, this part should be easy enough to follow.Act 2: Tone. The next sequence, lasting about 30 minutes, is a very impressionistic journey through space, time and evolution. Be prepared. There may be a few voice-overs, but otherwise it's completely without dialogue, actors or events. The best way to describe it is to say it's like an IMAX film with the narration turned off. It's somewhat reminiscent of the "acid trip sequence" at the end of "2001".Act 3: Plot. After that, we return to the 1950s. This 3rd sequence makes up the body of this film. Having established the setting &amp; tone, the director gives us a story (more or less). It's presented in a series of vignettes focusing mostly on the love-hate relationship between a boy and his father. This mirrors the love-hate relationship that each character has with goodness. Both the father &amp; son are jerks struggling to become good, each in his own way. This portion of the film reminded me of a dark, disturbing version of "Stand By Me".Act 4: Conclusion. We return to another impressionistic sequence, this time including the main characters and short bits of dialogue &amp; voice-overs. To some of the audience it may give closure &amp; satisfaction. To others, it may just plain suck.For the sake of presenting an objective review, I'll withhold my own opinion. But I did want to mention some of the reactions I observed in the theater and in the parking lot afterwards. In an audience of about 100, I saw 4 people walk out. (Well, 5, but I think that guy just spilled lemonade on himself.) Most of the audience seemed attentive, but I did hear a lot of yawns and uncomfortable fidgeting. When the end credits came up there was dead silence as everyone filed out. It was pretty uncomfortable. In the parking lot there was a man who hated the movie so much I feared for my life. Seriously, this guy was about to plow his car through a storefront. Others praised the film's technical merits and cinematography but remained lukewarm, if not mostly negative, with their overall impression. Several people were intent on discussing the films philosophical merits, but this only infuriated the angry guy, so everyone just went home.If I were to compare this to other films/directors, I'd say it's very Tarkovsky-like (Stalker, Mirror, etc). As I mentioned above, it's also much like Kubrick's "2001"--if you were to strip out the suspenseful parts about Hal and the Discovery. Perhaps it's also a bit like Wim Wenders' "Paris Texas" in that it wanders around a lot before coming to its destination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't expect the majority of viewers to agree with me as it already has a decent rating, but if you searched for people who hated this film then I suspect you will probably dislike it, and I am going to spare you the unfortunate experience I had of going to see it.Just to state my preferences and for your orientation, I have enjoyed many of the artistic offerings from the IMDb top recommendations, but I prefer my fare more straightforward.I'll just fly in the face of protocol now and say I had no clue what this film was about. I wanted to leave after 20 minutes but my girlfriend insisted to stay to the end to see what the point was. Other people did leave in the middle of the film and there was a lot of fidgeting going on in the cinema. For the first time in my life I dozed off for a few minutes in a cinema.There is no plot - only a stream of images following two boys through their childhood and also a flashback to the the creation of the earth. The cinematography was quite impressive but the overall result was oh-so-dull. I am sure there was a point but I just could not be bothered to try to understand it.Apologies to aficionados. I don't mean to be derogatory about this film. I only want to save some people from sitting through it who would not like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most pretentious pieces of pseudo-intellectual garbage I have ever seen. The photography is great, however that is not what a film is about. The whole film turns around a guy and his relation with is father and the burden of his brother's death. really simple story, with no need for mental masturbation over two and one half hours. I'm willing to bet that in the near future no one will ever remember this film. This film gathered another award: my life's greatest cinematic disappointment. Cannes' boys are lowering their standards, I think. Instead of this i suggest you guys rent "the fountain" because it has far better photography and a much, much nicer story.

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I went to watch Midnight in Paris but arrived 10 minutes late, so I went to see The Tree of Life. To be honest again, I don't like Terrence Malick movies that much. However, I convinced myself to sit through it until the end no matter what. It was horrible. I mean, no matter how abstract a movie is, there must be something the viewer can cling to, something the viewer cares about. This movie has nothing like that. The funny thing is, the set-up is fairly quick: in 10 minutes you know what the deal is. Sean Penn is a middle-aged man reflecting on the meaning of life and reminiscing on his somewhat estranged relationship with his father (Brad Pitt) and the loss of his brother in the Vietnam war. After those 10 minutes, nothing that happens in the movie changes that. There's just no development, it s a bunch of short cuts (honestly, the longest cut might be 10 seconds long) showing the family life in the 1950s (very much like home movies) mixed with images of space, Earth in its beginnings, dinosaurs (I'm not kidding) etc. It beggars belief that the crummy hacks out there calling themselves critics say this movie is a "masterpiece" and draws comparison with Kubrick's 2001. Is it because of the slow pace and special effects? Kubrick used those for a reason: to tell a story, to help advance the plot and create a sense of expectation and/or suspense. The Tree of Life is nothing like that, because there's simply no plot. You don't know who to root for or sympathize with. There's no hero, no challenge, no arc. It's just a 2 1/2 hour collage of short scenes. I saw several people leaving the room after just 15 minutes of projection; others kept checking their watches every few minutes (myself included.) It's a pity really, because the performances are quite good, particularly the kids in the 1950s sequence and Brad Pitt as the stern father discharging his career frustrations on the wife and kids. Sean Penn is there too, but he's useless: the director gives him nothing to do, so he just makes ugly faces at the camera as if he's suffering from terrible heartburn. In short: save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A matchless and immensely complex vision of childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing to say about 'The Tree of Life' is that it is ESSENTIAL VIEWING for anyone who believes that the cinema is a great art, and an early front-runner for 'Film of the Decade'. I first heard about this project in the early 80s when the film world was awash with rumours that Malick had a project that was 'Cosmic, too cosmic even for Hollywood' (John Sayles). And, being a number one fan of Malick's magical realism, I have been metaphorically holding my breath ever since. Normally, in describing a film one says this is the story of... da da da da. But this film is NOT a story in any but the crudest sense of the word. It is an impression... an impression of a childhood - perhaps Malick's own childhood, which becomes, through Malick's poetry, an impression of childhood itself... of being tactile, of feeling the love of one's parents, of experiencing the arrival of a sibling, of learning to walk... of a thousand things that we take for granted, but are wonderful and shape us more than we can imagine. It is by far the most brilliant evocation of rural childhood that, as far as I can remember, the cinema has ever given us. This is a film of gesture and movement, of happiness and insecurity, of learning to love and learning to fear. It is unlike any commercial film I have ever seen.... it is as if Stan Brakhage had been given a $100 million budget. The trouble is that Malick may have been too uncompromising. Many, perhaps, sadly, most, of the film-going public, in my experience, find abstraction in films difficult. This is the most abstract film most of them will probably ever see... but it's wonderful and moving and visually stunning. So the question is will they stick with it. With immense sadness, I have to say that I have my doubts.The much vaunted 'history of the universe' sequence is stunning and is like a poetic editing of all of the most stunning images from science documentaries. It adds even more gravitas to a film that is as philosophically weighty as it is visually impressive. Douglas Trumbull was a special effects consultant and many might immediately think of comparing this sequence with the 'Stargate' climax of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The film's philosophical/metaphysical weight rests, to some large extent on its deeply ingrained spirituality. Of course, this aspect has been there from the beginning with Malick, but here it is much more up-front. The film charts the paths of a family of characters. In the mother's opening line of dialogue she recounts how 'The nuns told us that there are two ways through life, the way of Nature and the way of Grace.' In the film, the characters show how much the difference between these two paths influences the personalities of the characters and the lives that they lead.Because of this, it has a profound religious sense but without trace of piety or sentimentality. And if, like me, religion is not your thing, don't worry, the film's wonders do not require belief to reveal themselves.There remains to be said a few words on Malick's stylistic approach. All of his films are incredibly visually rich, 'The Tree of Life' is no exception. But more important even than this is that large sections of 'The Tree of Life' are made in the magical style that he monumentalised in the two 'abstract' sections of 'The New World' - the love affair between Capt Smith &amp; Pocahontas and the amazing final 20 minutes of the film covering her death. It is this fusion of magnificent meaningful imagery and musical montage that lifts this work to levels barely conceived of by most filmmakers.'The Tree of Life', for all its wonders, is certainly not perfect as it seems again that Malick's dislike for dialogue has become a thorn in his side, as it was for 'Days of Heaven' and we get some embarrassing pauses as characters wordlessly confront one another or stare meaningfully into the void. It is not the matchless masterpiece to challenge 'Citizen Kane' that I was secretly hoping for, but it is wondrous and moving and unforgettable, a staggering piece of cinema that gives the impression of being immensely more meaningful than it appears at first sight... one just needs to put all of the pieces together... not in the narrative sense, for there is barely any narrative, but connecting up Malick's, 'universal' vision with the images of childhood that he presents. An example here is the confrontation between the two dinosaurs that has a resonance with the relationship between young Jack and his father.All in all, this is one of those films, where it is more important to let one's psyche experience the incredible richness of the film's emotions, than to try to understand it intellectually - at first viewing, at any rate! (And I am sure that Malick would concur about the experience versus understanding conundrum.)Finally... it is a very, very good idea to watch 'The New World' immediately before seeing 'The Tree of Life' - on DVD or VOD (if it is not being shown locally by some insightful cinema) because, stylistically, it puts you in the 'right groove' to appreciate Malick's cinematic expression... perhaps THE wonder of modern cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do you watch such a film? You've got to lower any defenses you have. You've got to not allow yourself to try to make a sense out of everything you see. You've got to take it all, and let it enter you, just as smoothly as the film enters dinosaurs, cells, planetary evolution, or a simple living room of a troubled family. Make no judgements, consider nothing except the pure experience of being there, wherever the film takes you. Search no explanation, for there was no real rational reason other than intuition for images to be as they are.Imagine a film about everything, with a remote storyline that talks about every theme, in every possible time of the world.Imagine a film without a beginning or an ending. Circular meta-narratives, where you can pick up on any spot (i mean any) and you can create whatever inner narrative you want. A sky of images (like the mosaic poster of the film) where you can pick your own choices, and create whatever story you like. Or you can choose to frame the more palpable story visible in the film in whatever fashion you want. Up to you. The challenge is that you have to test the limits of your own imagination to live the film in its full extent. Nothing is predefined. Go wherever you want.Now imagine all that delivered by someone who spent his entire film life trying to walk around the idea of plain old narrative layering. The absolute master of unrelated narratives, of off-screen details. The man who films hands and corn fields when he wants to say love; Who shoots the universe to build one of the most powerful expressions of intimacy, of mind's solitude in the film world. Contrast.I don't know if this is the best film ever made. It probably is the strongest experience in film world that i got first hand, while it was coming out, new.What is it? a film inside Sean Penn's head? a Story framed in the universe? part of it? metaphor for it?I've heard a lot about how this film is a kind of 2001. I don't think so. Kubrick and Malick are 2 different kinds, 2 different approaches, purposes, different process, and different outcomes. Kubrick bends narratives to a point of perfection. Obsessive. Chess leaked all over filmmaking. Malick is the other end of the stick. Pure visual intuition, enhanced by Malick's intellectual background. Just because both directors are little fond of public appearances, and because both this and 2001 feature planets, that doesn't bring the films closer.In 1963, Cortázar published one of the most important books of the last century, Hopscotch. The title of this comment is related to its original title, in Spanish. I think this film and that book have similar aspirations. Trace your path, you have the chapters, but you have to make an order out of them.How this is done is in pure mastery of every tool of film conception. Every image counts, each shot was taken care with competence and passion, each frame, each camera move - Lubezki has worked with Malick, I?arritu, Cuarón. Each collaboration adds a lot to what is being done. He really can read the director's aspirations, and deliver nothing short of mastery. At this time he has entered enough important projects to be considered one of the best cinematographers ever.The editing is world class. Every cut, whether the space virtual shots or the family scenes, matter to the narrative, whatever that is. What takes this to a whole new level is how, in this film, Malick tops his already incredible leverage of music. Editing has always equally present the visual as well as the sound scapes. Watch it, let it get absorbed.This film demands an incredible lot from you, as viewer. It demands that you be a different person after watching you, that indeed you may change your generic approach to film- watching, or at least that you accommodate in you a new way to watch films. On a basic level it's about Malick's intuitions. On another level, it's about what you get on screen. But ultimately it's all about how you place yourself in the universe proposed.My opinion: 5/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most pointless movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie, I sincerely cannot comprehend all the hype and the excellent reviews that it has attracted. The only way I can explain such good reviews is that whoever wrote them have either been generously paid to do so or were high on dope while doing so. This was the first time ever I have felt so angry about wasting my time and money watching a bad movie. The only reason the movie may have attracted so much attention is the fact that Brad Pitt and Sean Penn were acting in it. However, I felt that their talents were completely wasted on one of the most pointless and most boring movies I've ever seen.Usually, I can sit through a bad movie, but this one bored me immensely within the first 10 min. I still do not understand what the director was trying to portray with the shots of volcanoes, planets, dinosaurs (terrible animation versions) and jellyfish (??). Half of those shots appeared to be borrowed from the Planet Earth series, except portrayed in an incomprehensible and boring manner. There was not a single instance that kept my attention and interest. I was especially irritated by the fact that the movie had a very strong religious streak, which the "good" reviews did not mention. The entire movie was a bunch of disconnected, pointless scenes thrown together, and the ending was especially annoying, with everybody in the family ending up in 'heaven'. I would compare the movie to those useless pieces of contemporary art that depict a monochromatic shape in the middle of a canvas, and attempt to convince us that there is some deeper bullshit meaning to it. I am particularly angry at all the reviewers that rated this movie so well. This movie is a total rip-off!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Essence of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, for those who have not yet read reviews, let me start by saying that this is not your "Brad Pitt/Sean Penn" labeled blockbuster.Also, I would like to add that, if you really want to take in as much as possible (trust me there is a lot to take in), then you should go see this movie, relaxed, not tired, and in a receiving state of consciousness (I watched it last night at 2200hrs, after a very very long difficult day) and I am seriously considering re-watching it on a Saturday night...It is practically impossible to summarize this film, in a few words, but what this film does to you, mostly I think, is take you back to your childhood days, and bring back, re-ignite all these long lost first moments/feelings/discoveries/guilts. Do you remember the first time you had a fight with your parents? What crossed your mind? what did you feel?.....apply this to all the first times and you might get something that feels like this film.This film blends all the above with imaginary scenes from the creation of the cosmos, how all is connected, how did we get here? why? what did God really have to do with this? or is God in other words Love?You have to see for yourself, and I believe each and every one of us will have his own different experience which is exactly what real Art is.Bravo, to the Director, Producers and Cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a masterpiece - and easy to understand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Tree Of Life last night. Just like Sean Penn, who spends the day in the office remembering about his brothers and family, the most urgent thing I feel I have to do this morning is to write about the movie. I haven't be so much impressed by a story, a song or a a film from a very long time.It should go without saying, but let me tell you that this is not a film you should see if you just want to stop thinking about your life for a couple of hours. This should be kind of automatic, i know: but it's worth mentioning, as it would be really a pity to see flourishing such comments or opinions like "i was expecting something else" or "it's very slow paced" or "i didn't really understand that part of the story". Go watch this movie if you want (or: if you NEED) to think about yourself and your life and your story and your future MORE than you usually do, not less. Go watch this movie if you want to find a companion voice wondering together with you about what kind of relationship can be found between our personal stories and the story of the universe, between the quickness of a lizard running across a summer cornfield in Texas and the infinite spaces dividing the countless stars of the universe, between the tenderness of the love that you felt for your parents as a child and the plain fact that in order to grow up, to reproduce that love, you had to leave that child and that love behind you. The voice will help you to realize that the missing links are actually there, in front of your eyes; that in order to see them, your eyes must be open; and that regaining the innocence that seemed lost forever is the key, and the result, of understanding and accepting the presence of those links, opening your eyes.Tree of Life is not a lecture, it's not a sermon: it's an honest flow of memories, meshed with inventions and dreams. It's a masterpiece. I don't feel like making technical remarks here, with this lone exception: everybody will talk about the magnificence of the images of the universe, the ones about the story of the world. I was struck, instead, by the way children were depicted in this movie: the camera is always at the same level of their eyes and after a while you really feel a kid yourself, a friend of them, a member of the pack, playing with them, one of them, again.Strongly suggested to anybody, as long as you are looking for relax through relief, not relief through relax. But, in the end, The Tree Of Life it's a work easy to understand for anybody who's in the proper mindset - and yes, "everybody" includes even your children: in the worst case they will sleep through it, but hopefully they will stay awake, as they will feel perfectly comfortable with the family stories (since they are told with an honesty they will recognize as very close to their own). Eventually, maybe, they will wonder together with you about the meaning and the magnificence of the images retelling the story of the universe and time. Otherwise, as I said, they will sleep - but peacefully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike a novel the stories in this movie do not unfold, revelation following revelation, culminating in a definable message or theme. There is no moral, no hero, no emotional epiphanies. What it presents is an extraordinarily haunting vision of childhood, how the things we love the most are as fragile as morning dew yet immensely powerful. The things that connect us, separate us, and bewilder us - again and again and again throughout our lives. The saddest, most insightful, most poignant portrayal of a family I have ever seen. Genius. How can this film achieve commercial success? it seems impossible. How did a film so ambitious get made when everything that makes money today is everything this film isn't? Bravo to the producers, bravo to the early critics who are stepping up and speaking out for this deeply moving masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nature and Grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Rare are the times that I find myself lacking words to express my opinion on a movie just watched. But writer/director Terrence Malick does not play fair. First of all, what director makes five films in 40 years? Who makes a film about CREATION, life, evolution, spirituality, death and existence? What director seems to thrive when no real story is needed to make his points? Which director can so mess with the viewer's head through visual artistry never before seen on screen? The answer to these questions, of course, is Terrence Malick. And I hold him responsible the fact that I remain in somewhat of a semi-conscious fog four days after watching his latest masterpiece.Any attempt to explain this film would be futile. It is so open to interpretation and quite a personal, intimate journey for any viewer who will free themselves for the experience. What I can tell you is that much of the film is focused on a typical family living in small town rural Texas in the early 1950's. Brad Pitt plays Mr. O'Brien, the stern disciplinarian father and husband to Jessica Chastain's much softer Mrs. O'Brien.Near the beginning of the film, we get Mrs. O'Brien as narrator explaining that when she was a child, the nuns informed that in life one must choose between Nature and Grace. Nature being the real time of real life, whereas Grace is the more spiritual approach. Clearly, Mr. O'Brien has chosen Nature, while his wife embodies Grace. Watching their three boys evolve in this household is quite a treat - and is done with so little dialogue, it's almost shocking to the senses.One of the many things that jumped out at me was the set and production design of Jack Fisk. Mr. Fisk is a frequent collaborator with Mr. Malick and is also the husband of Sissy Spacek, who starred in Malick's first film Badlands. Unlike many films, I did not have the feeling I was watching a film about the 50's. Instead, the look is directly IN the 50's ... slamming screen doors, tree houses, and family supper time! But don't think for a moment that this is a story about the O'Brien's and their sons. This family is merely Malick's vessel for showing the earthly connections between the universe and each of the particles within. If you think this sounds a bit pretentious, you should know that Mr. Malick graduated from Harvard with a philosophy degree, became a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, and a professor at MIT. This is a thinking man and an artist.Actually I would describe the experience as viewing an art exhibit and listening to poetry. It really sweeps over and through you, and takes you on a trip of introspection. So many human emotions are touched - the need to be loved, appreciated and respected. We see the oldest O'Brien son later in life. Sean Penn plays him as a very successful middle aged adult who still struggles with the death of a brother and communication skills learned from his childhood. This is an odd sequence but provided to give balance to the flurry of emotions the younger boy survives.This was the 2011 Cannes Film Festival Palm d'Or winner and that means little if you don't open up as you walk into the theatre. It's a contemplative journey that you can either take part in or fight. My advice is to open up and let this beautiful impression of all life take your mind places it may have never been before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Knows?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this a movie about a hard-working 1950's father who, ground down by the greed of the rich and the machinations of the patent court, and mooning over having to give up a promising musical career as a young man, takes out his frustrations on his rebellious eldest son? And those hundreds of hammerhead sharks, are they supposed to represent the greedy rich? WHO KNOWS? Or, is this a movie about a lovely, loving, and beloved mother who, mourning over the loss of her eldest (or is it 2nd eldest?) son, questions the benevolence and even the existence of God until, with the aid of two beauteous angelic sylphs, she finally gives up her son to God? And what's with all those swirly astronomical scenes, billowing explosive clouds of gas, and pulsing glowing.... things? Are they supposed to represent her internal struggles with God?WHO KNOWS? Or, is it a movie about a boy on the cusp of sexual maturity, confused about the feelings evoked by fleeting glimpses of scantily clad neighborhood women in the heat of the summer, goaded by his neighborhood buddies into acts of cruelty and theft, resentful over the way in which his father treats his mother, his brothers, and himself, resentful of the pressure of guilt and remonstrance from his angelic mother, grows up to be, um, either dead or Sean Penn? WHO KNOWS? And why did that fleet carnivorous dinosaur, with his paw on the head of the abandoned baby herbivore, decide to saunter away, leaving his putative prey lying there still alive? Wasn't he hungry? WHO KNOWS?And about that gigantic, beached, prehistoric sea monster with the deep bloody gash in his side --- was that his head at the end of a huge neck twisting around to view the damage? Or was that the head of some other gigantic prehistoric beast who happened to be wandering by? WHO KNOWS?And what were all those slowly twisting spirally thingies? Were they spirochetes? And was that the birth and death of the universe? And why did they plant that tree? To memorialize the person who had crashed his bike and was flopping in death throes on the grass? WHO KNOWS? And was that the Horsehead Nebula? YES IT WAS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was awful. Terrible. A waste of time. I find it ridiculous that there are so many posts defending this film. It seems there are so many people out there who are fully ready to take in pointless stories and label them "deep" (by which they mean "made no sense whatsoever, which must mean its beyond our grasp") I can forgive some films that choose form over content but not this. Where it isn't ripping off shots from documentaries like "Home" (I/2009) and "Planet Earth" and concepts from classics such as "2001", it is trying desperately to convey some sort of painful story with minimal basic dialogue and endless monologues of pointless drivel. Yes, parts of the cinematography were beautiful, the acting (especially from such young boys) was impressive, yet there was not one SINGLE original idea when it came to the script. There was absolutely no motivation for the viewer to stay glued to the screen. It was more a case of:, "Ooh, this woman is grieving for her dead son, but it doesn't really matter in the big scheme of things cos' there were also once dinosaurs roaming the Earth and there are big explosions and...here's a shot of orange smoke...you figure all this out since I couldn't be bothered." Really deep stuff... I actually paid money to see this. Argh. And also - 8.0 out of 10? That's weird, that's seriously weird.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bold And Epic Exercise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terence Malick's existential and experimental drama is truly something special. When I first started watching the film, I was trying to figure out what Malick was aiming to portray due to the film's somewhat convoluted structure, but towards the end, I took in every aspect of the film, the themes of family, of existence, of life in general. Many see this as a hit-and-miss film, but unless you truly focus your attention, you'll miss the point it's trying to make. Is it pretentious? Indeed, but it's equally an amazing picture.We sit for 2 hours and follow Jack, a young child growing up in a dysfunctional house with Brad Pitt playing (extremely well) his strict and overwhelming father in the 1950s. The story feels inspired by the likes of '2001: A Space Odyssey' and the art-house feel of Von Trier, but despite this, 'The Tree of Life' has its own unique and bold style that works well in creating a haunting and emotional visual treat, accompanied with fantastic performances from Brad Pitt, Sean Penn and Jessica Chastain and stunning cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki. 'The Tree of Life' is a bold and epic exercise from Malick that acts as a commentary on our society, a truly rewarding view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly don't understand how so many reviewers found meaning to this lengthy, boring, pointless film. "We've been stepping on each other's necks since we were dinosaurs." Big deal! Large swaths of this movie are like watching a stranger's home movies. This is about a family who can't get past their own pain, whether it's large or small. It suggests that there really is no meaning to our suffering though we think there is. But I don't need a 2.5 hour movie with pretensions of grandeur to tell me this. Sean Penn stepping through a door frame in the desert. Gee, that's deep. Spend time with your actual family rather than watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emptying out, in search of the true face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Malick I usually come away with few things, simple wonderings about meaning and the desire to transcend. But there is something here worth talking about, a wondering that I believe matters. It is about the great lie upon which we have placed all our hopes and has fed us only suffering. It includes god but goes beyond, way beyond.Those of us in the West trace it back to Descartes, the foundation of what we call our Enlightenment. The title of the 1641 book where he tells us that we are because we think translates as "Meditations touching the first philosophy in which the existence of God and the distinction between the body and soul are demonstrated". Imagine the yawning breach with the natural world that gives us to itself at birth; we posit that we are because we think, not because we simply are! This alone reveals it; a distinction between body and soul (and how the concept of God is born from it, in a mind that regards itself as separate from its vessel), that has produced a culture that considers everything a commodity, that revolves around pleasing the needs of one or the other. And about us perceiving things as what we are in need of and by our ideas of them.The imaginary conundrum of duality goes way back, it's what the film starts with. A distinction between the way of nature and the way of grace, again body and soul. Implying there is no grace in the first and that a way of grace cannot be found in what we readily observe around us, in how the world simply presents itself to us (which includes our body and what sensations appear in it - either considered impure or to satiate), but needs to be separately thought by us. The nuns told us; about a world devised from nothing in the creator's own good time, and us separately placed in it, even created in a separate day from the rest of creation, to atone for an original sin.This is the worldview we are born into. A world itself as punishment, which we are called to subdue to our satisfaction. Modern science has done little to improve it, only now we explain away in order to subdue and have replaced one creation myth with another.Now both ways created by Malick, so that we can see where the lie begins. The creation of creation, from the Bing Bang onwards, rendered with overblown Wagnerian crescendos like what Kubrick did 40 years ago. Malick shows us here that mercy exists among the predators. And then us separately born into creation. The first words uttered by the infant are "it's mine", the first words uttered by the father a lesson to his young son about the imaginary line that separates his garden from the neighbor's and never to cross it.In the second half of the film we get a few codas on what destructive illusions have evolved from these notions. How we should strive to obtain and subdue until satisfied, and to admit otherwise is weakness. And how the pursuit never satisfies the hunger, but only leads us to imagine a lacking in what we already have. And how we desperately cling to things, things felt as either ours or to be made ours, even as we know that they will come to pass.But at the absence of the fatherly authority, we see how the kids become an aimless mob. And how the violence trickled inside the kid, eventually poisons and erupts.Over the course of all this, we get Malick's tricly soliloquy that has always been the easiest to attack. "Was I false to you?", "forgive us", "where have you gone?". It's not my favourite aspect of his work, but I truly believe he's a feather-brained bard and deeply means it.The rest is in the finale. It's not so much about closure that restores balance, but a process of emptying out and letting go of what has poisoned the soul. So that upon transcending the illusions of duality, remains only the unbound sentience of the world giving itself back to us.Pitt is terrific in this, in ways he hasn't been before (compare to Ben Button that strived for a similar somber effect). But what truly stands out is the boy and the look of grief piling inside.Malick tells us about his parents fighting inside of him, this is the great war in nature. Who of the two to become, without betraying the other? The one who loved harshly because he wanted his kids to have, or the one who loved tenderly but did nothing to alleviate the suffering in her own home.So these are the two natures as falsely taught to us by the 'nuns', one as cautionary warning, the other to aspire to. The father as embodiment of the "nature that only wants to please itself", but that nature is only our false notion of a self, an ego that expects to be pleased. A tree doesn't please itself when it's watered, it takes only what it must to grow into what it has potential to be.And the mother's way of grace that stoically accepts, also false because it accepts without complaint the injury of the innocent. The mother allows by her passive stance both her children and her husband to remain unhappy. So, who to be eventually, as grown men who have lived so long with grieves that are not ours?Zen Buddhism hints at this and goes beyond, with its koan of koans (the enigmatic phrase that doesn't have an apparent answer yet demands one by the initiate, meant to tie his tongues in silent meditation); Zen Master Hu?néng asks, "Without thinking of good or evil, show me your original face before your mother and father were born".Something to meditate upon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider myself a fairly intelligent movie goer. I am someone who have absolutely loved movies such as There Will be Blood, Babel, Old Boy, Memento, Capote, Tokyo, etc etc. But this movie astounds me. It astounds me and astonishes me in its absolute pointless stupidity. This movie has absolutely no story (so to speak). And I'm sure movie connoisseurs are going to behead me for saying stuff like this, but yes this movie is like a headless chicken. Only one that is not running around like crazy but still has no direction and is dying a very slow death. I just do not understand that how a movie maker can be so self centered, self-hedonistic and narcissistic in his pursuit to compile his art into such a collection of crap. Agreed that this movie contains some great imagery. But you know what....Terrance Mallik almost starts coming across as this pretentious moron who just does NOT know the meaning of the word 'moderation'. Jesus Christ dude.... grow up, you're making a movie for god's sake, not turning in some PhD thesis in a film making school. Maybe your fellow students, colleagues might appreciate your effort but the audience who pay their hard earned money to go into the theater don't do so so some high headed director masturbates on his own effort while not once thinking whether the audience may or may not enjoy the story.I am so so so disappointed in this movie and disappointed in the fact that Brad Pitt and Sean Penn chose to be a party to this charade...to this pretentious crap. To non-aficionado regular YET intelligent movie goers like me, all I can say is that please save your time and money and stay away from this crappy movie that otherwise looks great only in the trailer. The trailer is what drew me to this movie....and thats all there is to it. Arghhhh!!!!! I hate Tarrence Mallik's audacity with this movie and am going to stay away from all his movies going forward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious, pietistic drivel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>O.K, I'm a rationalist, and a supreme being, or a belief in such, plays no role in my life. This doesn't mean, however, that I can't appreciate a work that assumes a deistic definition of reality, but sitting through the "Tree of Life" is like being forced to listen to a seemingly endless Tent Meeting Sermon, gussied up with startling photography and made a bit more politically correct by giving a nodding acceptance to evolution (or at least to dinosaurs).An artist has a right to impose his definition of reality upon us, but even if we leave Mr. Malick's pietistic beliefs aside, the reality he presents simply makes no sense historically and sociologically: We know from the family's name that they are Irish American Catholics, but the church they attend every Sunday seems to be ecumenicized. Aside from Brad Pitt's quick kneel (without crossing himself) and a flash of religious imagery, there is no trace of Catholic ritual (no Latin mass, no communion, no confession.) It's a homogenized Christian church, and the religion the family practices seems, really, quite Protestant. Such a non denominational Christianity would be believable in a secularized family, but religion is the center of this family's existence. In short, it's a piety that could not have existed in Waco in 1950.But is it really 1950? It is assumed that the son who is killed was killed in combat. But in which war? From the costumes and cars, the action of the film when the boy to be killed was growing up was the early to mid 1950s; the boy is somewhere between 10 and 12. he was killed when he was 19, that is to say 7 to 9 years later. The date of his death, then, could be at the latest, 1964, when very, very few US military were killed. The serious fatalities among US military personnel didn't begin until much later. In short, possible, but highly unlikely. Moreover, the war itself is totally absent from the film. It was hardly absent from US society in the mid 1960s.But the most absurd aspect of the film is Brad Pitt's character's relationship to his sons. His main function is to act as a stern, tyrannical disciplinarian. But he has to be humanized to show how much he really loves his sons. Otherwise, there would be no story. So, he is constantly kissing and embracing them. Such physical expression of paternal affection was all but unknown among Irish Americans, especially lower middle class Irish Americans in Texas. It is totally unbelievable. Especially since the character is not otherwise physically demonstrative; he hardly ever touches his wife, except to fend off her aggression.That he is a musician manqué helps a bit; but even that is not particularly credible. Couperin in Waco in 1955? Please! In short, this is a family that never could have existed.I'm sure a scientist could say similar things about Mr. Malick's version of the Creation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine photography meets the cheesiest iconography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's "Tree of Life," is a pretentious slide show of cosmic post-cards, with a story in the middle. This animated power-point reuses unashamedly the worst clichés of TV commercials (think of a two hours advertisement for a life insurance), and the most lurid scenes of Discovery Channel's documentaries. Malick resorts to an exquisite photography to illustrate embarrassing platitudes, and this experience is particularly unpleasant for the spectator. Malick's attempt is very ambitious, and he should be praised for that. Two movies written in a similar phenomenological vein come to my mind: Kubrick's 2001 and Tarkovski's Zerkalo. The last two movies, however, were balanced and perfectly executed. Alas, Malick's movie is redundant, heavy, sententious, excessive and sometimes even obscene, but not hopeless. For this lack of decorum ultimately depends on the editing, and Malick could drastically improve this movie if he remembered that the force of poetic forms relies on economy of language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Random and Horribly Deceiving...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon seeing a preview of The Tree of Life, I was convinced that this movie was sure to be one of the better movies I'd see this year and possibly to date. On opening night, after watching and anticipating some plot development, I found myself bored and fidgety in what should more enjoyably have been a 50-minute National Geographic IMAX. The movie elaborates and clinches onto every small detail of what does not matter, and ceases to delve into or draw upon any explanation that matters- the opening scene is never truly explained; Sean Penn's roll never unfolds or materializes; and the central element of the film- one character's death- is never resolved or unveiled. It's as if Malick set out to describe every single detail and then midway into filming decided to give up.The movie essentially is a set of shots taken by Malick which he decided to combine into a two and a half hour film. The beginning half of the movie is spent painstakingly journeying into every minute detail of how the world was created, the details of the how dinosaurs and sea life evolved, and the meteorite that caused their extinction. Then, suddenly as if Jurassic Park is ejected and a new film has begun, you are transferred from how dinosaurs became extinct to how a family in Waco spends their summers. However, this sounds much more interesting than what actually occurs.In order to make these shots a movie, Malick decides to throw in Brad Pitt and the story of a boy's childhood. Shots of a fire explosion into Big Bang visuals into dinosaurs into jellyfish into a creek in Texas into the Texas Capital Building into Dallas Architecture into sunflowers into dessert hills are all randomly forced together without any entertaining plot, interesting story, or memorable happening. Every time you hope for something to unfold, the scene changes. All the shots seem forced together, more dramatic than what actually occurs, and encouraged to drag on and on and on. Commendably, the visuals are some of the best a recent film can offer. However, as a movie and a storyline- the Tree of Life fails terribly. I found myself hoping that the movie would end suddenly after any random shot of flowers or a creek or waterfall... and sure enough it did just that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love unconventional films. Creativity is rare, and I'm supportive of writing that is extraordinary (but not necessarily "out of the ordinary"). And I have to say that I am a big fan of some films coming from the same director ("Thin Red Line" is a fantastic war movie).And throw in the fact that I grew up in the Waco, Texas area (setting for the movie) and currently reside in Austin, this movie certainly was on the top of my most anticipated films of the year (if not decade).But from start to finish it disappointed me. I will not give away anything, but I have to say that it was too similar to the movies that are screened in small rooms in most modern art galleries. I just don't like paying money to sit for over two hours to watch what I consider to be almost pure modern art. But this just was not what I would call a "film" or "movie", any more than I could call a novel filled with random phrases a "book".If nothing else, seeing this film will give you something to talk about. You may be pretentious enough ... oops, I mean sophisticated enough ... to truly appreciate and enjoy this work. I hope so. But worst case you can have something to gripe about when you are working for a living, wishing you were clever enough to be able to make films like this one instead of having a real job.

		<shortDescription>Movie? Maybe. Art? Maybe. Pretentious? Absolutely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many movies have gone down in history as pushing the envelope, changing the way critics and audiences perceive movie making as a whole. Citizen Kane, Psycho and A Clockwork Orange are only a few to raise the bar on how effective a film can be on a viewer. Sometimes those filmmakers go down in history as visionaries, decorated time and again by journalists, historians and movie fans alike, but pushing the envelope can also bring about the opposite reaction. Every now what comes along is something that few understand and even fewer care to try. For the reclusive director, Terrence Malick, he doesn't seem to care which category he falls in and maybe that's the best way to play it. He makes his movies as a personal statement and they represent exactly what he wants to say, never mind what people want to hear. Lofty and admirable as that outlook may be, it can make for an incredibly risky movie-going experience. There are already heated words being tossed all over blogs and movie sites everywhere, so here's my two cents in the debate.The Tree of Life is a visual and ethereal poem about loss, despair, God and the search for faith and reconciliation.(I usually write much more about the basic plot of the movie for the review, but honestly, there wasn't much of a plot or story to speak of.)From the opening whispers of narration, I knew that we were in for something a little off the beaten path, which in itself is not automatically a bad thing. Challenging the norm should be done on a regular basis, but that comes with its own risks. With only a few precious moments of actual characters to speak of, The Tree of Life launches into a 45 operatic display of the birth of the universe. Within the first few minutes I felt I thoroughly understood the director's point of view, which admittedly may have been wrong, but either way I definitely got what we were witnessing. The main issue here is there was absolutely no need to witness it for 45 minutes. While listening to a tremendously overblown and self-indulgent score, nearly a dozen people walked out of the theater in that opening sequence. After twenty-to- thirty minutes of something more akin to a Discovery Channel special on the universe, the audience began feeling like there was no point being made and an actual narrative story was nowhere to be found. I've made a promise to myself never to walk out of a movie, but I was dangerously close. I knew Brad Pitt and Sean Penn were cast in this for some reason; I was waiting to find out what that was.Sadly, there really is no reason. There are a small handful of poignant moments from the various cast members, but they could never separate themselves from the poor cinematic experience or even truly showcase why they were cast. In the end I felt like any actor could have played these parts because each scene was only tangentially connected to the next, a feather-light spiderweb string trying to keep some type of flow or momentum, but it continually snapped under the hot air blown by Malick.The real debate here is whether or not this even qualifies as a movie (or "film" for the pretentious). Even farther down the philosophical debate is whether or not movies are "art", which this piece clearly strives to be. For me, this would have made a much better impression and found a more receptive audience if it was screened in the MOCA or LACMA or any museum. It felt completely out of context shown in a normal movie theater. Some people will point to this winning the Palme d'Or at the legendary Cannes film festival as proof of its value and credit as a great movie, but I would pleasantly remind those people that it was also roundly booed by half of the audience afterwards, something only reserved for the most detested of films in the festival. The Tree of Life is being hailed by critics everywhere, who mostly can't put into words what it is about or why they liked it, but in turn reviled and railed against by audiences, who walk out by the dozen and request their money back (true story, happened in my screening and in each of the ones attended by friends of mine). If anything this will help remind movie lovers everywhere, don't listen to critics, including me. Make up your own mind, at your own risk. In the end we are all critics, just some are louder than others.The End of the Page Recommendation: The Tree of Life wilts under the scrutiny of any audience not sitting in a museum or on hallucinogenics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director failed to achieve his goal, to make the viewer strongly feel what he was trying to express -the essence of the movie.Beautiful scenes alone (documentary or SFX style), doesn't make a good movie or a good part of the movie, far from this. The scenes with the family were OK, but everything else was almost out of context.Editing and directing was seriously lacking harmony -a meaningful connection between them, so overall cinematography was poor. It won at Cannes because Brad Pitt and Sean Penn were playing -the star-system always supports their stars -big names that might bring them more money. I regret I spend two hours+ with friends to watch this, instead of something better.Bottom line, other than some scenes with the family -which weren't anything above average anyway, you won't *feel* what the director wanted you to feel. You might "understand" (after a lot of confusion) his attempt, but you won't feel it. This is the difference between art and non-art, a failed attempt to express (and cause) the intended emotions on a medium, equals no art at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We rented this film from HBO last week and STILL have not erased it because we love it so much. When so many films are cookie-cutter adaptations of ingredients that work to make oodles of bucks this film was unique and took chances most do not. Brad Pitt, I believe, is one of our country's national treasures. His excellence in film is matched by his excellence in life.The film grapples with the eternal questions of man. I do not know if The Tree of Life solves what is for me unsolvable but at least it makes an attempt at differentiating the science surrounding the facts we know about the etiology of the earth with the yearning of man to still ask the eternal why of his suffering.It is about the Biblical Book of Job in that it is about suffering in the face of the perfect creation of earth. It is about the majesty of the earth's construct and the less than perfect man within it. The cinematography is gorgeous and the sound magnificent using many classical works to emphasize the grandeur of life that simply is.I loved the complexity of the relationships and the ambivalence of the mother toward the father, the grief they both endure and how they endure it. Pitt's relationship with his sons was profound, angry, loving, loathing and deep.We keep playing and replying this film to see, hear, and watch the beauty of the anthropological formation of earth and those in it who crave answers to their suffering juxtaposed against the beauty that is existence. We are a division between earth's scientific creations and within it the etiology of man with his frailties.One scene depicting early earth and the age of dinosaurs showed one dinosaur's victory over another. It keeps its talons on the subjugated wondering, it seems, whether to kill it or not. It does not. Was this some nascent element, albeit minuscule, of altruism compelling the victorious dinosaur not to eat his spoils as he, unexpectedly, lifts up his talons off the defeated one and walks away? Who knows? One can only speculate.Who are we, where did we come from and most importantly why? We live with the grandeur of the earth's beauty and alternatively the suffering ugliness it sometimes visits upon us. We live in its uncomfortable harmony as the two are inexorably and inextricably linked yet a separate part of man's existence. This film attempts to reflect on the eternal questions that have plagued human existence since the beginning and probably will never be sufficiently answered even at the end of it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, dumbed down to the point of being dumb. Deep and probing intentions made sappy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tree of Life (2011)A serious movie that is filmed with fluid and active photography and some beautiful special effects. It deals with life and death and mourning, about whether God exists and how we might picture him.And it feels like sacrilege to say it's a huge bore. It's slow. It's filled with greeting card clichés. It's pompous. The more it tries to be deep the more annoying and frankly stupid the whole enterprise is.I don't mean to end up insulting those who liked--or loved--this movie. Maybe this really is a good entry point for people who haven't dealt with these issues before. Even so, it doesn't do those people justice because it dumbs the whole thing down to sentimental sorrow or to empty wonder at nature's beauty.The three boys who dominate the "human" parts of the movie are pretty convincing types. The dad, played by Brad Pitt with a permanent haughty pout, is uneven, held back in part because of his script, and the mother, played with dull soberness by Jessica Chastain, is merely pretty. Pitt and Chastain appear in the first long core of the movie, set in the 1950s, and the idea is roughly to portray a common American middle class family with a normal set of flaws and charms. You'll get the idea in about ten seconds. It borders on insulting how the woman can't ever speak her mind--or speak at all. It's a dumbed down version of a male dominated family, with little threads of religion thrown in as a kind of unexplored rationale. Unexplored? That's the crux of the whole film--all these really interesting topics that are thrown up in the air like leaves and watched but never explored, even though exploration is the grand intention. The other human story, much shorter and even more superficial, features one of the sons forty or so years later, played by Sean Penn. He's tormented (still) by the death of his older brother when he was ten or so. So we see a contemporary man's struggle to find God, or to understand the absence of God, and find his place in a world filled with glassy skyscrapers.The non-human (nature) parts of the story are insertions bulging with dramatic slow motion special effects giving the same story you might remember from "Fantasia" (Walt Disney's version)--the big bang, the start of life, etc. all told in a kind of scientific sense (no voice of God) but with a tremendous feeling of awe all the time. It's pretty, but that's it.All of this might be enough for some people. For me it was almost impossible to watch. There is an astonishing lack of originality to it, and lack of intelligence (actually). It even lacked human subtlety. There is insipid whispered narration, lots of staring into space, or up at the trees. Lots of it. In a word, it's horrible even though the intentions are fabulous. I mean, we'd all love a movie that helps us make sense of life and death.The one saving grace is the filming, the photography, which is consistently nice or even superb, almost to distraction. Maybe the camera-work was just on such a high order relative to the rest of it, it became distracting, moving and following the otherwise empty scenes.Who's responsible for this simplistic mess? The director and writer, Terrence Malick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful! Way to cute a movie for its own good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was torture to watch this movie. We went to see it based on the reviews and the cast. I cannot blame the cast. The result has to fall on Malick's shoulders.The film begins when a telegram/letter arrives with bad news and then morphs into a scene that seems to represent creation or some other unfathomable purpose. It feels like this lasts for 15 minutes or more. It seems almost to be tacked on. Maybe it was a chance for Malick to follow through on a project he had developed for Paramount in the early eighties but had never come to fruition.The film eventually addresses family issues including loss, love, abuse and others. I had great difficulty connecting with any of the characters. This was partly due to the flashbacks and flash forwards that Malick uses to try to make his points. In the flash forwards with Sean Penn I had no connection with the Penn character. Yes it is easy to tell that he is depressed and lost. But I just did not care. He was just too disconnected with his younger self in the movie. This is not the fault of Penn. He was obviously serving what Malick wanted. Penn's scenes were probably filmed in one to three days. I speculate that the family dynamics portrayed may have been partly autobiographical for Malick. Possibly people who have suffered family abuse might be attracted to this movie because it expresses something they cannot. However I would recommend "This Boy's Life" as a much better alternative to Malick's film.What I mention now may sum it all up. The screen fades to black. The sense is the movie is over and you feel relief. After a few seconds a palate of colors comes onto the screen. Almost as if the "creation" scene is beginning anew. The gentleman next to us involuntarily utters, "Oh, no!" As if the movie was going to continue on. Fortunately it did not. It was still two hours and eighteen minutes lost out of our lives. My sympathies to BP.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>7.8 out of 10!? It doesn't make any sense. Sorry, but this movie is terrible. The story is OK, there are definitely some good acting performances and the music is the best part of the picture ? which is strange for a visual (?) work?. But that's all! I'm really impressed with the absolutely inexplicable number of good reviews, even here where the users usually have fair opinions. After reviewing them all I went to the theater expecting to watch a masterpiece. I couldn't be more frustrated! Thank God I had the privilege to see "Super 8" on the following day, more specifically, thank J. J. Abrans, thank Spielperg's school, for helping on my recovery! You must be a genius to be so pretentious: Big Bang, Dinosaurs, personal lost and Freudian pseudo-theories on childhood simply don't fit together.

		<fullReview>Little has to be said after seeing this movie. its beautiful, hypnotic, and memorizing. The fact that it doesn't follow a structured storyline is a big turn off for some people, and i respect that, but i completely embraced it. This movie gave me something more then just an experience. It was almost something outer worldly. The unstructured narrative WAS the journey for me.Don't listen to the other reviews, or the 'booing' articles. Go see it for yourself. Submit for two complete hours, and just let malick enfold you in his wings. And I guarantee, that if you have a passion for life, and for art, then you will find yourself sitting in awe of this movie.

		<shortDescription>On Profundity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just going to say a few of the regular things before I get into it. Yes, this is not your tradition blockbuster. A lot of people who normally wouldn't see this movie did because of Brad Pitt and Sean Penn. It's a non-traditional narrative. Terrifying, I know.I want to argue against a few accusations being thrown at Terry and this film. One common one is that this is a self-centered and pretentious film. As previously mentioned, this is not a box office thriller. Although I cannot speak to the intentions of Mr. Malick, I can say with some confidence that the main goal of this movie is not entertainment. In fact, this movie has no main goal. Some pieces of art are made for the sake of the artist, not the audience. In this case, we're lucky that the creator is a respected intellectual who has the ability to share his pieces with a large audience. This piece is not pseudo-intellectual wankery, as some have submitted. I don't want to come off as a total dick, but I could understand how this movie might be intimidating. Let me try my hand to explain what Terry was going for here. And like I said, I may be totally wrong.We have what seem like two separate sections of film. One, the depiction of the birth of cosmic bodies and the growth of the earth including the distinction of the dinosaurs and all that. Obviously its all gorgeous. I don't see a lot of people bashing the cinematography thank god.The second section is the one in which we see the loss of innocence of the boy and Sean Penn's character reaction to it. I'll also include what some people are calling the "heaven" scene in this section, although I would not label that scene as such. I'll get to that later. With some minimal research on the director (which I'm sure he'd hate) one can find out that these domestic scenes are rather autobiographical. Terrence really did have a very talented guitar-playing brother (who studied under Segovia) and broke from the stress. So what do these two sections have to do with one another? While not necessary for their comprehension it should be noted the director taught philosophy at MIT and translated Heidegger's "Essence of Reason," and purportedly visited the guy in the woods before he died. This may impress you, it may not. It impresses me very much.So here's where I tackle profundity. Many people today look at films and novels as things to be puzzled out. A moral is there to be discovered and taken and learned. This movie is not like that!Malick is taking his life and putting it side by side with the grand, cosmic, ineffable mechanisms of the universe. If there is a "purpose" of this movie for the audience, it is thus: what meaning can my life have against all things and all time? And not just himself, but the jellyfish, and the dinosaurs people find so silly. He has no answer. He is basking in the wonder of it all. This is his ode to existence. There's no hidden meaning to it. He just wants to say: look! Look first at the beauty and then look at your own life. So I guess that's it.</fullReview>

Somehow this movie got good reviews which is the only part of the movie that made me think. I though, am I just not getting it, is this movie above me? No it's not. movie critics are for some reason afraid to give bad reviews to a movie like this that is supposed to be "artsy" and supposed to make you think. they leave there bad reviews for "stupid" movies like vampires suck or hot chick.

		<shortDescription>The Struggle Between Nature and Grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many viewers, I had questions and some confusion. Then I read a few helpful reviews and went back over major images in the film. The creation, philosophical, and spiritual allusions were fairly clear before, but I hadn't made the connections fully with the family until I read and thought.I think for me the most powerful are the scenes of the dinosaurs, kitchen, and beach. In the first two, attempts to struggle are met with 'stop', and in both, the healthy dinosaur and the father become gentler. In the penultimate scene on the shore, the mother has stopped struggling with the pain and gained acceptance...grace. The adult Jack, through the child still within him, is allowed to see this and perhaps now accepts that we can never understand why we suffer--like Job--but the struggle only drives us further into deeper pain. The beach scene takes us and I assume the souls he sees back to a majesty suggested by the water: both life and death but also return. These souls are at peace. The final Bridge scene perhaps represents the connections Jack now understands.The film reminds me of Wordsworth's Great Ode, also a meditation on the mysteries, complexities, and anguish of our lives. He says we "come into the world trailing clouds of glory," but living beats us down, and the glory fades. However, at the end of the poem, like the film, is the image of the shore lining a vast ocean. We stand on that shore waiting to return to our source. It is Romantic and Platonic. Wordsworth believed that Nature is the force 'that rolls through all things": we are connected by it. But life also brings us pain "too deep for tears"--like the loss of a child.The answer to the question WHY may never be known, which makes us struggle even more. However, the film does not end on an existential note, but spiritual: "I give him to you." That release brings peace that never existed before. Is there more for us when we learn to bear pain and accept loss? Is there a grace then granted, even an afterlife? I don't know. Struggle against pain is a normal and healthy response. But for how long? Nature rather gently at last says 'stop.' Maybe we can't, but if we do, perhaps the peace achieved brings us to that shoreline--where a grace exists we could not know before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Moments of Existence in The TREE OF LIFE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tree of Life is the latest film by reclusive director Terrence Malick (Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line) whose previous films displayed a simple narrative abetted by haunting imagery. This film takes a step further by telling its story in grand strokes of imagery. Though its technique may lead some to wonder the point of this exercise and dismiss it as confusing, others will hail it an ambitious masterwork. Let the viewer beware.One family deals with a personal loss as it ponders the meaning of life through the point of view of its oldest son (Sean Penn), now an adult in the business world. Celestial forces of nature signal the very creation and existence of the universe and provide a majestic background to the birth and evolution of life on earth. We witness the beginnings of an American family from the Midwest in mid-twentieth century. Led by a stern, proud father (Brad Pitt), and a doting mother (Jessica Chastain), three sons experience the joys and pains of growing up. Through a rapid series of short scenes, this tapestry of sounds and images forms a mosaic of life's precious moments. All the while a voice asks the great questions of life and God.Certainly the most ambitious film in the enigmatic director's career, it is also the most challenging. This is pure cinema, and it is remarkable how the film is able to communicate visually albeit without much in the way of lengthy dialogue. These fragments of life almost seem surreal as if from a Fellini film. In a way it is kind of an experimental film on a grand scale. It seems to ask, 'what is the purpose of existence amid great loss'? (Despite being a very spiritual film, creationists might not like the premise of some of the scenes that strongly suggest an evolutionary development of life on earth.)Those who are able to decipher the abstract nature of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey will likely have a clue on how to access the style and meaning of this film. Indeed, some of the impressive visuals were created by Douglas Trumbull (Blade Runner) who did the 2001 special visual effects and helped to realize Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has captured some stunning visuals of landscapes and life that are at times overwhelming in their beauty. The musical score alternates between classical and operatic pieces although one almost expects a minimalist, Philip Glass-type score to pop up.There are many unanswered questions. Which brother died and how? And what is the background of the oldest brother as adult? How has the father changed since the loss of his son and how does this affect the family? As much as the oldest son asks for answers, we want more information and must settle for pieces from a larger puzzle.The film serves as a search for meaning and hope amid the vastness of existence. As we see the father teach his sons about manners, chores, music, fighting, and death, we may see something in our own common, shared experiences. Life is portrayed as a series of events that sometimes blur over time.This exploration of the meaning of life may prove to be too abstract and a turn off for some, but to those who are open to a visual experience unlike any other, it may prove to be a fascinating exercise in pure cinema. Kubrick would be proud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been studying Chinese calligraphy in the context of the cinematic life. 1300 years ago, Chinese poet-theorists had the notion that layered expression, perhaps with four layers or more, was the purest expression possible. The first of these layers come with the ideograms: you 'tell a story' using abstract pictures that reference other stories. Masters can then add several more levels in the way you draw the characters. The result is a barrage of meanings woven by emotions. Though the concepts unroll in a linear fashion, they do so with a symphony of simultaneous and referenced 'stories,' most of them working invisibly. Space, and the things unspoken are as significant as the ink you see.Most of these poet-philosophers would reference (even devise) basic laws of life. What we know as Taoism is more a result of calligraphy as the other way. No man could be a whole man without his writing. We would be without something like this in the West until Shakespeare devised a different way of sneaking up on this, the ideograms being 'acted out' (literally as characters) with the 'laws of life' drawn from the Kabbalah of Bruno and Harriot. While China has an incredible legacy of calligraphic twists and turns, with great sweeps of changes and literally millions of masters, we have the more visceral cinema. To plum this notion of simultaneous layers from the flow of the world, we have the different curiosities of Greenaway, Ruiz, Medem, Lynch, Kelly, Quay... And Malick.I'm especially attuned to his adventures. I took classes under him when he was a philosophy professor at MIT, and he was struggling, really struggling with the inadequate 'logic of layers' available to reason about this sort of thing. (During that time, I was working to understand the geometric cosmology of the Tree of Life and incidentally how it embossed on the Jamestown story. I do not suppose a direct connection.)Now we have this marvelous poem. I see the entertainment critics are puzzled. Story-listeners wonder where the story went. Public observers cuckkle over what went wrong while forcing themselves to celebrate it because it is obviously precious. I suppose that 1300 years from now, this will be studied for the ways it interlocks the layers of experience, passion and expression, each layer with its own kinematics that touch at odd points. My grandchildrens' grandchildrens' grandchildren will remark in wonder on how much can be communicated by what is omitted. And though the technology will have changed, this will be seen to be as basic to the human expression as ink applied with a brush from the hair of your infant.You will likely know the Kabbalistic controversy, presented here as 'nature' and 'grace,' but of course that is a perspective from grace. Usually it is described as grace and knowledge-by-effort (aka 'magic') with different paths up a geometric diagram representing a tree. (Insert here the argument between Paul and George.) I wouldn't parse too much of this film using the tree of life tradition: the point is it is superlogical, but you sure can see what he is working from.One of Malick's layers is the abstract but ordered ethereal dynamics of the universe, which he conflates with the gauzy unknowns of precreation.Another is the creation of life and its dynamics; birth, sight, discovery, dominance.Yet another is the artist's personal history as a child in Waco. He presents this quite literally; though the urge of the viewer is to attach narrative to what is shown, privileging this layer over the others. Malick slips off this layer via hidden doorways, but it has resonance for me because I grew up in that era, mostly in the Jim Crow south and did many of the things shown. It was shocking how many.And another is Sean Penn recalling, creating, weaving it all together so that each layer is the origin of the others. (Our redheaded, angelic mother becomes a spiritual presence in all the layers. The most impressive is her barely recognizable figure as an aurora borealis.) Only Penn among living actors is experienced enough with narrative folds to pull off this calligraphy. (The other actor with similar vision, Heath Ledger, was to have played the opposing soul.)A key 'tree' image is that of the redheaded mother levitated in front of (in traditional terms: 'on') the tree. Another is of ghostly, purloined lingerie zigzagging through a stream.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tree of Life is absolutely a true film experience, literally ? you have to feel the film from within rather than watch it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been sitting in front of my computer for almost an hour, and I still haven't decided on how I should start with the review. My mind is racing with conflicting view on the film. The Tree of Life is absolutely a true film experience, literally ? you have to feel the film from within rather than watch it. The colliding stars, raging volcanoes and dancing waves are backdropped by whispers, birds and seagulls in the distance, creating a dream-like context. You can feel the magnificence of the universe, its grace as well as erratic nature. Under the microscope, your will witness the birth, growing-up, loss of innocence and grieving through the perspective of a boy named Jack (Hunter McCracken and Sean Penn), who is raised in a typical family in the south of America. The young Jack is heavily influenced by his father's (Brad Pitt) egocentricity and fierceness - a manifestation of nature, and his mother's (Jessica Chastain) lovingly kindness and beatificity ? a manifestation of grace. This results in desperate frustration and confusion in Jack, even in his adulthood, which is exhibited through the Jack's grief for the loss of one of his younger brothers. What is the meaning of life and how to live it? Jack finally realises, after intense contemplation of his mother's words, that life is full of flaws and regarding everyone with love and kindness is the only way to make the best of it. Everything about this film is unconventional. The imagery created by Emmanuel Lubezki's (Children of Men) is so fluid and ghostly that I felt as though I was floating through space like a feather. The score composed by Alexandre Desplat's (The King's Speech) uses strings and piano intertwined with female opera, which complements the magnificence of the cinematography effortlessly. In terms of acting, I have to say that Mr. O'Brien is the most memorable role played by Brad Pitt. I'm not a big fan of Brad Pitt's acting because it always seems to me that he is detached from the roles that he plays. Ironically, it's however the sense of detachment that has helped him to immaculately portrayed this overpowering, self- centered father. My only critique for The Tree of Life is that Malick's attempt to compare the struggle of the O'Brien's family to the disturbance in the universe seems a little forced and even pretentious at times. Other than that, The Tree of Life is stunning and breathtaking film that raises a lot of questions on the point of living, which gives you a not-so-new perspective on life. Mrs. O'Brien: Nature only wants to please itself. Get others to please it too. Likes to lord it over them, to have its own way. It finds reasons to be unhappy when all the world is shining around it. And love is smiling through all things.Read the full review here: http://www.parallelfragments.com/projects/the-tree-of-life/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a movie at all but art. Fails since it tries to be both.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Claude Monet is one of my all time favorite artists. And I just happen to have a wonderful book featuring many of his paintings that is one of my most treasured possessions. Yet, if someone approached me and asked me for a good book to read, I would never for a moment contemplate giving this book a high rating. Simply put, while there is text describing the paintings, there is no story, no plot, no character advancement. It is not literature.And now, in IMDb, we are asked to tell others if the film The Tree of Life by Terrence Malick is a good movie to watch. The answer is "No." One of Malick's editors was quoted as saying, ""Our focus was to make it more of an experience and not about plot." Okay. Enough said for those of you who want to watch a storyline. Skip this film and stop reading now. This had the potential to be a much better movie. The premise (and the deceiving previews) were solid and that was what pulled me in. The idea of looking at the outwardly idyllic 1950s family and childhood innocence as something of a darker influence that colors a man's viewpoint and actions throughout his life would have been interesting. At issue is that Malick divides his film into three distinct segments: Beautiful (but endless) cinematic sequences of evolution/nature, vignettes of Jack O'Brien's childhood as portrayed by Hunter McCracken, and brief snippets of Sean Penn's interpretation of Jack as a late middle aged man.But the film fails to progress anything. Even as imagery. The movie is "interrupted" for twenty-two minutes of evolution montage. While stunningly beautiful, it is still a jarring experience that does not successfully build on what preceded and followed it. It is as if you are suddenly transported into the theatre next door ? and then magically transported back to the film you started watching. Sean Penn needed not be an actor in the film. We get absolutely no insight into Jack O'Brien past pre-adolescence; Penn is more of a prop than performer. His presence on screen was merely to tell the audience, "See, this man is remembering his childhood." Malick spends most of his time in the 1950s. He does succeed in giving us nice glimpses into character interactions in the O'Brien family ? particularly around Jack and his father (Brad Pitt) and his younger brother. Here's my main complaint about these segments ? they lead nowhere. A seminal event happens about eleven years later when Jack's brother dies at the age of nineteen. Do we get to experience that? No. In fact, beyond a few gratuitous "Jack as a baby" or "Jack as a toddler" scenes, our entire window into Jack's life is within likely a single year of his life at most. This deprives the audience of seeing growth and psychological cause and effect.If you want to focus on such a narrow time period, Terrence, then please have something dramatic happen. This is a movie, after all. If you want us to experience the fullness of a life experience, Terry, then give us a view of Jack past the age of twelve. We do see young Jack get angry, get elated, get jealous, get belligerent, and so on. We do not see growth or change in Jack. The afterlife scene on the beach was so hackneyed, that even the TV show Lost managed to do it better.Without character development, I felt like I was given two telescopes. One that would pick up random family interactions in the 1950s and one anchored in the heavens watching the vibrant creation of the world, or perhaps the Discovery Channel.Bottom Line. As a movie, one star. As art? If Malick would have maintained his artistic focus, five stars. Since he did not, I will give him two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very rare kind of film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a concise summary of what to expect from this film I can't do better than direct you to Rooprect's review.When I saw Tree of Life I think I was fortunate in that I knew absolutely nothing about it beforehand. All I knew was the title, and I'd briefly seen the enigmatic poster for it. But who was in the cast or who directed it, etc, I knew not. So I went in completely open minded. I also timed the cinema visit so I missed all the ads and trailers - I'm not saying this necessarily improved the viewing, but the nature of the movie is at a polar opposite to all that commercial stuff, and it was good not to be distracted by that crap.Turned out: It really was a memorable film, and I won't forget that couple of hours in the cinema watching it, it felt like a rare treat. Very enjoyable experience, but a film completely outside the usual Hollywood fodder of an Odeon or Vue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start off, if this is not the most beautiful film ever shot, is very high on the list. Every single shot in this entire film had my eyes glued onto it and my jaw dropped a few times. The story was confusing at parts, but a lot of the people who have negative feelings toward the film came in expecting a very upfront the story. The story is extremely compelling despite the way parts are told. It's simply the story of a boy falling from his grace, and becoming more like his father, even though he doe not understand why entirely. The film does an excellent job capturing the confusion and the discomfort in growing up, for example in the scene in which they send the frog on a firework. Obviously, not everyone did this exact thing, but it shows the way that the character is trying to find his way in the world and learn who he is. Not only was the story very compelling, but the score was incredible. Between the combination of the music and the shots, this movie was extremely intriguing and fascinating to watch. I give this movie a solid 9.2 out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visual Poetry!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the people I've met, have the opinion that a book is far better than a movie. Some even claim that certain movies will be better on paper than on Screen. If anyone ever claims like that... They Should watch this movie.By far one of the best movies of 2011 and also one of the Best of director Terrence Malick, who also wrote this. The Tree of Life opens with the death of Mr. &amp; Mrs. O'Brien's second child in 1970s. The focus then shifts on to their elder son Jack in present times who starts to think about his childhood on seeing a tree in front of a Building. Thats when the real journey of the movie begins...a journey that cannot be put down in words... but has to be experienced Visually!!! The visual journey is seen through the eyes of renowned Cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, who gives one of the best cinematographic work of his career. The movie is a Visual narration with minimal dialogues, which completely rested on the shoulders of the Dirctor and the Cinematographer. Although actors had only little to do, everyone did the best the could. Brad Pitt plays the role of Mr. O'Brien very convincingly. But its Jessica Chastain (as Mrs. O'Brien) and Hunter McCracken (as Young Jack) who steals the limelight. Although Jessica did earn an Oscar nomination for her role in The Help, she truly deserved that nomination for this movie. Hunter McCracken has done an equally brilliant job which is also his debut movie!!! But the true disappointment was Sean Penn (as Older Jack). He did not have anything to do in this movie other than his presence. He was truly wasted. The other technical aspects of the move was really brilliant... Especially the Background Score Alexandre Desplat is also Amazing.In short, this movie is not meant for those who like senseless Action or Stupid Romance movies. This is one of those rare movies where the Viewer, not only has to watch the movie but also think deeper into it!!!!</fullReview>

The imagery, use of music, and spiritual message of this unique motion picture will overwhelm and stun the individual viewer willing to drop defenses and embrace the incredible experience provided by Terence Mallick. Many will be frustrated that the film is not linear and lacks the explosions and car chases that satisfy the masses every weekend. For the literate, intellectual individual it true Cinema in its purest form and brilliantly done. The Tree of Life will be embraced and cherished for all time by those who understand that film is more than eye candy escapism and can achieve artistic heights beyond the reach of the juvenile mindset of the average movie goer. It is a tragedy that films of this kind are so rare and this sort of cinema experience is denied those of us who crave it because of the taste of those who exist in a cultural wasteland of reality shows and video games. These people may bring their money to the theatre in large quantities but they leave with empty souls and review films here, expressing a dullness and witless comprehension of real cinema art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two things fill the mind with ever-increasing wonder and awe, the more often and the more intensely the mind of thought is drawn to them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me. "~ Immanuel Kant Terence Malick's last film The Tree of Life is his claim to cinematographic immortality. Has he succeeded? These who love the film are struck with its scope, boldness and beauty but these who don't, dismiss it as the example of self-indulgent ponderous pseudo-art film. Looks like we all watch a different movie even if we sit at the same theater in front of the same screen where the great artist bares his soul and takes us to the incredible journey of self-discovery, finding the place for humanity, universe, and the Supreme Being on the map of existence. What I saw was a masterpiece, equal in scope of vision to (an inevitable comparison, I know, but appropriate) Stanley Kubrick's Space Odyssey: 2001. But while Odyssey stays always remote and cosmically dark and indifferent, Malick's film is filled with humanity and is as interested in the Universe evolution as it is in the short on the global scale and ordinary lives of one ordinary family in Waco, Texas, in the 1950-60s. That makes Tree of Live reminiscent of the other great film of past, Zerkalo (The Mirror) by Russian director, Andrei Tarkovsky.The road to Tree of Life took over 30 years, and finally, the time has come for a long-awaited and very personal writer/director's creation. There are not many filmmakers who create the movies searching for answers to the eternal questions, "Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?" and perhaps just a handful of masters, who like Malick, are capable of capturing their thoughts in truly unforgettable meaningful images.I've rarely been touched so profoundly with what was happening on the screen when I not just saw but, rather, lived through new, much more ambitious and grandiose (in all senses of the word) than anything he ever attempted and achieved, Malick's creation. I understand that this film may and will leave many viewers perplexed, frustrated, with desire to dismiss or to mock it. These voices addressing God, and God answered Job, the seemingly absent plot, action, and dialog - all of these may cause a negative perception as well as film's constant moving to and from different times and dimensions. And yes, there is a scene with the dinosaurs, whose appearance caused some shock on the part of viewers. I think that in the scheme of the universe, created by Malik, dinosaurs are just as important as all the other components, including us, the living. Malick, known introvert and recluse, is remarkably candid and open in the Tree of Life, his most personal film. He reflects on the eternal and ancient as the universe itself matters and does not know the answers to them, but he has the talent to embody the thoughts and reflections in the visions of superhuman beauty and deep love. He peers into the life of just one family whom he settled in the provincial town of his own childhood in Texas circa 1950s. But the story of this family in which the joy of innocence and discovery of the world, dark whirlpools of growing up, never-ending struggle of maternal and paternal origin in a child's soul, conflicts, losses, regrets, finding one's way and awareness of the place in the world, and, finally, an understanding f and forgiveness, repeat closely the stories of millions families at any place on earth. Maybe that's why the story in the film became so personal to me. The beauty of the film is pure and sad. I think the viewers should immerse themselves in it, as in ocean water and allow it to wash over them. Do not think, do not analyze, do not look for meaning in striking scenes of Cosmogony, but let them go through your soul. I had to stop the movie several times, because watching The Tree of Life is an overwhelming breathtaking sensual experience . It is filled with light, air, and open to all winds (notice the white light rippling curtain on the window in the O'Brien house, to which again and again returns Emanuel Lubezki 's camera). It is washed by with water - the source of life, a symbol of purification and dangerous, deceptive element . This film, like the titular tree, is firmly rooted in Earth, but directs the branches and foliage to the sky, as if floating in the air. Maybe that's why the levitation of redheaded Botticelli's Grace, re- incarnated in the beautiful Jessica Chastain feels so natural. Why did Lachrymose by Zbigniew Preisner accompany the birth of universe scenes? Why mourn, not Ode to Joy? Does this mean that the death is already included in birth, and everything will come to an inevitable end - all living things and Time and Space? Creating by the power of his talent, strikingly beautiful birth of the World scenes, finding for them the shades and nuances of colors that I have met only in one place on Earth - in Death Valley, Malick sees them as scenes of grief but expresses sorrow and wisdom in such perfect confluence of cinematic images and sounds that once entered into your soul, they will remain forever. I am sure that The Tree of Life is a film for multiple re-watches. At different stages of a viewer's life, it might reveal parts of its mystery but never to l the end. It is hard to recommend, but not to recommend it - simply impossible. Is it perfect? I do not know. But it takes my breath away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot? What plot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always believed the conventional wisdom that "Plan 9 From Outer Space" was the worst movie ever made -- until I saw "Tree of Life." "Plan 9" was ridiculous, but at least it had a (silly) plot and was laughable. "Tree of Life," on the other hand, is ostentatious, pretentious and incredibly dull. It consists of short scenes -- one after another -- which don't seem to have anything to do with each other. Also, practically no dialogue in the film. In other words, as I said, incredibly dull. Near the end of the movie there was a scene of a horde of people walking -- for no apparent reason -- slowly into the ocean. They should have kept on going...By the way, I just noticed that most of the reviews of this film are either "Oh my God, how wonderful!" or "Oh my God, what garbage!" Personally, I found the reviews much more interesting than the movie.Many years ago I went to an art show, and stood in front of a large canvas that had been awarded a blue ribbon. It was painted completely black, from edge to edge. I suspect the judges thought it was a deep expression of (what?), but I've always thought that art should be a picture of something. Same thing with a movie. I think it should tell a story. I know there are some film makers who want to express their "artistic abilities," without resorting to crass story telling, but when I have to pay to see a film I expect it to tell a story. I would like it to evoke an emotion in me -- besides boredom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst "movie" I've ever seen in my life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tree of Life" was a very depressing experience for me. I'm a passionate movie geek, always looking for a film to move and inspire me. After sitting through 50 minutes of "Tree of Life" I couldn't help but feel that the fast food nation I live in will never be as artistically relevant as the rest of the world. Where Russian and German directors can put together profound film experiences for the viewer, this was just an embarrassing, failed experiment.The one thing I've had to wonder after watching some of "Tree of Life" was; would a bunch of monkeys armed with cameras capture less compelling material? The heavy handed "artyness" of the camera movement was anything but fluid or effective. It actually made the presence of the cameraman felt, completely taking me out of the film. The fact the actors were playing archetypes instead of actual people didn't help much. Lack of narrative completely killed any potential for the film. The interspersed Natural Geographic shots bordered on comical. Would be kind of funny to think if every director of family dramas tried so hard to be profound.I couldn't help but feel bad for Sean Penn, especially reading his comments after he saw the final product. What a waste of his time and talent. He's always created an actual character with human traits, in "Tree" he's a prop in a music video. Nothing more. Though, the same can pretty much be said for all of the human props in the film.I do think there's a sad, ironic justice in "Tree of Life". Everywhere across the continent there are filmmakers experimenting in different ways to affect the viewer. Here in Michael Bay's McAmerica we get a bloated, two hour music video directed by Hallmark and try to label it as "art".Makes me realize how small and irrelevant we are in the big picture, as an American... As a Stanley Kubrick fan, I can't help but feel a bit sad and sick to think of how far the art of film has fallen. I'll never give Malick another second of my time.Oh man, I didn't even mention the whispering or the random, arbitrary shots of nature. Why bother, watch the trailer. It's more effective than the actual film and tells the exact same "story"...</fullReview>

The best things to compare this movies with are "The Fountain (2006)" and any poor 60's flick with random screen images or the light show from a bad Pink Floyd tribute act. I get that it tries to be pretentiously high-brow, I understand that it wants to be different. I value that it was not directed towards Joe Sixpack.

		<shortDescription>Amazingly Boring Artistic "Disaster-Piece"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amazing thing about this film was that none of the movie goers in the relatively crowded theater in Tokyo where I saw it didn't leave before the film was over. I was even more amazed that I didn't leave before it ended. But most amazing of all was that the film didn't implode on itself into a black hole of ravenous boredom. I don't mean to be a git or a crank, and I have seen many great films in my life. And I've seen over 50 films this year in total, but this film amazed me over and over again at how terribly boring it was. It was like I waited for it to start, waited all the way up to the very end. Obviously, people are liking this flick. I asked my brother about it who is a high brow filmmaker dude, and if I want to get this review published here, I cannot repeat in a decent online forum what he said about it. Translation: he said it was bad, very bad. But it does have redeeming qualities. There is plenty of emotion in it and empathy. I could empathize with the kids and the parents. I could feel the pathos. But I didn't need to sit through 2 hours of rambling disconnections to get a dose of empathy. I could have seen a few photos of people in trouble, dealing with death, and I would have come a way with a feeling of empathy, and not have wasted 2 hours enduring an artistic "disaster piece."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of Tree of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was trying very hard to watch Terrence Malick's "The Tree of Life." After seeing two hours of completely non-intersecting footage, such as unexplained looks of 1. anguish, 2. fear, 3. depression, and 4. wonderment, with none of these being connected in any sort of palpable manner, I started to feel faint/distraught myself. There were mundane scenes of a tyrannical father at dinner with his family, then a shot of a family of hammerhead sharks, then a volcano, then sunspots. This is not art. This is a man confused about his cinematic intention. Is this a National Geographic video, a ripoff of 2001 ? A Space Odyssey, or a takeoff on Archie Bunker? This is not cinematic genius. This is either an example of unbelievable self-indulgence, or psychosis. It's a lot harder to make a movie that has a plausible storyline than it is to merely make a two-hour series of free-associations. The latter requires no intellectual rigor, vision, or discipline. The mystery to me is how Malick is able to get backers to indulge him and finance such unwatchable, narcissistic claptrap.</fullReview>

This movie starts by putting us to sleep with a half hour of nature/trippy/music montages that could've been cut down to about 5 minutes. Things slowly (slowly) pick up as we learn more about this boy and his family, by the end we have gotten the concept of loss of innocence and all that, but at what cost? This movie should not have exceeded 60 minutes. By the end you are left wondering why you spent so much time on such an undeveloped story. So if the first hour doesn't bore you then by all means watch the movie, otherwise just leave because it really doesn't get better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a promising plot and such a disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tree of Life is an interesting experiment, some kind of a visual blend. It is a period film centered around a Family in the 1950s. The film depict a crucial time in Life of a boy (the eldest son), who witnesses the loss of innocence and the lack of control over his deepest feelings triggered it seems by the arrival of his new born brother.But Tree of Life is also a variation over the meaning of Life and Death alternating between a cosmic vision of Life and a subjective and often poetic vision of childhood as an aphorism for Grace, Nature and Love.The films then introduces the unbearable Death, the one that can't be explain the one that shakes the very balance of a Family, the Death of a son of a brother as we learn that the second born died suddenly at the age of 19 (probably at War).However the genuine narration and enigmatic if not poetic vision of the cosmos mixed with state of the heart but virtual shots depicting how Life started (the way of Nature) makes for a slide-show of boredom. And as we move along the story of this family seems more and more like a "collage" exercise, some kind of a pretext to voice over cosmic images philosophical questions from our main tree protagonists (The Mother, the elder son and the Father). The result is messy and at times superficial.In this blend of images and emotions actors aren't use to deliver an acting performance but more so to make the philosophical questioning move along. The problem is the questioning stagnates and closure never really gets through. Even if we understand that the border between Life and Death is as thin as a bank of sand between two seas on which we may meet sometimes, the audience is left with the same Belief before entering the Theater. Eventually you remain the same before and after the movie. You don't feel any more comfort, tranquility, clarity or even sadness. You've just seen beautiful shots.Soaked with Christian Philosophy Tree of Life delivers as a very well shot film but never provides the audience with a sense of progression and closure. The story of this Family never really takes off nor does the Philosophic Questioning gets to an end.At posteriori Tree of Life seems like an audacious idea on paper and lays out good material to explore. However the film ends up resembling a nice slide-show with little to no story, which makes me wander if cinema was the best medium for this cosmic Tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A peculiar slice of life film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to preface this by saying that I am not a fan of Terrence Malick's work. I hated the Thin Red Line. The film seemed like it was all over the place and I just could not get into it. The New World is an exercise in patience. The film is so slow and plodding that I questioned my love for cinema after the credits were rolling. So as you can see, I was a little hesitant about watching The Tree of Life. Mix in the reports of dinosaurs and the creation of the universe and I was really on the fence about seeing it. Then the movie got good reviews and started popping up on a bunch of "best of 2010 lists." Needless to say, I now had to see the movie and I'm glad I did because The Tree of Life is a unique film experience that cannot be duplicated. The Tree of Life is not so much a movie as it is a series of images and ideas. The plot is thin, especially in the beginning of the film. We don't really start to get to know the characters until about half way through the movie. There are really only three characters that the film follows. The father, played by Brad Pitt, who can be extremely strict (especially with his oldest son) but also very loving at times. The oldest son Jack, played by Sean Penn when he is older. Jack is just coming of age and struggling with numerous emotional feelings. He's constantly being verbally abused by his father and lashing out at the rest of his family because of it. Then there is the mother, played by Jessica Chastain, who is a free spirited, fun loving woman who is often seen showing her children affection. She is the polar opposite of her husband. She also seems to be very close to the Earth and all of the living things that inhabit it, which is a common theme throughout the film. Jessica Chastain's character is the one I identified with the most. I found her story to be the most inspiring and interesting part of the film. Jessica Chastain also happens to be my summer celebrity crush. After seeing her in The Help, I was instantly drawn to her. She's even more magnetic in the Tree of Life. She's an extremely beautiful woman and some of the photography in the film literally makes it impossible for the viewer to take their eyes off of her. Her face is so expressive that you can really feel what she's going through in every scene. Chastain is a true star and I can't wait to see where her career goes from here. Perhaps the most talked about part of the film is the creation sequence. It's a little drawn out and, I admit it, more than a little odd, but it worked for me. I'm the kind of person that often reflects on the creation of the Earth and how everything came to be. I think Malick is trying to show us that our lives on Earth is so fleeting. In the grand scheme of things, we are really only here for a small fragment in time. This is something else that I think about a lot. How we have to make the best of life and enjoy it as much as possible because we really aren't here for very long. What impressed me most about The Tree of Life is the cinematography. It's some of the best work I've seen in years. With all that being said, The Tree of Life is not for everybody. I couldn't recommend this movie to most people and, to be honest, I don't know if I would ever feel compelled to watch it again. I think my main problem with it, and it's one of the problems I have with a lot of Malick's films, is that there are many scenes that just come off as entirely pretentious. I could understand if some people wrote the whole movie off as that, but there are a lot of important themes going on here. Different viewers will find different themes that impact them more. It truly is a subjective film. The Tree of Life is unlike any film I've ever seen. That doesn't make it great, but it also doesn't make it bad. It's not the cinematic masterpiece some would make it out to be, but it also shouldn't be dismissed as artsy trash. I think the best thing I can say about The Tree of Life is that hours after the film finished, I was still thinking about it. Even when I woke up this morning, some of the images and themes were still running through my head. For me, that's enough to make it a film that was worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guided Dreaming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the words of Jorge Luis Borges, "literature is naught but guided dreaming". I like to think similarly of cinema: a stream of images and sounds delving deep into our dreams. Films become most personal when their images become ours. They speak to us in ways that are beyond words, that somehow feel familiar and still penetrating deeper into ourselves, perhaps revealing things of ourselves. These films allow reflection, and indeed they seem to be completely taking place in the viewer's mind, the images a kind of catalyst for solitary meditation.Malick has always made these kinds of films, and this is a marvellous dream indeed. Its depiction of childhood, with all its clarity, opaqueness, distance and inexplicably environing sense of intimacy were a revelation, and still continue to be. I have seen this about six times since then, and it won't leave me be, instead constantly pulling me towards it.There's added significance in that I too have seen death in my youth; and I am a father of three, and in fact a teacher by occupation, so I'm constantly working with children (by which I'm not directly referring to my colleagues). There's something very acutely spot-on in the description of the chasm between the two proposed world-views of the film, and how they steer our way in the river of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to even begin with The Tree of Life? Any release from Terence Malick is highly anticipated because, let's face it, "prolific" is not exactly his middle-name. Malick's output of 5 Films in the best part of thirty years makes Stanley Kubrick look like a Roger Corman protégé. Ostensibly, The Tree of Life is the story of a young family growing up in 1950&#x2032;s Texas. Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain are the parents of three boys living the suburban life. Whilst, Sean Penn plays the grown up older son reminiscing over these times. Here is where any attempt to continue with a plot synopsis collapses under the weight of the films impressionistic non-linear structure.The Tree of life is a fundamentally polarising experience of the highest order. There will be those who view it as a mess. A sentimental, art-farty shambles. A two hour long perfume commercial stuffed with "meaningful" abstract shots and scenes. A melange of whispered preposterous platitudes and pretentious, "meaning of life" and infuriatingly glib sentimentality. They'll think it's rambling, mawkish, misjudged, ill-disciplined, lacking any narrative cohesion and packed with the kind of heavy handed-symbolism best left to a 6th form Emo's poetry. They'll think it's the work of a director who's lost the plot up his own arse and submitted a self-indulgent soufflé of a film that'll stretch their patience to breaking point. They will hate it. And, they'll have a point.There will be others though who view The Tree of Life as an elegiac meditation on memory and grief. They'll think it's a lyrical and visual poem. They'll see discussions of familial remembrance, the friction between father and son, the birth of morality, the Universe and universal truths. They'll see a beautifully meandering and melancholic ode that eschews traditional narrative for a sumptuous visual lyricism that washes over them. They'll be prepared to lie-back and let it take them to more melancholic and meditative shores. They will love it. And, they'll have a point.Guess, which side I fell on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been sitting on this film for 2 and ? weeks and still cannot figure out how I want to go about my review, so instead of letting a difficult task waste away I am going to forge forward. In the 17 days that I have been thinking about this film I have had several contrasting thoughts but what it comes down to truly is, did I like this film? My answer to that is I still do not know how I feel about the film but I will try to express my thoughts as clear as I can.The Tree of Life follows a family from the beginning to the end. By beginning I do not mean from start of their union as a family, I mean from the Earths creation. Big bang, cell division, dinosaurs, evolution, you catch my drift? So imagine you are sitting there watching a movie about a family and all of a sudden the television turns you to a channel airing Walking With Dinosaurs, Carl Sagan's Cosmos and Through the Wormhole but you have an inability to change the channel. Then after about 40 minutes of that you beam back to the movie you were watching about a family and you say to yourself, "wow, it almost seems like they were connected." Welcome to the world of Malick and his film The Tree of Life.As a movie it lacked dialogue, direction, and continuity so if you wanted to see something engaging on tangible level this film will anger you, but you should have known that going in, Malick does not care what you think, nor should he. His movies are never to please an audience but to try to stop himself from cutting his own ear off, it is a release for him, not for you or me.As a work of art it was beautifully shot, thought-provoking and spiritual, so if you wanted to be engaged in an intangible tour of a man's psyche with picturesque visions and dreamlike shots of life that kind of go together but often veer off like the mind of a toddler then this film will blow you away.I am no Malick aficionado; I have seen Badlands which I loved and A Thin Red Line which I also loved but have yet to see Days of Heaven, his most critically acclaimed film, and his 2005 film The New World. What I do know or think is that Malick's films are often more about the art than the content, more about a vision than a message, and more about himself than the audience.The Tree of Life is a film that asks the questions but does not have the answers; there are no real beginnings or ends, just a myriad of themes beautifully shot within the journey of a family, from creation to death. It is not going to be for everyone but then again it was not meant for everyone.check out our site at 3guys1movie.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tree of Grace. The Tree of Nature. The Tree of Life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ambitious in scope, sublime in artistry, unprecedented in imagery, meditative in content &amp; audacious in execution, The Tree of Life is an incredibly complex, provocative, symbolic, philosophical &amp; visually arresting art-house feature that's destined to polarise its audience but for those who can patiently connect with it, it's gonna be an intimately personal &amp; emotionally rewarding experience.A radical examination of both the origin &amp; meaning of life, The Tree of Life chronicles the life of O'Brien family's eldest son from his birth to adult years where he is still seeking answers to the purpose of his life &amp; after a tragic incident, also begins to question the existence of faith. Interspersed within this narrative are images depicting the birth of the Universe &amp; dawn of life on our planet.Written &amp; directed by Terrence Malick (Badlands, Days of Heaven &amp; The Thin Red Line), The Tree of Life is without a doubt his most ambitious, thought-provoking &amp; divisive film to date. Brimming with Malick's sweeping cinematic vision &amp; making effective use of his trademarks, it is also the most gorgeous looking film he or anyone has ever made for every frame of it is a masterwork of spellbinding art.The screenplay deals with existential, religious &amp; metaphysical themes but the whole story is simply a conflict between the two choices that life offers: the path of grace &amp; the path of nature. Although the film is thoroughly refined in all technical aspects, where it sets an entirely new benchmark is in its breathtaking camera-work as its smartly chosen angles, expert use of natural light &amp; ideal framing of shots are the very definition of perfection.Editing is equally impressive as far as stitching those distinct images into one harmoniously unfolding sequence is concerned but when it comes to pacing, the film is all over the place. There are times when it gets repetitive, few moments despite the splendid imagery are too frustrating to sit through plus a slightly conventional &amp; accessible narrative approach would have definitely benefited the film without lessening its desired impact.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Sean Penn &amp; Hunter McCracken with Pitt &amp; Chastain playing Mr. &amp; Mrs. O'Brien respectively, with the father presenting the nature side of life while the mother is the epitome of grace. McCracken is excellent as O'Brien's eldest son &amp; his struggle with his parents' conflicting teachings is utterly convincing while Sean Penn just wanders around like he has no idea of what's going on, a feeling I'm sure many of its detractors share.As for me, I'm equally conflicted with this film. It deserves a full score for its jaw-dropping photography alone, is filled with moments that are snippets of my own childhood, &amp; those segments dealing with the birth of universe n inception of life on Earth are undeniably my favourite segments. But then there's that philosophical rambling I simply didn't care about as well as those baffling final 15 minutes during which the film jumps into a full pretentious mode &amp; I could finally see why many despise it. I don't blame them either.On an overall scale, The Tree of Life is an aesthetic, artistic &amp; extraordinary work of dazzling beauty that arguably has no comparisons. There are moments in it which make you go like it's the greatest achievement in cinema history but then there are also times when it evokes an entirely opposite response. An ode to life, a reflection on love &amp; loss, and a strong reminder of the infinite smallness of mankind against the grand schemes of the Universe, Terrence Malick's magnum opus is cinema at its most spiritual that comes recommended with multiple viewings advised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a movie: so WHAT is it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS is a guided search through the experiences of life toward a restoration of faith, forgiveness, and perhaps, self-acceptance. But it is NOT pedantic. Malick seems to specialize in recreating the experiences in the viewer through the combination of image, sound, and story. I wonder if he would mind if I said that he is our "Hemingway" of film. He doesn't really waste a lot of time preaching at us, but rather letting us "feel" the story at core through the direct access he gives us to the characters through their actions and their literal perspective of the world. If you need to give a good book 50 pages to sink into you: you also must practice patience with this film during some of the more "abstract" scenes. This is not a "fast-food" film: this is a FEAST.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's get the Kubrick comparison out of the way first. Many people admire Kubrick as a director but I'm not one of them. I think he has brilliant passages in some of his movies but he seldom sustains the quality over a full film. As I young man I admired 2001 because I was into the space race and because it had trippy visuals; today I find it virtually unwatchable. In fact my reaction to 2001 is rather like many people's reaction to The Tree of Life ? despite some arresting visuals it's boring and has nothing to say.To those who have found it necessary to tell us at length what a boring and tedious waste of time The Tree of Life is and that they found it personally offensive I have a simple question - Why did you watch it to the end? You could have left the cinema or turned off the TV anytime you liked. I know I do. It saves wasting brain space and is a more rational response to not liking something than persevering with it. I think Dogville was probably an awful film, even though I've liked other Von Trier films, but I'm not certain because I bailed out early on. It wasn't for me.The Tree of Life is an interesting film on several levels. Firstly it's what I would call "pure film" in that the visuals and the flow are more about using the medium to create an effect rather than to drive a narrative forward. The visuals and the sound design are beautiful. I was going to say the pace of the film was difficult to get into but on reflection I realised my attention was held throughout, with one exception I discuss below, and I had a smile on my face from beginning to end. Interpretation is always tricky given that it's up to the viewer to interpret once a work has been created, but I took it to be about the contrast between Grace and Nature. I'm not a Christian so the biblical aspects didn't wholly interest me although you can see the parallels with any religious or spiritual perspective. I don't think I'd completely agree with Malick's intended meaning either but that doesn't matter to me. His views, as far as I understand them, are interesting and the fact that they lead into a debate makes them even more so.My one reservation is the length of the main section (after Life, the Universe and Everything) following the lives of the family and effect of the parents on the boys. It was, for me, too long and I would have liked to have seen perhaps twenty minutes taken out of this sequence. I'd got the point, accessed the emotions and understood the purpose well enough without being beaten over the head with it well before we got to the last act.So not a perfect film in my mind but a great one certainly. I rate The New World as Malick's true masterpiece but The Tree of Life as a great film but with some flaws. It isn't Kubrick who I am reminded of when I watch a Malick film but David Lynch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unless you love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing that film for the very first time. I confirmed myself in the belief that it's love-it-or-fall-asleep film, just like Tarkovsky's "Stalker" or pretty much anything by Bergman. The film seemed like a never-ending bore and clearly something was missing. Or rather, I have missed something. I've watched with great appreciation dozens of "artistic-deep-never-ending" films, and I felt cheated, since this one had promised so much.That was before. Then I lost someone I loved, someone my life depended on. For the first two months or so I wasn't ready to watch any film. Yet, this one was the first I watched. Then I knew that one needs certain experience to comprehend it's two-hour long beauty. Suddenly nearly every moment of this previously unattractive film became important. Every whisper, every sound and every scene meaningful. It's pure beauty: the birds flocking and dispersing on a dead silent sky, galactic imaginary, creation of the world accompanied by Mozart's Lacrimosa (by maestro Preisner)...and a multitude of previously unnoticed details. And the main theme is just like T.S.Eliot wrote: "We die with the dying: See, they depart, and we go with them.". The characters - father, mother, son - all are departed. Staring into emptiness, stunned, for they can't deal with the loss, for they have also lost part of themselves. For me "The Tree of Life" is a picture of spiritual desolation, of our fall, of our doubt, ultimate loneliness in our existential condition, and of our struggle. "World has gone to the dogs" and buzzing silence - that's how one feels dealing with a dead-blow loss - resignated and stunned. Later comes the great search for meaning, just like in Frankl's book about Auschwitz survivors, one has to build, fill the gap somehow. Malick chose God.Malick's "The Tree of Life" is a difficult picture and not readily available for everyone (bless you the fortunate ones). It's also beautiful and deep, especially for those who experienced the bitter taste of life, or rather ? of death. And there is one more human theme - love. Love and death always march together. That's our greatest tragedy - we have to love what is mortal, depend on it, and one day let it depart (just like Mary Oliver wrote). That's the price to pay for meaning and happiness on this planet, it's a pact with the devil - unfair and inhuman, yet seems to be our only choice. Otherwise, it's a life-time of doubt and emptiness..."unless you love".</fullReview>

For those of you who gave this movie a positive rating, thanks for ruining my night; I trusted you. For those of you that say this movie is deep, please watch any other film ever produced and you will be blown away with its depth (maybe start with Shrek 3, don't want to blow your mind too much...). Deep requires *some* form of message, content, theme, or anything... Just because nobody understands it, that doesn't mean it is deep!Ughh... so annoyed with my wasted night. The only redeeming thing about this movie is the comical fact that I hung on 'til the end. I thought I might get a surprise ending that would tie all of the nonsense together. Surprise!!! Still just a bunch of random nonsense!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Tree of Life: Lots of promise. Big named actors. Great cinematography. Failed execution. In reaching to be art it failed at it's core need; capturing emotion. Actually it failed with a dearth of acting; filling the hour and a half with Discovery Channel HD footage, some voice overs, a canonical sound track, and 15 minutes with those previously-mentioned big names actors. It's meant to be about a family that lost a son and how they deal with it over the years. You get that from the 5 to 10 minutes of acting in the first 30. From there the screen writer loses his way and flails around, unsuccessfully grasping for it the rest of the time. I'm reminded of how Ed Wood shot random footage of Bela Lugosi and cut it into Plan 9 From Outer Space. Both directors must have done similar things with their lead actors. "Now give me anguish". Only later editing in the 15 to 30 minutes of script with an hour of filler stock footage from the Hubble Telescope, Hawaii's volcanoes, some CGI dinosaurs left over from a SyFy Channel movie, and various travelogues.If you're in the mood for drama and loss, then put your time to better use by watching Beautiful Boy instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A leafless tree ... for a lifeless film ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't believe this would happen, I'm generally respectful toward a film and try to watch till the last second to make my opinion, but this one was too much for me ... I left after 67 minutes. If a movie demands respect, it should at least respect the viewer. Basically, the first half of the movie simply didn't convince me to watch the other half.I was ready to love it, to get myself transported in a cinematic dimension that would make me discover the innate beauty or the futility, the magnificence or the pointlessness of life, but after 15 minutes, I thought the movie lasted one hour and was waiting for the end ... it was 10 minutes of a long 'creation' sequence that made "2001: A Space Odyssey" look like "Speed"...Does a movie need to feature a succession of stunningly visual shots totally disjointed with some mystical words whispered in voice-over, to be considered a masterpiece, that's it? and the name of a director who only made five films? I don't mean that in a derogatory way, but sometimes, I had the feeling that just because Terence Malick made a few films, they were all good, you know the whole 'quantity doesn't match quality' equation ... well, I hated every single leaf of this "Tree of Life" as much as I loved every second of "Badlands", and don't count me among the followers of this current Terrence Malick's cult as if he was the Revelation, the New Kubrick! Or am I supposed to be ecstatic and condition my brain to enjoy this; because this is so unusual it must have an incredible meaning I shouldn't miss ... what's that? is that what 'art' movies are coming to, so weird it's good, so you can pretentiously declare that the movie touched a special nerve, reminded you of something personal ... and use such big words as "haunting", "transcending" as if we were watching 'philosophy in motion'? I'm sorry but whatever point it was trying to make, and I'm sure the director had good intentions , we didn't need that whole creation sequence ... I don't think life is such a 'big' subject you must prevent average movie goers from enjoying a film dedicated to it. I concede the part with the boys was interesting, and that the whole film could have begun like that, but no, it had to provide an endless 'origin of the world' sequence in a Kubrickian emulation ... well, I was upset, the dinosaur parts set me off psychologically and the whole dizziness of the direction, especially during the 'Sean Penn' part made me seasick ... well, I stop here ...I needed an aspirin after the film, I had one, I felt better ... but I just don't get how Malick could have gone from "Badlands" to 'this', and how 'this' could have won the Golden Palm. I saw "Badlands" and I was mesmerized, I don't necessarily consider myself as an old-school movie fan, I love to be left shocked, stunned or hypnotized by a film, and I expected this one to be a quite unique experience. But as I said, after 15 minutes, the direction gave me a headache (literally) and I was upset and seasick (physically) ... people were already walking out of the theater but I was telling myself to "stay calm", to "be patient" and I thought my patience was rewarded when started the part with the family ...... but after one hour, and a few minutes that seemed like a painful eternity, I felt the need to go outside, I couldn't wait one more hour ... it was just a succession of good scenes on their own, but the assemblage was chaotic, self-indulgent and I don't even want to use the word 'pretentious'. I know, one can say the same about abstract painting, but in my opinion, cinema is a very particular art that shouldn't overestimate our abilities to get many messages at the same time, complex doesn't mean complicated, and I may be wrong but I think a movie should be accessible on the surface to hide many meanings and symbols when you go deeper in its analysis.All the great movies are about something simple, entertaining or captivating and that you can summarize very easily, "Casablanca" is a love triangle providing a hard choice to make between duty and love, "Godfather" is about succession, "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is a quest for gold leading to paranoia etc. etc. A movie must work on 2 levels and whatever you put on the first, the second should be entertainment.To conclude, despite all the efforts, I couldn't love it, even if I wanted to fake my sentiment, I couldn't ... I couldn't forgive this soulless non-sense ... yes, soulless, despite the intent to portray a sort of universal representation of life, I just thought it was the kind of film (especially the first sequence) that you would either screen in a sect's showroom, either watch after having consumed some illicit substances. Or I wasn't in the right mood ... but I really wanted to like and failed to appreciate its beauty, my mistake but I don't think you can make a masterpiece out of artistically good intentions ...Or I can also take a camera and zoom on a candle while its flame is fading, and put Tchaikovski's music in the background, and a woman in voice-over whispering : "help ... help .... help ..." and I would title this : "Amnesic Plenitude", and if you don't like it, well, you just don't get the symbolism ...Cinema is an art whose nobility rhymes with its ability to entertain you. Cinema is a serious Art that shouldn't take itself too seriously. This movie takes itself far too seriously and seriousness is not an excuse for boredom and lack of enjoyment ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most boring, absurd movies I have ever seen. I usually seek out good movies to watch rather than watch trash put out by Hollywood. I assumed that this was a great movie since it had won at Cannes and had a 8.0 at IMDb.The only uplifting moment in the movie for me came because of "Die Moldau" by Smetana. I am writing this because I feel cheated out of my time and money (I drove from College Station to Dallas to watch this) by being misled by people who praised this movie. I used to have a lot of faith in the movies that won at Cannes, but this is truly absurd.Some call it artistic and creative. I wanted to be 'moved' and transformed by a movie. This did neither. It was absolutely boring from the moment it started till it ended. My thoughts during the movie were "when is this going to make any sense?", "when is it going to become interesting", "why are there dinosaurs?" "When is Sean Penn going to speak?" Is that a clip from the 'Planet earth?' " and "is it over yet?"</fullReview>

I saw this at the press screening at Cannes (where it got some jeers amongst the claps). I will admit that the scenes with the children were beautiful and in places thought provoking but Sean Penn might as well not of have been in it and I found his scenes in the film the most "Calvin". Now don't get me wrong, I'm not averse to slow moving, "difficult" films and I admit it looks and sounds great, but for me, there just wasn't enough...

		<fullReview>Life and death are existence. Existence is a neverending cycle. To be happy you must learn to love everything.These are perhaps the biggest, most powerful concepts we as humans know. They are also the most commonly regarded ones. So, why bother making a "movie" that has no message beyond what everyone already knows? Life is beautiful (if you allow yourself to see it that way) ... and don't let all that beauty slip by you now! :: shakes pointer finger in front of your face :: Wow. How profound... I've never thought about that before... and I've DEFINITELY never seen a movie that touches base with that concept...Or wait...Normally, I am a huge fan of abstract/obscure films that most people consider "art" with atypical progressions, etc. Now a lot of people see this as a piece of art. But to me, it's tough to see it that way because I feel like it has literally no depth whatsoever. What makes "art" art to me is when someone infuses their own creative personality into their project - now, if this is Terrence Mallick's art, then I guess he must just be an incredibly boring person.Although I found the 2nd half of the film to be stronger than the first, I had an extremely difficult time staying entertained and getting through it. I began growing anxious and impatient due to the repetition and more importantly the pointlessness... now typically i'm into repetition, but only when the repetition has meaning.In this case, we are forced to watch endless scenes of a small boy playing and/or dealing with his controlling, annoying father. I get it... he's growing up. But why do we care? He's just a regular kid...Nothing interesting is happening in his life. Now I know a lot of people are going to say "that's what he was going for... so people can relate to it", sure, I understand that... but, what is supposed to make it entertaining? What are we supposed to come back to and remember these characters by? Mallick did a great job with the cast, creating characters that are incredibly realistic and believable - but again the main problem to me is that there is absolutely NOTHING INTERESTING happening in these peoples lives. Why do they even deserve to be characters in a movie? The live and die... their life was hard at times, and beautiful at others... yeah, and same with everyone else's. I don't need 2 hours full of shots of the universe being created and little boys playing catch to be reminded that life is beautiful...The concept is boring. It's been done. Overkilled.Now, of course, the absolute highlight of the film is the breathtaking cinematography, and even more specifically the stuff they captured (however they did is beyond me!) showing the creation of the universe and the development of living beings! Visually, Tree of Life is a marvelous feast but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that is just about ALL it has to offer. If I wanted to watch shots of nature and space, I would just turn on the Discovery Channel.All kinds of people are comparing this movie to 2001: A Space Odyssey. When Gaspar Noe compared his own film, Enter The Void, to 2001 - I knew I could trust him - no acclaimed director would say that about his own film without reason. Enter The Void lived up to that title - it was beyond a film - it not only had a vicious roller-coaster to ride plotwise, but it was also a psychological and visual experience unlike anything else I had ever seen. Tree of Life felt like visual poetry about life in general that was more so open for interpretation - my interpretation was that it was about nothing at all. A poem without meaning. A measly poem about trees in a gentle breeze on a summer day... an uninspired bore.The Tree of Life is MAYBE worth watching once for the visuals, but beyond that I would never recommend it to anyone. It certainly does not belong in the same category as profound artful masterpieces on a similar subject such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Enter The Void, or The Fountain. I will continue backing those as the greatest metaphysical films I have ever seen. Tree of Life - maybe you'll be worth turning on in the background at some casual party at a condominium some time...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this film, I found it difficult to rate (something I do with every film I watch). Unlike most films, I did not love it or like it or dislike it or hate it. I could not place it in any of those categories because I found myself thinking that within the film that I watched was a masterpiece, but that masterpiece wasn't the final product that was shown on the screen. The film is a grand meditation on the meaning of life and the essence of morality, framed within the existential crisis of a middle aged man remembering his childhood, but touching on the creation of the world, the start of life on our planet, and the progression of life from that point until the birth of our protagonist. The core of the story is the main character's struggles with his parents competing influences. This story, the one of the man's childhood and it's effect on the adult he grows to be, has the potential to be a masterpiece of cinema. It makes up the bulk of the film and it is absolutely great. However, I found the grander parts of the film which gave the film its epic scope detracted from the effect of this primary narrative. I found that even when I was immensely enjoying the film, I myself being bothered by the inclusion of those extraneous parts. I found myself frustrated by this, as I saw a landmark film detracted from in such a major way, and wished that the director would have gone smaller and more focused in scope, and given us the touching human story that makes up the real narrative of the film. I would recommend the viewing of this film to cinephiles, but I would caution that many may find the experience frustrating, a feeling to which I can relate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoilers)Don't let the synopsis fool you. Here the real synopsis: A journey through the various stages of lifeThis movie has been called a masterpiece by some and pointless bullshit by others. I am in the school of thought that it is almost a masterpiece. This is one of those movies that if you are told what it is about or you read a synopsis, it sounds like pretentious, surreal, and annoying. I assure it is not. This movie is not for everyones taste, but if it appeals to you, than you'll never forget it. The first hour of this movie is quite simply mesmerizing. Everything at first appears to be random but then you realize what it all means. This is the story of the various stages of life and creation. The old-fashioned visuals done by Douglas Trumbell of 2001 fame are great as is the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki. This is a very human film and it is so seemingly complex yet so simple. Although everything described makes this movie sound like it is perfect, it is not. Nothing in this movie is anything close to bad but it is a very very good movie that could have been a masterpiece. Although all of the movie serves it's purpose and is in part based on Terrence Mallick's childhood, I think this movie could have been even better if it was shorter. I found the first hour and 20 minutes of the film is so unique, powerful, and engaging enough to make you forget you are watching a film. Although there is plenty of good things left to come, it began to feel less like an experience and more like a movie. As an example, I became aware of it being redundant mainly with it's voice-over/montage scenes and it's thematically redundancies about growing up. Although still well done, I just wish that this movie had been cut down by about 25 to 30 minutes. Although I will note, it picks up again a lot in the end. If that were the case, it would have been utterly fantastic and I would have given it a 10 out of 10. As for the acting and the script, Terrence Mallick has a great script here. I didn't even think about the script until the end of the movie because it was so realistic it seemed more like real life dialogue than scripted dialogue. That is one great element throughout. As for the acting, it is subtly great. Brad Pitt. Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, and most of rest of the cast are very convincing. That is the real test of acting. Can you convince someone that you can not only play like a gangster or an alien, but a real human being? Most of the actors achieve this. I didn't care for Sean Penn in this movie mainly because he was in it for so little and he is such a big name, that I think a less recognizable actor would have made more sense for his role.I give this movie a 8 as opposed to what it sounds like it should be, a 7, because what it does it gets right, it gets really right. Great execution, great character development, great effects, great cinematography, great acting, great direction, and realistic as hell, if not a bit overlong.Definitely see this movie. Even those who hate it will admit, it is one of the most unique movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Universe brings the film down, The family brings it back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All of the beautiful images Malick has presented here, from the formation of the universe, to the bacteria that forms the human beings we start to care for, feels out of place with the rest of the film. The film is so good at making us care for these characters as actual people that when Malick shows us the bigger picture it makes us feel the time we invested in the characters story was wasted because the universe goes on with or without you and it wont help you with your problems. Moreover it just doesn't feel right to parallel a story of family problems against the trials and tribulations of the universe. It seems out of place and in the end the images that bookend the film are forgotten about, as beautiful as they may be, they don't have the same weight the middle of the film had, in the end it feels more pretentious than inspiring.The use of Adult Jack was a good idea, showing a man who is out of touch with the world, looking back at his childhood and his broken relationship with his father. The way The Tree Of Life is filmed feels like memories, memories that are painfully realistic in the worst of times and beautiful, slow, bright images in the best. Malick uses the beauty of nature to his advantage giving the film dream like qualities, the feeling that what your seeing is too graceful to be real. The way he films Jacks mother (Played by Jessica Chastain)as this mother nature character, the voice of reason, the ray of hope in a world of darkness and despair, shes almost like a ghost, you know she's there but she never gets involved enough to become real.Mr O'Brien, a man who was treated unfairly by the world he resides in, is an angry, bitter man because of it. He is strict towards his children, controlling nearly all aspects of their lives. He isn't an evil man, he wants the best for his children, he sees the world as a cruel, corrupt place and he wants to be sure that his children are ready for it. He wants to make sure that his children follow their dreams, the way he never could. He is a troubled man and we root for him to overcome the emotional wall thats separating him from his wife and children.The Tree Of Life is flawed, no doubt about that. It tries to link the trials and tribulations of the universe to the trials and tribulations of a broken family and it ends up feeling disjointed. However, in saying that, the story of the family is so real, the cinematography so gripping that it manages to overcome its faults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly not your typical movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no definitive plot and this is certainly not your typical movie...The opening I found a little difficult, the abstract scenes and whispering was perhaps a bit too subtle, just loud enough for you to grasp the general concept (grace v nature). However; great cinematography, the insight into a 1950's family life and a journey around the cosmos was, I believe, relative and stunning. I am not going to try to explain this film as I believe it is open to your interpretation and personal life experiences.The film deals life, death, loss and to a lesser extent whether God exists; being an Atheist the religious aspects didn't interest me but I can see that the family's Catholic background would be just as relevant for any denomination; although there are no (I believe) religious sermons or moral lessons to be learned. From the start the film seems to be trying to help us make sense of life and death by showing the fragility of our existence compared to the vastness of time and space.The line: "Father, mother. Always you wrestle inside me, always you will" is, for me, perfect. My father passed away a number of years ago and I still try to make sense of a difficult relationship; where regret, guilt and misunderstanding kept us emotionally distant. After watching this film I felt a little lighter, knowing that I am not alone with these thoughts.Except for the whispering, there is very little dialogue, Malick (for the most part) uses music and visuals to tell the story, with atmospheric shots of scenery and photography, to the hypnotic and haunting soundtrack; when there is dialogue, it provokes thought. However, in my view The Tree of Life gives little in the way of answers to the meaningful questions it poses and should just be enjoyed for the cinematic treat it is...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...that too many people saw who clearly weren't the target audience. Here's the conversation I bet happened to about half of the people who accidentally went to the theater to watch this movie without knowing it's one of those really artistic movies:"So, do you want to go see a movie?""Sure, what should we see?""Well, 'The Tree of Life' has Brad Pitt in it. I know who he is.""Okay, let's go see that!"...and in the middle movie they walk out! You want to know why? Because this movie isn't for them! It is for a very specific audience. The audience that Terrence Malick attracts! Fans of "The Thin Red Line" and "Days of Heaven" will probably love this movie!Malick's signature style is just flat out not for mainstream viewers. "The Tree of Life" is the opposite of mainstream! However, there is one aspect of the film that everyone can agree is a positive, the imagery. This is by far one of the most absolutely beautiful films of all time! If everybody can agree on something about director Terrence Malick, is that he knows how to create a visually breathtaking experience.The film, in my opinion, is a very great film to please the viewer's emotions. It is a movie that you shouldn't necessarily think about all that much, and just have your emotions take over. Go into this film and be ready to allow your emotional side to take complete control. However, if you dislike Terrence Malick and/or experimental cinema, you just should flat out not watch this movie unless you're forced to.It is an unconventional, avant-garde film, if you don't like films like that, avoid this film with all your strength!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick cements his place among the pantheon of great Christian artists.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It might be ridiculous to hold such a hyperbolic opinion regarding a film that's barely 4 years old, but The Tree of Life might actually be my favorite movie of all time. Being able to understand the film isn't paramount to being able to appreciate it, but it helps. What Malick is doing is retelling the Biblical story of Job through the prism of his own childhood, and detailing his eventual return to Christianity. And instead doing this with a proper narrative, he chooses to tell the story the way memory works: using snippets, feelings, images rather than plot or dialogue.The universe creation scene was likely an to allusion to God's answer to Job. If you're not familiar with the story, Job was a man who had a crisis of faith after losing everything: his wife, children, vocation. He then, understandably, starts to question God - in the famous verse: "Brace yourself like a man. I will question, and you shall answer." God then replies with the opening text of The Tree of Life: "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth? When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" In other words, "how can you possibly understand my plan? You're just a tiny infinitesimal part of my vast creation." He then goes on to take Job on a journey through the cosmos, like Malick does with this film.Other than the opening text, there are other hints to this, like the protagonist's name being Jack O'Brian - JOB, or the fact that Job is mentioned by the priest in the film. So i'm fairly confident that the Job interpretation is correct."The nuns taught us there were two ways through life: the way of nature, and the way of grace."Malick also deals with the philosophical distinction between Gnosticism (the spiritual view of life) and materialism (the scientific view of life). The mostly silent protagonist played by Sean Penn is caught between the two ways of life, and sees that distinction personified in his two parents when reminiscing on his childhood.The Tree of Life isn't just the most visually spectacular film since 2001, it's also the most daring and original. It justifies every superlative used to describe it, and is one of the very few films capable of living up to the adjective of "masterpiece."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And that's okay. Malick isn't for everyone. There is a rare dichotomous paradigm that exists wherein some things can be incredibly brilliant and yet not necessarily inspire people to experience it multiple times. Such is the case w many of Terrence Malck's films. Tree Of Life especially so. On the one hand it is an exceptional piece of filmmaking that perfectly highlights an artist at his peak. On the other hand it is a slow moving brooding and poetic work of art that simply doesn't work as well as entertainment as it does a reflection of human life. Simply put if you're looking to be entertained, don't enter here. But if you're an intellectual looking to be inspired or amazed then you will always remember this indisputable masterpiece. It really is that simple. In that this film acts as a natural dividing line between the masses and the more cerebrally focused. The former despise this film -- because they mistakenly thought they were going to see a "movie"; and the latter find it breathtakingly brilliant and beautiful. I can easily float between both worlds, simultaneously appreciating this magnificent work of art AND completely understanding how mind numbing and boring it can be if you're looking to be entertained. Therein lies the rub: it all depends on what you're in the mood for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a deep, intense movie that can make you blossom inside with joy and at the same time reopen old forgotten sores. It's been a long time since I saw such a movie and I totally enjoyed it. Hope you do too.Essentially, the movie is about:1. The personal, intimate relationship with The Creator. Sometimes we estrange ourselves from God, following an illusory personal success, other times we get back to Him, looking for an answer for the things that happen to us and help.As viewers, we have access to the main characters most intimate place, where we witness their inner talk with God.2. The creation of life. The great mystery of how life appears and the great mystery of how it ends. And about the sacred mysterious order by which everything takes place.3. Relationships, family and childhood. The wounds we suffer during childhood shape our personality and mark us for life. It is in the depth of our own being that we can find the power to forgive and love unconditionally, eternally.4. The ephemeral and superficial nature of personal feelings as opposed to the eternity and greatness of life itself.This is a review that I wrote for my blog ( www.lotuspocusfocus.com ) but I wanted people who check IMDb's ratings &amp; reviews to have access to a positive view also. Because this movie is great. I believe all negative commentaries are but poor understandings of the topic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>like others attempting to articulate a response, it's hard to say what it's about - i will just say, however, that it weaves personal and intimate in with global and eternal time scales in a very convincing way - it also could not be done in any other way except in cinema. for me, it feels like poem cinema - a new category?? we all (as human beings) share deep attachments to mother - either negative or positive; similarly to dad - and this applies to both male or female (I'd have liked more on that apart from little boy's berating her, saying that she does not stand up their father_- and, like the boys in the family, we have envies and ambivalent feelings much of the time about any sibs we have.like Job, too, 'god's' answer to what he thinks of us is in creation itself, the majestic forward drive of it - meanings we try to impose sometimes work - but not always. there is nothing we do right or wrong - event is acausal.a stunning event of a film, and you will walk away feeling just like that - stunned. would i watch it a second time? well, i guess not right away - it did dawdle ... but i would out of love for it however sometime in future, and i'd also recommend it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Work of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today I've watched Terrence Malick's the "The Tree of Life" for the second time. The first time was almost three years ago and it was on the big screen during the opening week. Never was I more excited to re-watch a film. Not only because I wanted to be transferred back in time and spend two hours being a part of small town nostalgia in the 50's rural east Texas. I wished to experience art without a need to leave the realm of my home. There are few filmmakers who can offer you this and most of them are the long gone European masters with exception of the brilliant American artists such as Ford, Scorsese, D.W. Griffith (yes), Lumet, Kubrick and of course the man himself, Terrence Malick. "The Tree of Life" is the essential art film and in that essence it is aimed for a patient niche audience and certainly not for the Hollywood blockbuster, average Joe moviegoers. And what an irony that is for Malick depicts the everyday American family in the aftermath of the WWII. I am not writing this review to defend this picture from criticism, I'm just here to show my admiration for the most quaint work of art in the world of cinema since Bergman's "Persona". And for the actors. Brad Pitt's most realistic performance since "Se7en". He is top-notch as the authoritarian (but loving) patriarch and Jessica Chastain as his wife who is just as shy as sore eyes. Beautiful and mesmerizing, like an angel from the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, she stands for the unconditional love, Grace. The opening sequences reminded me of an another masterpiece, Wender's "Wings of Desire". The story of how Jack lost his God and became more like his father is one of the strongest ever made on the subject even though it is only captured in short, poetic shots.But Terrence Malick is trying - and trying, as it says in the song - to get together everyday and eternity, heaven and earth, death and life. He hasn't done so many films in the forty year career since the accomplished debut "Badlands" from 1973. Maybe he does not think he's going to cope with another one. In "The tree of life" he has, in any case, accomplished about everything.¨On the question if Malick is trying to send us a politically incorrect massage of religion as something positive, I'll just finish this review with: "I give him to you. I give you my son."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visionary and innovative. Extraordinary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it ridiculous how many comments here decry this film for its apparent lack of narrative or conventional structure, though I guess it's not unpredictable. For some reason audiences don't seem to want to think anymore; when a film comes along that tries something that's not dedicated to formula, their minds reject it, and for some reason they criticize it before they try to understand it. Let me say this: The Tree of Life isn't the easiest film ever, and I'm sure most (all?) of it went over my head, but it's certainly nowhere near as challenging as most people have. If you want challenging, go look at a Lars Von Trier or Werner Herzog film, where the difficulty stems from the subject and themes; places where this film is easier on the audience. Let the films eccentricities wash over you and you're left with and incredible and innovative piece of filmaking, with amazing visuals and thoughtful after effect.The plot is about as simple as it gets (and not entirely absent, as some people have stated); three boys grow up with their parents in small-town Texas, focusing on their experiences, in particular those of Jack, whom we say several times as an adult too. The way I see the films is that it's merely about life, in it's broadest sense; the creation of the universe and the birth of consciousness(as seen in the prehistoric flashbacks), and as consciousness as we know it, from childhood to adult life. The film isn't perfect at portraying this, but then I don't think any filmmaker would ever get it perfect; film is in many ways too narrow a format, and yet Mallick has come as close as I think possible and that's what makes the film such a joy to watch.If you're going to see this film, think long and hard first. Think about the usual format for films and forget it. Disregard structure, existentialism (this film has a few out-there moments) and plot as you know it, as they're different here to accommodate its grand ambitions. Do these things and you should have a good time at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Spiritual Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film about everything in means to be a human being. The entire cast shine in this film but this is really a film about unanswered questions, grace, hope, love, and loss. Why is there humans suffering in the world? Director Terrence Malick's answer: a 20 minute creation sequence. God says to man, "See, look, words could never explain." Part nature, part nurture - this film also explores how children are shaped and how events can be made pure through faith and grace or ugly through primal urges and violent nature. The whispering voice-over prayers, beautiful shots of children at play, the galaxy in formation, and all the questions ask make this a essentially contemplative film My favorite film, hands down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The vague parts depicting perceived human relationships and character interiority needed a little getting used to. Especially some of the scenes with the mother in them. The subjective (I hate that word) depiction of the mother was always nebulous and spiritual, which made me yawn. The parts with the father-son relationship were interesting though, because of all the tension. Brad Pitt does a great job portraying a domineering father who is dissatisfied with his rank in life and wants his son to end up better.I was moved by the cosmological aspects. The family of the now dead young man reach out to God or the universe for answers and support. As they do, we hear their questions and pleas echoing through the vastness of time, as the forces of the universe bring everything into existence, and as life crawls out of the primordial soup. The worth of a human life may be said to be linked to all of time and space.The CGI and cinematography were GORGEOUS. I LOVED all the planetary and spacial sequences, and "The Light." All the nature sequences were marvelous. I loved the soundtracks.It reminded me of 2001: ASO many times, with the cosmos situated over a score of some classical music. But 2001 seemed to be more concerned with human advancement and evolution. The Tree of Life, I guess, tries to be relevant to the worth and character of humanity and its link to the universe. More often that not, I think, it succeeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't often encounter films that leave me genuinely baffled, but "The Tree of Life" is that rare film for which my only honest response is "huh?" I suspect that the flaw lies in my lack of cinematic sophistication. Although I consider myself a film geek and I can usually figure out the subtleties of artsy films, the film grammar and narrative style of this film elude me. I liked what I understood of the conventional portions of the film, which focus on the problematic and often discomfiting relationship between a young boy (played as an adult by Sean Penn) and his demanding, relentlessly strict 1950s-era father (played by Brad Pitt). Jessica Chastain is luminous as the wife and mother, and the film itself is a masterpiece of stunningly beautiful cinematography. But please don't ask me what the story means or how the various pieces of the film tie together, because I haven't a clue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is a prayer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a prayer. It is a heart's cry out to God. How does one film such a concept? Terrance Malik tries his darndest and comes up with something that is visually flawless, emotionally compelling, and pretty near perfect. It is very helpful to have read a synopsis review of this film before seeing it. I had, and so was expecting a non-linear (to say the least), impressionistic, film who emphasis was on images evoking emotions rather than on concrete narrative. Had I not read a review or 2 beforehand, I might have gotten lost at first. Hard to say. The film strikes a two-fold chord. On the one hand, it requires a lot of the viewer to assimilate the images and to understand what time period one is in. If you let your concentration slip, you might be asking "What's going on now?" But at the same time, the film is so soothing that you can actually relax and let the stunning imagery wash over you.Several points are made. First and foremost, it is a prayer of the three lead characters as they seek to understand God in a world that can sometimes be cruel. Second, it is an analysis of living by "grace" versus living by "nature". Grace being defined as grateful in all circumstances, other-centric, seeing the love and wonder of the created universe. Nature being defined as the polar opposite. The mother represents the former and the father the latter (although he makes a change). However, the film shows their living out of grace and nature in a perfectly normal way, so that one could actually imagine real people living as they do. And lastly, the film explores the creation of the universe and the living out of it until the end of time. This is done from a distinctly Biblical point of view. Christianity is the underlying metaphor, with a quote from the book of Job as an underlying message.What a majestic movie! It resonated very deeply with me as a Christian. It is hauntingly universal in the emotions it evokes and it captures the struggles one has while praying as well as the deliverance one receives through prayer. It shows resolutely the providence of God, the creator of all things, who orchestrates creation beautifully (the choral music during those scenes represents this excellently) even though from our limited perspective we may see only the chaotic side of nature. This movie will no doubt anger hardened "new-atheists". But then again, their opinion of a closed world view of life that excludes the unseen spiritual world is opinion. If you are such a person, I encourage you to see the film, if nothing else to understand why a person of faith can see God in the greater tapestry of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard Ways - Radiant Crown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Father, Mother. Always you wrestle inside me. Always you will" Before going into the film's review, let me outline my lack of any knowledge of the director. This film is my first encounter with Terrence Malick. Therefore, I cannot identify with certain aspects of the director's standard aspects and compare this movie with other of his productions. No right chance had come to see one of his films until recently when I saw THE TREE OF LIFE on the big screen (it's important to mention the movie theater because its grand scale images do play a decisive role in aesthetic impressions ONLY on the big screen). However, its influence does not so much correspond to impressions but feelings.I have decided to quote the words that the young protagonist Jack O'Brien (Hunter McCracken) says. Those words nicely resemble the gist of this movie and, somehow, anticipate or even prefabricate the praise and criticism that will arise. It is really strange how extreme the opinions about such movies are. They provoke viewers: people either love it or hate it. That is, in itself, stimulating enough to feel motivated for such genres. Yes, because Malick's film is not for everyone, it is not an easy film but a picture that really prompts you to think, reflect, see the characters and yourself within them. It asks difficult questions, wrestles with them, looks for answers elsewhere than in predictable contexts. Not everyone can agree with that and it is perfectly alright and natural. The film is not meant to agree with it but rather to feel stimulated, provoked, encouraged to draw some conclusions. THE TREE OF LIFE is actually a thought provoking depiction of human life, its cycles, and one important fact..."There are two ways through life: the way of nature and the way of grace. You have to choose which one you'll follow." That is what Jack's mother tells at the beginning setting the right tone for the film's content. Unbelievable! A human being is not a mere creature, sheer nature. A human being is also supplied with...grace and, most importantly, has a choice! The choice of two ways! Michael Frost accurately analyzes this aspect that retains actually throughout: the struggle of grace vs nature, struggle of giving vs taking, pleasing others vs pleasing oneself, being driven by force vs being driven by compassion; yelling vs whispering; fist vs open hand; unrestrained greed vs absolute benevolence. Michael Frost sees Malick's movie as "a staggering meditation on the meaning of life, the presence of God, the character of human nature, and the perpetual longing for grace." Following this very thought, we could ask 'where does this perpetual longing come from? Where are its roots? Malick majestically and humbly supplies us with a story of a family - the smallest unit within any society and within the universal co-existence of giving and receiving. Although the movie begins with the tragedy of their child's death and, naturally, the questions that arise within parents, the sorrows that infect their lives, our attention is directed towards a stronger brother, Jack (Sean Penn) who is a grown up man and yet is haunted by the experience of his childhood. Freud's followers would immediately attempt at psychoanalyzing this character's phobias...though Malick looks for interpretations/explanations/justifications elsewhere. In the Bible where even such brave concepts as the dawn of time and the dawn of any existence can be addressed."Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding, when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" (Job 38:4,7) However, the film is not religious. Although the director represents one particular denomination, his film is foremost spiritual and skips all shadows of dogmas for the sake of addressing any human being. He supplies us with the truly majestic sequence: the splendor of creation, the marvelous shots of nature, the breathtaking eruptions of volcanoes, the mysterious images of the earth within the universe. This sequence, as well as the dream sequence set in the afterlife, appear to be a little away from this world, an oasis for the emotions of the viewers. Most importantly, however, at first sight, this all may seem to collide with the storyline, being there for no special reason...yet, as you see the dinosaur scene, you may be misled. This scene shows the universal aspect of the aforementioned struggle and...choice being made. But, let me now address the most down-to-earth aspect of the film.Jack's story, beautifully depicted by Hunter McCracken, appears as a coming-of-age drama. Along with these uplifted images of nature, the angelic benevolence of his mother (Jessica Chastain), he is an ordinary boy living in a conflicted family. The 'wrestling' of his parents is ever present within him (Brad Pitt deserves particular attention in this role making for a sophisticated character of luxurious tastes and selfish drives). On the one hand, Jack delights in harming a weak frog, letting his puberty tensions erupt, letting his juvenile years be spent on keeping company with his pals; on the other hand, he struggles with questions that arise in himself, he cannot stand the violence he sees in his home and suffers as long as he realizes that he is a mere reflection of his dominant father (whom he seemingly detests). That character with the growing sexual drives would be a perfect 'material' for a Freudian stimulus and response and yet, THE TREE OF LIFE develops a juvenile character in a different manner. He is also a part of the universe, its grandeur, its uplifting beyond the animistic drives (the dream sequence highlights that).It all makes THE TREE OF LIFE a unique creative production filled with a very optimistic concept of human life, mankind in general that experience hard ways towards radiant crown by rising above and facing a dilemma: "Nature, Grace. Always you wrestle inside me. Always you will."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the frustrating parts of writing reviews here is that there are people who, because they didn't like a movie, give it a one so its ratings will go down. No matter how much this movie eluded you (and I have sympathy for those who don't like certain types of films), to give an ambitious film like this a one is totally beyond my comprehension. You're not reviewing, you're stacking the votes and trying to punish whoever. Just the visual essence of this film should elevate it way beyond that. There's my brief diatribe. Unlike some of the viewers, I was never bored for a second. While some of the presentation was bewildering and hit-and-miss, thank God someone is doing something besides Transformers 8. This is a splendid film, filled with unanswered questions, portraying the lives of people in a whole new way. One reviewer said that this will not stand the test of time. Perhaps not, but more's the pity because we have gravitated toward judgment and the lowest common denominator. I was transfixed by the tension between Brad Pitt's father and his son. He is a failure in his own eyes and takes vengeance on his children and his wife. He had a chance to pursue his dreams as a concert pianist, but blames his family for his giving up. Children are wise and his son gets to know him. Unfortunately, he has to vent his own anger. He precariously hangs on a thread of destruction. The cosmology in this film is striking. There is a part where we are taken from the Big Bang to the implications of an indifferent universe. The forces we face on a day-to-day basis are often random and cruel but the love we can give (the mother) is the only thing that outweighs it. If you have trouble with theology, remember there is stuff in the world worth clinging to, not just an adversarial god. There is one issue. What did Sean Penn get paid for being in this film. Other than putting his name on the credits, he did nothing. A lesser known actor who looked more like the oldest son could have had just as much credibility and the movie would not have missed a beat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another (near) masterpiece from Malick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few directors have as instinctive a flair for the art of cinema as Terrance Malick, who is such a perfectionist about his work that he's managed to crank out a mere five feature films in his four decades as a filmmaker. His films are like glorious odes to nature, much in the tradition of Wordsworth and Coleridge - only, in this age of modern technology, he uses images rather than words. He makes us see the world from a whole new perspective, employing cinematography and music in much the same way as an impressionist uses paint on a canvas.Watching a Malick film - to mix up our metaphors a bit - is a bit like sitting at the edge of the ocean, as wave after wave of indescribably beautiful images washes over you and eventually carries you out to sea. It really is an experience unlike any other that one can get at the movies.His latest work "The Tree of Life" is clearly his magnum opus, the culmination of his career-long obsession with the beauty of nature and mankind's relation to it. It is also his most overt dissertation to date on the random nature of the universe, as it chronicles a family's struggle to come to grips with the sudden death of their 19-year-old son and brother, R.L.The majority of the film takes place in Waco, Texas in the 1950s, where Jack and his two younger brothers, R.L. and Steve, are experiencing a childhood very similar to that of many middle-class Americans of the time. In fact, when it isn't busy being metaphysical and exploring the mysteries of the universe, "The Tree of Life" provides a searing look into suburban family life during that time period. Indeed, even though the characters don't say much to one another throughout the course of the movie - most of the words come in the form of voice-over narration - each still manages to become a fully realized individual in his or her own right, a character very much of that time but also universal in scope.Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt), for instance, is a rather archetypal father figure of the 1950s - an emotionally aloof disciplinarian who finds it so hard to express his feelings for his boys that at one point Jack finds himself wishing for his own father's death. Yet, O'Brien still displays those rare moments of tenderness that reveal the caring and loving individual that resides at his core. O'Brien is also struggling with the fact that he has never achieved his dreams either as a musician or as a successful inventor. This leads to a sense of bitterness and a kill-or-be-killed ethos that not only defines his own life but is the major value he wants to instill in his boys.Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) is also a fairly typical 1950s housewife - a generally passive woman utterly consumed with raising her family and defending her boys against the frequent outbursts her husband throws at them. In a way, she is the yin to Mr. O'Brien's yang, a woman filled with the virtues of understanding and nurturing, who balances out the unyielding rigidness of her husband and gives her sons an alternative path to follow in life.Jack is also a highly complex character, a naturally curious, strong-willed and contemplative young boy who wants desperately to do the right thing but often feels unable to do it. His strong moral code is frequently at odds with his penchant for mischief and, like all children who are just finding their way, he often chooses the wrong path to go down. Indeed, the film provides one of the most realistic depictions of childhood I have seen in a long while, capturing the wonderment, fear and sense of exploration that defines that period in life.Sean Penn, in a much smaller role, plays the adult version of Jack, who, even in the present day, is trying to come to grips with his little brother's untimely death. But it is Hunter McCracken as the young Jack who brings the film to life and makes us care about the character.As with any Malick film, "The Tree of Life" derives a tremendous amount of its greatness from its camera-work and sound and, true to form, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and composer Alexandre Desplat provide their customary miracles here. No other movie quite looks like a Malick film, with its smooth-flowing tracking shots - many following a character from behind - its intimate close-up shots of nature, and its haunting, painterly landscapes. For this film, Malick has added several scenes depicting the formation of the earth, the evolution of life and the destruction of the planet - all to illustrate the we're-all-interconnected, circle-of-life theme that resides at the movie's core.Yet while "The Tree of Life" is certainly Malick's most ambitious work to date, is it also his finest? I really don't think so. Even though it is completely mesmerizing as a work of pure cinema - few other directors could even touch it - it exudes a certain self-congratulatory pretentiousness that is missing from what I think are his best films, "Badlands" and "The New World," which feel more organic and natural. In a sense, it's trying so hard to be great - hardly a commonplace sin in American movie-making - that it actually feels a little off-putting and desperate at times. Genuine masterpieces - which I believe "Badlands" and "The New World" to be - generally don't have to work so hard at being masterpieces.But then again, in this day and age of formulaic and soulless commercial movie-making, we'll take a near-masterpiece any time we can get one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, But Uneven. Not Best Picture, But Something New</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film with two expectations: one, that the film would be long and slow. And two, that it would be extraordinarily good (as such outlets as NPR were behind it as the year's best film). The first expectation was met, and the second fell a bit short.What the film shows is very beautiful, and you can take it how you want. For me, the images of the universe's creation and the evolution of life are there to remind us that our lives are very small in the grand scheme of things. Was this Malick's intent? I have no idea. But that was my take.I also found the story to support this view based on how little story there actually is. The parts with Brad Pitt are few, showing him getting increasingly violent for no apparent reason. And the parts with Sean Penn are even shorter -- he may have only ten minutes of screen time. If you like story and plot to your films (and I do), this may not be the movie for you.If you are more interested in cinematography, this is a visual treat. Malick, who is not a fan of modern computer graphics (something we agree on), went the route of "2001" and used the more conventional special effects. I think this was a wise choice. At times the effects (such as the flying mother) border on pretentiousness (his message, whatever it may be, is clearly something big) but they never fully cross over (unlike "The Fountain", which is elitist horse apples).Roger Ebert calls the film a "masterpiece", gives it four stars, and compares it favorably to "2001". In fact, he thinks this film outdoes Kubrick. Ebert is apparently biased, though, as he says, "I don't know when a film has connected more immediately with my own personal experience." Ebert does call to our attention the film's mention of both "nature" and "grace". I did notice a science versus religion message here (or perhaps, a science overlapping religion message). I have not thought it through enough to make a cogent point, but there is definitely something to be said about this.Being someone who likes narrative, this does not rank for me as one of Malick's best works. I prefer "Badlands", for example. I am also aware that the story parts of this film and the universe parts were conceived as two different films. I think, perhaps, they should have stayed that way. Cutting the universe parts out (which would also cut down the very excessive running time), this could make for a very compelling story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw The Thin Red Line for the first time in 2003, something changed in me.Terrence Malick's cinema is about painstakingly creating emotions that remind you of things you did as a child, as a soldier, as a lover, as a human being. Imagine this: an old-school magician comes to your house and tells you about the most trivial things in your life. He gives you a scent that reminds you of the mother you didn't love properly when she was alive. He fills your room with nostalgia, with regret, with peace. In summation, he's performing magic.I saw The New World in 2005. Something changed in me. Seven years later, I watched The Tree of Life. A lot had changed in my life by then, but Malick's world brought me home in a way I can't describe in words. He doesn't cater to dialog or story arcs. The only master I can compare him to is probably Tarkovsky. The Tree of Life is a work of magic, not cinema. It's spellbinding. No, I didn't fall asleep while watching the film. Something beautiful was happening to me.If you walked out of the theater wondering what it was all about, you shouldn't have. That's like asking someone what their life is all about. Will that person be able to give you an answer?If you haven't watched this film yet, I adore and envy you. Be open to this film. Remember: it's a work of magic, not cinema. Witness it as such, and you'll be rewarded as much as I was. About Terrence Malick, what can I say. He's saved my life several times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No 'escapism' in Mallick's story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be the first to admit that this film looks incredibly pretentious. But so does anyone ever trying to approach a large philosophical question. And no one can deny that Mallick does approach a lot of large ideas in this film.I am most surprised by viewers who claim there is no plot. To claim this is to claim that our own lives contain no plot. The drama of a child's coming of age, and how much it effects the rest of his life is one of universal experience. We are part of Mallick's story, for we all were once children. How can we claim it to be plot less? I'd also like to point out that this is a film that portrays reality recklessly close to actual experience. Most films are conscious of how characters are unreal, either ultra-evil or ultra-good, in order that we may 'escape' from the every day into an alternative life. What is hard for most viewers of Tree of Life is that the film is so close to our own. The story of the children and their family is gristly, hard to watch, and at the same time, full of promise and beauty. We discover with these children. The cosmic origins sequence is comforting, as we try to conceive of the millions of years of activity that led simply to our birth. And Sean Penn's wonder at the world around him strikes us often, though we keep it to ourselves.What Mallick has achieved with this film is the closest thing to reality that film will probably ever be able to express. This is not simply the reality of what we see in the physical world around us, but includes what we experience, what we perceive of the world.Many people giving bad reviews argue that their is no recognizable plot. This is true, because Mallick meant to push the boundaries of what 'plot' must be. It is hard to be presented with our own lives, with our own faults, with our own mistakes, so lyrically, so sensuously. Tree of Life was the nearest to 'touching' a film I've ever experienced. As to the constant groans about how slow it is, perhaps this is an effect of how our generation is queued for quick gratification. And anyway, who among us won't confess to dozing during a great symphony before? Does this negate it as a masterpiece? During this film I was terrified, I cried, I was on the edge of my seat, I laughed. I related to the character of the boy more than any other character I've ever encountered. Most of us go to the movies to get away. But who among us dare go to the movies to face ourselves?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most riveting and ambitious examples of modern film making,Terrence Malick's 'The Tree of life' is profound,poetic and a beautiful work that proves that cinema can be art just like music or painting. In a movie asking the most important questions in human life,Malick dips into his own childhood as he picks up a simple narrative of a family whose eldest son ,now a successful architect recollects his childhood as he remembers the death of his little brother.Malick seamlessly blends the beginning of life to the creation of the universe and encompasses all of nature's action his his film.with rich visuals having deep emotional content,Malick succeeds in making us nostalgic and curious at the same time.The Boldness and reach of the film is paralleled only by Malick's fiercely heartfelt rendition.My top 10 films have been set that way for years but The Tree of Life has now entered it alongside my other favorites like 'paths of glory','Ikiru' and more recently 'The live of Others' and 'Oldboy'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why people hated it and how to appreciate it more *minor spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the reason why people hate the Tree Of Life is because they take it as it is on the surface, but not what it's deeper meaning is.Now I am not distinguishing between intelligent and not intelligent. I think an intelligent person could not like this film also, but this film has so much to think about and really if you take the time to analyze it as you're watching it, you'll appeciate it a whole lot more.This film, as anything else art is subjective; this means that there will always be people who like it and those who don't. But I am trying to maybe help people who didn't like it, to like it more. Or just explain why I liked it. The director was ambitious and tried a new take on filmmaking. Technically, this is what a film should be: it's meaning and story beautifully told through visuals. Which is what this film accomplished. I believe the point of this film is that creation of life is simple, but the development of it is complex and fragile. Life and love are extremely fragile but also very powerful and this was conveyed through how we try so desperately to explain them. This is living by nature, not grace. Grace is just being happy with life as it is, instead of constantly questioning it.People are loved for their grace, not for their nature, because subjective love itself is a part of subjective grace. But we need a balance of the two, which is what makes love and life so fragile and complex in the first place.The father (Brad Pitt) represents nature, and the mother represents grace. Their son represents the struggle of the two and the growth that comes with it.Some say this film delivers a strong religious message, well it does, but it also does not try to convert you. Instead it leaves you with the message that you should just live your life and be happy for what you have and this alone is faith. Religion itself crosses faith because it teaches you to question life.*SEMI SPOILERS*At the end when Sean Penn lets his brother walk off into "oblivion" and his mother comes to terms you can see that he has been able to come to peace and accept grace. That's why in the final shot, with the colours, nobody is speaking or asking anything of God.*END OF SPOILERS*This film was beautiful, brilliant and excellent in every form of the words and in order to like the film, you have to accept what the film conveys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Cinematic Poems Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the reason that this film gets such low ratings from so many people is because so few people read poetry anymore, or have the patience for the type of elliptical, indirect, allusive form of expression that great poetry involves. Most people expect film to conform to the same conventions as prose, as embodied in the genre of the novel, with interesting characters and a more or less linear plot that leads toward some resolution.This is a cinematic poem, and one of the most sublime exercises in that genre I've ever seen. It makes me feel lonely that so few people even remotely "get" the idea that Malick is trying to convey here, which flows from the quote from the Book of Job that starts the film.This is one of the very, very few films I've ever seen which seems to take Andrei Tarkovsky's "Mirror" as its main source of inspiration. The people to whom I've recommended "Tree of Life" who love Tarkovsky as much as I do have been rendered speechless by its spiritual depth and staggering visual beauty. I know a few people, myself included, who have had to make room on their "Top Five" list of greatest films of all time after having seen "Tree of Life" a few times. It does not give up its secrets easily. Those who don't like or understand abstract film (or art, or poetry) tend to fall asleep or get angry when watching it.So what is it about? I believe that great art is irreducible to anything other than itself. To try to explain something in terms other than those used by the artist destroys the art. The best that one can do is to help the audience understand the work on it's own terms.To me, the film is a homage to the hidden, greater reality that lies behind the world of images and sensations, but which has great portents in those images and sensations if one knows where and how to look. That underlying reality seems randomly cruel, tragic and heartbreaking at times, but it is not, because ultimately it emanates from a Love that is beyond all understanding.The unimaginable amount of Love that goes into creating another human being cannot be meaningless, it cannot be for nothing in the economy of Redemption, Salvation and Love that we all inhabit, whether we recognize it or not.If you care about this, and believe this, you will probably find "Tree of Life" to be one of the greatest, most beautiful, most emotionally and spiritually devastating films ever made. It reminds me of the old aesthetic aphorism: "The problem with beauty is not finding it, but bearing it." If you don't care, or don't believe, you will probably feel that you just wasted over two hours of your life that you will never get back after watching it.I can't help but think that many people who watch this film, and don't like it at first glance, will be haunted by it as time passes, and life starts to unfold in ways they cannot understand nor could have predicted. Sometimes the most important lessons are not learned until many, many years after they have been taught."Tree of Life" ranks with Tarkovsky's "Mirror," Bergman's "Winter Light" and Bresson's "Au Hasard Balthasar" as one of the greatest exercises in abstract filmmaking ever. I think it will remain on that very short list for as long as people have eyes to see, minds to wonder, and hearts to feel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ramblingly long montages, did Jack's brother die at some point and how? Sorry, it's not clear. I just think the whole film was a bit odd..! From my point of a view a artistic film can not be a rambling collection of images that add nothing to the film. the story only ever semi starts and never seamed to progress any further.Once the montages of the world, the universe, jellyfish and strangely enough dinosaurs have finished (the cinematography and visuals in these montages are very good) the story revolves around Brad Pitt and the way he deals with his sons in particular and family. He can be very abusive but at the same time can be very tender towards his family. Is it because he's just a cruel man or is it the time that the film takes place when parent were a bit more authoritarian. But it's all done in a very arty way and it somehow feels very disconnected. I could not relate to the film or characters in any way. And believe me I tried. (I watched the film from start to finish, with my company begging me to turn it off after 30 mins) Is it indeed "vision" of childhood? I personally couldn't tell you. As when it ended I was even more confused as no underlining story emerged and I felt slightly cheated by the whole thing.I just wanted to bring the score down a bit. 7.4 Fail.</fullReview>

A movie is supposed to be greater than the sum of it's parts, but those parts are supposed to mesh together somehow and make sense -- this movie, does not. Actually, I think calling this a "movie" is pretty generous.I knew right from the start that when there were basically no dialog scenes in the first 30 minutes, the rest of it was going to be pretty much the same thing over and over again...my only mistake was not trusting my instinct to turn it off right then and there.If you're into this kind of thing -- that's cool; but your time would be more well spent if you actually went to an art gallery or a museum -- not watching "the tree of life" - at least people who, generally, have their work displayed in an art gallery or a museum have actual talent, and their works are worth looking at and discussing; and more importantly -- have cohesion, and meaning. This movie has none of those qualities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great American Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film seems to have divided people like no other. To lay my cards on the table: I think it will come to be seen as ranking alongside the likes of Citizen Kane and The Godfather as the "Great American Movie". I've only seen it once (it's only just opened in the UK) so may well revise that opinion after 1 or 2 more viewings, but I doubt it. It is intensely autobiographical; Malick's own brother died at the brother's age in the film, which is set in the town where Malick grew up. The much-criticised "history of the universe" section is Malick's illustration of God's answer to Job: "where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?" with Sean Penn in the Job role. As for those who found it "boring", why on earth did they go to a film which they must have known wasn't their kind of film? I enjoy EVERY film I see, simply because I carefully select which to see in the first place, having read up about them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not like The Tree of Life, but watched it with an open mind and now I want to give it a serious review. I've enjoyed plenty of artsy films, like "Blue Velvet" and "Lost In Translation" and "Mulholland Drive," but this this movie is very different. There is very little dialog and seriously HALF of the movie is just imagery of the big bang, the creation of the universe and evolution of life on earth (yeah, there are dinosaurs in this movie). The other half of the film is really more a collection of "character studies" than a linear story. Sean Penn is hardly in the movie. Basically he goes up in an elevator in the beginning and comes down an elevator at the end. When we're not watching the history of the universe or Sean Penn in an elevator, we see Sean Penn's character as a young boy growing up in a somewhat dysfunctional family. The movie was very long and boring. There were a few times when it seemed to end and everyone in the theater said things like "finally, it's over" but then another scene would start and I could hear people in the audience complaining that it wouldn't end. To avoid being like film maker Terrence Malick, I made my point, so this is the end of the review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A love letter to the art of cinema, a prayer for humanity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This simplistic review is for those who loved the film. If you hate slow, abstract films, then stay away, because I know that it's easy to hate the film. Don't knock it until you tried it. No offense to the haters, I'm writing my own opinion.)It's been a long time since "2001: A Space Odyssey" where we have a film that was so ambitious, so original in its direction, and yet at the same time so abstract, that people have written it off as "pretentious". Terrence Malick's latest food-for-thought "The Tree of Life", is perhaps just as ambitious, maybe a little more, than Kubrick's sci-fi juggernaut. The year's best film is also a powerful, mesmerizing experience. Whether everyone can feel it or not is up to them.To watch it properly, watch it alone, or at least someone who can handle abstract, avant-garde films. Watch it during the day, with no popcorn or food of any kind, because night will make you sleep as the film is slow- paced, and refreshments will make you distracted. You will need 100% concentration on this movie.Everyone has a right to their opinion. Many call this film "pretentious, overblown, boring, etc". It can be all of these. It can be none. What has to be accepted as fact, is that this is Terrence Malick at full force, letting his personal story be told in a manner modern Hollywood (and their audiences) would really object to, and he doesn't hold back, not once, in his direction and storytelling. This is a passion project of the purest form. Kudos for that to one of the greatest, ambitious, and most mysterious artist in the film medium since, dare I say, Mr. Kubrick himself?There is no coherent plot. There are flashes of experiences and visions. This minimalist form of storytelling and acting works perfectly and resonates more deeply, knowing Malick.Yes, there are stars, like Brad Pitt, Sean Penn and Jessica Chastain, but they all play background to Malick's vision and mystery, as well as the crew who has done wonders here. Jack Fisk's beautiful production design; Emmanuel Lubezki's top notch, masterful cinematography; Alexandre Desplat's haunting music; the seamless editing of the story and the thematic imagery; Malick's trademark inner monologues, all are perfect and combine together with the actors and Malick to deliver a unique and mesmerizing experience. This is a movie perhaps unlike any other. Notable praise goes to Hunter McCracken as the young boy who shows a variable range of emotions without overacting - he is superb in the role and it puts the audience into his shoes, the innocence, the joy, the harshness, and the bewilderment of life.So why are there images regarding the birth of the universe spliced into the film? What purpose are they to the story? Perhaps it is pretentious drivel like they said. Perhaps the film shows, not tell, two childhoods - one a boy in small town Waco, and the other, the birth of the Universe and the creation of life. Are they together and the same? Are they different and so vast that we are insignificant? Should we be grateful to life and its offerings? These are just the tip of the iceberg for the many, many questions that are posed in the movie. I await to see the movie again and again, for this movie requires multiple viewings.The film is a love letter to the art form of cinema. Rarely again will we get a film that caters strictly to cineastes and avant-garde art lovers, rarely will we get a film that is so pure in its ambition and artistry for a long while. The film also serves as a prayer for humanity, perhaps asking us to look deep into ourselves and appreciate life for what it is, what it has made us become, and what the uncertain future will hold for us.I admit, there are parts where I felt completely lost in the movie. But maybe the boy in the movie is also experiencing the same thing - lost, confused, frustrated. I somehow felt something - a connection with the characters, a personal recollection of sorts. It's this feeling that makes me keep on watching, and wanting more. Maybe it will be revealed when I watch it again. Maybe I'll appreciate the film more as I grow older. But what I do know is, I loved the experience and would not want to forget it. The things that make our childhood...to love and to fear...to give and to let go...to enjoy and to suffer...to live and to die...it resonates throughout the film and it gave me goosebumps. Philosophers will have a field day with the film dissecting its hidden themes and messages.I'm refreshed that this movie is proof that even masters like Malick would not succumb to the modern Hollywood system. I eagerly await the master's next project, but as of now, "The Tree of Life" is a haunting yet mesmerizing experience that should be felt by all, although many will hate it and accuse it for being pseudo-intellectual. If you don't like these type of movies, you're gonna hate it. Some movies entertain. This one makes you think...and feel...and embrace life.Terrence Malick the mysterious and eccentric filmmaker is a brilliant man. Sometimes the strange ones are the brilliant-minded ones, wanting to say something they always wanted to say (that, in the public mind, would seem odd) and not giving two damns about everybody else's opinions. Malick is one of them, and for that I'd say, bravo. He has created a poem of beauty and care, a prayer for hope.This is one of the great movies that will be talked about, and say, more appreciated, as time goes by. It is also a reminder that cinema is a unique art form for all to experience, and this movie does the art form proud.Overall rating: 95/100</fullReview>

The cinematography was pretty good, but nothing else was even grade 1 movie making. Flaws abound. Inconsistencies were rife. The use of so much NASA and national geographic stock film was insulting. I see that all the time on my PC. How many children did they have? Who died? How was he 19 when the other two kids were there and young?Why was there a cameraman at her door when she received the letter? Who was the blond woman with Penn? Where was this pseudo-space? It seemed to change its character all the time. What part did the cgi animals (dinosaurs?) contribute to our understanding? Maybe there should have been a screen play, it would have helped. This is strictly for the phony intellectuals. Score another strikeout for film festivals and wonder at the payoff the critics must have gotten. No one in my audience (around 150) liked or "got" the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked the acting in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Acting is make-believe you are looking at the character instead of the actor. I liked the acting in this movie. Of course, it goes without saying that Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain are able to do that, they are professionals, but what stands out for me is the acting of the children. It was so good, even with the camera so close it sometimes almost collided with the children, and still they remained in character. Wonderful.That said, nothing else in the movie impressed me very much. The story was erratic and slow, no plot at all, just every day life of a family in the 50s going through an ordeal, in a dreamy kind of narrative. Oh, I almost forgot. Old Jack, played by Sean Penn, does not unite with young Jack. It seemed an entirely different person. I don't know why, because Penn is a good enough actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to challenge the "really-loved it" and "really-hated it" mentality by saying that it was all right. I liked it. A 6 for me means that I either thought it was an okay movie or a good movie. Now I love Malick for movies like "Days of Heaven" and actually I didn't like "Badlands" all that much, but I still thought it was a great movie. Maybe it's because I don't like Martin Sheen that much, but I did like Apocalypse Now, so I'm guessing that wasn't the biggest problem for me from "Badlands". Anyway, I did liked "The Tree of Life" for the acting. I thought Jessica Chastain, who is one of the greatest actresses of our modern times, Brad Pitt, and Sean Penn gave great performances as they usually do--I don't think this part can be denied. I think the problem of this movie for most people was that it is just way too long and, quite frankly, one flipping boring film. I think it was about 2 and a half hours, but I remember while watching this I literally felt like time was going backwards, spinning upside down, and doing whatever other implausible and scientifically unexplainable things.It was artistic though, emotional, and meaningful - depending on how one interprets it, though I am too lazy to justify my statement, so we'll leave it at this. Films aren't supposed to be about dialogue, they're supposed to be about imagery and telling a story through pictures. All right, from the creation sequences, I'm not sure what story this film was trying to tell, but I said this to try and explain why this film may not have been all talk but all show.I guess this film really is a love-it or hate-it film. I just wasn't really mad or happy about seeing this film, so I guess I'm just one of those random people who got stuck in the middle. There are great film- making aspects about this film that can't be denied--the directing was good, acting was good, the cinematography and visual effects were absolutely stunning, the screenplay was probably 5 pages long, but still this is a decent film for the previous reasons. Is it worth paying for to view though? I think one has to pay more attention to the director for that. Not sure when Malick switched to Kubrickian time, but for those who aren't fans of it, just keep in mind Malick's name next time you hit the cinema for another meaningless movie night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As other reviewers have stated, I too heard remarks of bewilderment regarding this film, and being someone who likes unusual films, I took a punt on it. I love the story line such as it is, although it wasn't what I expected from the advertising I had seen. Rather than being about the relationship between the narrator and his strict, authoritarian bully of a father, It is a love letter from the narrator to his dead younger brother, and is very touching. The emotional impact would be greatly heightened however if there wasn't constant quick cutting between unrelated scenes. If the film were re-cut it would be a lot more accessible to its audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual Malick's thoughts transfer to you via whispers and half-overheard snatches of conversation.Visually it reminded me of Lars von Trier's Melancholia - it had that same up close reality bathed in a rich golden otherworldly light.Like many other master film-makers Malick expects you to contribute your personal intelligence and sensibility to the film and not just sit back to receive it. In other words, participation and submersion is the key to accepting the film.The children are well cast and directed and appear incredibly natural. The adult performers are all outstanding, particularly Pitt, who gives a performance of a man teetering on an emotional and moral tightrope.If you love Tarkovsky you will be at home with this film.If you don't know what the hell I'm talking about - try watching it anyway as a form of meditative exercise.</fullReview>

This special movie is like music, like living painting.

		<shortDescription>Visual poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been going through a lot of firsts lately, and this is the first Terrence Malick film I've seen so far. Prior to this, I've only known about his visual style that includes a freely wandering camera and a tendency to emphasize visuals over story. So, with that in mind what did I think of this? Well, to be sure it is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. There's also a heavily spiritual undercurrent that makes every line and image pregnant with meaning, as long as you're willing to look for it. This is a very esoteric and philosophically dense film, and also very opaque in terms of what it means. There are a number of threads and themes which I was able to pick out, but I challenge anyone to really give a definitive interpretation. The basic story is about a family in 1950's Texas. There's the mother and father, played by Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain, and their three boys. The mother and father are fairly opposite in personality and approach to parenting, and this has a significant effect on their oldest son. One major theme that kept coming up was that of tragedy and how we respond to it. What the film seemed to be saying is that tragedy comes to us all, but what matters is how we deal with it. The film also deals with issues of childhood, growing up and the parent-child relationship. It also deals with life and love in a very broad, spiritual manner. I'm still trying to piece it together, but I must say that I liked it more than I thought I would. Terrence Malick is a filmmaker whose filmography I look forward to delving deeper into. This first look at the way he artfully combines images and music was very impressive. I also loved the soundtrack and score, composed almost exclusively of classical music. Some might find this type of film too arty or pretentious, but I was OK with it. That being said, one does have to have a measure of patience to watch this kind of film, and also not mind having little spelled out in terms of narrative or interpretation. If you're fine with that, then I heartily recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pefect Depiction of Childhood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one movie which is truly puzzling. How in the world somebody got the courage to make it is really beyond me. Now, The Tree of Life is clearly not aimed at this new wave of pseudo-intellectual Christopher Nolan fans of Inception or Interstellar or any of these turkeys like Drive, which actually make 18-35 year old average movie goers think that they have seen a good movie because they are more cleverly tricked than, say, older movies like Terminator.It is not a typical so-called artsy movie neither, which gets automatically some kind of price and praise at film festivals longing to get known recognition because it has been slowed down to a point where you cannot take it anymore (think about Uncle Boonme).I really do not know how this movie got made.But this is only one side of the brilliance of The Tree of Life. Actually, it is much more than a movie: it is a breathtaking and honest experience about the loss of innocence during childhood. While watching the TTOL, I felt like experiencing a collection of memories from a really ordinary person, events which may seem insignificant at first but really shape our identity (e.g. the scene where the father asks his son to give him the ligther). It is also shot in a way that is very emotional and original. But that make the TTOL so powerful is the complexity of its characters. You could sympathize with any of the main characters, even with the father because even if he is cruel at times, we all know that he acted in this way for the good of his sons. I am not saying if he is good or bad, I am only saying that he is more complex than that, and people are very complex. I think this is the hardest thing to for a director, and this is what lacks nowadays in most movies.Truly mesmerizing experience which reminded of how insignificant we are (think about our tiny place in the enormity of the universe and our non-existent effect on its evolution, hence the first part of the movie), yet at the same how precious a human life can be.10/10 for such emotion and depth in a movie.</fullReview>

It's not that the movie is the best film I've ever seen, and I'm sure those who will hate it won't think it's the worst movie they've ever seen, either. It almost feels like an experimental film. It uses nature and beautiful cinematography to tell its story, and uses words less. It paints a great picture of life in general, and almost feels like 2001: A Space Odyssey in some cases. The actors involved give Oscar-worthy performances, the kids included. This movie is definitely only for certain people, and I am one of them.

		<shortDescription>Amazing! But not for everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nature only wants to please itself", it's the main question that makes this different masterpiece unique. Terrence Malick created this visual vision of his, to show us that there are two ways through life. On one hand how nature works on the other how God thinks. It's a big debate of the creator's mind to ensure us some unknown answers about our existence and our place on this massive universe and our existence after we die.A middle-aged successful architecture sits and remembers his childhood memories with his brothers and his parents. A middle class family is going through an ordeal when they lose their son. A sensitive mother represents nature and a strict and autocratic father representing probably religion. A "communication" between humans, God and nature that is very well shown with the incredible visual effects and the powerful music mixed with the image. In my opinion this film is not for everyone although its easy to understand it but not easy to appreciate it. It's an artistic film that even Terrence Malick's followers will find hard to follow. I also believe that the film gives you the benefit and freedom to create your own reflection about the meaning behind the main concept. The movie has amazing directing skills that only Malick is able to do by skipping the basic "rules" of directing. Great performances by Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain. Also from the children witch they've never had acted before. It's a movie you should watch at least one because of the concerns you might consider later on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets cut right to the chase. A very esoteric and somewhat artsy film with tons of angst as it presents an abusive father son relationship...and the spread to the three boys, with the helpless mother. The film didn't cut it for me. A much more effective treatment of the subject matter is "The White Ribbon", a pre world war I German movie that was more realistic and had more impact. I'd suggest the Tree of Life borrowed from it, at times, and "The Tree" knows not if it is an "imaginery" or "reality" in the making. For those reasons, I give it a 3 out of 10 and suggest a 'healthy'alternative - if there is such a thing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tree of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As any fan of writer/director Terrence Malick can tell you, some of us have been waiting for The Tree of Life for quite some time. I think it was announced that he was making this film shortly after his 2005 feature The New World. Different websites would report on any news they had on the film, but for the most part everything was in secrecy and what they did report just added more to the mystery. The release date for the film kept getting changed around as well until finally this year it was released into theatres after a successful premiere at The Cannes Film Festival this year. Just to sum it up briefly, The Tree of Life is a very spiritual, religious and poetic film that shows us breathtaking images of one's idea of what the beginning and creating of the world looks like as well as some of this earth's earliest creatures and some beautiful natural occurrences and the beauty of nature that is all around us. The film then focuses on a family growing up in the 1950's in Texas. The film shows us how devoutly religious the family is and that through their years together as a family they experience much joy as well as heartache and sorrow. All of this is seen through the one son, Jack. He looks at his mother almost as a saint as she is very soft spoken, kind and playful. His dad on the other hand has cause him great grief and trouble over the years even into his much later stages in life. It is not that his father did not love him, but rather had a different way of showing it. His father was very strict and demanded recognition and respect. Everything to him was very matter of fact and routine and there are some scenes we see him with his young children that actually caused me some discomfort and anxiety. Not because they are violent, but because of the emotional intensity of the scenes and how real and believable it is. We get to see the young boys growing up with each other and their friends and going about day to day life such as school, chores and family life. Often at times there was a very peaceful feeling I got while watching them and then in times of trouble you could also really feel for this family and the young kids and it would almost disturb you. The sequences showing the creating of the world and this earth were very beautiful and done to some very poetic voice overs and music and by the end of this film I felt quite emotional. I felt that way because in this movie we see so much beauty and also the hardships and difficulties of life and because it feels so real and personal I can not imagine it hitting home to most viewers who watch it. The film is done in such a way that many will lose patience with it and not care for it whatsoever. This is more a film for the braver filmgoers who like a challenge and liked to be challenged by their films and think about what they just saw. This film will leave you questions and perhaps in it's own way give you answers to your own life, existence and past memories you have had on your path down this life whether they have been good, bad, or like most of us a little of both. The Tree of Life is a haunting and beautiful film that reached my inner emotions and left me quite quiet after I saw the film, but gave me a lot of food for thought and it was definitely a very worthwhile and meaningful movie experience that I am glad I had. One of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of beguiling beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's 5th film since his brilliant debut, Badlands (1973), The Tree of Life is seemingly a semi-autobiographical familial story of the O'Brien flock. The film begins with a brief look at the family in 1950's Texas. Headed by Brad Pitt's authoritarian Mr O'Brien, his wife Jessica Chastain, and their three boys, Jack (Hunter McCraken), R. L. (Laramie Eppler) and Steve (Tye Sheridan). This is often juxtaposed with an adult Jack (Sean Penn), who seems to be struggling with the memories of his childhood. The end of these first sequences are occupied by the death of one of the boys.This is followed by a grandiose, visually stunning opus of the creation of worlds and life. A heavily orchestrated sequence with a scientific outlook for the big bang and what follows. We even see some CGI dinosaurs, occupying the beautiful, serene landscape. A tree, like life has wild branches, vein-like, splitting off on tangents, moving into different directions. Humbled by the complexity of this, we are back with the O'Brien clan, as we see birth in all it's joy. A family drama ensues, with Pitt's father, authoritarian, sometimes coldly tender to his boys. He does love his boys, but is stern, particularly with the eldest, Jack. Jack's feelings of hate towards his father becomes increasingly apparent. As Jack progresses, he begins to see the world, the relationships, in a more mature manner. In one sequence he states to his father, "This is your home, you can make me leave any time you want." His thoughts are whispered, as he thinks after "You want to kill me". Jack is also seen praying for God to kill his father.The films major theme is reflective of both religion and hard science. Philosophy is fundamental to the process involved in the nature of life. Mrs O'Brien tells her sons in voice-over "There are two ways through life: the way of nature and the way of grace". This perfectly encapsulates the meaning behind the film. All actors involved are wonderful. Pitt's Mr O'Brien is stern, and effective, we feel almost threatened by his coldness. And all three boys are seemingly natural in their performances.For the visual effects, Malick had Douglas Trumball pulled out of retirement, and (except for the dinosaurs), began experimental with natural substances to create the beautifully realised creation sequences. The use of Trumball seems to be reflective of the nature of the films themes. The Tree of Life often feels like a religious reworking of Stanley Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) - that Trumball also worked on - and Malick, like Kubrick, uses music wonderfully, evoking creations beauty. It is simply the elliptical nature of the film that gives it a fantastical, grandiose quality. Creation of life is juxtaposed with it's inevitable partner, death, and in turn how this effects life.Winner of the Palme D'Or at 2011's Cannes film festival, The Tree of Life has been met with polar-opposite reactions. In its first showing at Cannes it was booed. Pretentious has been bandied round a lot in reaction to the film. Yeah, it has pretensions (of course it does - it's a huge subject to tackle). I watched the film with awe, its beauty utterly beguiling and surprising me. Many of the shots in the film are so stunning, I would be very happy to frame them to adorn my walls. And, due to its complexities, it is certainly one of those films that requires more viewings.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Big Tree is pretty damn good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is easier to dissect former professional basketball player Tree Rollins' NBA Career than to review Director Terrence Malick's "The Tree of Life" so please bear with me. The renowned Malick, who is a recluse in his personal life, does not play by the prototype Hollywood film narrative formula. And that is definitely exhibited in "The Tree of Life". I could now divulge into the plot points of the movie (as I usually do during this portion of my film reviews); but the problem is that there is no plot in "The Tree of Life", and in fact it's not really a problem. "The Tree of Life" branches itself primarily on the themes of evolution, nature, grace, religion, and existentialism; and has something in common with porno movies, it shows a "big bang" (but not the one you're thinking, exiting gutter). All these aforementioned themes are incorporated within the memories of the character Jack during middle age as he fixates on his childhood in Waco, Texas with his domineering father, free-spirit mother, and two brothers. Huh? You just gotta see it to know what I rambling about! "The Tree of Life" is not an "Inception", it's not supposed to be a cerebral challenge for viewers. It is more a visual avenue where a viewer can analyze their life experiences within the context of the universe, etc. (believe me when I say etc.) Are you still with me? Do you think I am barking up the wrong "Tree of Life"? Maybe so, but that is OK. Because how you plant the "The Tree of Life" in you is also OK, unless you dismiss it instantly and don't give this tree a change to grow in your consciousness. Malick presents one of the most stunning cinematic visual sequences you will ever see in a motion picture in "The Tree of Life". Can someone already please hand over the Best Cinematography Oscar to Emmanuel Lubezki? Yes, that good! "The Tree of Life" and "The Tree of LeBron" has something in common, they have mucho haters. It is not a movie where after experiencing one says "It was OK, I guess". It has no middle ground, it's in "love it or hate it" territory. I really liked it, did not love it, but really liked it, and 93.4% it was because of Malick's mastery direction. If it was like he was a ghost character in the film, I can't really describe it; like his films really. Brad Pitt was solid as bully dad (sorry Mr. O'Brien, I meant Father) Mr. O' Brien. Jessica Chastain as Mrs. O' Brien was quiet in verbose but at the right volume with expression with her wonderful performance. And crack in another impressive child actor because Hunter McCracken was a revelation with his impressive acting as Young Jack. The only Jack that should have been kept more in the box was Sean Penn playing the older Jack. Even though his character was pivotal in the film, there was no need for Penn to play it. Any other actor could have done what Penn did in just wandering around elevators, streets, his home, and his office building. Malick's screenplay was not as impressive as his direction, but the screenplay is not the trunk part of "The Tree of Life". The only movie that slightly resembles "The Tree of Life" is Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey". But even so, "The Tree of Life" will be like nothing you have ever seen before in the cinema. When you do, just remember to open your cerebral roots of your mind and just let the Malickism take you away! **** Good</fullReview>

In short, it's excruciatingly boring, horrendously long, inexcusably pretentious and a complete and total waste of good acting and a good script.Even Sean Penn has panned this movie and he was in it. This movie is clearly a result of nobody telling this director "no." It's not experimental. It's not meaningful to anyone else but the director Malick. And, it's not worth your time to go see it.If this had been presented as a student film at the UCLA School of Film (or any other school of that type), the person making it would have been run out of the program.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very seldom, and by seldom I mean never, do I feel so moved by a movie that I am compelled to take the time to write a review. To put it simply, this movie angered me. I'm a pretty laid back person and I found myself squeamish with irritation and impatience. Just because you string together a series of visually striking scenes and long shots of big name actors staring into space does not qualify it as a movie. This is the epitome of self-indulgent, pseudo-intellectual drivel. Film critics all have to jump on board with this movie so they don't fall into the ranks of those who don't "get it", that's the only possible explanation I can come up with for why the reviews were so glowing. This is by far the most disjointed, incoherent piece of "mental masturbation" (as another reviewer put it) I've ever suffered through. Don't let the artsy, "sophisticated", elitist douche bags make you feel stupid for not liking this film, deep inside they know it's crap, though they'll never admit it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the tittle says, this movie was terrible... it is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. It was so meaningless and full of stupid pictures. If there was ever a plot in the entire film, please, tell me!! I don't know how actors like Sean Penn or Brad Pitt ended doing something like this (I respected you guys). As soon as I saw some of the first scenes, I wanted so much to leave the room. And I did it! The music selection was awful, the acting was a terrible, and almost all of the scenes didn't have a single relation between them so that the movie could have had some meaning. I really warn you: whoever you are.... you have better things to do with your life rather than spending it seeing this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious and boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most movies that try to convey a sense of how deep and profound life really is work exactly the opposite of this one. They usually start out with small and everyday stuff and then develop into something grandiloquent, so that we can develop an attachment to characters and their own personal feelings and hence relate to the more 'abstract' content. The Fountain and Requiem for a Dream come to mind as a great example of that approach. This film tries to work the other way around and fails miserably: it throws a bunch of space and deep sea imagery and supposedly profound reflexions about God, life, love, etc. at the beginning. The visuals are truly a delight, but the whole thing feels more like a overly long video clip than a movie, since classical music plays in the background most of the time and most characters have been on screen for only a few minutes. Frankly, the space visual + choral music scene this has been done a thousand times already. It feels old and uninspired, yet it tries unsuccessfully to be mobilizing. When the real plot kicks in, it's already too late since you are pretty bored and you may wish the movie would just end. Having said that, I have to praise the selection of music throughout the film and overall sound effects (trees, waves, etc.), the acting of Brad Pitt and Sean Penn are also remarkable (even though the latter hardly speaks), and some of the visual segments are truly jaw dropping. But these are far in between and feel distant to the characters from the movie, so it's not really surprising to see the whole project derail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A failed masterpiece?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was 9 my parents took me to an art gallery to see some of the works by Pablo Picasso. Now, to me art was all about drawing something so that it looked like it did in real life, so I didn't understand when I looked at a painting titled 'Seated woman' and it looked nothing like a woman on a seat, or a woman at all, it challenged my ideals on what art was meant to be, and I didn't like it one bit.This is my introduction to my The Tree Of Life review, because watching this film made me feel like that 9 year old kid looking at a confusing painting again. I did not enjoy this film. I had an idea of what kind of movie it was from reading reviews and seeing clips of the movie on the net, and it looked interesting and I figured that the negative reviews were just from people whose idea of art in movies is when Bruce Willis did Sin City. How wrong I was.Here is how the film goes. Someone says a statement/question like "Where are you?" then for the next 5 minutes we are bombarded with metaphorical imagery that is so obscure that you give up trying to work out what it means and just look at the pretty pictures instead, then another statement/question, then another 5 minutes of imagery.Now the imagery is central to this film, and it looks stunning. But saying that, I have seen BBC nature shows that have the same amazing cinematography. Some people will say that every shot is a work of art. Kubrick did the same, but he also made movies that made sense and had more than one line of dialogue every 5 minutes. Slow burner movies with minimal dialogue are great to watch (Drive, 2001, Lost in Translation) but this is not one of them.It is almost as if this movie - and the director - are too clever for themselves. Metaphorical imagery is fine in cinema, we as an audience are used to it. But it has to be clear what the metaphor is. A dinosaur stomping its foot twice on the head of another smaller dinosaur, then leaving it alive before running away, that is a metaphor for something, for what though, I do not know. I'm sure that it is clear to the director what the message of that scene was, but I know no one who has a clear idea what it meant. And that sums up the movie. No one knows what it means, every person interprets it differently.Is it genius film making? I don't know.Is it enjoyable to watch? Not really, the pictures are nice.Did it tell a good story? I think it had a story hidden in amongst all the imagery and metaphors. If it was good or not, I don't know because I can't decide if it was there in the first place.3/10 - If you are planning on watching this because it looks amazing, do yourself a favour and watch the BBC's Planet Earth instead, better story, and you'll enjoy it more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One would think that having a cast with Brad Pitt and Sean Penn in it would make a great movie. One might even say it doesn't matter how bad the script, screenplay, directing, etc. is that Pitt and Penn could make the movie decent. Well unfortunately they don't even get a chance. You actually see the actors for about 30 minutes of the movie. The rest of the film is something you would see in a movie theater at an art or earth and space museum. It really will be a waste of your time. The storyline never develops any further than the first 10 minutes of the movie. I know this film was hailed by many as being so bold and pushing the barriers on how a film should be. But it will leave you wondering what happened to the last 2 hours on your life. I've never walked out of a movie in my life; well until this movie came along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cinema I visited to see this movie showed a plot summary to make this look like an actual movie. However, what I got was a series of images without a plot whatsoever. Not one time had I seen the audience around me, including myself, completely flustered as we did not know what to think of it. Because there is no plot whatsoever it becomes exceedingly hard to understand. It is like the director thought it would be a good idea to flash random images of people crying/fighting and lights and completely at random special effect. The only feeling that haunted me, was wondering what I had been watching for over 2 and a half hours and I would never get this time back.In comparison to this movie, a title such as Inception is Crystal Clear. Avoid this title as it does not qualify as a movie in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beginning has great nature shots, but poorly edited, confusing and disorienting. Then dinosaurs appear, and I wondered if we stepped through a portal into science-la-la land. This section was beautiful, in National Geographic style, but too jumbled. The voice-over comments in this section about faith were likewise disconnected from anything else in the film. I hoped the story would get solid and engaging, but like the nature scenes, it too was cartoonish. We learn too early of a son's death, then slip forward and backward in time in a way that made no sense. The film suggests that pain makes one's faith stronger, but was not continued in later interactions among the characters.The characters are two-dimensional, flat. I didn't care about any of them. I got increasingly uncomfortable with the unreality of it, gave up, and waited in the lobby. My wife later said the audience laughed from relief when it was over.Can someone explain how so many critics rave over this? It had the life of a cartoon, not of people.</fullReview>

There is no dialogue - it is not a film! The music is totally unbearable and seriously depressing; there is an interminable part with images of ripples and colours and shapes that just go on forever! The dialogue is really laughable - most people were snickering and wondering what the heck they were doing there, and several people left. We tried to hang on in the hope for something to happen, but when it didn't after half an hour we left anyway and went in to another film which, thank goodness, we thoroughly enjoyed!

But this film, although very pretty, was boring, and we followed the five other couples that left and went before it ended. I just couldn't stand it. I appreciate the sentiment, but the film, at least when people were present, was for sure boring. I had to look away from the screen because it was so boring. The montage of the cosmos was breathtaking and sort of reminded me of screensavers. But when the actors came on, it was annoying. If this means I am not artistic, so be it.

There is no story line in it what so ever. People who like this movie will tell you probably some crap story like this: This movie is so sophisticated. It's about the creation of the universe and the tiny role we play in it. It's about the love of our mother and how beautiful life is in its smallest assets. It has a deeper meaning... (start reading the positive reviews if u like to read BS).What the movie is really all about: Its just music and images. It feels like your watching some boring pinguin documentary on discovery channel. About 1/4 of the people didn't stay until the end. The rest of them just went to sleep inside the movie theater cause the movie feels like your listening to a sleepy song you already listened to to many times.</fullReview>

Let me first say that there was nothing wrong with the acting of all the actors. It was just so slow and every time the movie got a little interesting the director killed it. If you like conversation,don't go to this movie. Movie is over 2 hours with in total 15 minutes of conversation. Could of made the movie in half an hour. It's like I was watching national geographic channel. More than 2 hours of images put together. If you perhaps think that's just one opinion. It's an opinion of somebody who gave the movie a real chance. After 1 hour already 11 people had left the cinema. 17 before the movie ended.

		<fullReview>As for cinematography great it is, and that is about it nothing else. Does it have a philosophical point OK I might say yes. But for something with such a deep meaning the movie is very very slow. Me, my wife and my sister had a very hard time keeping our selves to the seats rather than just jumping out of our seats and leaving in the middle of the movie. There were comments elsewhere about mistakes in the time line of the creation of the universe, in all honesty I wouldn't hold that against the film as long as it is serving a purpose of getting a point across. I know that this movie is greatly loved and admired by the critics and many viewers. But I am sorry guys in my humble opinion I would have to say this is one of the worst movies I have seen, the same story concept could have been done much better with a higher viewer retention rate, something just did not click and I had a strong urge to leave the movie in the middle of it, and that is something I seldom feel or do. A movie should grab your attention and make you want to stay till the end, something this movie failed to do for me.

Everything could be perfect from cinematography to acting, but the director never read the screenplay and the film editor didn't know nothing about the subject, was tipsy, and someone made him a cruel joke putting between the raw footage a National Geographic's documentary. Just to make an example, who is Sean Penn and what's he doing in a modern room lighting a candle? Everyone could easy answer "He is the Brad Pit's soon grew up". But I don't think the story tells us this information, we need to read some reviews in order to understand the plot. I've have developed a sort of test about this film. Every time I meet someone enthusiastic of it, I ask him why Jessica Chastain started floating in the sky around a tree. Usually the answer is that this scene isn't in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this tree is barren, pretentious and boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had this film recorded on my cable TV memory device for quite a while. I was quite curious now to see it with my own eyes, after the dust of the extreme reception it enjoyed settled. Some of the critics I mostly admire declared it no less than a masterpiece. Among them the late Roger Ebert, although I must say his review deals a lot with similitude of the story and heroes with his personal experience. The film was also decorated with awards. Yet, many other reviews seem to incline of the other side. Mine included.The story in 'The Tree of Life' is about the childhood and coming of age of a young boy in the Mid or South of the United States in the 50s or 60s. It is a little strange to say 'the story' as director Terrence Malick seems very little interested in story telling. What we see developing is a very Oedipal relation between a strict father (Brad Pitt), and the elder of three brother kids, with the mother (Jessica Chastain) becoming the moderating and caring member of the family, and an object of interest in the growing pains of a rebel teenager. I have no problem with story telling in different than chronological order, I have seen them all in movies - personal perspective, reversed chronologies - but in this case the logic was hard to grasp, and some details remained obscure to me. Did both younger brothers die? One drowning as a kid, the other at the age of 19 (his death is announced in the starting segment). If so, why does the first dead brother appear again and again after his death on screen? Are these supposed to be events that happened before his death? Or does the director intent to say that his presence continue to be with his family even after his death? All this is left in fog, and I am not sure what higher purpose this ambiguity serves.There are two more plans in the film. One of them shows the elder brother many years later, remembering his young years, still in guilt and in an uneasy relation with his father (not clear if still alive either). Sean Penn's character seems somehow disconnected from the rest of the film, and from his young incarnation (huge performance by Hunter McCracken). The most talked segment is the one that shows the origins of the Universe - it's beautiful video art on Gregorian songs music, but I failed to be very impressed for two reasons. First, it's not extremely original, the association with Kubrick's '2001, A Space Odyssey' that was often made shows this, but what made sense in a space saga is less fit to a mid-America family drama. The disconnect of the three plans, or four plans if I count the after-days final is the principal problem of this film. Its length, the story telling style, the lack of logic made the experience quite boring to me, despite of the beauty of the cinematography.On the positive side I need to mention the good acting. Brad Pitt is at his best in the role of the tough but caring father, mirrored in his son with the same failure to communicate beyond the strict rules of American fathering. Jessica Chastain provides a strong emotional counterpart, with delicacy and femininity. None of the two talk much, but they are real and alive characters in a dead (but colored) setting.I read that at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, the screening of 'The Tree of Life' was met with both boos and applause. The film ended by winning the Palme D'Or. I am afraid that if I were in the audiences, I would have been among the protesters.</fullReview>

Those were basically regarding the pace of the film. I thought the pacing was appropriate. Not only is it something to marvel at, but it is something to reflect upon. This film reminded me a lot of the way I feel about my brother and the happy times of my childhood. It certainly is a film that would be great to see on a big theater screen. I wondered why this was never presented in IMAX. That would be incredible. The magnificent visuals permeate this detailed, meditative, and moving saga of a man who self-reflects over his childhood as he makes the journey to inner peace. Its artistry is certainly appreciated. It features some scary images. It is a simple story told in a perfectly roundabout way and is wonderfully directed by Terrence Malick. If you're a close follower of cinema and/or are familiar with Terrence Malick's work, then this film certainly is recommended.</fullReview>

A poetic and artistic expression. A celebration of life. The frailty of it. The inherent divinity of all life, put into a cosmic perspective. It's a movie of love and loss. Of finding peace, and realizing the abundance of light shining all around us.I was deeply moved by this movie. It was a total surprise.Thank you for this experience. An absolute masterpiece.

		<fullReview>Life, what does one make of it? What is it about? Where will it go at the end of time? The Film explores these questions in the form of captivating Imagery.Terrence Malick is known for his ability to capture hauntingly beautiful images of simplest of things, he used this ability with precision in all his earlier Films but in The Tree of Life he uses this craft for not just showing the beauty of things around us, he uses it o take us on a journey through the beauty of life, through Love and Laughter, through hate and suffering, through the heart of the almighty himself.A family of five living in a lovely home, A gentle Mother, A strict Father and three sons who are troubled by his Father commandments. The eldest one is troubled the most for he has just entered Adolescence and his father has been desperately trying to show him better path which he does not like, even his troubles are portrayed with serenity and this serenity is the Film's heart and mind. The mother tries to be gentle with the kids but never goes against her beloved husband. Through this extremely similar troubles every family has at one or other point of life they talk to the almighty, some asking questions about existence and some for favors of extinction, this almighty who resides in infinite darkness as a speck of colorful light answers by taking us on a journey through the cosmic sea and then through the land before time ( The Land Before Time is the prehistoric period.) showing how life was born, how it ended, how it began again and how all of life is connected like branches of a Tree. All of this happens happened in the past and this past is recollected by a man who is mourning someone's loss, he too asks questions about how he lost that someone.A Cinematographic Achievement, The Tree of Life is entitled something more than that, something as beautiful as itself. There isn't a single frame in the Film that you won't cherish, there isn't a single moment that won't fill your heart with pleasure. If you are fascinated by poetry beyond your understanding and this is the Film you will grow to Love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's difficult to comment on The Tree of Life because it's designed to be indigestible. There's so much that stuffed into two hours of film, the evolution of the Earth, faith, grief, domestic issues, it's hard to make sense of it in words, though the emotional experience sums it up perfectly in your heart. Terrence Malick is what gets The Tree of Life to the places it needs to be; his direction is what the film relies on to make sense. Brad Pitt is first-rate and Jessica Chastasin got nominated for the wrong film in 2011. Obviously, it's a dividing film, but the two areas everyone can enjoy are the cinematography and film score. The images projected to us are out of this world, or at best, the purest images the Earth has to offer. The photography is beautiful, each shot capturing a metaphor or symbolism of some kind. The film could be described as visual poetry and the music used to capture the experience is like an operatic reading of the Bible. I can't say I understood everything I saw in The Tree of Life, but maybe that's the point...we don't know everything about the world. The Tree of Life never comes out and tells us what it wants us to think; it's not even about faith per say, it's just about the way we view the world. Everything about this world is tied together in some way. It's up to us, as individuals, to decide what is means.Rating: 9/10Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick's Mirror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky's SOLARIS was supposed to be the "Russian 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY." With THE TREE OF LIFE Terrence Malick attempts an American version of Tarkovsky's MIRROR, complete with main character in sterile present reflecting on his tough-idyllic childhood, classical music, voice-over narration, fractured narrative, total indifference to conventional storytelling, excessive water imagery, and even a levitating mother. The difference is that Tarkovsky attempts a very tricky balancing act and nails it, while one feels Malick straining for every effect: add more poetry to that cake, there's not enough poetry! I've had problems with all of Malick's films since his return to filmmaking after post-DAYS OF HEAVEN silence; all of them have brilliant moments but none seems quite finished. Supposedly THE THIN RED LINE's original cut was five hours, and it shows: the film, terrific as it can be, feels like large chunks were sawed out of it and replaced by redneck poetry voice-over ("What is this thing, War?" and the like). Same goes for THE NEW WORLD, also with moon-struck whispered dialog that edges dangerously close to 15 year-old girl poetry, and THE TREE OF LIFE, which is worst of all in its silly murmured philosophizing, its shapelessness, its awful solemnity, and its obsession with being "poetic" at all times to the extent that it begins to make one ill: all these poetic panning shots and sweeping classical music come to nauseate. But even if I don't find them entirely successful THE THIN RED LINE and THE NEW WORLD have grown on me with further viewings; I've seen TREE OF LIFE twice now and it has not. I suspect that Malick's films are just going to get more overreaching and bombastic - sometimes it's a good thing when the producer takes the film out of the director's hands and insists on giving it shape - which is a shame, because he really is the closest thing to a Great American Filmmaker currently living, and the TREE OF LIFE, for all its many misjudgments (the National Geographic special a third of the way through is wonderful, but belongs in another movie; Sean Penn's character, who could have given the film emotional resonance, is left to wander around aimlessly looking wounded throughout the picture) should at least get some credit for its lunatic ambition. Still, if this is what passes for great art these days...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defies easy description, a moody, visual depiction of turmoil in one's life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very curious movie, for most of the middle of it focuses on a family in Waco, Texas in the 1950s. Parents and three boys. I can relate, I was a boy in the 1950s myself and all the things the boys here do are the same things I did at that age, growing up in a small Louisiana town.But it is sandwiched by scenes in modern time, in fact shot in downtown Houston, including the same buildings I used to frequent for work and lunch. The character in those modern scenes is the eldest son as a 60-something business man, seemingly unhappy with his life.Then there is the fairly lengthy section of the film which simply uses images, fantastic images from such sources as the Hubble telescope, deep space explorer images of the planets, National Geographic images of strange creatures in the sea, and so on. There is no explanation for this section of images, except it perhaps is supposed to represent a theme in the movie stated early on in a 'voice-over', in life we have two choices, to choose NATURE or to choose GRACE. A spiritual point, and the choice directs your energies.In the 1950s part of the film it seems that the mother chooses GRACE in the way she treats her children, her husband, and others. The father seems to have chosen NATURE, represented in how he goes to work, talks about his travels, and imposes a very rigid set of rules on his boys. E.g. "don't call me 'dad', call me 'father'." This naturally (and gracefully) causes friction, and we assume it is why the older son grows up with an unsettled view of his place in the world.I enjoyed the film, but it takes lots of patience, for overall it moves rather slowly through its 2+ hours. Brad Pitt, who also is a producer for the film, is the 1950s father, Mr. O'Brien. His modern day oldest son is played by Sean Penn as Jack. Jessica Chastain is the 1950s mother Mrs. O'Brien.Most of the movie was filmed in communities we have become familiar with over the years, including Waco, Austin, Bastrop, Lagrange, and Smithville. That was part of my personal enjoyment of this very unusual film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first Malick film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first time I've watched a Terrence Malick film, and I must say, I've been completely blown away. I'm not sure how similar his previous work is, but I imagine this has the biggest scope of any of his films (because I'm not sure any film I've seen has a scope as big as this).To me The Tree of Life is an attempt to capture an entire 'human' life from start to finish, and it's a grand attempt. It's as though Malick is trying to show us the entirety of Jack's memories, and because of that, people can take away a lot of different things.Now I know it doesn't actually show the entirety of Jack's life, or even any large part of his adult life, so how can this film attempt to capture an entire human life if it only focuses on childhood? Well I think this was the point of the mother's views on love. She said 'The only way to be happy is to love. Unless you love, your life will flash by'. In my opinion this line was the core of the film. We saw Jack's childhood becoming more and more turbulent, and he was feeling more conflicted between his mother and his father. My interpretation of the film is that the main memories of Jack's life are those in his childhood, when he really felt love. The film attempts to capture the most important memories of Jack's life, the only ones that counted to him, and those were all in his childhood before he lost his spiritual way.We see Jack in the modern day amidst a concrete jungle, suited, working for some company in a sterile environment. Everything his father would have hoped for. This is how we know he lost the way of his mother soon after his childhood. His life had flashed by, because he stopped loving. So really, we are seeing all of his 'human' life, Malick has skipped over everything post-childhood because they weren't 'human' parts of life. Jack had signed out of his love and became a cog like his father, just a cold, loveless man. Who travelled to the top money-wise, but kept his emotion sheltered. His life flashed by and he had no strong emotional memories apart from his childhood.Well thats my interpretation anyway, and that's only an interpretation of one aspect of the film. I think it's a human life, put to film, and in that way it's as simple as a human life, but also as intricate and complex. The film sucks you in, and if you're open minded to new cinema experiences, it can really strike a chord deep down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some over-due thoughts about "The Tree of Life"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This notion of summing up a film in one sentence is ridiculous to me. Films for the most part have many layers and giving it a one sentence or phrase to describe it is elementary. Now Tree of Life is a particular film that garners this sort of reaction because its not an easy and laid out film that you can grab some popcorn and be mindlessly whisked away because its a rare film that actually makes you think and judge what you are seeing. It's a particular piece of cinema that garners you indulging your senses and intelligence. But I can sum this film up in one sentence for those layman's out in radio land; and frankly I can do it in one word "Life". It's actually a case of Life and Death but i will address this further later on.Now how is it that people think this particular film has no coherency? When everything to understand this film; like every other film ever made, is right there you simply need to surrender to cinematic flow. Because the people who are immediately going to hate this film are the same people who ask six billion questions during a film when they need to wait and there answers will inevitably be answered if they take some intelligence and comprehension to do so. Sean Penn's character lost his brother when he was 19. This is a story taking place somewhere 30 years later. Now where people are going to get lost and Malick's ultimate flaw occurs is the fact he is working in modern times to tell parts of this story. Something Malick has never done and from the reactions of Penn and the style of film this is something Malick is not comfortable with and therefore important things that should be addressed are lost because Malick is having a hard time working in a time he is not comfortable with. Now as for Malicks blatant tangents, they do become redundant and frankly tedious after a while, but the world and life is a slow thing. He is trying to address this with the pace of the film. Malick is giving faith into audiences that that will not just be drawn off because Brad Pitt isn't on screen. If Brad wasn't in the film at all and this was a bunch of complete unknowns; would most feel differently about this film?? It's a lot like going to church; it's incredibly boring but if you pay attention you will get a story out of it, if you don't the opposite will occur. You in essence are experiencing the film through Penn's emotional comprehension of his brothers death and the ways he has to deal with this to finally make peace by realizing the complexities of life and where we came from and how much we should cherish our own life. But don't make this false case for this being a religious film because it most certainly is not. This is making a very strong case for evolution and how we need to have enlightenment through experiences through our lives because an afterlife is simply a figment of our imagination. This can be considered the most anti-religious spiritual film ever made. Because his religious elements are expressed through semi-bad people like Pitt's character. You feel for Jessica (the mother)'s character because she is the non religious and frankly sane one of the family. And its also baffling for a non coherency argument because there is just so many cliché moments littered in this film from getting fired, moving, nothing being the same after moving, turning to religion (although this doesn't help here?). It is drama at it's most pure. Bringing the souls on the lost beach is even cliché but if you actually look past it and look at the full meaning with the rest of the film, its simply something for Penn to help deal with his brother because he committed suicide himself. This sequence is is Penns subconscious right before he dies from his own life taking after years of torture he has put upon himself from his brothers death. It's a film to teach love of nature and grace and not religion and power. It needs to be remembered life is a complex thing and a film about it should not spoon feed you info you want right at this second because you should process it in your own way. Audiences has this reaction back with 2001 also and over time has been properly put into its place as one of the greatest films ever made. Will this be in the same realm as 2001 in decades to come? NO. Because this is an extremely pretentious film that tries to do too much in too short of time. I think this is one of the best films made in a very long time but does it garner it way to the top of all time; absolutely not. Because with his pompous way of trying to incorporate modern society he lost some of his cinematic narrative. This is why it will be considered great but not one of the greatest. There are flaws because of Malicks ego to try and get some things across that either needed to be expanded upon or omitted. It is nothing new to say the cinematography and performance from Brad Pitt are simply some of the greatest of all time, and the sheer brilliance of Malick putting some faith in the cinema patrons intelligence; but it needs to be remembered this film could have been even more if narrow minded audiences actually took the cinematic journey they were meant to take, and the film was a proper 4+ hours. This is a film that will probably always be talked about just not revered in the same way similar films are now. But all in all this film ultimately asks the viewer "what is life to you"??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Tree of Life (2011) C Be ready for a long, innovative, experimental, modern film presented in four parts. (1) A 1950's family suffers a serious loss. (2) Spectacular cinematography signifying creation and evolution suggests that we live in a world full of hardship and pain (3) Brad Pitt plays an abusive father who tries to show his son how to meet hardship in the longest section of the film. (spoiler alert: stop here) The father only succeeds in making his wife and son miserable. (4) Sean Penn plays the unhappy grown man. Church scenes show meaningless religion. Quasi religious amen singing ends the film. Those who think life is mostly pain and struggle can relate to this tragedy, The film got some good reviews and made its budget. However I don't agree that life sucks. I hope some day unhappy people like those in this film may may join the majority of the population who believe in a loving God.(May 2012)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie of all time!If my first choice of 2010s movie is Boyhood (2014), the second choice is The Tree of Life (TTOL). Both of them talk about childhood. Although Boyhood is better than TTOL in my opinion, but TTOL has the better energy and made me cry.I knew why this film is too underrated in IMDb (6.7/10) although it had the positive ratings by critics. It looks like other psychological movies like 2001 or Easy Rider. If you don't like this movie, I sure you can't love 2001, Big Lebowski, Blade Runner, Easy Rider...Tree of Life is the story of your life!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for everyone, but then what is?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, nobody pretends to like a movie you don't like just to seem smart on the internet. Anyone who thinks they're so important that strangers on the internet care about impressing them is a pretentious narcissistic egomaniac who deserves no more time or thought than a squashed bug.I understood when I was about 7 years old that not everyone enjoys the same things, that what was a good fun movie for me might not be as enjoyable for a friend AND THAT WAS FINE! Seems strange to have to point this out to adults on the internet, but there is no right answer, no perfect movie that everyone will love, no superior tastes in movies.I first saw Tree of Life in the theatre. I enjoyed it but admit I didn't understand a lot of it. What were the dinosaurs doing? Why was she floating by that tree? How did the son die? I rented it from the library on DVD and loved it, made me cry in a good way. Maybe I still don't understand it completely, but I doubt many of us understand anything completely.I often enjoy movies/films others don't. I don't need a typical story arc or a tidy conclusion to the movies I watch. I've seen most Bella Tarr movies more than once and enjoy very slow moving plots with images that stay on the screen for a long time. That doesn't make my movie taste superior to anyones, nor am I claiming it does. Only pointing out how vastly different peoples taste in movies can be.For me this movie pointed out something I believed for a long time. God can't micromanage our lives, for God we're all here for so short a time, and it's so inconsequential that it would be like us taking time to consider the toils and tribulations of a fruit fly (IMO of course).Like most movies, I encourage people to see it for themselves and make up their own mind. It might be helpful to know beforehand that it won't have a neat conclusion or a typical story arc. I would distrust anyone who says 'Don't waste your time on this movie', they're assuming everyone else's taste in movies is similar to theirs which is a childish assumption that I overcame at the age of 7.Give it a try, make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I'm comparing, too. And I felt more than a little bliss while watching this movie. Most at about 22 min - while listening to Elzbieta Towarnicka's voice.It reminded me of Tarkowski. And it went further - no wonder, more than a generation later.I have great expectations on art. I feel conversant with the chosen music, the chosen images of what telescopes captured from the space, it feels the same as in the caves of Lascaux. It entertains me in the right way - no distractions, the right way to compound something to show with awareness of what time I need to understand. Malick's showing simply fits to me. He shows some people - and begins the "storytelling" half an hour later. No wedding nor war or "love scenes", simply some smile and tenderness. Very free and easy :-) As already seen in "The New World" Mr. Malick shows in "The Tree Of Life", how thoughts and acting are connected. Somewhere I read, that an adult human being has more than 30.000 thoughts every day. Neither it's possible to be aware of them all nor to communicate them with spoken or written language. So if I want to get in contact I have to chose carefully. And I have to learn how to chose. This is one point where Malick went light years further from Tarkowski."So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them." Who ever the creator is or was - Turn off the sound and watch...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Fun to Think/Talk About Than to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: Okay, I'm about to pitch the perfect movie to you. Seriously, there's no way you can screw up this pitch. Are you ready? Here it is: Brad Pitt and Dinosaurs. But not in the same scene. That would be ridiculous. Don't be ridiculous. No, Mr. Pitt and these dinosaurs exist millions of years apart from each other, but they're still in the same movie. The cohesiveness of the plot thread that binds them is up to you. No matter what you come up with, I'm quite confident that you will make a winner for me.The marketing for this film was spot on. A potential viewer could watch the trailer 100 times on loop and have the same knowledge of what happened as someone who actually saw the movie. Another potential viewer could just stare at the movie poster for two and a half hours and understand as much of the plot as I do. Okay, maybe that's a slight exaggeration. But I stress the word slight. Like, to the extreme. There's really very little embellishment there. I could talk about this movie, at length, around someone who's never seen it, and I wouldn't have to worry about ruining it for them.Accordingly, it really is satisfying to be able to say that I've seen it, and then talk about it in pretty much any manner I feel like. It's like I now share a special connection with the two people I watched it with, because we've all experienced something that makes very little sense. In the future, I'm confident I'll be able to make a reference to one of them that won't make any more sense to any of us than it does to anyone else, but it'll still get that knowing look in return. Maybe a smile, but more likely a scowl. Either way, it'll be special. And confusing.Did I mention there are dinosaurs?In all seriousness, Brad Pitt really must have eaten his Wheaties this year, because he does another very good job here. Portraying the great American patriarch, he sheds his generally off- color personality and goes the straight and narrow as a complex character torn between his dreams and his responsibilities. He simultaneously gives us a father figure with whom we can identify and struggle. While he's nominated for his work in Moneyball, this performance is probably more deserving of recognition, so I will gladly give that recognition here. (You're welcome, Mr. Pitt.)Cons: Is it possible for a movie to have so many non sequiturs that the plot itself becomes a non sequitur? Because I think that's what happened here. The thematic elements of the movie are constant, but the plot almost seems like an afterthought. What I said above about the trailer and poster giving as much clarity of vision as the movie itself was said with a completely straight face. The style of the movie is just one of images and impressions. Many of the images are actually quite evocative... In moderation. When they make up the bulk of the film, it becomes a bit much.I was tempted here to just start listing off some of the (many) random images shown throughout the movie (really, they're ubiquitous), but then I decided that I didn't want you to hate my review as much as a lot of people hate this movie.I've mentioned previously how I feel about movies that lack dialog. The thing is, while it makes sense in a silent film, it makes very little sense in a movie that has dialog. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "Blake, that didn't make any sense what you said just now." Welcome to The Tree of Life. Catching a theme? The point is that, yes, there is talking, which is an excellent device for advancing any plot. The problem is that the dialog in this particular movie tends to take what plot was there and tear it up and put a match to it. Most lines evoke a thought from the viewer like, "Wait, why the hell did he say that?" and, "... What does that even mean?" and, even less eloquent, "Huh?" And then most lines in the movie are, well, absent. I think there's a stretch of a solid half hour (although it feels like it's closer to an hour) at one point where no one says anything (because, as we all know, dinosaurs can't talk).Overall: While I was watching the movie, if there wasn't either Brad Pitt or a dinosaur on the screen (which was about eighty percent of the movie), I was doing some combination of furrowing my brow, scratching my head, looking at the clock, and wondering when my roommate Jeff was going to say something really angry and biting. It was definitely a restless movie watching experience. Constant mental fidgeting, trying to figure out which way was up. The funny thing is that, in hindsight, I kind of appreciate it for what it was, which is a fairly spot on impressionist representation of growing up (with daddy issues), all the while questioning existence. It is a thoroughly introspective work that (either fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your perspective) doesn't really offer any answers. Just questions. I can dig it. But then I remember the extremely painful experience of actually watching the movie, and I give it a 5 out of 10 while I hope that I never have to sit through it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful work of art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to attempt a plot outline as I saw it, I've only seen it once so I have to say that there is certain parts that remain (I think intentionally) opaque for me (i.e. - the ending). If people are critical of it for that reason that's fair enough, I would say the joy for me was the journey. The outline I will give will be in a different order to how the events happened on screen, and it's pieced together by presuming certain things based on the events of the flashbacks to young Jack's 1950's childhood, which probably make up an estimated 70-80% of the film screen time....PLOT including spoilers.The key moment is a row that Architect, adult Jack (Sean Penn) has had with his father, he's thrown an insult at him relating to the premature death (30 years or so earlier) of one of his two brothers (the middle brother) - relating to how badly he treated him/them when they were kids. We never see this row, we only see him have one short conversation on the phone, he's apologising to his Dad for a slur, miss it, and you miss a key part of he narrative, it cannot be too much longer than 10 seconds, it probably happens closer to half way through the film too.This row has sent Jack into an existential funk. He goes through the events of his life as he remembers them, or as he's been told. We see flashback memories of his childhood. He's attempting to understand, empathise, and perhaps, ultimately forgive everyone, especially himself and his father (played in flashback by a superb Brad Pitt). Why was his father so strict?, so humourless? (particularly to him, the eldest of three brothers). Jack, as a grown man is kissing goodbye to his own childhood innocence, asking himself the question, will he ever see all these people he loves so dearly again in a "heaven"?. Jack is attempting to rationalise abstract ideas of heaven, he has to make a journey based on what he and humans know in general. We see visions of universal beginnings, galaxies forming, suns, planets, the first life, dinosaurs, all indicating a rational, and navigable path from the start of everything, to him, now. He's asking himself how have we got to this point and naturally how will it end?, he's taking on board the ultimate questions of life &amp; death, he's trying to find a heaven, he wants to see his Mum, Dad, Brothers again when it's over....That's the plot, If I dwell too much on how Malick goes about producing this, and directing the actors, and the narrative tools he uses and the beautiful photography - I'll retreat into vomit inducing hyperbole.. so I wont.Lets just say that it felt like one of the best films I've ever seen, and I identified with it completely and if people don't like it, that's fair enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holy c***. That was the best LSD trip I'd seen on film. That's a compliment by the way. Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life is a beautiful take on human life and how life changes us through events and nature. Like a coming of age story mixed with 2001 and the discovery channel show, Life. It relates the childhood of Jack( adult played by Sean Penn) and his relation to his world around him, mostly through he parents (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain). This film cinematography is the best I've ever seen. Period. The special Effects are amazing and can see the work done to make them and why there was such a delay in the release if the film. Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain give great performances and u feel ourself moved by them as you would your own parents. This touch of human emotion gives it edge over a film like 2001 and creates a whole new depth to the ideas of life. The ending was beautiful and showed the connection between humans. I can't pay enough compliments to the film. This is not for everyone. If you can't appreciate art films and the sheer magnitude of this work, then avoid it. But for everyone else, watch this and appreciate the work over 25 years in the making from one I Hollywoods most gifted directors, Terrence Malick. This film is the pinnacle of special effects and cinematography. True beauty. If people call 2001 a masterpiece, then watch this. It has more of a story and more heart than 2001. Overall beautiful. I can't say much more 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i wholeheartedly stand behind this outstanding work of film. i was completely awe-struck for like half an hour after i walked out the theater. one of my best cinematic experiences it's a necessity to applaud the directorial sense, the camera movements and positioning around the characters (you can see how specific Malick was towards the height of camera, most notably with Sean Penn as Jack). amazing cinematography, art direction, score and acting. but the film didn't allow any of its actors to provide extraordinary performances, mainly because the film is much bigger in vision than its characters, and since there is no plot, the acting work as a continuous unfolding/evocation of memories and emotions. i can't say how much of the actual film was scripted, but i give much credit to the writing, though.so many beauty in this film, i couldn't begin to point it out. the special effects, i thought were amazingly, and it's great to see how much creativity went through that whole process since Malick doesn't like computer generated special effects..i went to see this with a couple of friends who are fairly casual movie watchers, and they loved the film so much. they praised mostly the poetic, personal and emotional side to it. that's a testament to the wide accessibility of the film. i was equally engaged in those virtues as well, it's quite admirable how the film evokes much of the viewer's own memories and feelings into the whole experience (the complexity of one's relationship with his family members, the ever-growing understanding of life, contact with the tragedy of death..). but in the grand scheme of it, as a preliminary interpretation of mine, the essence of the film is the experience/meditation of human life amid the God created cosmos, incorporating nature and grace, since i think man is a mixture/exists in both. the final scene represents finally letting go of nature and giving oneself over to grace..The Tree of Life is film that's gonna stay with me for a long time, it's poetic, gorgeous, personal, philosophical, emotional, ambitious.. the film dares to go to great lengths to reach the medium's potential, and it doesn't fail in doing so</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something happens in an interval of our lives and haunts us forever. We don't even need to think about these particular chain of events but they're there every moment and they affect our decisions and sometimes obscure them. The Tree of Life is a cinematic experience about that dim feeling. Although film is mostly shot during daylight its uncertain nature is still there. I suspect this is because we are exposed to so much detail just like young Jack we didn't ask for.Film doesn't take a conventional editing style but rather follows adult Jack's thoughts on a sad day; his brother's death anniversary. Film's story implicitly suggests that his brother's death was somehow related to their childhood years which they spent together. These days were mostly spent in a neighborhood where they can play long hours during a day under the authority of a cynic father who takes life as some serious business which according to him takes fierce and will to become successful and a mother who sees things differently. She suggests that one should take the way of grace which involves not taking the joy of goodness out of the picture no matter what we are dealing with. Because once we do, we are destined to come to a bad end. These ideas certainly creates the conflict in Jack's mind and this conflict is portrayed under a generous sun which lets us see every detail the characters encounter. Film's shots are incredible cinematographic achievements not only due to their beautiful visuals but also as a tool which lets us relate experiences and their eventual consequences in characters' lives. Film introduces itself with a prologue and closes with a resolution scene both of them, again, with incredible visuals. Audience might find it hard to grasp these scenes not only because film's narrative style but also because numerous visual references used. In my opinion , the prologue lets us see how nature and grace are intertwined within the fabric of reality.What about the resolution Jack finds at the end of the day? I am not going to write in detail what I see and certainly it depends on the personal experience but let me just say that the whole experience we had in the prologue on a cosmic scale is reflected in a single human being's life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick's long journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tree of Life alternates between an episode of Nova with volcanoes, great balls of fire and a misplaced animated dinosaur sequence and a family in 1950's America. Brad Pitt is the conflicted father of three sons trying his best to raise his children as a stern disciplinarian with touches of affection. Jessica Chastain is Pitt's wife and the mother of the three boys. Malick's style is very unstructured and he uses long periods with no one speaking and when Chastain speaks, it is in a low whisper over loud background music. The director may be trying to be profound but I found this device to be extremely annoying.Sean Penn is the grown son of Pitt's character and he has very little to say throughout the film, often looking at the camera with a look of someone suffering from a severe bout of indigestion. This is a complete waste of one of the best actors working today.The high point is the three brothers growing up together. Like the adolescent boys in "Stand By Me" it brings back memories to anyone with a similar family background. My problem is the way in which Malick jumps back and forth between the kids and Penn's non-verbal, too infrequent appearances.The film feels very long and drawn out and without giving it away I found the final scene to be very silly. The best part of the movie is the cinematography which will surely win an Oscar. The editor should have cut this opus by at least 20 minutes. If you are a very patient viewer, maybe this will be a satisfying experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>4 stars? taking LSD is a better investment of time. So now I need to add ten lines of text just so I can post this -to reinforce what a terrible waste of time this movie is. It has no redeeming value and anybody who believes that this is a deeply spiritual and moving movie should probably go end their lives now to allow themselves to embrace the spiritual journey of death. I can only hope I've typed enough for this review to register as a warning to others not to waste their time. Still not enough, OK - everything about this was disturbing ,the randomness of it , the inaudible whisperings ( which must have been the awe inspiring aspect of this movie that somehow alluded me.) I believe one more line should fulfill the requirements of a minimum ten line review to state unequivocally how much this movie sucked, and sucked the life out of me. Oh wait, it's ART. .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually stunning film that isn't pretentious, just trying to get a new look on movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't want to change anyone's opinion, but that doesn't mean I am going to hold in mine. I thought this was a beautiful film that contains ways of life and doesn't only hold a story, but shows us that we are living in a world that is more exquisite than we think. Sure, Terrence Malick could have gone without all of the scientific images, but you know what? It is HIS movie, not our's. He can do whatever on earth he wants to, and because of that, he was nominated for best director, and the film was nominated for best picture. The story was phenomenal as well. I thought Jessica Chastain's free-spirited character and Brad Pitt's angered and old fashioned character fit together perfectly. All in all, I thought that this film was beautiful, freeing, and an amazing way to create a vision of this world!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully Acted, Beautifully Shot, And Has A Strong Idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really didn't know what I expected from myself after watching The Tree Of Life. Would I be satisfied? Would I think it's pretentious? Would it's ambition satisfy me? Could it still hold it's ground on subsequent viewings? The answer to all those questions is yes.This Tree of Life was written by Terrence Malick. This would be my second film from him, the first being The Thin Red Line, and I came into this not with high hopes as others have dismissed the film as dull and I didn't find The Thin Red Line as interesting in it's story and the questions that was being asked (granted I have only seen the film once, so it my opinion may change in the future). This film gave me hope in Malick and that his work does have value. The Tree of Life tells the story, though not linearly, of this nuclear family from Austin, Texas and also in the middle of the story is the painting of the creation of light. The film's plot doesn't scream engaging on paper but once it starts, it's hard to stop as the film asks questions that makes the audience reflect on. The film discusses the existence and role of god to us on a personal level and also at the big picture. It may be hard to engage to this film in a spiritual level if one is not in touch with religion but if one has understanding of science and the development of life from the big bang, this film explores that too. The bulk of the film explores the growth of Jack, the eldest son, and this is where I connected the most as so much of what happens throughout his childhood is empathetic. My childhood may not be exactly the same as his but the idea and logic is the same. This is where the film has made a huge impact on me, as countless times it has made me reflect on myself, past and present, and see which path am I headed. The only issue I have with this film is that Sean Penn's adult Jack was very underused.Terrence Malick's direction here is passionate. The man has taken emotions, values, ideas, logic, philosophy and love, from which I assume he has experienced, into this film. The film feels very personal, in particular the arc with Jack's childhood. Malick has not chosen a side, religion or nature, in this film but rather explore both and show how it has impacted their son who has grown up embracing both. The film's pacing may be slow and tiresome for some people but if one puts their whole selves into it then they will be guaranteed an experience that would probably change their perception of life.The first thing I noticed about The Tree of Life, was that the film is absolutely stunning. It's beautiful from start to finish, and the credit goes both to Malick and the film's cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki. I have not seen Malick's other post-Thin Red Line films so this is the first time I have seen a Malick-Lubezki film, but I have seen his photography on films like A Series of Unfortunate Events, Cat In The Hat, and judging from the trailer I saw from the upcoming film Gravity, he knows how to the film's image look iconic and stylish. In this film he uses a lot natural light and this creates a more naturalistic effect. The footage from the 50's in this film feels like a gorgeous picture perfect moment on a home video. It brings the audience in like we're part of the family and that we can feel what they're going through. The scenes that show the creation and development of life is more of a showcase of special effects. I think it is an amazing triumph, it feels like something off a documentary but at the same time it still retains this cinematic quality that make the scenes even more gorgeous.The film's score is composed by Alexandre Desplat who has worked on films like Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, Moonrise Kingdom (a personal favorite of mine), Ides of March, and Argo. His work here is definitely a treat, when the score comes on whether it's on the scene with the cells or the scenes where Pitt and Chastain are just lying down on the grass, it definitely catches my attention. The score fits to what Malick is trying to show us. The score at times has this aura of spirituality which I liked, as it made the connection between the family and god all the more stronger.The acting in this film is not what I call groundbreaking, as these actors are not portraying roles that will show off the highest of their abilities. These characters are something that everyone has; a father, a mother, a family. These characters are therefore simple yet true and personal. Every actor in this film shines, in particular Pitt and Chastain. Both have fantastic chemistry and has created something that people can empathise and connect with. There were times that Pitt has made me think about my own dad being strict and Chastain similarly to my mother speaking about religion. The children; McCracken, Eppler, and Sheridan; were great and they seem to have great chemistry and we buy that they are brothers. Sean Penn was decent in this and didn't really have a lot to work with but this is due to the film not utilizing his character to it's potential.The film overall has made an impact on me and definitely be something i will keep coming back to whenever I need to search myself. The film is wonderfully acted, beautifully shot and has a strong idea. This film is something that will have people come back to later on and discover it's appeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Few Meaningful Films Shot Recently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not saying that I enjoyed the movie, but I think it is one of the most valuable and meaningful films made these years.I did fall in sleep few times during my first time watch this movie. I think it's boring, meaningless and even a little painful to watch... Why did Malick put so much effort on this family's daily life? How does all these relate to the universe and nature?I decided to re-watch it when I accidentally saw the movie was showed on TV one day. I was so attracted by the visual and music. The cinematography and music in this film is simply amazing.Although I'm not a Christian and a God believer, this movie brings me into the family point of view with all the "boring" family life. Malick created a relation between the family and me-- to fell their pain of losing the youngest brother, and to feel how each of them struggled in life. Isn't life like watching this film? Boring and painful but at the same full of magnificentness. (How life is created and diminished.) It's not only a religious film, but also a film questions and defines "life". Instead of watch two/three crappy Hollywood movies, it defiantly worse you to watch twice or three times and think about what it is about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully filmed...has the director's musical stamp on it as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin, Director Terrence Malick films the scenes and juxtaposes images. At times there is an incongruity. There are interesting visuals of a forest, the beginning of time, and references to biological and biochemical interactions.The story itself, Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt) as an ordinary working man in Waco, Texas in the 1950's with three sons to raise. His wife, portrayed by Chastain, does a good portrayal here of the mother, at times oppressed, at times happy and joyful just to have her children, especially when Dad is away trying to get his creative patents (which never come to fruition).The authentic era of the 1950's is re-visited here, with elaborate music score and visuals. We see the mother hanging laundry outside on the clothesline. We see a small town where people dress formally just to go to the general store, and war veterans returning from World War II. We see the children playing in a seemingly idyllic American town, running under sprinklers, playing with dogs, chasing after a city truck spraying DDT randomly.There is a sadness to the family story. Jack the oldest has ongoing conflicts with his father, and at first is consumed with anger for being disciplined. A father who is rigidly following the dogma of an "American Dream" in some sense.Brad Pitt is believable in this role. Understated, but a strict religious man who believes God will provide as long as you go to work everyday and are a 'good man'. However even his 10 year old son sees the hypocrisy. The father may take them to church and explain the preacher's interpretations of Job and biblical references of material loss. Yet at the same time he drives the boys through well-to-do areas, coaching them on how they must succeed, and be hardened to 'get ahead' in America.There are many nuances to the film, it needs to be viewed more than once, and granted the underlying themes are subtle.The ending has visuals with references to, opening doors, entering gates of consciousness. As "adult Jack" Sean Penn is the embodiment of a boy's journey to himself.The music is Brahms, and tells the unveiling of one boy's life, with references to incipient life itself at the start of the film.This is not a film for the myopic, or any wanting concrete answers. It simply is about the reality of life, in that we are only human, a part of creation, but cannot presume to know what God wants. Or even what we ourselves sometimes want or need, until we have gone through the journey.Highly recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Macro/Micro Observation of Childhood Memories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing I was able to pick up pretty quickly was Malick's approach to the editing in this film. No edit in this film lasts more than a couple seconds. There also is very little on-screen dialogue, relying more on body language between characters. This creates a collage or montage instead of a real time presentation of events. This forces the audience to make a more abstract theme of the narrative, such as paging through a photo album of childhood memories. So the film as a composition does not feel experimental, we are not challenged in that respect. I love good cinematography, and this film should not only win an Academy Award for it, but also should be hailed as one of the best photographed movies ever.I read both positive and negative reviews of this film, wondering if there was a line Malick may have crossed in being too 'artsy'. This feeling may possibly come across as we witness the beginning of life on our planet through the dinosaurs. We supposedly can make the connection to the main subject as we freely interpret it. Or maybe not, since there are tell-tale snippets of narration supplied by the characters. I was kind of having a "Blade Runner" flashback, where narration was used a little too bluntly to hopefully keep the future world understood by the audience. Consensus over time was that the narration just got in the way of enjoying the experience, and letting yourself provide the narration. The spell Malick puts you under with the flashes of "moments" is interrupted by a question "where were you?' or the like. The music, mostly classical, provides enough cohesion to let the highlights of growing up fuse together into a greater whole. The flashes into the present help weigh the impact of time and space from what was the innocence of childhood. Better yet, is the absence of any cliché resolution between Dad and son, or a big revelation on a deathbed. As for the 'finale', here we have to allow Malick to take us into the surreal (represented by a metaphorical 'doorway'), and present his imagination's vision of - something. It could be heaven, it could be the blissful cocoon we visit in our mind where we still can experience love, or a greater idea of what going to church represents. Again, nothing breakthrough in concept, and Malick doesn't get too phantasmagorical in it's imagery. But he does unashamedly borrow from Kubrick, as we watch the sun break over the floating planets with triumphant music. Again, something that for me was unnecessary in the understanding of the central theme, and almost felt like it was superfluous. He also ventures into David Lynch territory with some odd fantasy imagery.These things are easily digestible, however, as Malick wisely doesn't make this an epic 3 hour challenge to your attention. Even so, there were a couple extra pats on a shoulder, hugs, and the like that felt a little repetitious. But again, these are petty observances that do not take away from the pleasurable experience I had. Except for the venue, that is. The theatre I went to was the only place around that was showing it, and the sound system was blown out. The seats were uncomfortable and the sight lines were bad. I hope this film catches on so it can expand into a state-of-the-art venue it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting attempt, but ultimately bland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off with, let me say that I admire the attempt and it's always interesting to see filmmakers try to break away from the norm, but the risk you take with that is missing your mark. I know that he was not trying to make a film with a traditional narrative or a clear storyline, and that's admirable, but the ultimate result didn't sit well with me.The cinematography is gorgeous, and the acting reasonably good, but the writing is almost nonexistent and the characterization struggles. He is too unbalanced with the portrayal of the parents for them to be sympathetic (she too much of a doormat, he too much of a tyrant), but not thorough enough to make them realistic. I liked some of the ways they decided to compose the shots. Showing Sean Penn's character in a city full of sharp angles and massive buildings as opposed to the open spaces and gentle curvature of his surroundings as a child and all the shots taken through doorways were nice, but not ultimately worth the almost three hours I had to invest in muddy dialog and unconvincing accents to get to them.This movie will very much be some people's cup of Darjeeling (I've heard it described as genius and a masterpiece), others will find it incomprehensible. I'm somewhere in the middle: I admire the filmmaker and its spirit, but don't think it's that great in the final analysis. I'm glad it has its audience. I'm also glad that I'm not part of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To those who seek deepness,meaning or a feeling in every single ridiculous scene that has nothing to do with the story: Give me a break!! The movie started off alright. At the beginning I didn't even mind documentary-like scenes. After a point it gets really boring and exhausting to keep the track of the views and thoughts I assigned for each object, picture and sound that I observed. Then I started to ask myself the following questions: 1)Why am I being extremely tired to fully understand a movie? 2)Does that make a movie great? 3)Why am I constantly feeling the urge to yell at the actors and actresses and make them start talking? 4)Am I seeing a freaking dinosaur? Questions got odder as the movie progressed. After the dinosaurs I had lost my attention already. My purpose had changed to 'finish the movie to see what happens'. Nothing happened literally. Again figuratively a lot happened. I would appreciate the movie if ,I think was excessive, documentary-like scenes were less. Ethereal mood and music of the movie worked well for me. I do not regret watching it.I may call it,despite my low vote,a different experience,</fullReview>

Just hanging in there waiting for the big hit. But it never happens. I'm sure members of the academy are clapping each other on the back and stroking some egos, but people who go to see this movie because of Brad Pitts previous performances are sure to be disappointed.

		<fullReview>If you're standing at the Redbox, and remember this title from the previews on another disc you rented, you might think - "huh. I remember some nice photography, and Brad Pitt was in it, wasn't he?" STOP RIGHT THERE.Don't waste your $1.20. YES, I am educated. YES, I watch 'arty' films. NO, I'm not an Adam Sandler or Harold &amp; Kumar fan. What I am, is honked off.There should be a gigantic and obvious warning on this movie: 1. The film you are about to mistakenly rent is a Terence Malick film and 2. There is no plot whatsoever, random Nature interludes, and ZERO resolution at the endSure, the little boys were great, and the fictional depiction (no matter that there was no explanation for what was going on or why we were with them) of life 'back then' conjured up remembrances of childhood. Other than that, pure dreckitude. I have no idea what Sean Penn was even doing in this movie, and because he looks to be about 50 in his scenes, it's hard to tell if he was meant to represent one of the boys, all grown up. If so - where are the other brothers? There's a telegram notifying us all (MILD spoiler; so don't bitch about it, it's in the opening 10 mins.) that someone has died, but we never find out who. If it was one of the brothers, we're still missing one in the present tense. Note to the writer/director: If the title of your film is The Tree of Life, and you have some characters (supposedly and symbolically) PLANT A DAMN TREE in their front yard - have the courtesy to reference it again just even ONCE later in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an emotional experience, and enjoyable as poetic expression, but nonsensical as a story-telling film. It comparable to an unusual and non-realistic dream rather than a realistic experience.Now a dream is disorganized, illogical and emotionally expressive compared to real waking life. A good artistic production incorporates dream imagination into a coherent and realistic structure - a blend of poetry with prose so to speak.This movie fails in being too much of a dream with too little coherence and logic. It is enjoyable as a kaleidoscope of sights and sounds but that is not enough for me to enjoy it.Terry Gilliam's "Brazil" (1985) is an example of dream elements molded skillfully with some logic and coherence. Fellini's "And the Ship Sails On" (1983) is another example of dream elements molded with even more logic into a skillful artistic production. "Tree of Life" just doesn't qualify as good art for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Experience Full of Wonder: Watching Life Happen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE TREE OF LIFE is not the usual film - a story that begins, develops, and ends. Yes there is a story here: in a small town (Waco, Texas) lives a family - a stern, painfully frustrated artist/man who can't seem to succeed in anything for long except raising three boys with his rather quiet passive wife. One of the boys dies and the remaining family enters into a realm of questioning life, both at the time of the death of the child and years later through the experiences of the oldest boy reflecting on the meaning of life, his response to his father, his sense of continuing loss. The setting is in the 1950s - that structureless decade following the horrors of WW II, the unleashing of the atomic bomb, the difficulties of making a living and sacrificing dreams for a reality in a way that changes the way individuals interact not only with outsiders but also with the family unit whose only seeming hope of meaning is relying on religious protocol. Yet even religion seems to fail when the inexplicable tragedy of an innocent child's death changes everything. The journey of the film is the maturing of the eldest son as he grows into a man forever challenged by the meaningless of the loss of his brother and the effect that has on his own maturation.The power of the film is in the visual and auditory miracles that unfold on the screen. Writer/director Terrence Malick (Days of Heaven, The New World, The Thin Red Line, etc) has gathered images from nature - incredible rock formations, waterfalls, volcanic eruptions, floating jellyfish, night skies, and light in all its forms, among many others - and allows these images to seep into our minds accompanied by the music of John Tavener, Gustav Mahler, Aresnije Jovanovic, Zbigniew Preiser, Hector Berlioz, Gustav Holst, Bedrich Smetana, Ottorino Respighi, Johannes Brahms, Francois Couperin, Johan Sebastian Bach, Henryk Górecki, Robert Schumann, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - each work so carefully chosen that the visuals are liberated from the screen to enter our minds. It is that rare opportunity to watch creation, death, life, and the majesty of nature - none of which is understandable - and that is where the comfort source of this film touches us. The cast is committed and allows the story to enter our heads untainted; Brad Pitt is the father, Jessica Chastain is the mother, young Jack is Hunter McCracken who ages into Sean Penn, Fiona Shaw is the grandmother, and the other boys are played by Laramie Eppler and Tye Sheridan. But the real star of this glowing work of art is Terrence Malick. This film is a masterpiece of cinematic art. It needs to be seen and experienced. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully shot horrible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film after reading rave reviews about it and hearing people comparing it to Kubrick's Odyssey and Tarkovsky's Solaris. This film can absolutely not be compared to these two for any reason. Apart from the fact that every plan is perfectly shot and the cinematography in general is flawless the movie is awful. There are no characters, no philosophy, no plot line and nothing to keep the viewers interest. It seemed to me like a collage of beautiful pictures clumsily and pretentiously arranged around an excuse of a story (the father son relationship), in the hopes of making a film about everything. Apart from that, the movie is overdramatised by ethereal music and overblown whispers that come and go annoyingly often throughout the course of the film. The whole time I was feeling as if an invisible giant was shaking my shoulders and ordering me to feel something deep and moving. The film manages to sacrifice the idea of narrative without having anything to offer in return. Both Solaris and Odyssey are very concrete films, very focused on the subjects they deal with, perfectly balanced between what is said and what is implied and shot with a wonderful taste and knowledge of the language of cinema. I gave it 2 stars just because of the cinematography and the special effects . It breaks my heart to see all these resources go to waste on a film as meaningless, boring and self indulgent as this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, if you want to see some really cool Nat Geo scenes then go to the IMAX because that is what a VERY LARGE section of this movie is. Maybe there is a story here, and while not every movie needs to be a narrative with a cliché' beginning and end, there is not any type of flow or connection to the cool looking but non-effective placement of the nature/nice acid trip scenes. It is, as others have said, a pseudo- intellectual wannna be kind of blow hard movie that people will talk about and act like they understand yet say things like they have to watch it over again to "really get it." We are beaten over the head with "these people had a kid and he dies and they are sad and have regrets." We get that. Repeatedly.Well not only do I not get it, I don't want to get it. I am so glad I did not make a special trip to the theater but still want my five dollar movie rental fee back from whoever is responsible for this.The dinosaur apparitions make this film outright laughable. Yes, it is awesome looking at times, but somebody ate the mushrooms and not the kind you buy legally. A good movie writer got together with someone on an acid trip and they got to film some really cool things then met up with an architect who likes Sean Penn and another nifty fifties interior decorator and a nature lover and made a movie. A stinky movie that looks really good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching the movie. It was like watching a movie with Discovery channel videos as an ad commercial. basically there is no story, even if there was it could have been narrated in a straight way, rather than going back to Dinosaur days or outer space.There could have been proper use of actors. Sean Penn and Brad Pitt, and you get a movie like this!At any point of time, you don't understand the notion of that particular scene, why did he have to show a purple colored wall? A ladder? A leaf? Suddenly you see a light! its just confusing!As person who loves watching movies, i hated every second of the movie! But, the visuals were great. They can be saved as an archive footage for the future generation to show how earth looked like. Stay away from this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly entertaining if you're high as a kite or enjoy cloud-watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never really been angry at a film before, however as I don't usually go to the cinema, rather watch everything at home, this made me seethe as I decided to finally go out and watch something for the first time in years. In simple terms - this was a waste of my time, my effort and my money.First: there was no coherent plot whatsoever. How do you judge something without a basis to be judged upon? The actors may have been brilliant, even the kids - no, especially the kids, effects may have been wonderful, even the soundtracks could be somewhat decent, and then what? If all these brilliant pieces of art come together, it's bound to be good, is it not? NO. In The Tree of Life it is not so. It's a jumbo of inconsistent images not following any laws of nature, physics, psychology or even decent film-making. The most enjoyable part of the whole movie was the more than 40 minute long episode, in which the creation of the world, volcanoes oceans etc. were shown (also barely coherently of course - it took me more than five minutes to decipher that I have seen the Big Bang, not some random space scene). It was entertaining in the sense that me and my friend began to spot dragons, faces, sheep and so on in the various fires, waters, gas... Quite like watching clouds on a summer day.Second: I admit I walked out after nearly two hours of suffering, but I think the fact that we STILL did not even know which of the three kids actually died, committed suicide or was killed, if the mother was even still alive or not - these all speak for themselves. I'm not trying to act stupid here, with some small effort, this could probably all be figured out, but hey - it was just this boring.Third: Be warned - as I was not - the movie builds upon serious religious undertones. Nearly all musings, in some form or another, deal with a character attempting to make piece with their God. It is not exactly a bad thing per se, only it does require a certain mindset.Anyways, there are a lot of deeply spiritual and moving films, that make you really think (on your existence, beliefs, past, future etc.), and if The Tree of Life was not so infuriatingly pretentious as it is, it could be one. As it is, the only word to describe it is plain weird. This is only my opinion though. Feel free to be enlightened to the meaning of life, as I'm sure a a lot of smarter people than me have already done during their viewing experience.In the meantime I recommend watching Arizona Dreams if you're looking for at least part of the above with a coherent plot, awesome actors and ingenious soundtracks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of Malick's, as any movie lover has, but holy stunning sheep stuff, this is something else. I'm a bit moved beyond words right now to go on, but this is what film making is all about.2001 has been my favorite movie since I first saw it when I was 12 - I may have a new favorite. I think it's inspired, perfect, divine. To me, movies are about images as much as words. Words are for books, images are for galleries, and movies are where they meet. As much as one admires great dialogue, it is the power of the music over the images (along with enough words to know what the tale is) that really sends me. What a beautiful thing this film is. I feel privileged to have experienced it.Thank you Terrence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really a complete waste of time. I hated this movie. And it makes me mad that I paid to see it. What little meat there is comes quite late in the film, after a long disjointed series of slow-motion nature-ish scenes, with no dialogue and only a soundtrack of somewhat classical music. I thought that at some point there would be some story emerge, but no such luck. No plot, contrived 'arty' cinematography, the film is so disjointed that it loses any meaning. This movie seems to me to be an attempt at a deep, meaningful big poignant story, and it just isn't. It is about anything. It is a soppy mess. The film assumes that the audience will be intrigued. But I was frankly insulted at what I felt was the filmmakers attempt to rigidly manipulate the reaction of the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One does not walk into Cinema Village in Manhattan to see a summer blockbuster. What I did expect was 1) a slightly coherent story, 2) interesting visuals, and 3) thought-provoking dialog and plot. What I got was "excerpts from the stock footage festival" and cryptic whispering. These tropes have been so overdone I can't even begin to fathom how this film has consistently high ratings. Its literary equivalent is "Atlas Shrugged" - people who don't know what good film is see this as "something smart people like" and have to rate it highly. The only bright spot of this film is Brad Pitt, who basically ... shows up and is Brad Pitt. Acting in this film consists of staring into the distance and thinking *real* hard. it's insipid, and I wish directors would stop assuming silence=substance. It's never clearly established which brother Sean Penn is supposed to be, or which one died. Saying that it "doesn't need to be" just underscores how unlikeable (and interchangeable) all the characters really are. The character of the mother switches between being the "manic-pixie-dream-girl" who sings and dances in the sprinkler, to being the "suffering housewife" but she's never given any chance to develop as a character. The sociopathic son is uncomfortable to watch, but not in any thought provoking way, it's just obnoxious. The two other children are interchangeable, and as I've said before - Brad Pitt is pretty much Brad Pitt in this film. Also: The visual interludes (the ones that aren't just footage off of Phil Platt's Blog, or stock footage from "Planet Earth") remind me of the Mutara Nebula from Star Trek II - and I'm pretty sure they were both filmed by dropping dye into heated water. (I'm going on the record as saying a campy Sci-Fi from the 80's was a better film than this bloated production, by the way) The dialog consists of bland, trite pronouncements to God and the dead child, whispered over B-roll and those attempts to connect the film to some greater religious truth (the film opens by quoting the book of Job) ring hallow, and the pronouncement that comes across loudly is "Don't worry, upper-middle class white Americans, god still loves you" So okay, maybe this film did provoke me to think, and elicit an emotional reaction from me: All I can think about is how angry this film made me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film is art, certainly, however, films require a central theme and some sort of purpose to hold the qualification of film.The Tree of Life felt like a 2 hour observation. I sat through it largely dis-interested hoping that the finish of the film would resonate some sort of meaning. Unfortunately, like every scene in the film, it's open to interpretation. That is the meaning, the ending, the montages of nice visuals, the characters, their actions, etc- all open to interpretation. The range of interpretations is vast, which maybe explains the critical praise and high IMDb score. For me, I was so disappointed that I signed up for IMDb just to write a bad review. WATCH- If you like father-son type films If Planet Earth visuals really appeal to you If you just have to see for yourself (might like it?) If staring off into the distance is your cup of tea Don't WATCH- If you need entertainment If you need a good finale to a story If you like clear themes in film If you need a good story</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring - to describe in one word.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrance Malick as a filmmaker has his unique style of story-telling where he takes the audience on an adventure with his narration and terrific camera work. It has to be admitted that The Tree of Life is not for everybody. It is unlike anything that you might have seen on screen. Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain deliver great performances along with Hunter McCracken.Oh! Yes! There is Sean Penn too. He, however, just wakes up and roams around watching nature and experiencing something profound and meaningful. It is known that Brad Pitt plays Terrance Malick's father when he was growing up. This feels like more of a story that he has told in order to solve his own issues or at least to discuss them within his soul. This feels something too personal to be on the screen for others to watch.The tree is life is not for everyone. I found it quite boring, with Brad Pitt standing out as an actor. Don't be surprised if he gets an Oscar nomination for this one.</fullReview>

I felt nothing for the characters or the "plot". I just kept thinking, "I get it, get on with it". After an hour this movie became painful. Many people left the theater. In the last five minutes a man bellowed out "Just end already!". Almost the entire theater began clapping and several others added yells of, "it's never going to end", and "God please let it end". Then we sat there and when the credits came up everyone was silent. Dead Silent. Then a guy screamed out, "WORST MOVIE EVER"!!!!!!!!! Practically the entire audience began cheering wildly. The AMC guy at the Oscar movie showcase got on the mic and said,"no one liked that one I take it?". People yelled no, a bunch boo'ed really loud and then someone said at least it's over then people cheered. The AMC guy on the Mic said, well some times that happens.The AMC Oscar movie showcase was full, hundreds of people, and I didn't hear a single person say one positive thing about it except a couple who said the cinematography was good. The only positive thing I have to say is, great cinematography.</fullReview>

I mean, in some aspects, this is even worse than all the previous films from that director. At least those films, despite being incredibly boring (Note: Just because a movie has a nice photography and a good soundtrack, it doesn't necessarily make it a good or interesting movie) at least had coherent plot and a linear narrative. This movie didn't have anything like that. "The Tree of Life is a pedantic, self-serving film. Sure, the visual style may look good and innovative at first (If you never saw before films such as The Qatsi trilogy or "Baraka") but not even the best visuals could make this boring film anything more than what it is: Hipster garbage, which is almost painful to sit through. The lack of plot and over-indulgence of pseudo-intellectual nonsense may help to give the "deep" feel, but it's all just smoke and mirrors, hiding any real substance. It is, in effect, "a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." (Shakespeare, "Macbeth", act 5, scene 5)This film is the definition of sheer pretentiousness. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How hard I tried to enjoy in it I simply tortured myself to see it till the end. It is hard to express everything through this journey but it was not exciting one.The Tree of Life is by my opinion pure experimental big budget movie. I believe the director puts all of his efforts to make a masterpiece, but the end he fails. The cast is very good as well is acting but...Pure artistic intentions are obvious, and with the image sequences as well the camera work you can say that it is and Art film. But the reality side of the plot and with the cast ended as an typical Hollywood attempt to enter the pure Art zone.About that beautiful cinematography and images: if you are familiar with movie Baraka you will find cinematography and images in this movie unoriginal at all.In Baraka you are touched emotionally in very strong manner. While watching this movie I was not touched nor stunned near close. The rhythm is simply too slow, forced too be complicated, yet simple. There are however very wise lines in it (Father advices to his son), but it simply looks to much American and to much forced to be the great work.So if you saw Baraka or Home before that movie you would probably find some similar almost copy like elements in this movie. If not, you will be probably astound with scenes in this one.No mater how hard it try to touch our deepest emotions with so many intentions, still the complete movie can't touch that inner heart truly. Something is not as it should be here, and the result is shallow yet visually solid movie.If you really want to ride through the essence of life, and truly feel it in any emotional sense, watch Baraka instead.</fullReview>

When I say whether I liked or disliked a movie, it all comes down to one thing, namely, would I watch it again? And here I would like to ask people who gave it a high rating: would you watch it again? Would you go through that boring stuff all over again? I didn't think so, therefore always ask yourself whether you would watch a movie a second time because you enjoyed it so much the first time... then only give the rating.

		<shortDescription>This film is excessively long. It tries to say a lot, but fails. It's a 2.5 hr waste of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like good movies, but when it comes to The Tree Of Life I feel that I MUST warn people away from it. Simply put, the film is weak and overly long. It tries ultra-hard to be profound, but it comes nowhere near achieving that goal.A rather long portion of the middle of the movie (almost 20 minutes) consists of a sequence of bizarre graphics/interstellar scenes/volcanoes/amoebas/scenes of the sea and jellyfish/dinosaurs that intends to show the history of the universe. The segment reminded me of the portion of 2001 A Space Odyssey where Dave Bowman journeys through space after entering the rectangular Black Monolith. Back in the 1960s that Kubrickian "journey via graphics" was groundbreaking. However in The Tree Of Life the theater audience I saw it with just didn't buy it. It seemed to go on forever ... interminable. The length of the movie is 2 hrs 20 mins and that's _Excessively_Long_.The overall story in The Tree Of Life wants to say a lot, but never achieves that goal. There's a family with a strict father (Pitt) that has some troubles, but mostly nothing goes on. You see the kids growing up. Other than the long sequence described in the previous paragraph this, largely uneventful, view of the family goes on for about 2 hours. During that time you're supposed to drink in how the family members interact with each other and we also see the faults/foibles of the father. This part of the film is sooo sloooow as to be glacial. I'm not looking for an action film, but please give me fewer preachy atmospherics ... cue low volume choir. No joke - the film is full of choral music. It's like a cross between the lullaby effect of Gabriel Faure's Requiem and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir singing softly.In the final 12 minutes of the film we see one of the sons grown up (Penn). As I recall this character has no spoken lines. During most of this segment we see inter-cuts of strange scenes that we can't figure out ... like both the young and old characters of the son walking through the desert together or a field of sunflowers. I swear ... that's the whole friggin' "story" told by this film. IT'S JUST WEAK! It tries to be huge, but the results are puny.On the other hand, the cinematography in the film is quite superb. In this respect it reminds me just a touch of The Man Who Fell To Earth (1976 with Bowie) which also had nice imagery but, again, the story was confused and didn't readily come across. If you love this film then check out that 1976 film.In spite of the heavy duty casting the acting is only just OK because there's not enough of a story here to work with to make the acting really resonate. It's not the fault of the actors. It's because the film is 95+ percent atmospherics.The theater audience I saw this film with was quite disappointed and they were surprisingly vocal about it. This happened in a rather liberal suburb of a large east coast city. That's an audience that is usually pretty easy going and accepting of unusual stuff. How on earth did this film get such a high rating on IMDb? The film wants to say volumes, but the communication here is quite muffled. It doesn't deliver the goods and thus the huge acting talent is squandered. Avoid this film. It's not worth investing time here.</fullReview>

Another bloated, over produced try at being an art film. The only time the film was interesting was some of the nature and macro footage, particularly, the volcanoes. Just too literal a story line. I figured out where the film was going in the first 30 minutes and the ending, trivial and commercial. I should have of known better. If there are big Hollywood personalities, it going to be some insipid story line that is palatable to the average reality program consuming viewer. Need I say more? Just don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the reviews before deciding to watch this.Long story short- I made it through 30 minutes and turned it off.I have to say- the visual imagery is impressive, but the whole losing a loved one/questioning God and the misery and grieving and whispering narration was more than I could take.BTW- it's a pet peeve of mine when the narration or dialog is a whisper you can barely hear- then the next scene is so loud it shatters your damned eardrums. I hate sitting there with the remote and pressing volume up/volume down constantly.Hell-oooo- haven't you film makers ever heard of "Normalize"? It IS possible to compress the dynamic range of the soundtrack so it doesn't have this flaw.I wonder how the "critics" rated this? It always seems that critics rate mind numbing BS like this as work of genius. I think it's a case of "The Emperors New Clothes" with them.If you want to watch a film for it's imagery, do yourselves a favor and skip this one.I instead recommend the film "Koyaanisqatsi" which is technically a documentary, but is hard to describe. There is no dialog, and no narration. It's a stunning series of video montages that you can't tear your eyes away from. It's set to a score by Phillip Glass, and best watched on a big screen TV with a decent sound system.I may try and watch this again. Then again, I may not, because it's no loss if I don't.</fullReview>

Too bad, that I already seen all those stellar constellations, solar systems, sunsets, waves, etc. on various documentary channels.Funny thing is, that I can't comment acting.. because, again, there isn't any acting -literary.There will be some, pretending recognizing "the truth" in the movie.. being on some kind of spiritual trip while watching it.

Now in saying this, I am not ranking it against truly bad "movies", the kind of cinematic endeavors, with their no-name casts, that you know are bad and, therefore, have no expectation for (even though such movies can occasionally be so bad that they later become mildly enjoyable cult hits). No, the Tree of Life, with a cast headed by two marquee actors (Brad Pitt and Sean Penn), aspires to be a "film", which I define as a cinematic endeavor starring well-regarded actors and actresses, with great story lines and also often containing thought-provoking, emotionally moving messages.As a "film", the Tree of Life is horrible (actually it's even horrible as a "movie"). It has no plot. It has no direction. It has no acting per se. It runs over two hours and defies human endurance to sit through in its entirety, although we did, just to make sure we didn't miss anything. Critics have called it "beautiful", "majestic", "poetic". It is none of these things. It is just two hours of mind-numbing torture that makes water-boarding seem pleasant. Even the cinematography is nothing special. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park are much better and if a bunch of computer-generated graphics (perhaps to simulate a bad trip on acid?) are supposed to be "beautiful" then I'm not sure I know what the definition of that word is.There is a reason why many theaters running the Tree of Life had to post written warnings at their ticket windows telling patrons that no refunds would be given when you realized you had just wasted a lot of money and two hours of your life. Any critic, and apparently there are some, who includes the Tree of Life in his or her "10 best list" for 2011 needs to find a new profession. Avoid the Tree of Life at all costs. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would love to have given this movie a negative infinity score to take the average down a bit (at time of writing it was 7.2 out of 10). This is a complete mystery for a film to achieve such a great rating and be SO POOR. I could not hear anything apart from the music, which was lovely. The imagery was beautiful and the cinematography brilliant. However, i could only stomach 27 minutes and 35 seconds of this self indulgent clap trap. A movie is supposed to be entertaining and interesting. This lost me from the moment I couldn't hear what the actors were saying. Utter cr@p.Very bad. Don't hire it, or even consider recommending it to anyone.Poor.Rubbish.I want to go outside and scream at my neighbours in frustration.Deary me.</fullReview>

The only thing that saved the evening was the girl behind me asking for a gun when the movie ended!

		<fullReview>I agree that movies are a form of art and that this fact has been forgotten by many directors and viewers but one should understand that there are two types of art forms , one is art that makes sense and stands out as being intelligent and creative and entertaining at the sametime , other category is senseless art , remember going to a painting exhibition and looking at a painting that does not makes any sense at all but still has a high price and some weird guy comes along and buys it and you wonder what an idiot he is and you could have painted better , its just that the weird guy bought it for the only reason that it didn't make sense to you and it caused all the people like u and me wonder what the hell it was , this is what it is , senseless art , even if this movie would have made some sense out of all what was shown I would have given it a straight 10 , unfortunately it didn't , just an attempt to inculcate an artistic way of story telling into mainstream movies which has actually done more harm to art than good , critics can give it good reviews but something like this is not worth your time and money until and unless it makes some sense and has a proper meaning that would touch you emotionally</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy to dislike, but unlike anything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think there will be many reviews on here that are 5 stars out of 10, for the simple fact that the majority either love or hate this film. I can understand both sides of the argument, but personally find myself somewhere in between.I could never say I enjoyed The Tree Of Life. I went in open minded, aware that it would be a challenging watch, but still struggled very early on. I left feeling disappointed it hadn't reached my expectation. But I also left knowing I'd just seen a film, unlike anything I have ever seen before.It is an extreme departure from all the traditional expectations that film history and theory have given us. One of the most challenging of these departures being the lack of, or more so, non existence, of a narrative. Sure, there have been plenty of films with little to no story in the past, but not like this. This is a visual and aural flow of deep observation into a family, and particularly, a boy's childhood. It's the way this is portrayed and the self reflection it evokes in the viewer, which is truly astonishing.The disjointed nature of the piece also is difficult. Again, films in the past have jumped through time and space, without reason or explanation, but again, there is normally a hint of narrative or a theme to provide the all important glue to keep you interested. But not with The Tree Of Life. It jumps with no clear or even subtle reasoning, much like a dream or a memory popping into your head. Or a work of art, open to interpretation.Not providing the viewer with a character/s that they could feel sympathy, anger or concern for, is probably what I found hardest. I can watch most things, but to not have a character that garners some sort of emotive interest, makes it a very difficult watch. I actually found myself getting annoyed at the amount of screen time dominated by the young boy. Screen time without dialogue. Just stares into the infinite, behind the camera, which in hindsight seems like such a different and highly effective way to ask the viewer to engage with the character's thoughts. This is too real for you to care for the characters. Too honest, too true, not fictionalised or hyperbole, it presents their faults, and their struggle, through an ordinary everyday life.I think the above three points really outline why I was disappointed with this film. But as soon as I was struggling with the lack of narrative, structure, or characters, I was overawed by the way it was making me think and feel. I come back to my point that I could never say I truly enjoyed The Tree Of Life, but I could never dismiss it. As to me it presented a family on film unlike anything I have ever seen, and it made me think about my life during the movie and for a long time after. It makes you look inside yourself and revisit your past and think of your loved ones, to discover how your unique life and personality has been shaped. It won't provide any clear cut answers or epiphanies, it won't turn you into a better person, or make you proud or disappointed in who you've become. But instead, it simply invites you to reflect, on the wonder of it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More times than is necessary, a movie comes along that provides an opportunity for too many folks to write reviews they think will elevate them above ordinary folks into an elite group of intellectuals. Pitiful really. No amount of intellectualism or philosophical babbling can improve a lousy movie.Terry Malick forgot one simple idea when he made Tree of Life; he forgot he was making a movie. Instead, it seems Malick set out to create his magnum opus, an epic about life, the universe, and everything, but Douglas Adams already accomplished that far better without all the mental pretentiousness.A good movie should be a good story, with a beginning, a climax, and a resolution (even if the ending is left open for interpretation). It should have a storyline through which viewers can trace the development of the characters. It should have scenes which help viewers make connections to their own lives.Aside from a cliché beginning, Tree of Life fails on all those accounts.We are told that a son is dead, and we're never completely sure which of three sons until the end of the movie (and by that time we don't care). After the initial introduction, we are then thrust into the creation of the universe, the formation of the solar system, the creation of planet Earth, the evolution of life, and finally the birth of humans, with no rhyme or reason regarding what such karmic movement has to do with the overall story. The musical accompaniment was too loud, and the particular arias poorly chosen.The characters wander so pathetically aimless that we do not really care about them. Their moments of spiritual questioning ring with too much triteness. The scenes in which they appear remain disjointed. After one hundred thirty-nine minutes of Malick's egotistical maundering, I still don't know why I needed to witness the eldest boy sneak into someone's house and steal lingerie, which he floated down a river.If I want two hours of disjointedness, disappointment, and just seeming randomness in life, all I have to do is walk outside and live my own life. But if I want a good story about an inner spiritual discovery I'd rather watch a good movie: "Broken Flowers", "Winter's Bone", "The Sensation of Sight", "I've Loved You So Long", or, "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter? and Spring".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I spent New Years Eve trying to get through this film and fell asleep before midnight. I tried again on New Years Day and finished the film in its entirety without falling asleep but have to say I wanted to turn it off five times as least. If you are into a religious spiritual message with little cohesion than this is the film for you. I still cannot make heads or tails out of the dinosaurs, end of the world, beginnings and endings/death. I guess I missed the entire message if there was one in this film. I am shocked it has won so many awards and if this wins an Acadamey Award than the Acadamey is far more existential than myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I would like to note that I would like to have given this movie a lower rating but IMDb would not let me.In fact I am confused at how this was given a rating at 7.4 - I'm so confused that I'm emailing IMDb support as we speak to review the rating of this movie.Sean Penn has approximately 30 words in this movie. I'm certain that random river scenes were repeated.This was an absolute joke. I mean I watched this with people and we were all expecting a "YOU GOT PUNKED" message at the end.There were stretches of about 30 minutes where no humans appeared and there were no words.If you watch this movie start with scene 24 labeled "THE END"The best part of this movie was watching the dinosaurs at around the 45 minute mark.Just so that the reader is aware - I am studying for a PhD so this isn't a hoax - I actually felt this movie was so bad that I intentionally made an IMDb account to post this to help people avoid this nonsense.Anyone who likes this movies is most clearly a film snob. No normal human being could enjoy this. In fact anyone who has seen this movie, please post and tell the brutal truth so that this movie can reach its proper ranking - Worst movie of all time. I've watched MANY of the bottom 250 movies as well... scary thought...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some maybe like to pretend they got the point of the movie, which is all fine and well if there was one. But there isn't. The thin thread of a storyline depicts Brad and his wife getting word, right at the start of the movie, that one of their 3 adult sons has died and from here we are taken to (the many times mentioned) scenes of the universe and planets and dinosaurs which bizarrely has no relevance whatsoever to the rest of the film which follows after. The majority of the movie (then set in a time when the sons are children) has Brad (a salesman) treating his eldest son pretty badly which results in said son acting pretty badly to all around him as a result. Brad goes away on some business and when he returns he continues to not be very nice to his son once more, finally explaining to him he just wants him to turn out well. We are later shown Sean Penn playing the part of the slightly disturbed son, now an adult, and trying (still) to come to terms with his life - and thats about it. Thats the full story of this movie. None of it works very well, and the depth and meaning that some have tried to drag out of this damp squib is almost funny to me. Avoid like the plague!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most disappointed about a movie i have ever been. Academy award winning actors like Brad Pitt &amp; Sean Penn have wasted their time (and mine) &amp; their talent making this movie, in my opinion. I understood exactly what the ''point'' of the movie was - and by ''point'' i mean the most ridiculous plot i have ever seen - &amp; yet the only thing that kept me ''engaged'' in it was to know the ending &amp; maybe make out why the hell a 10 minute explanation would take 2 and a half hours to film. I love movies that have a deeper meaning and which have a somewhat complicated plot to which you really have to wrap your brain around and focus but this was beyond any ''deeper meaning''. The images and camera use were truly excellent I will admit but no offense, I could have stayed home and watched the Discovery channel for that or looked up images of screen savers on my computer. That's what it felt like to me, a bunch of pointless images and scenes that I thought would somehow lead to the boy's death however that never came. What bothered me most about the movie was 1. the mother having echoing monologues about how she wants her son to come back and such which I get that she's grieving but does it have to be so dramatic? 2. the music chosen to play during the images of the universe which made me feel like I was in church. I usually do not mind this kind of music and find it extremely soothing when used in the right situation but I just did not get what they were trying to portray in this. 3. the script - if I even dare call it that - had not one single dialog that lasted more than 3 minutes &amp; if you put all the dialogs together it would maybe make up 15 - 20 Min's of the movie. I believe it is possible to express yourself in another way but a hint or whisper that could explain where the story is leading to or maybe what certain things were about, maybe it would have been more interesting to watch and less difficult to understand. I do not even know why Sean Penn was in the movie, all he did was look left and right and frown (my guess because he's grieving) and not one word left his mouth but when he was talking to a friend of his (which he uttered meaning you couldn't understand what he was saying anyway). I didn't leave the movie theater before it ended was because 1. I had paid to see this seemingly ''epic'' movie &amp; 2. I was hoping to see how the boy died. Other than that I would Not recommend the film unless you are willing to spend 2 &amp; 1/2 hours wondering what the hell is happening or you are high on dope which in my opinion would have made it the ''magical and unique'' film every annoying reviewer has stupidly said. I love Brad Pitt &amp; Sean Penn &amp; their work throughout the years but I'm sorry to say I will make sure not to believe a film is worth watching just because the cast are usually at their best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were no positives to this movie at all, except Brad Pitt was in it, but he did an awful job. I went into this movie with high expectations and left with a frown on my face. What was with the whole universe dinosaur thing????? I didn't make much sense to me at all. I have never even thought of walking out of a movie and i came this close to walking out of this one. There isn't much to review, considering half the movie was just the universe being created. Maybe this film is supposed to be an artsy film, which it only half was. I feel that Brad Pitt's movies have just downgraded. Fight Club is my life and the greatest movie ever and I idolized him in it! Now this crap, i can't even bear to think about it. I kept thinking there was going to be some HUGE twist or something of that sort, but there wasn't at all. Overall, don't see this movie with high expectations, because you will be disappointed. Overall Rating: 1/10 (Just because the effects for the creation part where kind of cool)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, first off I thought the jelly fish and planets were the silliest thing I had ever seen in a movie. I don't want to sit for 20 minutes looking at pictures of planets and fish. The second thing that just bothers me is not knowing what happened to the middle son. The third thing is I am still wondering what the hell Sean Penn's character was doing. There is no story to this film. Well, there is a story but it is so muddled as to be unintelligible.Oh yeah the visuals. I am literally gonna have to roll my eyes on the visuals. I mean the visuals just looked dumb and really I wasn't awed. The movie is seriously a bad acid trip or like trying to remember a dream a couple of days later. This movie was horrible and it left me highly irritated that the story wasn't expanded upon.Acting wise Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain had decent moments. The two older kids played by Hunter McCracken and Laramie Eppler were believable and so I can't fault the actors. Even Sean Penn probably did what he was told but I feel Penn's talent was entirely wasted. It's not the actors I blame Terrence Malick for making this train wreck. I will never in life intentionally watch another movie by this director.</fullReview>

There is truly no plot, character development, or harrowing theme that holds you in your seat.Like 2001: A Space Odessy, it is very abstract and nonlinear, but 2001 had enough substance to carry it. Tree of Life does not and is a waste of time.Better luck next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry to those of you who enjoyed it, but it didn't make any sense whatsoever. People in our row were actually falling asleep. We were bored and confused after the first half hour, but stayed another three-quarters of an hour, out of the principle of having bought a ticket and not wanting to disturb other viewers, before we gave up and left. It was terrible.The sheer number of 5-seconds-or-less space shots was entirely unnecessary to get across the point about big bang vs creationism, and the dinosaur sequences was just strange. The underwater house, the floating woman under the tree - what were any of those about? Nothing made sense, it was boring, many bits were creepy, and overall, it was a pointless half of a viewing experience in my opinion, I'm afraid. I went so far as to warn all my friends not to watch it as it was the first time I'd ever walked out of the cinema.</fullReview>

Don't be conned by the pretty photos, the religious rumblings of the narration, and the spiritual music. Exercise some real critical judgment instead and actually consider what is going on on screen. Is there really two paths through life - the path of nature and the path of grace? Come on, this is just a lot of incoherent, mystificatory, religious nonsense.

Man that was to be the worst movie ever, only one at that level is Blair Witch. In few words first is very beautiful screensaver, beautiful but not original, they're all images you can find in the web, so it's like a collection the director had in is PC or MAC. Following that there's some story, something that could be told in 30 minutes tops and is a more profound way. The movie (i really don't think it should be called that) is long and incredibly boring, so, so very boring.Really hard to judge the acting as there is none, OK, maybe i exaggerate, there must be some 10 minutes of acting there LOL Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was an absolute waste of time, energy and money. Its inexcusable that someone would dare to make a pointless film such as this and except anything but pure contempt from the viewer. I can't believe Brad Pitt agreed to do this film. Surely he can't be happy with the final outcome. And this movie supposedly also stars Sean Penn. From the looks of the poster you'd think Penn had a major role in the film. He appears in the film for a maximum of 10 minutes, and he literally does not make any sound whatsoever in those 10 mins. He doesn't have any dialogues, I still don't know who he was supposed to be and what he was trying to convey.The whole film is a mish mash of wayward scenes which had absolutely nothing to do with the previous or next scene whatsoever. Its got random shots of the solar system, cellular multiplication, dinosaurs (!!!!!), and random people milling around on a beach in the end for no apparent reason at all.I literally have no idea what the movie was about. I have never left a cinema hall in the middle of a movie but I could barely contain myself today. I wanted to leave after the first 15 minutes (and 4 people did leave), but thought I'd give the movie a chance. I thought maybe it does have a point and maybe I was just not *getting* it, and maybe the point was saved for later in the film. The point never came! The logic never came! Why someone would choose to make this film is beyond me. And it is such a farce reading the top reviews for this film calling it a "masterpiece" or a "life altering experience". This movie is garbage, and the I don't want to judge anyone but in my honest opinion the people giving it high marks are either big time wannabes just wanting to appreciate 'arty' pointless cinema (just like a modern art lover looks at gibberish paint strokes and derives 'meaning' out of it), or they saw a completely different film.I trusted IMDb's 7.8 rating for this movie but boy I have never been this mislead in my whole life.Please avoid this film if you can. You will not have missed anything at all. Or go and watch it if you're still curious about how bad it could be. If nothing else, you'll at least experience garbage cinema at its best. And this is an experience which will set a new benchmark for the worst film that you will ever have seen.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been moved to write a review, but if I can save anyone their admission money it will have been worth it. This is simply the most pretentious trash I have ever seen, and I have seen many bad films but nothing ever as bad as this. Boring, tedious, badly made, it even features (cgi) dinosaurs at one point which is about when I gave up. Early on I thought I could discern a theme, but then followed 10-15 minutes of clips of nature/stars/volcanoes/whatever that went on and on. Was this an attempt to frame the story somehow? But then the dinosaurs appeared and when one of them hopped off in a somewhat unconvincing way I didn't know whether to laugh or throw something. People started to leave by this time. I gave this film one star - that's because they managed to join up the clips without any gaps (joke). By the way, I went with a group of 5 ranging from 30s to 60s who all thought the same. Unfortunately the movie theatre didn't do refunds, which was a shame. Avoid this movie, at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painful and Pretentious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been using IMDb for years and years but have never been so inspired to write a review of a film before seeing The Tree of Life. I've been a big fan of Malick's work and was excited to see what he could do with a cast that included Brad Pitt and Sean Penn. Five minutes into the film, I found myself unengaged and disinterested but willing to see where he would take things. Thirty minutes in, I was thankful that I still had popcorn to eat because it was the only thing keeping me awake. Forty minutes into the film, the obnoxious whispered voice-overs ? "Brother" and "How do I find you?" (paraphrased) really started to get to me. Then fifteen minutes of spewing lava, an injured dinosaur, and no-plot later, I was ready to leave the theater. I looked over at my girlfriend sitting next to me ? fast asleep. We stayed until the end of the film, and the entire time, I couldn't help thinking "I paid money for this? I spent two hours watching this?"As we left the theater, the box office manager was casually asking people what they thought of the film. I was baffled by the responses that people were giving him: "It was beautiful!" "It was amazing!" "Truly genius!" When he asked me what I thought of the film, all I could say was "It was awful." Snobby art film lovers "like" this kind of stuff because they're supposed to. When I spend fifteen bucks on a movie, I want a story?not an "impression." Granted, I probably should have done a little more research on the film before heading to the theater, but I figured that with my appreciation for Malick's work and respect for Pitt and Penn, The Tree of Life would be a good bet. I was horribly, horribly wrong. And I would LOVE to have my money back.This was a true waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ostentatious and Lacks a Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It didn't take long for me to realize I wasn't going to like this movie. Basically it had no plot, a vague meaning, and seemed to be consciously attempting to be artsy. I suspect that Cannes critics praised it out of fear that they were the only ones who didn't understand it, somewhat of a 'king's new clothes' scenario. Most movie viewers free of pretension and who don't go for its overtly religious message (the movie is constantly overlaid with whispers to God) will quickly grow bored with its ostentatious imagery which leads nowhere.One aspect of the movie was decent, the cinematography. Many of the shots of this movie, of nature, dinosaurs, the sun, light, etc., would make for beautiful stills. Despite this the movement of the camera was often jarring and constant during the 50's set scenes, so even some of the otherwise beautiful visuals became annoying. Not to mention the fact that they are part of a ham-handed attempt to relate the emotional outpourings of this Texas family to the creation of the universe within a religious framework.The religious narration of the movie, seeming to be directed towards God, is aimless. It is made up of phrases which seem contrived to sound profound while remaining vague enough to elude actual interpretation. The narration is also annoying, as it is done entirely in harsh whispers which sound like the speaker has their face too close to the microphone.The vague and histrionic religious message of the movie will likely only appeal to theologically non-specific, moderate, cross-denominational Protestants who like to self-identify as 'spiritual' and evangelicals of a particularly emotional and 'nature represents God' bent. It will probably be unappealing to non-believers of all stripes and believers who maintain theological specificity and coherence. This movie doesn't seem to set out to change anyone's mind or make a case for itself; it seems geared towards people who are already set in these beliefs and, if you'll excuse the language, will function as a circle-jerk revival for this crowd. The meaning has an overtly religious intention but fails to convey anything specific, conclusive, or challenging.The greatest disaster of this movie is its lack of plot. It begins with a family tragedy which is only alluded to and an emotional outpouring that comes off as indulgent on the director's part to a viewer who has only been introduced to the characters and hasn't yet seen the dead character on-screen. Once the movie settles down to its 50's childhood setting it becomes mildly promising, but without a climatic buildup or any sense of direction it begins to drag. This would be forgivable or even true to form if Malick was attempting to make a realist film, but as the beginning and end sequences of nature images indicate, this is emphatically not an attempt at realism.Unfortunately to add to all this, the movie was constantly overlaid with melodramatic music. I usually feel that music should reinforce what's occurring on screen, if it is included at all, rather than forcing the viewer to adopt a certain mood towards a scene which wouldn't otherwise inspire that kind of emotion. In a number of scenes Malick would have failed to convey the intended emotional force of a scene through pure storytelling and instead used background music as a crutch.Many of the images were attractive, but if this is what I was looking for I could have watched a nature show instead. The child actors were also unusually convincing, while Brad Pitt was convincing as usual. Because of these factors I have given it 2 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, multi-layered, and deeply spiritual film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visual Studies Professor Mette Hjort has said that film has "an extraordinary capacity to expand our reality, to deepen our moral sensibility, and to shape our self-understanding by moving us closer to?realities that are distant from those we know well." In his latest unconventional masterpiece, The Tree of Life, director Terence Malick has opened our vision to the untranslatable miracle of life in all its aspects. No other film has so preoccupied itself with the process of learning about the world, from the infant's first discovery of his ability to touch, to the stirrings of language, to the ability to discern differences, and ultimately to questioning where God lives and how life began.Malick posits the central dilemma of existence as he sees it from a Judeo-Christian outlook. How can one reconcile the love of God with the pain and suffering we experience on Earth? Opening the film is a quote from the Book of Job with God answering Job's question about suffering, "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? . . . On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone when the morning stars sang together and all the heavenly beings shouted for joy?" As in Malick's previous work, there is little dialogue. Voices are internal, whispered, and often barely audible. As the film opens, Jack (Sean Penn), an architect locked in glass towers seems to have lost his connection to the world.Lost and lonely, he looks into himself and rediscovers the innocence of a young boy living in rural Texas in the 1950s with his cookie-cutter's house situated in a typical suburban environment - houses without locks, neatly-trimmed lawns with sprinklers, streams accessible from one's backyard, and an overriding feeling of comfort. His parents, known only as Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain), represent the struggle between" nature" and "grace", grace being the Dasein (being) in Heidegger's "Being and Time," and what Malick calls "nature", the ego, the self-involved force that obscures our experience of who we really are.Reflecting Malick's dichotomy, Mrs. O'Brien is a perfect example of the female capacity for nurture, a mother of tenderness and understanding, telling the boys that love is all that matters in the world. She asks them, in Werner Erhard's phrase, "to make their love for the world be what their lives are really about." In a tender scene, she reaches her hands in the air to find a butterfly sitting gently on it. After the sudden death of their 19-year-old son, questions are heard but it is unclear to whom they are addressed: How did you come to me? What disguise? How did I lose you? Did you know? Who are we to you? When did you first touch my heart?" Malick moves from Jack's recollection of his own birth and the birth of his brothers to a brilliant kaleidoscope of the world's creation and evolution, engineered to perfection by Oscar-nominated cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki in collaboration with special effects consultants Dan Glass and Douglas Trumble. To a gorgeous choral soundtrack, we see everything from the Big Bang to a large dinosaur stomping on the head of a smaller one in the forest, then staring at him with compassion. Malick's process is mirrored in both the microcosm and the macrocosm.The family scenes in Texas, perhaps a recollection of the emotions that the director felt as a child, are shown only in fleeting images: running, climbing, dancing, and singing that wondrously match the splendor of the universe with the joy of childhood. The three brothers establish a close relationship and we see the world from their perspective. In 1950s mold, however, Mrs. O'Brien does not challenge her husband, a disappointed musician who takes out his bitter frustration on his children, the perfect reflection of the "spare the rod and spoil the child" philosophy.Though he is loving and even playful at times, Mr. O'Brien believes that strength is the single most important attribute you need to make your way in the world. He goads the boys to hit him in the face with their fists and, in almost military fashion, he tells them never to call him dad, but only father and to answer his questions with "yes sir" and no sir." The film mostly centers around the stormy father-son relationship between Jack (Hunter McCracken) and his father, the same Jack seen at the beginning of the film 40 years later, still looking for love.When his father has been particularly rough on him, Jack tells him, "It's your house?you can kick me out whenever you want," then under his breath whispers, "You'd like to kill me." Eager to please his father, he acts out in aggressive ways, breaking into a neighbor's house and stealing her nightgown, throwing rocks through the window of an abandoned house, and shooting his little brother in the finger, an act he later tearfully apologizes for.Though I was not always emotionally engaged and I found the ending somewhat prosaic, The Tree of Life is, on the whole, a beautiful, multi-layered, and deeply spiritual film that asks the hard questions, a film that everyone will respond to differently depending on their own experience. To me, it says that the representation of reality that we see is a function of our own consciousness, that God is not an anthropomorphic perfection of ourselves, but lies within us, in our capacity for joy, compassion, and love and our realization that, in the words of Sri Aurobindo, "There is no I nor thou, but only one divine Self equal in all embodiments."</fullReview>

There are dinosaurs in this movie. I know what your are thinking, a movie set in the 1950's about parenting and coming of age and dinosaurs but I swear it's true. My IQ is 185 so I got it, even though there was not much to get. If you are an intelligent person, this movie is not for you. If you are a dim wit that's impressed with striking visuals and moving music, you are going to love this movie but remember you probably won't understand it, because it's so good.

The storyline, if there is one is so jumbled and out in the ether that it actually becomes tiring to sit there and try and figure it out. I really got a sense that the producer and/or director thought he was producing such an epic that he could give it as much artistic license as he wished. The result unfortunately was movie that never started. The only plus was the acting by all actors but unfortunately for me that was no where near enough to lift this movie off the scrap heap of flops.save your money.</fullReview>

But the tedious, faux-ecclesiastic score and the embarrassingly lengthy cosmic art shots were just too much.I will refrain from commenting on the inclusion and meaning of the soon to be famous dinosaur scene. And by "famous" I mean famous like "no-wire-hangers".That said, it is worth seeing. It's not without merit and I respect the ambitions of the film. It is a very difficult endeavor to deal with what Malick is attempting to address. Did he fail? I think so. But failing at this is frankly much more admirable than succeeding at what so many other directors succeed at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes a profound love for cinema is not enough. Throughout my life one filmmaker that I have always enjoyed and counted on would have to be Terrence Malick. From his very beginning Badlands although slow, was an instant classic and beautifully shot. It was this that became Malick's trademark. Days of Heaven is forever seared in my brain as one of the most breathtakingly gorgeous American films ever created. Each frame more beautiful than the last. The Thin Red Line, despite several problems with the film, like having entirely too many big stars all trying so desperately to deliver their greatest Oscar worthy performance, it was still at the end of the day watchable and furthermore an enjoyable film. It was at this point that I began worrying that maybe Malick had lost a step....Then he delivered a home run several years later with Colin Ferrel and Christian Bale in the wonderful New World. Once again a beautiful Masterpiece. All of this building up to what was said to be his most personal, most beautiful, most vulnerable piece of work that the critics hailed as one of the greatest art films of all time... The french (with all their wisdom) cried that it brought them to tears at Cannes. They had no other choice but to give it the Palm(their most pretentious and rewarding award). all the same I went into the film knowing that it lacked a real narrative. I wasn't that concerned. I felt Malick can pull it off. Somehow it will still be moving...Brad Pitt fought to be in it and even Sean Penn gifted us with his presence .(he even took time from Haiti to make this movie)The movie starts... Several beautiful shots of mother and child playing in the front yard... Very circa 1950's America. And then suddenly nothing.. Just a bunch of beautiful images followed by silly voice overs about God not being there. Is there a God? Is God moving me? My father is wrestling inside me... Is this movie worth seeing?? I really think not... Sorry Mr. Malick but your ever so personal introspective yet Metaphysical take on Life, Loss, and don't forget Death, was all too contrived and done before, only more interestingly done and easier to watch. It seems to me that sometimes, particularly this time, critics and moviegoers the same regard certain filmmakers so much that they neglect to really look at the film. As if they are conditioned to like it for whatever reason. I have seen and love many art films but this one is simply not good. I'm not saying its horrible but it is certainly not great. It lacks a cohesive element that pulls it all together and keeps it together. If I wanted to go to sleep at night I usually prefer Perry Mason.</fullReview>

The only reason why i did not walk out of this film was simply because it won best picture! So i stayed so i could make sense of why it won that award... maybe i had to be patient enough and see it through so i will get it. I did not.

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Story but Pretentious as Heck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tree of Life follows a family in 1950s Texas as they struggle with life under an up-and-down abusive father. To start, the visual effects are phenomenal. The fact that none of it is computer-generated is even more impressive. It's absolutely gorgeous to look at. On top of that the performances are all basically flawless. Seriously, why can't Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain play parents more often? And this well. Even the child actors were good, dare I say great. Terrence Malick really hit a gold mine with these kids. And better still, the writing is amazing. The dialogue is great, realistic, and engaging. I loved it. So why didn't I give it a 10/10? This movie is probably the most pretentious thing I've ever seen. Within the first few minutes it throws half an hour of visuals at you showing the creation of the world. And yes, it is beautiful, but it acts like this movie is such a big deal, like the family it follows is so unbelievably important. Also, while the visuals are beautiful, it's still 30+ minutes of staring at planets and lights and nature. It becomes 'Nature Shots: The Movie' for a while, and it gets boring very quickly. This is more of a personal issue, but Sean Penn is advertised as one of the main characters, yet he's not even in the movie really. Of this 139 minute movie, he's there for maybe ten minutes. Maybe. He doesn't say a word, doesn't really serve a purpose. He kind of just wanders around at the beginning and end of the movie. You look at the cover and it advertises Brad Pitt and Sean Penn as the main characters. So, what, we're not going to acknowledge that Jessica freaking Chastain is a main character, that she actually has more screen-time than Brad Pitt and Sean Penn combined? No? Okay, fine. I know this was just a marketing thing. I mean, jeez, the kid didn't make it onto the cover, yet he has way more screen time than everyone. But why the heck is Sean Penn even in the movie, let alone on the cover? It just bothers me so much. Overall The Tree of Life would be better if it didn't pull all the 'depth' crap that it did, and instead settled as an unconventional family drama. I probably would have loved the movie if it was. But no, it had to be pretentious. And of course, the Sean Penn bullcrap (I'll be bitter about that for my entire life). In the end I'd still recommend this movie, it's definitely worth a watch, just don't expect Sean Penn to even be in the movie because he isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully shot, good soundtrack but extremely flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start off by saying that this is the first Terrence Malick film I have seen so I am not used to his style. Having said that, this film shows he has a very good grasp on cinematography. Every shot is well composed and the cinematography choices Malick has made, although restrictive, paid off big time.The nature scenes showing evolution were my favourite scenes. As well as the cinematography being top-notch, the locations are beautiful.The music choices being classical music was responsible for generating emotions in certain scenes for me.The big problems are story and editing. It was edited by 5 different people. This shows because the film feels uneven in areas. On the Blu-ray cover, Sean Penn's name is next to Brad Pitt and above Jessica Chastain despite hardly being in the film at all (a little bit in the beginning and the end). I wondered what was the point of even having him in the movie and as it turns out there was enough footage for a movie around his scenes. From what I know about Malick, he tends to shoot hundreds of hours worth of footage and edit down to the final cut. While this produces interesting results, it causes the story to suffer.Overall, I feel this is more of an experience rather than a movie. I recommend watching at least once but be warned the pacing is a little off.</fullReview>

The one I'm really sure of is about the birth of a child. I could see an angelic woman gather all the children and whisper something to the chosen one and then she told him to enter the gate. There is a sea and a door. When the boy reach the door, the baby is born. How amazing.But why there is a dinosaur? I don't know the kind. I just remember he stepped on his own kind. Does he represent Mr. O'Brien? Like the way he treated his son. And does Jack loves his own mother? That different kind of love, like the love of a lover? Wow.This movie also gives some suspense. Like one when Jack saw his father was repairing his car. He was lying under the lifted car. My heart trembled thinking what he might do about it. I know how much he hated his father.I really love the cinematography as well. And I think I need to watch it again to find other meanings of this superb movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Much Guaranteed To Split People Down The Middle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick strikes again after a somewhat lengthy absence. For a man who specialises in remaining reclusive, when he appears there's a positive mood that another gorgeous looking movie is along the way. "The Tree of Life" looks and feels like Malick, but the whole "experimental drama" is bound to aggravate a large amount of people. I as well felt frustrated since I've wanted to see the film since its release, only to be faced with sheer beauty for some 20 minutes and regular familiarity for the remaining 2 hours.The film chronicles the origins and meanings of life, focusing on a middle-aged man's childhood memories of his family living in 1950's Texas. Early in the film scenes on the origins of the universe and the inception of life on Earth is spliced between this reflection, all building towards an "ascension" of sorts. These next two paragraphs I'm going to split into visuals and acting, starting with the visual aspect. The whole movie is shot in a kind of "fish-eye" lens, incorporating plenty of POV shots and Steadicam movements. It's gorgeously directed and effective at evoking the mindset and views of our young actors, but it is definitely nauseating and for 2 hours can become tedious even for those with a tolerance for patience. The universe stuff in one word, is beautiful. Douglas Trumbull who is most famous for the effects work of "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968), uses many practical lighting effects and a variety of liquid materials to help build this vast majesty in all its glory. Unfortunately CGI is the only way to approach the "Dinosaur" segment, and it cannot help but feel jarring after just witnessing that wonderful display of infinite space.As for the acting aspect, I find myself at a crossroads. Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain and Sean Penn are wonderful performers who really shine when the scene calls for it, but Penn is so barely utilised in the entirety of his scenes I find anyone could have taken his role. Of course Hunter McCracken is the young lead of the movie, and he's very convincing as a young boy growing up in these rural areas. I find myself infuriated that their is such a lack of dialogue between his peers and the adults throughout the movie, but we were all kids once and even I can admit I didn't have much to say at that age either. Essentially the movie is this blank slate kid growing up, and you are his eyes. Discovering the strange natures of the earth that entices him, then as he grows older discovers rebellion and the reality of death. The universe stuff in-between doesn't really mesh well, and regardless of how beautiful I find it, it all leads to this ending I find more "indulgent" than "grand".Final Verdict: After all is said and done, I still find "The Tree of Life" to be worth your time when you finally sit down and watch it. If you only want to see the universe stuff, then I would recommend watching just that alone because it really is the highlight of the movie. Everything else feels a little familiar and a little sub-par for a Terrence Malick picture, but as far as "experimental" pictures go it's certainly an acquired taste. 7/10. A very ambitious movie.</fullReview>

All of these pretentious critics who give crap like this good reviews are only encouraging this unwanted behavior and giving false hope to normal moviegoers. Call me old fashioned, but movies need to hold the interest of the viewers with clever writing, great acting and stunning visuals. I will give only the last one to Malick, but it seemed more like Getty Images had a sale on ethereal music and nature clips. This does not make a movie!There are other writer/directors who are on my DO NOT WATCH! blacklist. They are: Stanley Kubrick, Todd Field, and Rian Johnson (sadly, Johnson has signed on to direct Star Wars Ep. 8&amp;9. I expect a major drop off in quality from the great Abrams). Now I have also added Malick. All of these directors are nothing more than capable of making pointless, horribly made art school films. In all reality, I would rather watch a bad normal movie like The Pacifier which has a bad story, bad directing and bad acting, but at least there is something to grab on to. At least I know what I am getting with Vin Diesel as a babysitter. When I plan on watching Pitt, Penn, and Chastain, I expect greatness and not a film any kid could make in his basement with a camcorder, a trial version of Final Cut Pro, a Getty Images account and 2 hours and 20 minutes of hard drive space.HORRIBLE!!!! Worse than Tom Wilkinson eating soup in his kitchen with zero emotion for an entire 15 minutes during "In the Bedroom"! Yes, worse than that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, what did I just (attempt) to watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was...something. Honestly I got more from reading the synopsis afterwards than the movie itself, then I was like oh, that's what was going on.There is a complete lack of story here and for the most part no dialogue either, just erratic imagery, shaky camera work and a random (whispering) narrative "Brother. Mother. It was they who led me to your door." Yeah whatever.All I can say is thank god I watched this on DVD where a FF button was available (and readily used) because there is no way I could have sat through 2 1/2 hrs of this in the theatre. About the only thing that made sense initially was the death of one of the brothers in Vietnam (?) -guessing on that because except for the style of clothing we don't actually know when this takes place.Then things got really weird, with at least 10 minutes of random shots of the creation of the universe, dinosaurs, jellyfish, volcanoes. I don't know what's going on here at all. The "story" finally goes back to the boys childhood, he is born, has a loving mother (Jessica Chastain) and a stern father (Brad Pitt), runs around in the woods with his friends, loves his brothers and appears to get angrier and more resentful of his father as he ages.I got to a point with this where I just had to see it through, to find out if there was actually a point to it all. Nope. About the only scene I did enjoy was at the end when everybody is dead (?) and walking on the beach (don't worry this won't spoil the movie for you and I'm not really sure that's what was going on anyways) This may just have been due to the fact that the movie was finally over though, a feeling of relief, I made it through *fist pump* 1/19/15</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You create your own destiny."Watched this beautiful piece of work last night, my second Malick film even Badlands has been a favourite for years. Malick has clearly come a long way since Badlands stylistically, although he's on similar ground as far as ideas are concerned. But whereas I consider Badlands to be one of the best films ever, I'm on the wall about this one, and I'm not really sure it's fair to compare them seeing as I've missed a huge chunk in his filmography and his style has clearly changed since then. I will say this though, for me Badlands adds up to a cohesive whole, it's ideas and characters summed up perfectly through image and performance until a wonderfully ambiguous and existential ending. The Tree of Life on the other hand is an audacious and highly experimental film, less concerned with a linear story, less grounded and more about showing the shifting inner lives of a family in a 50s Texas small town, and it does so beautifully. The ever-fluid camera, the understated performances and the subtle sound design which occasionally lets loose inner chattering and questions from it's characters make this film hypnotic, the film portraying life as waking dream. The narrative structure too is loose, going off on wild tangents with mind blowing footage of the big bang, the universe and Earth's distant past, and jumping forward to the son as he's grown up (Sean Penn) and living in some strange sterile utopia, until the film for most of it's running time settles into the story of a family told from the point of view of a boy (Hunter McCracken; excellent) with a grudge against his strict disciplinarian father (Brad Pitt; understated and very good) following a tragedy in the family. I'm glad the footage of the universe forming and dinosaurs was the length it was, because it's balanced perfectly with the main narrative, never going too far out and removing me, but just far out enough that the film feels like a dream lost in time. The film's religious themes of questioning faith and why we're here and what it's all about are conveyed beautifully as the camera moves in and out of each characters motivations and thoughts, although the ending threw me a bit, and I'm not sure where I stand on it. This is where the film really loses it's grounding, and I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing. I think I understand what it's getting at, maybe symbolising eternity and timelessness, and while somewhat touching, I did feel something of a remove at that point, especially seeing as I was so wrapped up in the story of this family struggling through life.But despite being unsure about the ending I'm giving this my highest recommendation and I consider it a must-see film. It is mesmerising and fascinating. See it. Now to catch up on everything I missed from Mr. Malick, and maybe give an old favourite a re watch..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not For Any Average Movie-Goer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone searching for some mid-day enjoyment or a couple's night watching t.v - I would not suggest this movie. This movie must be watched alone. It does not hold enough integrity to be pleasing to a crowd. It's personal. And as an additive, it must be viewed completely ( and not forwarded through that 20 min representation of the creation of Earth). Because it is simply art. The whole film is a generator of images and sounds which intervene wildly and to almost a comforting level of our intense human nature. At first it may seem tactless and so-over but the order of scenes and angles do adjust and climb into newer heights of our exact senses. For instance, as Chastain's character glides her hand over the silken fabric of the drying sheets (in one scene), we feel that touch in our minds. We see her expression and satisfaction along with the brimming notes of some distant orchestra (classical music is so prominent in this film), and we are reminded of similar memories.The film is so remarkable in the way which it effortlessly portrays an Amercian childhood. So in fact, that I could actually recollect some moments of this film from my own past. There are joyful moments: the children chase the mother from room to room with a frog in hand, as the curtains bring about the magic-hour's light, and every character is hysterical, and some sweet serenade plays. And then suddenly (the tones change): the father is at the table with some dark dilemma and sees to it that one child is also mentally stricken, and he goes off ranting, and there's a fight between he and the mother. It is the American opera of domestic living. And in some strange way, Malick enables it to reflect also the creation of the universe. There's a lot to digest here. So if you decide to watch it, please give it time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Tree of Life" is an extraordinary film that is new to cinema, and proves Terrence Malik is a cinematic master.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has never been such an extraordinary and deep film than Terrence Malik's masterpiece "The Tree of Life." The film tackles elements that relate to experiences all living creatures go through. Feelings of sadness, guilt, anger, love and joy are expressed through the eyes of a middle-class Texas family in the 1950's. Brad Pitt plays a strict father who is very harsh on his three sons. We later see Sean Penn play the older version of the son that is mainly focused on, and how his life is full is misery and wonder. Jessica Chastain plays the mother of the boys who is a loving angel. Malik takes us in a direction of beauty by showing the nature of existence and has magic cinematographers to capture the gorgeous beauty the world has to offer. Using rich metaphors that require slick attention to fully grasp the complexity of the text, Malik shows how each parent represents the grace and nature of the world we live in. The process of living is examined by each character and shows how in each day human beings experience rich emotions that can be positive or negative. Many criticize this film due to its confusing plot and lame spirituality. When many praise it for being religious, it is not a religious film at all. It opens the question of faith and shows how afterlife and a deity could possibly be real and Malik shoots shots of the universe to give a scientific visual examination of life itself. This film is a visual masterpiece that doesn't have any explosions or battle scenes to fulfill that need. Instead, Terrence Malik gives us a visual representation of the beauty of the natural world, and incorporates humans into that category. Terrence Malik's directing is so stylish and artsy that not a second is forced or overdone. Malik shows the world in shockingly new ways that are so gorgeous and interesting that leave us in fascination. The speed of the film is edited well to give lengthy scenes to fully examine existence. This narrative classic is a film everyone must see before they die, and can be brought to bring beautiful and thought-provoking cinema to life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This marmite film is Terrence Malick's most ambitious project to date, and the time when his wandering narrative, slow pace and emphasis on depth over action went totally overboard. It's difficult to describe the story as there's no plot, but it can be divided into 4 sections. 1. A family in the 1950s twirl around in sunlight, yell at each other and one of them experiences the loss of innocence. 2. A beautiful but boring creation montage (Dinosaurs! Sharks! Microbes! What?!). 3. Sean Penn wanders through skyscrapers and thinks about life. 4. Something? With it's snail like pace, confusing voice overs and lack of actual action this is certainly going to alienate a lot of people. I have no problems with a story being told like this, but the film seems to think it's really deep when it isn't. The ending makes absolutely no sense, and the film is so boring I spent the entirety of it almost nodding off. It's also an emotionally void experience, and just leaves one feeling cold. I don't know what the film was trying to say and to be honest I really don't care.Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain and the child actors are good, and the cinematography is some of the beautiful ever committed to film. I can get stunning visuals on Google Images. I would seriously not recommend this to you if this isn't your sort of thing. Terrence Malick's direction is fine and I have nothing against him, but the screenplay is indulgent and pretentious, and doesn't even tell the audience what it's trying to say. If the film had actually given anything to its audience in return for 2 hours they will probably spend asleep it might have worked. If you want to try a Malick film, The Thin Red Line and Badlands are far better and at least they've got a plot. TTOL is not a terrible movie as occasionally a curious power shakes to life and you can't help but admire Malick's ambition to make something like this is an era of computer generated money grabbing blockbusters. This is very much a critic's film so I do have a sort of respect for it. Since this film is so divisive, it's better to watch it for yourself and see what you think.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible visuals, but greatly unsatisfying on repeat viewings when one knows the film's two layers won't jibe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's THE TREE OF LIFE is an attempt to inject some cosmic wonder into the most mundane American story.In the 1950s, two parents bring up three boys in an American white middle-class, small-town existence. The mother (Jessica Chastain) radiates love and warmth, while the father (Brad Pitt) feels the obligation to be cold and distant in order to prepare his sons for the cruel world that awaits them. As we are informed at the beginning of the film, sometime during this mid-century upbringing, one of the boys would eventually die. We are also shown flashfowards to the present day, when the eldest son Jack, now a successful architect working in New York City, reflects on the death of his brother decades ago. There is very little conventional spoken dialogue in this family drama. The story is told through voiceovers on top of a rich series of images, these monologues representing the inner thoughts, doubts and fears of the characters.But Malick adds something on top of this, one of the most controversial turns in Hollywood filmmaking in recent years. Early on we are treated to a depiction of the creation of the universe and of life on Earth, from the initial clouds of gas right after the Big Bang to small nebulae, then big galaxies like our own Milky Way, the Earth as an inchoate ball of lava, life arising in tide pools, and then into the era of the dinosaurs. These special effects were created by Douglas Trumbull, best known for the cosmic visuals of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The titles of the film quote from the Book of Job: "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth, when the morning stars sang together?" I get what Malick is trying to do here, that is, to show that the trials and tribulations of an individual human life are part of some vast unknown plan. Nonetheless, while I can understand this on an intellectual level, the film does not seem to reconcile the two layers into a single coherent plot. The film is indeed a visual feast on a first viewing (the Bluray release watched on an HD projector is nearly as stunning as 2001), but the TREE OF LIFE is much harder to sit through on a repeat viewing when one knows that it doesn't quite hang together. Furthermore, as thought-provoking as the story of the boys' 1950s upbringing is, the last part with its scenes of petty delinquency goes on forever and should have been cut. Finally, the ending which I won't spoil here is a total trope, not at all a fresh take on the meaning of life.At a time when Hollywood is widely regarded as stagnant, I can appreciate a director like Malick who at tries to do something unexpected, but I find THE TREE OF LIFE to be rather a noble failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrence Malick overrates his tingly inexpressible feelings, and now we all can too. If he could have shot the movie on film made from mulberry bark, he would have gladly. Not that it isn't deluxe enough already, in its fake naive way: the camera stumbles, the editing stammers, and lens flares are stuck all over like sequins. The nature imagery is in a contest with the voice-over to see which can be more generalized, more evasive. What it's all about is nothing more than a grown man having a bad day, remembering his childhood and feeling he was unloved. But no one's childhood was ever as unceasingly idyllic and "timeless" as what we're shown. Malick wants to avoid specificity, and with good reason: it disguises the silliness of The Tree of Life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging, if in a visual sense, but one needs to try hard if one is to take an awful lot from the experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the depths of the Earth's oceans to the hearts of distant nebulas by way of a contemporary high-rise building and a 1950's Texan neighbourhood, Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life certainly gets around. There is can be little denying that its imagery is often stark and quite beautiful; these grandiose compositions of star systems located deep within outer space giving way to low angles of terrific prehistoric beasts, sitting and waling, on the shores of Earth's beaches several millions years ago. The way he later glides his camera around what he focus' upon, manoeuvring around from rural to urban, as voice overs prop up the imagery calls to mind the work of Tharkofsky. When one digs a little deeper, however, one cannot shake the sensation that most of it is just surface shine to a rather unremarkable premise about what appears to be a clinically depressed middle aged man living in the modern age who's flashing back to his youth during a single working day. In this sense, the film shoots its bolt fairly early on. Its underlying hypothesis about how, in spite of ages passing and millions of years of evolution coming and going, everything that's ever lived on planet Earth has shared in the same emotions and gone through the same processes of birth; death; strife during youth as well as varying sets of emotions encompassing as guilt and remorse.That's not to say you can't enjoy the film. Hold on, maybe you in fact CANNOT enjoy the film, but appreciating it is certainly not out of the question. Veterans of Malick's previous work, specifically his 1998 film "The Thin Red Line", will spot the correlation between his opening there and how he begins here. A softly spoken voice-over greets us and a montage graces the screen to some angelic music. We're taken in by the tranquillity of it all as we construct an image of the speaker enjoying their time in the locale. In The Thin Red Line, an American soldier has deserted his platoon and has decided to hang out with some Pacific Islander natives. In The Tree of Life, we observe a family playing on their front lawn in an American summer of around sixty years ago; a mother and father with their sons in what is itself a flashback, before the mother and narrator of this opening receives news in the not too distant future of one of her son's deaths.The ugly item of death and destruction, or an implement of such things, reared up in The Thin Red Line to dispel a narrator's musings on their domestic bliss. On that occasion, it was a Navy cruiser hunting for an AWOL soldier in the Pacific theatre of World War Two. This is not new territory for Malick, in spite of how the film comes at us as fresh and seemingly unlike anything you've previously seen. We move forward to the early 21st Century, and Sean Penn is a clerk of some sort in a high rise office building; a man dwarfed by the tall, anonymous, cold looking structures. He speaks of his disenchantment with life, a musing provided as Malick precariously tracks his camera towards one of the many windows within the interior of this structure ninety storeys up, as if it were to reflect the perspective of what an individual in the process of jumping out of such a thing might look like.After providing us with a little bit of this man, who's battling internal demons and cannot shake away his negative memories of childhood, we're shooting off to depictions of what the early millennias of Planet Earth may have looked like: the forming of the oceans; the birth of its sea-life and various dinosaurs coming to interact with one another, some more mercifully than you'd think, in what is an instance that sees the film ask you to see it as the monster movie wherein the beasts decide AGAINST attacking one another. Smart and revisionist? Or trite and demanding of simplistic things. You decide. The dinosaurs were, of course, wiped out my a meteor and billions of years later we're back on that 1950's America strand with a bunch of kids growing up and getting into mischief. This stretch is the closest we get to any sort of stone wall narrative wherein characters are depicted and fill out the respective roles of leading and supporting. Young Sean Penn is played by Hunter McCracken, and his job is to sit around a dinner table so as to take flak from Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt is Penn's father, not a character we haven't seen before in that they're domineering and tough and most likely suffering from post traumatic stress disorder out of World War II without even knowing it. Some scenes depicting how he came to be how he is might have been interesting and more reflective on life, the universe and just about everything if the film is going to go down a route of all the stuff anyway.Alas, the second unit content is more interesting to Malick to this extent. At least, I THINK you can classify it as second unit content. I wouldn't count five unbroken minutes of an iTunes visualiser as "second unit", but whatever. Ultimately, it seems the film wants us to see things very simplistically through a very complicated lens: ages and have past; millennia and such have gone by; tremendous beasts once lived, but have since died out; homosapiens of all sorts of races and religions have inherited the Earth - but hasn't existence always been the same for all of us? Haven't experiences and feelings always been the same for these organisms, and aren't we all just trying to get somewhere at the end of the day?</fullReview>

It can be a connection to the cosmos and the enormity of it all, but can also be a disconnect of storytelling and montage.Not for everyone and requires a quiet and open mind. There is much beauty and just as much disturbing and imaginative irritation. The whispering voices are politely pretentious and meant to convey inner feelings, but along with some of the Director's conceits can make this troubled viewing for some. For others it can smoothly anticipate anguish.The Film is an Artistic form of Cinematography uneasily meshed with real-life suffering and a Family's unsuccessful attempts at uniformity and conformity. It is off center Cinema and your enjoyment will depend very much on your place in the Universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always love these creative movies that challenges the viewer's mind and ability to think and interpret hidden meanings. I also love when filmmakers invent new cinematic experiences that are unlike any seen before kind of like how this film, The Tree of Life was. I talked to people and they absolutely despised this film because it wasn't what a normal movie is these days. I liked it because it was the total opposite. I love these movies where I get to think what the movie actually is.The plot is an interesting one at the very least. Terrence Malick's film is about the struggles of a Texas family at the very first glance. But I'll leave the viewer to decide if it's any more than that.The acting is a positive trait for this film. Brad Pitt plays a powerhouse performance as the strict father. Sean Penn was pretty good but I wish he had more scenes. The kids are also worth mentioning because they take up the majority of the screen time and were really good.Overall, this may have been the most complex movie I have ever seen. I thought that honor would go to Inception but that is nowhere as complex as this. This film is also a polarizing one since critics loved this and viewers not so much. I liked the visual part of this movie because these visual are actually doing part of the explaining of the story. They go hand-in-hand with the narrative. I liked this movie but I don't know if I can watch it again. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I start commenting, I have to admit that I dozed off a little at the beginning of the movie, the first few scenes of Sean Penn. That is why I did not see a lot of Sean Penn in the movie, even though I've seen people commenting that Sean Penn could get acting awards from his performance here. I only remember him appearing in the modern world in the beginning and in the end him walking around some strange places.I have never seen any previous movies directed by Terrence Malick. I only know that he has an Oscar nominated directorial "The Thin Red Line", which I have yet to watch. But I did hear good reviews of this movie of his. Actually very extreme reviews, either extreme good or extreme bad.To me, this movie is definitely not a failure, but I am not sure if it has succeeded as a 'movie'. Before I talk about the illusory side of the movie, the story was actually nice. The story surrounded this family, with Brad Pitt as the father, Jessica Chastain as the mother and their three boys. The story about how the family lived at an earlier era, the strong culture and value from the earlier decades. It started with the parents losing their second son, the pain and suffering, before flashing back on their lives.Sounds like it could make a good story, but then came this long section in between. It is kind of like a symbolism, images starting to appear. I think it lasted about 30 minutes from the whole movie. I think this part of the movie is very controversial. It can either leave you amazed or dumbfounded, not having a clue what is it about. It is a very different approach of telling a story in a movie, trying to convey a very special message. The question is, does everyone get it?Acting wise, it was quite good over all. Brad Pitt did have a little breakthrough, and Jessica Chastain is definitely one actress that should be highlighted. It is sooner or later she will be discovered further and turned into an A-list star. The three boys were quite OK. I think the second son has the most similar feature to Brad Pitt :).In my opinion, it is not a bad movie, but I think if this is shown in an art exhibition, it could have been better. It is a fabulous piece of 'art', maybe not such a similar grade for a 'movie'. I have to admit it is a very unique approach though. Full marks as a good piece of art, but maybe failed to capture most of the audiences heart as a movie? You grade it.</fullReview>

Not only that I see it's pointless, but it looks like I faced a no direction way and I don't know where to go.. Perhaps his directing style is unique, the cinematography was beautiful IMHO, and if either Brad Pitt, Sean Penn, or Jessica Chastain received a nominee for their performance I wouldn't surprised because I didn't have a full look on their performances but I found them were doing great until half of this movie..

The subject starts to embrace life and a journey you might take through it, yet the standards are far from constant throughout the film. What did hold the film together for the first 10 minutes was a show of promising editing to come, yet that too fell short halfway through. Brad did not add to the film at all, his acting was terrible and did not come over as the typical father figure but an out of work actor with a grudge. The visuals were the only point that kept me to halfway were I could not stand any more. The films message would drift though and while you got lost in drops of color in water effects that went on to lava and dinosaurs, bad direction totally lost the week thread that was there. This kind of film is extremely hard to pull off well and although a lot of the imagery was striking it was often out of place or badly edited. The lack of dialogue was refreshing, yet often tried to be too deep and failed. I did enjoy some of the camera work, often from a great perspective showing just enough to leave you in thought. Music and cameraman get the 2 stars.</fullReview>

"The Tree of Life" is a moving experience that brings its audiences through the various phases of life, death, and rebirth--a heavy topic indeed. However, this movie successfully poses all the old philosophical questions : Why do bad things happen to good people? Is there a right or a wrong? Or is there only nature? Does God care about humans or is he a distant observer? Do our actions in this life mean anything in the grand scheme of things?While most movies would fail in addressing these questions, "The Tree of Life" allows its audience to contemplate these deep thoughts through an interesting stream of conscious cinematic style.If you want an experience that only appeals to your cinematic sweet tooth don't watch "The Tree of Life," but if you are open to a spiritual experience please give this movie a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about nothing, that tries to be something.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is arguably one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. I bought the DVD with high expectations. I had read a few reviews which were quite polarised. Some praised the film as challenging, emotionally complex and deep whereas others thought it was utter nonsense. Nothing could prepare me for the disappointment....Without giving too much away (there isn't anything to give away really,) the film starts with a lot of meaningless images of random objects. Granted, the visuals are quite nice, but once I looked back at the film I realised they were completely meaningless. This is because the film did nothing to develop these strange images into any sense of purpose. In short, the film does not really have a plot. So I've concluded that these images were only really put in the film because of the directors wish to 'challenge the audience-' (i.e. to be pretentious.) The film vaguely examines the effect of a sibling death in a family. Brad Pitt puts forward a good performance as a sadistic father, but this is not enough to save the film from itself. There are a couple of nice pieces of cinematography, but then the director decided to focus on the image of a depressed looking Sean Penn who has barely anything to say throughout the entire film.Overall this film is a great pile of nothingness. Although it boasts some impressive visuals and good acting, it does not provide any coherent plot, and by the end it made me want to never see a film again. Despite it's slow, meandering pace the film did not end with anything coherent or shocking, let alone profound. In short, it is the type of film that the Cannes film festival loves to praise as being profound, deep, and meaningful. Unfortunately it is none of these things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I truly loved the movie, I feel it's fair to warn everybody wants to see it that this is not an easy film, nor for everyone. All the action lovers, who expect for adrenaline, great plots, suspense will be very disappointed. This is because the most important part of the movie is not action, but its deep reflection on life. This is why it's absolutely useless wondering if the plot makes sense, or if there is a plot at all. The feelings related to the facts make this movie a masterpiece, not the facts themselves. The film is an exaltation of life in its splendor and devastation, that shows how Man is just a small reproduction of the whole universe and how everything is extremely connected by a God that is not above us, but amongst us, and lives in the beauty of Nature. This deep spiritualism follows the story of a family, and meanwhile shows how men, just like the spectators of the movie, wonder about life and how they react to it. Some of them manage to understand it in all its uniqueness, they learn to follow the "way of Grace", they respect God's project and live for the others. Some others follow their own path, they don't manage accepting suffering and they suffer for this. But at the end the message is quite clear (whichever is our own interpretation): the way of Grace triumphs, and the routes of the tree of life are simply the love that permeate Nature. Ps. I'm Italian, sorry for my English mistakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tree of Life: Big Bang to the End of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tree of Life (2011) This is a strange film filled with a handful of Hollywood elite actors. It's hard to follow where the movie is going and what it is trying to tell us. If you do not like deep movies that make you think, change the channel. I can say that it is extremely ambitious because it tries to capture humanity, biology and the history of our universe from the big bang until the supposed end of time. We get flashbacks of the past and fast forwards to the present day. We get that Sean Penn is at work in a US city with skyscrapers. He is remembering his childhood with his two brothers and his parents (Jessica Chastain, Brad Pitt) in a 1940's suburban neighborhood. We observe the personal moments and lives of these family members and we constantly review philosophical questions about good vs evil in our minds as this film unfolds. We see the afterlife, we see the tricks that our memories play on us and we see forgiveness. If you have ever seen The Fountain with Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz it also has a philosophical feel. I also get a feeling of time flying the way I did when I saw the Green Mile with Tom Hanks and the late Michael Clarke-Duncan. Watching this movie is like being educated on your day off from school. It's a must see for Movie intellectuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Not Be Missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tree of Life is a film with experimental elements written and directed by Terrence Malick. It features Brad Pitt, Sean Penn and Jessica Chastain. It chronicles the origins and meaning of life by way of a middle-aged man's childhood memories of his family living in 1950's Texas, against the narrative backdrop of the origins of the universe and the inception and end of life on Earth.The screenplay follows the life journey of the eldest son, Jack, through the innocence of childhood to his disillusioned adult years as he tries to reconcile a complicated relationship with his father. He finds himself a lost soul in the modern world, seeking answers to the origins and meaning of life while questioning the existence of faith.This film's rewards are many, for those with the patience to simply let it float. Malick's singularly deliberate style may prove unrewarding for some, but for patient viewers, Tree of Life is an emotional as well as visual treat. Also,through his signature imagery, we see how both brute nature and spiritual grace shape not only our lives as individuals and families, but all life.The result actually plays like a divine pronouncement, cosmic in scope and oracular in tone, a cinematic sermon on the mount that shows its creator in exquisite form.Also,it aspires to change your life as it tries to explain it, from the first cosmic blip to those busy amoebae splitting and multiplying, to jellyfish jellying through the primal seas, to the planets lined up in a row. Striving for no less than the pinnacle of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Tree of Life falls short of masterful but retains a power that far too many motion pictures lack.Definitely,not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terence Malick makes a comeback with the visually mesmerizing 'The Tree of Life'. Like many abstract films, this is the kind that most would either love or hate. As for me, It was a visual treat. The collage of detailed photographic shots of nature juxtaposing with suburban life is done with skill and the score is used very effectively. 'The Tree of Life' feels like a personal account of Jack's childhood (he grew up in a dysfunctional family) and how he seeks the meaning of life as a grown-up. Perhaps much of it is based on Malick's own experience as a child.Dialogue is minimal as the film relies more on visuals. A downside is that the characters speak in very low volume, sometimes whispers and at times I found it difficult to hear what they were saying.The pacing is too slow . I've heard that some viewers had given up after watching the first ten minutes. 'The Tree of Life' certainly takes its time. Moreover some sequences felt repetitive.Even though the film has two big stars, it could have easily done without them. Moreover, it is Jessica Chastain who stands out more than Pitt and Penn.As stated above, this is the kind of film that would either appeal to the viewer or bore them. In spite of its flaws, I found it worth the watch mostly because of the personal world that Malick creates and how he engulfs the viewer into it. Maybe it helps that I didn't watch it all in one go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has redeeming features but....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was constantly reminded of 2001 A Space Odyssey while watching Terrence Malick's much vaunted film. Stunning visuals and haunting music with traces of a story somewhere close beneath the surface. But I almost flatlined at one point not knowing whether to walk out or give it a few more minutes. I persevered and I am glad I stayed to the end not because this is a good film but because I can tell it like I felt it.There are times when this film is truly uplifting, especially the retelling of family life before tragedy strikes. But there is a vapour that hangs over the rest as if, through painting and sound, you can construct a movie that is automatically great. And this is NOT a great film. It isn't even a good one. Yes it is very watchable in places but it does not make up its mind what story it wants to tell or what its point is.Stanley Kubrick's 2001 had people talking and I am sure Malick's film will attract every bit as much attention but it is simply nowhere near the equal of the style I think it attempts to copy. It is uneven, its haphazard structure doing nothing to enrich whatever point the director is trying to make. At the beginning the film says we have a choice between nature's way or the way of grace. I don't think this film does either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful tree ? plastic roots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terence Malick is a director who allows the camera to do a lot. He works with cinematographers who are able to capture exquisite images, so much so that his films become a type of visual poetry. Combining this talent with a powerful story is the epitome of filmmaking talent ? which is why, after watching The Tree of Life, I am disappointed and even angry.On the plus side, we have superb acting. The story of a family dominated by a loving and increasingly frustrated and paradoxically abusive father is told in an understated and extremely effective way.Pitt has never been better. We feel for all involved, particularly when tragedy strikes. The problem is that the simple and so effective story is hidden behind an intrusive stew of religious and evolutionary images in which Malick allows his CGA folk free rein. The DVD I hired told me to turn up the volume: a first for me. Ten minutes in I understood, because most of the speech is whispered, with the occasional window-rattling burst of sound. Early on, for about ten minutes I seemed to be watching a dirge music video or screen saver, which was beautiful but fairly pointless once one had appreciated the spring leaf/ volcano violence ambivalence. Somewhere we went into space, and then launched into an evolutionary sequence which ended with one form of dinosaur planting its foot on another. I was hoping that this was going to continue, as a counterpoint to everyone's whispers to "God" who appears as a reddish waving curtain (I think).No, we were back to the whispers.Then the film picked up, and for the next reel or two I was riveted by the family dynamics, the acting and the beauty of the photography.Why am I angry? When the film actually appeared to be going somewhere, we were back to the planets and some dire beach where the dead or dead in spirit woodenly move in random directions greeting each other or even worse, versions of each other. Sadly, they actually looked silly.I cannot help but feel that Malick has been seduced by the images at the expense of the story and even the characters involved(something from which even Bergman could suffer). When the symbolism takes over the film, it's self-indulgent, pretentious and something of a cop-out - which is a pity as much of the film shows that Malick is way better than this. If, during a wonderful performance of King Lear, everything shut down and people with beautiful pictures of lightning, and some with fireworks and others with artistic pictures of stars and swamps cavorted about the stage for fifteen minutes to tell me what to feel, I would feel patronized beyond belief. Enough said. Still, overall, it's a visually stunning film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great potential, but too much surrealistic filling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The feelings meant to be conveyed throughout the movie are achieved sublimely; the characters are so real, that it is impossible not to feel every emotion; the grief, frustration, love, tenderness, regret. The photography is amazing, and what I loved about the movie was that unlike traditional Hollywood, it lets the audience interpret and figure things out on its own, yet it goes overboard in the macro artsy psychedelic universe thing, and understandably, even the most patient and alternative film loving person starts to think, "So, get on with it, already!!" At least four people walked out of the theater before the movie was over. It would have been a much better movie with half of the symbolic surrealist scenes. Excellent acting, both adults and children, thought Sean Penn's character doesn't give him much of an opportunity to do anything more than walk around with a morose look on his face. The movie had some beautiful, redeeming qualities; it's just unfortunate it will probably be dismissed for its cumbersome slowness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we have movie that left me feeling more frustrated than satisfied at the end. I liked the whole creation of the universe followed by the development of life on Earth from the first primordial pools of molecules up to the Jurrasic period of the dinosaurs. And the choral music was perfectly suited to the artistic &amp; articulate visuals. I just didn't understand how it fit into the story of a man who was reliving his past memories of regret &amp; guilt throughout his life. All in all it was just plain weird and not too profound for me. The acting was stellar. The story of a 1950's American family with 3 young boys of opposing personalities being raised under the roof of a controlling father was emotionally riveting at times. The protagonist's feelings of depression due to a father who couldn't give him the love he desired all while facing the tragedy of the death of a brother were conveyed with genuine conviction. However, the surreal "walk on the beach to Heaven with long lost family &amp; friends" ending was perhaps a bit awkward and ambiguous. I'm not even sure if this was a crushed man's final farewell to the world or just his acceptance of the consequences of poor decision making both as a youth and as an adult. This film left me sad and bewildered after the credits rolled. Generally I love to peel off the psychological layers that require deep analysis of the story and characters. This was a slightly depressing experience over all. I might watch this movie on DVD someday to see if it makes more sense with a second viewing... Ya never know!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As bad as the one star reviews say it is; believe them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terence Malick's "Days of Heaven" is my favorite film of all time, and I am inclined to like many of his other works, so this was a sore disappointment. It is boring, glacially paced and what story there -- not much -- is hard to understand and confusingly told.However, I did a little research and I'll share it with other puzzled viewers. I actually looked up a bio of Terence Malick. As I suspected while watching, this is HIGHLY autobiographical (the people bits, not the dinosaur bits). Mr. Malick was born in 1943; he grew up in Waco, Texas. He is the eldest of three brothers. His youngest brother died in 1968 by suicide. (That brother was a gifted guitarist, just as in the film.)Once I read this, a lot of the film actually clicked -- though a good film requires no research or explanation, the STORY is the explanation. Obviously, this is the story of Malick's childhood, and the director (in his late 60s while filming this) was reflecting deeply on the passage of his own life, his family and the awful tragic loss of his young brother. I have no doubt that death impacted them all tremendously and caused his mother no end of grief.I have to say that I -- like so many here -- assumed, when we see Jessica Chastain get a telegram at the early part of the film, that the son died in Vietnam. The time line and period make this reasonable. But knowing the real story, that is less likely.I can only imagine a 67 year old man, reflecting on the brother who has never grown old, and the death of his parents (his mom in 2011 -- she was 99! and probably frail and his dad 2 years later) and his own mortality. What does that all mean in the scheme of things?But honestly, that would have been better asked in a biographical story. All the stuff about the planets and dinosaurs and beginning of life is just VERY pretentious, and looks like cobbled together bits of Cosmos. It is a bizarre lead-in to a story about a very middle class family in 50s Texas, a quite ordinary story at that. There is nothing here to suggest the younger brother is suicidal or depressed. Indeed, it is Malick's character (young Jack) who seems depressed, as both a kid and an adult (Sean Penn, phoning it in).The largest part of the film is just the family's quite ordinary everyday life in Waco in the year 1956, when Jack is about 12 or 13. It's lovely, but has absolutely nothing to say -- and is filmed through the glow of nostalgia. Waco, a dusty East Texas town, is shown as looking like a Pottery Barn catalog. The family lives in a HUGE old house, tastefully decorated with antiques and pastel colors. It is always summer. Oddly, it is as shady and tree-lined as some Midwest or East Coast area -- nothing like the Texas that I have visited.Criminally, the wonderful actress Jessica Chastain is wasted here, and spends the film hanging up laundry or walking through sprinklers or floating in the air (????). What is the point here? she grieved terribly for the loss of her young son; in time, she came to some acceptance of this through religious faith. Young Terence Malick was a very crabby and ungrateful kid, who did really mean things like blow up frogs with rockets and throws rocks through neighbor's window. In time, he grows up to be so pretentious he thinks HE ALONE is the entire reason for the existence of the universe, from the big bang to the sun collapsing into a black hole. The end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intensely human trip through time and space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm currently typing this review out on my iPhone, serving as my sole source of illumination as well as method of typing. I mention this because it just hit me, that the dimly lit LCD screen of my smartphone seems oddly reminiscent of the opening shot of Tree of Life: a wavering, phantasmagoric light which may or may not be God. I don't know. A few people sure like to address Him when the alien flame is on screen.At any rate, a movie is certainly doing it's job right when I can fondly recall the controlling idea of the film as a result of doing something simple, like blankly staring at my smartphone for an extended period. Tree of Life parallels the life of a family living in 1960s Texas, with the creation of the universe. There's a scene roughly 20 minutes into the 2-and-a-quarter-hour runtime where various cosmic anomalies are poetically presented in dramatic, staggering scale, as if resurrected from the early drafts of 2001's Star Gate sequence. The early Earth is shown, scarred red and black by the violent events preceding. The planet cools, however, and the Tree begins growing as life springs into existence, starting with cells, then plants, primitive animals, dinosaurs (the mass extinction scene is especially enchanting), and indirectly, us.Beyond the tremendous scale of the brilliantly executed camera-work, the scale of Malick's ambition is simply massive, encompassing the creation of everything that ever was and presenting it through the lives of such comparatively tiny entities. Jack is a sympathetic boy. He's not a bad person, he's just a kid, but he's shaped by the conflicting influences of his life, like peer pressure and sexual(?) desire. He's relatable in more ways than one. We were all kids once, we were all inexplicably confused by our own selves as we grew up. Mom and Dad may have names, may be vulnerable in the eyes of a few people, but are ultimately a force of nature who require titles and demand respect.The idea of living life one of two ways is presented very early on. "Nature" is strict, authoritative, and self-serving. "Grace" is forgiving and benignly open to the world. Jack will be shaped by these two opposing forces as he grows up, his parents personifying these lifestyles. Both learn from each other, in time.I dislike the idea of a film having a grandiose 'meaning', or having/prioritizing academic significance ('Somebody INTERPRET me!'). That's not what films were made to do. They were literally made with the purpose of visually depicting an event or piece of fiction. 'Depiction' is the buzz word. Tree of Life has awe striking visuals that depict the creation and expansion of the universe, laying the groundwork for Jack's experiences set in Malick's hometown of Waco. It was in my second viewing that I thought to myself, during these cosmic set pieces, "it all came from this". The tremendous magnitude of all history has literally, to this point been leading up to me, you, Jack, and everyone we know. Cue me fondly recalling this idea as I began writing this review.Oh, but I can't exclusively talk about the awesome scenes set in the cosmos, as intimidating and beautiful as they are. Malick seems to have an uncanny eye for delicate objects. Everything is shot with such raw feeling and intensity. Surely he's one of the most fiercely human-spirited filmmakers of all time, even if only for the skilled direction in cinematography. His aptitude for conservative, yet evocative screen writing is just overkill in this sense.I realize that this is the sort of film that everybody watching it could connect to, in some sense. Some more than others, sure, and not just counting our identical origins; by connecting to this family, I feel like I'm a part of the entire picture, that the cosmic voyage in the first act really was leading up to us. That Malick considered that we could so easily empathize with these characters, and be thereby brought into the idea of the grand design... Sly bastard. This is my second Malick movie, having recently seen To The Wonder in a specialized screening. I liked it a lot. I'm pretty well looking forward to seeing his other works, past and upcoming, having impressed me so much so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film will make a Terrence Malick fan out of people who have never even heard of him. If you didn't think his style was suited for some of the other stories he has told, such as "The Thin Red Line" and "The New World," have no fear because he has found his story here. I have never seen anything like this and most likely will never again. Some have compared it to 2001: A Space Odyssey and I can definitely see why, it is an epic that attempts to encompass so much such as the origins of life and the universe and the inevitable growth and decay, but this story is different in that these themes are explored through the interwoven story of a seemingly ordinary family in the 1950's, which has been described as semi-autobiographical. I could go on for a while about this extraordinary feat but I won't and I'll leave it at this: While this film may not be for everyone, it is definitely worth the two and a half hours it will take to watch it and see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched Terrence Malick's artistic dramatic masterpiece The Tree of Life (released on May 27, 2011) on Blu-ray disc for the fifth time. The film contains experimental elements and a non-linear narrative story.The first time I watched this film I was very impressed due to the artistic cinematography and the superb non-linear narrative as well as the structured dramatic story. One of the other movies that I've also watched multiple times that also has a non-linear narrative story is Quentin Tarantino's 1994 dark-comedy, crime drama Pulp Fiction.The idea for Tree of Life goes back to the late 1970s. Terrence Malick directed Day of Heaven (1978). He was working on a project named "Q" that would explore the origins of life on earth. He ultimately abandoned the project, but Pulp Fiction contains elements from it.The Tree of Life begins with a mysterious, wavering light, resembling a flame, which flickers in the darkness. I consider the development of the characters in the film to be truly artistic and the acting in the film was truly enjoyable.Sean Penn portrays a modern day, middle-age architect Jack O' Brian. He shows the audience his childhood life in suburban Waco, Texas in the 1950's with his parents, and his two younger brothers, R.L. and Steve.Jack's strict father Mr. O'Brian is portrayed by Brad Pitt, a man who easily loses his temper as he struggles to reconcile his love for his sons with wanting to prepare them for a world he sees as corrupt and exploitative. Mr. O'Brian also has passion for playing the piano.Jessica Chastain portrays Jack's mother Mrs. O'Brian. Jack's childhood flashbacks offer the viewer a glimpse into how he and his two brothers were often rebellious.The cinematography was sensational in great part because of the cinematographic close-ups of the underwater waves. The creation of the galaxy and earth was very well visualized due to the special effects and the cinematography of the film. Emmanuel Lubezki, the Mexican cinematographer on this film, should also be considered for an Oscar for best cinematography for his sensational work.Terrence Malick did an amazing job directing this film through his great command of his film crew. He should receive an Oscar for best director due to his outstanding film direction.Just like Citizen Kane (1941) and Memento (2001) once did, The Tree of Life is one of those films that adeptly handles flashbacks as integral to the story. I call this film an art film for its artistic cinematography and special, visual effects.139 minutes of the film was overall amazing. Here's my advice for the movie: It's definitely a must see! I give the film 4 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is what I call a pleasant surprise, I did not expect so much from this movie but surely had enormous to give.The main theme of this movie is centered around a family in the 1950's as they try to find the meaning of life by trying to communicate or waiting answers from God. One of the three boys dies at age 19 and from this on starts a religious debate of the role of God about this loss of the family.After the story is presented we witness an epic presentation of the universe and the birth of Galaxies, the solar system and Earth, trying to present Creation and importance of mankind beside this great process. This reminds me a little bit of Kubrick's 2001. When this begins the mother speaks to God if somehow is her fault that her son has died, why did He let him die, what does mankind mean to God?After the middle of the movie the story is re-centered to the family, more exactly to the father Mr. O'Brien(Brad Pitt) and the eldest son Jack(Hunter McCracken as boy, Sean Penn as adult) relationship. And in this case to, both are trying to communicate, speak to God to find answers, to be better in life, to each other.Other good point of the movie is the message to love in life ,with this the mother eventually will find peace for the death of her son. I did not knew before seeing the movie what is "The Tree of Life" about , specially seen in main roles Brad Pitt, Sean Penn but they did a pretty good job in this kind of roles to.</fullReview>

Loud I did play it and they were quite in the right. It is a terrific accomplishment of sight and sound. It ought to have come with another warning: "For optimal viewing, the producers of this Blu-Ray recommend you see it big." I have now seen all of Terrence Malick's movies and this is easily the most ambitious. It's about life and death, the universe and our place in it, God and deep human emotion. What else is there? When you leave this movie, and this is mostly true of the other Malick movies, you walk out to the edge of a sharp cliff and you can see down, far below you lie all other movies. They simply do not compete for ambition, maturity, thoughtfulness, and beauty. It just feels like something completely different.This is the story of a family. In what looks to be the late 60's, Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) receives a telegram and finds out that one of her sons has been killed. She and Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt) are hit hard by the loss. In the present day, Jack (Sean Penn) is working as an architect in Dallas. He is preoccupied with his past and contemplates life. The universe is born, galaxies formed, planets emerge, and on Earth life is created. Jack is born, brief moments of his early life go by, then his brothers are born and, in their young teenage years, the bulk of the story is told. Mr. O'Brien is tough on his sons R.L. (Laramie Eppler) and Steve (Tye Sheridan), but on the eldest son, Jack (Hunter McCracken), he is too tough. All of his own failings and troubles he takes out on Jack in the thought that he's getting him ready for life as he knows it to be. As Jack grows older, he has difficulty dealing with his thoughts and emotions about his father, his mother, pain, God, loss, plus all the ordinary things a young boy has to deal with.I think that the reason I never?but maybe once?thought about this movie being pretentious is that I basically ignore the voice overs. They feel to me to be optional. You can take a dip, listen in, but if you focus too hard, something else will pass you by. That's what makes The Tree of Life such a great movie. It's a beautiful film to watch (cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki) as it is to listen to its score (Alexandre Desplat) or soundtrack. Let me underline that, the score and soundtrack is perfect. The story is told as impressionistic. You only get an impression from one shot, whether it's a tear on Jack's face or a piece of dialogue, which will only last a moment before it cuts to another shot that might be Jack coming home and Mrs. O'Brien responding to Jack's hugging or avoiding her.Cut cut cut cut cut which keeps the energy of the film driving forward, developing your sense of the story and character. A movie is a rapid substitution of one picture for another, slightly different picture that gives the illusion of motion. That's how The Tree of Life operates. It's a delightful thing if you can watch it without conscious thought. I understand there are many of you out there?the sort that likes to guess the outcomes of mysteries, for example?that just can't find the dimmer on their brain to passively enjoy a movie. This is how I watch most movies. I turn down the lights and let the movie impress upon me. I suspect that this is why I enjoy The Tree of Life and To the Wonder (2013) (review) so much. When I can't turn it off or a movie isn't immersive enough to force it off, then it's going to be tough for me to enjoy.The cosmic interlude, if you haven't seen the movie, may strike the cynical viewer?and I certainly sympathize?as pretension writ large. Believe me when I tell you, it is astounding. Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is supposed to have one redeeming quality in the beauty of his planetary waltz. I'm having trouble finding words to describe how far it is surpassed by The Tree of Life. Obviously, that movie is a technical marvel for the time?with roughly twice the budget of The Tree of Life when adjusted for inflation?but the imagination on display during Malick's sequence is unparalleled. What makes it so great, and I think aloud here, is that it is still imbued with Malick's maturity and his eye, like he's capturing the moment without having planned it. Just "here it is."Read more at ProfRatigan.Wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully shot. Excessively boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So after reading so many reviews of this critically acclaimed film I finally decided to purchase and watch it. What a complete waste of ?3.75. I knew that i would either be wowed or utterly disappointed, and unfortunately it was the latter. There is simply very little plot- within the first 15 minutes we find out that a family had lost their son, of whom the father had a love/hate relationship with. And that is it. The rest of the movie, all 2 hours of it, reveal absolutely nothing else. It is just a string of random clips put together with some music and occasional talking (of which was very cringe worthy). The clips looked like they had been stolen from Planet Earth and i was expecting David Attenborough to start speaking as the film showed space, the creation of germs and even dinosaurs, all strung together with the main characters questioning of existence. The constant "why is this happening to me?" whispered so quietly it sounded like a moan, over the top of a 5 minute shot of planet Earth was very annoying. I was quite ready to turn it off after 20 minutes, however i made myself watch until the end as i wanted the film to redeem itself, perhaps with a plot twist or more information of this sons death. It did not. There was no closure to the story, and sometimes this is good in films, but it was extremely frustrating in this film. The only reason i give it a 2 out of 10 is simply because it was beautifully shot and the performance of Brad Pitt was very good (the 20 minutes we see of him during the entire film). This film could have been a real masterpiece- the idea of life and death and how it effects us all is a story we can all connect to, however it was not pulled off. I was desperately trying to find the point and any deeper meaning the film had by the end. I could not. It's one of those films i think you have to see, it is completely different, but i do warn you- it may be the most boring two hours of your life you will ever spend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent but dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tree of Life has stunning images, spectacular cinematography and excellent acting. But it is also incredibly dull. And I don't mean 'deep and meaningful' dull, I mean 'check your watch' dull. Having read several reviews beforehand, I was more than ready to be relaxed and let the film 'wash over me' without being judgemental. It wasn't easy though; the scenes were more like random thoughts in a dream, which can work in films sometimes, but not here. I did actually get excited towards the end when I realised there was only 20 minutes left to go and that we might finally be approaching something that would make the previous two hours seem worthwhile. There was nothing. Some films dare to be different, push boundaries and result in a surprising, entertaining or moving experience, but Tree of Life is not one of them. However, the film did have some genuinely amazing cinematic moments. There were some superb performances from the cast and the relationship between the father (Brad Pitt) and his sons was quite intriguing. I've therefore decided to give it a realistic 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know a lot of people are giving this film low ratings. That's because they are not able to understand the specific purpose this film is trying to make and they are likely too bored to sit throughout the movie.I thought this film was outstanding otherwise. The Tree Of Life depicts life and shows once a child is born it enters stages and grows further into childhood. I found it to be a little walk through life and childhood and I enjoyed every part even the long sequences they had in there. I thought Jessica Chastain and Brad Pitt's performances were quite phenomenal. The emotion that they have plays out very well and make you feel like you're there, sometimes it may make you feel like you can relate to it. Of course, I'm sure that this will not catch all audiences attention, but The Tree Of Life on my opinion was a definite masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Profound and Pretentious At the Same Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is for advanced cinema geeks only. It is the complete opposite of a Michael Bay movie; if you like TRANSFORMERS or AVATAR, then you'll want to avoid this movie like the plague. In fact, even cineastes who will watch any obscure film of any kind have trouble dealing with TREE OF LIFE because of its unusual layout.The structure has already been laid out in another fine review. And everybody has laid out how clearly subjective the whole thing is. So I'll condense the properties of it.Terrence Malick often favors non-narrative tone-poem visuals but this one is unorthodox even for him. At times it feels like Malick is imitating other directors with very different styles to get at what he's trying to say. He feels that the subconscious feelings in the images are more important than the story--in some way, the story exists as a framework to find the images.In the case of TREE OF LIFE, Malick wants to speak volumes about small things on a cosmic scale, and the methods he employs to do it makes it seem disjointed. He uses experimental avant-garde film techniques akin to Stan Brakhage and Jonas Mekas to create textures and associations, then uses Godard-esque editing techniques to assemble the images in a fluctuating emotional montage that has very little logical coherency. He cuts things together based on what happens in the moments, not whether the moments have any chronological importance. So the film skips over entire sections of time just to get a few seconds of something ephemeral.Yes, there is are reasons for it, but the question is whether those reasons justify the approach. Well, it does and it doesn't.The film is visually amazing; all those comparisons to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY are true. But trying to blend the creation of the universe and the nature of existence with the incredibly detailed emotional experience of a family in 1950s Texas doesn't really gel. I think Malick's personally feels that the internal life of the boys and the birth of creation have the same emotional weight, and that unfortunately makes the movie kind of overwrought to most of us.The scale, visuals, and overall vision are nothing short of full-blown astounding; there's nothing even remotely like it anywhere else in film today. But unfortunately, it's also a bit indulgent and discombobulated, making it equal parts profound and pretentious at the same time.I like it myself, but it is an extremely acquired taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick's work of visual beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The career of Terrence Malick has been one of visual poetry and philosophical metaphors. His most metaphoric and symbolic film yet is The Tree of Life. The Tree of Life shows the growing pains of the '50s with little dialogue contrasted with images from the formation of the universe. Malick's symbolism has never been as poetic, but it can also be viewed as a bit pretentious. Nevertheless, Malick has created a wonderful work of art filled with uncanny visual power and his usual originality. All in all, it is not Malick's biggest success as a filmmaker but it is a success for cinema. Love those images from the universal and physical passages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably my most disappointing film experience ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should start by telling you that I am a huge Terrence Malick fan. The Thin Red Line was one of the most influential films I've ever seen. I really enjoyed The New World. Days of Heaven was very interesting. Badlands was alright. When I saw the trailer for the Tree of Life I was blown away. They totally captivated me. It seemed it would be the most important viewing of my life.I waited and waited for its release. It didn't play close enough for me to see in theaters so i bought the blue-ray just so i could get the DVD. I thought it almost completely lacked any narrative. Mind you, I'm not referring to narrative with little dialogue, but a lack of narrative completely. I looked at the biblical comparisons upon a second viewing, but it was still pretty weak. It felt like a 30 minute short film cut in with 2 additional hours of random montages. I was pretty crushed. I have friends who liked it and friends who hated it.I can just say that for myself it was the most disappointed I've ever been. Where was the film from the trailer i watched dozens upon dozens of times? Oh well, if people get something good out of it then that's awesome. I came away very sad for the death of the story I thought I'd be getting. Apparently Sean Penn agrees. Check out the trivia for the film on IMDb and you'll see what I mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrence Malick needs to be credited for his acute style of writing in THE TREE OF LIFE. I am certain Malick is over the moon with his production shortlisted for the Oscars 2012. It is assumed that several rounds of voting's take place prior to the final nominations being announced. I am baffled now as I was then when I heard that THE TREE OF LIFE and EXTREMELY LOUD &amp; INCREDIBLY CLOSE made the cut over more broadly recognized movies of 2011. The only thing that did run through my mind during THE TREE OF LIFE is what exactly was Sean Penn's entire purpose? Walking through a city, stumbling over rocks, walking across red sand and then finally I believe walking to heaven and back. What is he doing? My answer lies in the words of Sean Penn himself."I didn't at all find on the screen the emotion of the script, which is the most magnificent one that I've ever read," Sean Penn Said. "A clearer and more conventional narrative would have helped the film without, in my opinion, lessening its beauty and its impact". "Frankly, I'm still trying to figure out what I'm doing there and what I was supposed to add in that context! What's more, Terry himself never managed to explain it to me clearly." If this is response from Sean Penn after during the premier what more would I need to emphasize on.A movie that is stiff to watch (MELANCHOLIA) always ends up on a note that is hard to forget. In the case of THE TREE OF LIFE revisiting the movie just for the purpose of the article on its own is unquestionably painful to me. The Key word here is that it's painful to ME. On another note Malicks production does seem to have earned a certain amount of positive vibes by a few critics. Yet would this be the case at all had this been a production without Brad Pitt and Sean Penn. This is where the key to its success lie; sheer star power!I could not grasp her one bit; maybe you could.Good Luck!TITLE: THE TREE OF LIFE DIRECTED BY: TERRENCE MALICK STARRING: BRAD PITT, SEAN PENN, JESSICA CHASTAIN &amp; HUNTER MCCRAKEN RATED: PG13 FOR SOME THEMATIC MATERIAL RATED:03/10 139 MINUTES</fullReview>

If I were to rate the film at that point a 1 or 2 would have been generous. I would say I had seen better low budget B- horror flicks. But I did not stop. I happened to receive a call from someone whose opinion I value and trust and all they wanted to do was rave about how good this movie they had just seen was. I asked him which movie that was and he told me, "Tree of Life." We discussed what he liked and what I hated and many of those same things seemed to bring out the polar opposite result from each of us. I went back and finished watching it trying to take his praises to heart but I still hated it. I respected it but hated it. Don't feel bad if you are a hater.

In the first 50 minutes, the mother gets a letter saying her kid is dead. She tells the father. It goes into some scenes of the future where the brother is distraught about his brother dying many years ago. Then comes a bunch of scenery with abstract music...Taking place in space, the woods, the woods with dinosaurs, and abstract morphing art... While beautifully shot, you're better off just watching "Home" which is far more interesting and beautiful.So, skip 50 minutes in and you'll start the movie where the kids start growing up and is a pretty interesting story with some GREAT acting by all involved.The last 20 minutes comes more abstract stuff...Sean Penn going in the desert, and everybody together again with the dead brother at the ocean.The last 20 minutes comes a bunch more nature and space scenery</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2/10 unfortunately - Mallick gets marks for great cinematography and ability to direct children... but unfortunately that is all that is positive about this overlong exercise in what appears to be psychotherapy for the great director.After seeing the great 'Thin Red Line,' by Mallick I was hoping for a similarly complex and satisfying exploration on the meaning of existence and relationships between and within people, people and war, people and nature. But,alas, what we get instead is a too personal and narrow vision of a family grieving for a lost son and an odd, albeit visually impressive,depiction of the origins of the universe, solar system, earth, life etc. slap in the middle of it. I understand, or rather, I think I understand that its a comment on the majesty and vastness yet impersonal nature of the universe seen through the eyes of the grieving, testing their belief in grace.. and that what we are grieving is not just the son, but the very fact of our self-awareness that we are alone in the universe.. but somehow it all left me cold and impatient. Why? I'm not sure, maybe it is because the opening 1/2 hour when we are introduced to the family doesn't draw us in emotionally, or maybe it is that this is not a film that was actually meant for the entertainment or engagement of audiences and more to do with the creator satisfying his philosophical queries or resolving his psychological conflicts or,uncharitably,soothing his ego.(Which given the too obvious oedipal themes in the film - is not too hard to believe),</fullReview>

Through the whole movie I understood completely what was going on and what was being con vied but in the end what came out were some beautiful screen shots of the film that belong in a picture frame you buy or the wallpaper on your computer. It lacks an actual plot all the while try to make up for it in symbolic scenes where the viewer is supposed to find deep meaning in them.

		<fullReview>I should make clear straight away that I'm not averse to slow, thoughtful films and a bit or arty-ness. The reason I didn't like this film is not due to a lack of capacity.But this film does not have a plot or a story. It's (as far as we got) basically a collection of short and mostly quite abstract fragments, like seeing snippets from a family's home video collection.Those snippets are artfully presented and use some interesting cinematography - but not interesting enough to keep me engaged for more than about 10 minutes.I initially thought that the dream-like fragments of imagery were going to form a kind of introduction before the story proper kicks in. After 10 minutes I was thinking "this is going on a bit .. " and after 20 it was dawning on me that perhaps actually, the whole film was like this. After 30 I'd got tired of waiting for something interesting to happen and switched off.I guess that there is a deep and much-pondered-upon reason for doing the film in this way. Perhaps it's intended to have the feel of reminiscence, and the way in which we recall the past as momentary fragments of time... If that's the case, it works. The film certainly does evoke a hazy dream-like feeling.That doesn't stop it from also being quite boring. As far as we watched, nothing actually happened. It was like sitting through the haphazardly arranged holiday photos of an anonymous family who have experienced a bit of tragedy at some point.So story and narrative is important to you, you're unlikely to enjoy this film. If you are adept at finding interest in meandering arty-ness with no obvious point, you may enjoy it and evidently you may even love it for it's difference.Personally... I think being different is easy, being good is hard!I did enjoy the "creation of the world" imagery though, it's just that I'd prefer to see that in a 5 minute short-film.</fullReview>

When a director does that, it is unforgivable, as it was in 1932, and it is in 2012, no matter how beautiful some of the cinematography. Since the actors had hardly any lines to speak, and very little physical acting to do, how are we supposed to assess their performances? All in all, a bad film IMHO. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American film director Terrence Malick's fifth feature film release, in four decades in the business, The Tree Of Life, is a film that, in parts, has some of the greatest techniques and moments ever recorded in film history, but it also has some fatal narrative flaws that prevent it from outright greatness, as an overall work of art, and possibly the worst ending to a near-great film since Akira Kurosawa's 1950 classic, Rashomon, while at the same time having one of the most self-indulgent and showoffy endings to a film since Federico Fellini's 8?. More reprehensible than anything the film does, positively or negatively, is how utterly over the top some praise of the film has been, and how utterly ridiculous some of the criticism of the film has been. Granted, some of this has been generated by Malick, and the promotional efforts for the film, but, frankly, many big name, and lesser name critics, have simply imbued and misconstrued their own critical lack and imaginative dead rot into their reviews, and missed the boat on this film, from some of its most basic elements through its more nuanced themes and evocations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tree Of Life is a pretty fantastic "underrated" movie It's obviously a visual masterpiece, the scenes and filming techniques are just fantastic, showing fractured pieces of a puzzle i am too stupid to understand. Every frame in this film is meaningful and thoughtfully composed. From my understanding, the movie, as modern and progressive it's views may be, shows true to a certain reliance on nature, on god; and idea which to many from the new age, is arcane. Sparked by a death in the beginning, the movie delves into many ideas that make up the backbone of our views of life and death. There is a solid 10-20 minute sequence detailing the beginning of the universe, the formation of star systems, the generation of planets, and the evolution of life. The movie then begins to abstractly pluck out specific memories from early times of the beautifully portrayed subject family, a nurturing time in which the children and the parents morph and change through specifically shown symbolic sequences. There is much conflict between the father, Brad Pitt, and his children, as they run from him and seek refuge with their mother. As many themes, ideas, and visuals are presented in this movie, the most pertinent is the idea of an arrow of time which moves only forward, leaving us to long the past and cherish all that is good and bad in life, for everything (every. thing.) is beautiful. The appreciation of the beautiful is the appreciation of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As others have, I also thought of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey while watching this hot mess. However, my thoughts were about how badly this film fails to come close to achieving the obvious emulation of Kubrick's fine effort. This one is not only not even in the ballpark, they hadn't even found directions to the parking lot entrance. The imagery is totally corny, to the point of being funny (Those scenes near the end on the beach with all of the zombies walking around dazed and confused was like something from an amateur community playhouse.) The "space" images are all photos that are badly overused and easily recognizable to those with even the slightest knowledge of the cosmos. The images that are womb-like are just plain silly.Pitt's character was just plain mean to his sons, often to the point of being difficult to watch. Jessica Chastain wandered through the movie like she was auditioning for a stint with The Blue Man Group. Although I'm not sure she (or anyone) could have played the part any differently. As Penn has said, his part was so detached that it just didn't work; it would have been an improvement had his part been written out of the screenplay. The boys had the best parts, and that isn't saying much. They all did a superb job, but the parts didn't lend them to anything close to endearing.Total fail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about this film I was not that bothered about seeing it, having watched The New World also by Mallick which I found pretentious and rather boring to be frank. However this movie blew me away. It certainly is not for everyone and you have to be in the right mood to watch it, much like The Fountain by Darren Aronofosky. I think this movie has more substance than The Fountain though, because it is more of a celebration of all aspects of life, the big and the small, and The Fountain was more of a enlightening trip. I found the film to be beautifully rendered, it reminded you of all the beauty there is in the little things if you take the time to look, and I think it is important to be reminded of that. The whispers throughout the film made it become pretentious after a while but I understand why they were there, I guess to correspond with our thoughts and how we sometimes feel a need to whisper too. Because the film was from a boys point of view I did find it hard to connect with some of the material, like the need for his father to accept him as he is and blowing up toads. I loved the dinosaur scene, though I'm not sure dinosaurs would have had that kind of humanity back then. Overall I thought the film worked because you can tell how much thought had gone into every scene and shot. The child actors weren't that bad which was a nice surprise and Brad Pitt does a convincing performance of a typical 1950's dad. I recommend this film to film lovers who appreciate this kind of movie and aren't expecting a linear spelled out plot with lots of explosions. Its a film to think about and to watch several times, with lots important hidden messages and questions to sift out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tree of Life: Review By BladeRunner391</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(POSSIBLE SPOILERS MAY HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW!!!)Prologue: The Tree of Life is by far the most controversial and talked about movie of 2011. It has polarized many viewers for its (lack of) plot and dialogue, surrealistic symbolic imagery, which is typical in Malick films, and his directorial style. It's most (In)famous sequence is a 17 minute scene where we are shown of the birth of the universe and the inception of life on Earth. The film then jumps to the 1950's where we trace the development of 11-12 year old Jack O'Brien, where we witness his loss of innocence and his struggle between the way of nature (Mr. O'Brien) and grace (Mrs. O'Brien).Synopsis: This is a work of art, pure and simple. As other reviewers have mentioned, one of the highlights of the film is the cinematography by Emanuel Lubeski. You can hang every frame of this film on your wall. It captures the true essence of life and death in a way that no film has before. This is the most realistic depiction of childhood I've ever seen in a major motion picture, rivaling Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows. There are many sequences that have little to no dialogue and don;t seem to fit into the rest of the film, but once it reaches its beautiful climax, everything comes together. The imagery of the film comes close to surrealism and judging by the IMDb's discussion board this has infuriated many viewers. No seriously, at one point you see the mother freaking hovering over the ground next to a tree (But admittedly it is one of the film's most beautiful scenes). Anyways, I didn't mind this too much and it made for some nice discussions between me and my family. The birth of the universe was hands down the best sequence of the entire movie, where it balances outstanding practical effects (this should have won the visual effects Oscar), and classical music that was perfectly selected and matches the tone and scope of the scene. This movie is virtually impossible to describe in words, so I would advise you go and see it, preferably in a theater.Pros: Lubeski's cinematography Malick's direction The classical music (Which unfortunately was not included in the soundtrack) The acting (This is Pitt's best performance) The visual effectsCons: Very confusing upon first ( and second) viewing Sean Penn is in the movie for under ten minutes The entire movie feels unfinished ( there is however rumored to be a six hour cut, which I would totally watch :D) It gets extremely slow at around the 90 minute markFinal Score: 10 of 10. The cons I listed were not enough to stop this movie from receiving a perfect score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tree of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no trouble recalling my maiden voyage in Mr. Malick's cinematic set-ups, 6 years ago THE NEW WORLD (2005, and a medium 6/10 in my rating system), which I almost forsook due to an extreme frazzle (a grudge rising from anger more than tiresomeness), then after a couple of years, the second time is with DAYS OF HEAVEN (1978), which unexpectedly procures my staunch affection, a 9/10. So the third one comes now, notched up the Golden Palm in Cannes last year, it's Malick at his best, though a 139 minutes running time could be physically exhausting and mentally innovative. The film is entangled with an eternal mythology of life and contains tons of visual stunts to eclipse any films before, but the inexplicable distance is also like an eternal wheel, it defies all the habitual principles of film-watching, the uneasiness of a lengthy exposition of the familiar confrontation (in particular the father-son bond), the hand-held camera whose angle at most of its time complies in a child's prospect, plus an unlooked-for jump in between which relates to surreally breathtaking montages of nature and space as if it is a polychromatic program from national geography (save the dinosaur scenes, it could not be more anti-documentary).The superstar cast is astoundingly palpable which is a leap from THE NEW WORLD, Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain are steadfast in their emotion presiding roles, the new-comer Hunter McCracken is uncannily memorable thanks to the camera lingering around him most of the time. It is also one of the most beautiful shot film ever, if you like photography, you will like it, if you believe in mythological philosophy, you might love it, but if you are a true poet, this is the cup of tea you will ecstatically devour, as for myself, I appreciate its existence to cater for the sort of the said category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't work for me - too abstract</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am watching trying to watch all 9 movies nominated for the best picture academy award this year prior to the AAs on Sunday. I have 6 down, 3 to go. I rented this on BluRay. It's not that I don't get it per say. It's just that it didn't work for me. I understand that they are trying to make an artistic work and not a traditional film. It just didn't work for me. Art is like that. It connects for some people and not for others.I am starting to think that the academy would be better off shrinking the list of best picture movies back to 5.There were just too many nature scenes that went on for too long. And the ending was just too abstract. Did he die as an adult? And that beach scene was heaven?The acting was actually good, so it is perhaps harsh of me to only give it 1 star, but that is all that it merits.--After writing my initial review above, I thought about the movie The Diving Bell and the Butterfly - which was great (unlike Tree of Life). They had a nature scene to represent death at the end of the movie. But it was pretty much shown with the closing credits (after a fabulous movie). It worked. It wasn't 45 minutes (that's what it felt like at least) of nature scenes in the middle of a movie that had barely got started (aka tree of life) and didn't do a whole lot when it came back from the 45 minute nature scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen more interesting Independent Serbian Silent Films than this piece of artsy-farts garbage. I actually jumped ahead to the spoiler so I do not have to agonize through 139 minutes of this hell.They need to call this "The Tree of Taking My Life" because 30 minutes of this movie has brought me to that point. I saw that Heath Ledger was supposed to play a leading role in this movie. I guess we know what action he took to not have to be affiliated with this cinema-graphic nightmare.There is no need to add all of these shots of volcano's, outer-space, veins and stock footage from "Land of the Lost." These scenes do not make this film seem "smarter" or "more creative." All they do is make me want to get up and put my laundry in the dryer.I am glad this was a freebie from Redbox.Other than that, this is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conveys what eternity is like - because it feels endless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a contemplation about eternity, familial love, the meaning of life, and the nature of God...and it is horrible. Most of the dialog is whispered in voice-over that is more often than not unintelligible. Suddenly random montages of dinosaurs, jelly fish, and volcanoes take up twenty or more pointless minutes before returning to Sean Penn riding up and down an elevator, silently, for several minutes, or children crying for no obvious reason, or a boy putting a woman's slip in a river. It is the most pretentious movie that I have ever seen. There is a fine line between art and self indulgence -- this movie goes far beyond it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worst use of symbolism ever. Extremely bad editing - cutting away too quickly and not giving you enough information. Excellent actors - if they were given more dialogue and more interaction with one another. It would have been better if there were less space pictures from the Hubble Telescope and why so many waterfalls and dinosaurs. We all get it! Life, the Universe and everything. When people think about these things they don't actually see this sort of stuff unless they are smoking something. Well, maybe I would have enjoyed the movie if I was smoking something. - Note this is not a recommendation. Brad Pitt's acting is very good for his part. It is too bad they did not utilize Sean Penn's talent with the minimalistic dialogue. It would have made more sense. The only thing I can say for this movie is if you can get through it, there is food for thought. I do not recommend watching this movie if you expect a plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean no disrespect to the actors or crew involved in this movie. In fact, I think it had the potential to be a great movie; it simply is not.Perhaps I'm simply not enlightened, educated, or avant-garde enough to 'appreciate' the hidden brilliance in this film.For me, the movie was VERY slow and VERY boring. This movie actually makes movies like Emma and Little Women seem like action thrillers. It reminded me of certain movies from the 70s in which the director, for some reason, would choose to pan along a wall, silently, for a good 30 to 60 seconds... No sound, no dialogue, no important points with regard to the plot. It simply 'was.' I suspect that if one took out the silent 'panning' of random places and events from this movie, the story would not change one iota and the length of this film would be less than half its length; maybe even less. And NO, I AM NOT joking about that; I'm being literal.If, however, you enjoy lengthy scenes of people silently walking in non-nondescript settings then you will flat out LOVE this movie. That's just not my thing.I like movies that have dialogue and a point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistic, maybe IMAX material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is basically art house dribble. It's well photographed. Some of the imagery is over the top. I think for me it would have played better in an Imax showing. I certainly don't think it's worth 12 bucks or more however. Maybe $8 for a saver deal..maybe that doesn't exist at that price, but it's not really worth more than that.This film will end up in the Walmart box of DVD's for $5 or less by 2012. It might actually get a resurgence as that Mayan date approaches because of all the afterlife nonsense in it. It did have a good basic principle about living in nature or grace. The convoluted story revolves around childhood, family, death of a child, and the afterlife. It tries to piece some meaning together of human existence in the fabric of all existence and creation. It really ends up being just a montage of short photography clips with short spurts of some decent, but wasted acting.This isn't a masterpiece, and it's very boring and hard to stick with. This is definitely not for everyone, and if you just want to rest your head back and enjoy the imagery it may not be too bad, but for most, it will leave you depressed. It's really an art piece for an artist.I can't recommend this film for the average person. There are so many other choices out there with a real plot and acting, so I'd skip this for an actual theater trip. Maybe if you smoke some weed it might work. Even then, you'll probably want to jump from a huge "Tree" after it's over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Christian Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder why people don't mention this? It's Malick's address to God. That's what the movie is about. It repeats Malick's frequent theme of the loss of innocence in the Garden of Eden. Innocence is lost when authority is rebelled against. There's also a Cain and Abel aspect. These seem to me to be the more obvious Biblical references, not the Book of Job as some critics have said. In the end, Malick affirms his belief in God and Heaven.I wasn't too interested in the Christianity aspect but I did find the family drama interesting. I wondered how much of it could be autobiographical--did Malick have a bad relationship with his father? Did his mother identify with the children and subtly turn them against their father's authority? Was the son who died identified with the father (in the film, through music) and thus his death was hard to get over for Malick because of the ambivalency that would have been tied up in it? I'm puzzled by comments that the boy who later becomes Sean Penn "witnesses" the loss of innocence. It is he who loses his innocence. This is the interesting part of the movie. The galaxies, the dinosaurs, the field of sunflowers are pretty but not the important parts of the movie.Overall I found the film worthwhile even though I do not share Malick's philosophy. It is a psychologically accurate film and as usual for Malick gorgeous to look at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Malick's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One person walked out halfway through. At the end, when the words, 'Written and Directed by Terrence Malick' appeared on the screen, the man in the row behind me said "Thank God" (and the rest of that sentence isn't "...for Terrence Malick movies.") As we exited the theater, employees were there asking how we enjoyed it. The guy in front of me said, "Didn't. Didn't care for that at all." This film has received wildly mixed reactions from audiences. It's a matter of what you're expecting. A strong narrative should not be expected and was not sought by the filmmaker. The film opens with parents dealing with the death of one of 3 boys, who's only shown briefly as a young boy. This paves the way for the film's theme of change, the how of it. Malick also deals with the How, as in its occurrence in nature. The Tree of Life is very thin on plot. But the story and themes of the film are strong. The characters are strong and well portrayed. Malick gets impressive performances out of everyone, most notably the 3 boys who play the O'Brien sons. No two people will view The Tree of Life in the same way. Everyone will get something different about it, if they can tolerate it. Understandably, some won't be able to. Though strong, The Thin Red Line (which I hold to be one of the best films of all time) and The New World are both better Malick films than Tree of Life. Some scenes and editing choices are culprits in its shortcomings. For example, some scenes seem to begin too late, not allowing the viewer to catch up with what's going on. The reason for some shots is not known. I'm OK with cutting in shots whose meaning is not known, as pieces of a puzzle, to be put together later in the viewer's mind. But some parts of these proceedings take you right out of the film and you're left to get yourself back into it. There are a couple such instances. So it's not perfect but if you've got the right attitude going in, you might like this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Terrence Malick shoots for the stars, and misses. While he aims to explore deep existential issues about family and the meaning of life, the movie comes off as a garbled mess almost completely devoid of plot or dialog. The extent to which the geniuses that are Brad Pitt and Sean Penn are wasted is literally painful to watch.For the bulk of the movie, predictable and uncreative scenes of Fifties American suburban family life are constantly juxtaposed with a mishmash of planets, waterfalls, and the like. It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to see that Director Terrence Malick is trying to imply that the universal spirit is embodied and carries on in all these wonders of life. While that's an admirably lofty goal, in the movie, it comes off as sophomoric at best. These gratuitous shots are more like generic stock footage with classical music playing in the background than new material. In my opinion, these scenes (like the rest of the movie) lacked anything original, creative, or interesting,This is one movie that an IMDb review could never have a "spoiler" for, If you tried, it would read something like "Sean Penn's character comes in, doesn't say much of anything, then doesn't do much of anything, and then it cuts to some planets." I'm not talking about one scene either here, folks, it felt like half the movie was these five minute long shots of planets, waterfalls, and at one completely incoherent moment, even a dinosaur! I don't mean to be harsh, and I know that everyone has their own opinion about movies, but it's literally seriously inconceivable to me that anyone in their right mind could watch this movie and think it's anything but an abomination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watch movies to take a mini-vacation by getting lost in a story, or experience another world, be educated, or simply be entertained. I am not, it's safe to say, a demanding audience. I'm the person on Netflix who has never rated anything below a 3, because I'm grateful for being entertained. I like most movies better than other people do. (Notable exception being 'Descendants', which despite its reviews and awards, fell far short of what it could have been, but hey, Clooney did his twinkle eyes, so I didn't complain.) I'm easily amused, I WANT to be entertained, I WANT to enjoy whatever movie I watch. I'm not a critic, I'm a consumer who wants to be happy! Alas, I watched this movie two days ago, and am still stewing about how terrible it was. My first three criteria had no chance; and I was not even mildly entertained. There was no story revealed ("A" child died, this would seem important, but evidently not to the filmmakers, because I couldn't tell which one or how; nor could I tell which child Penn plays, but I didn't much care about that, because well it's Sean Penn) ... I would not have cured cancer or the common cold in those 139 minutes, but I could have watched a good movie, done my taxes, or cleaned out my closet, any of which would have been more enjoyable.Some have said this movie is deeply intellectual, perhaps beyond the grasp of we minions. Like most people on here, I use my brain for a living and am capable of complex thought. I do not, however, feel any obligation to perform whatever mental gymnastics would have been required in order to make the damn dinosaurs and whirly stuff have a damn thing to do with what passed for a plot. This struck me as a director throwing in bizarre and unrelated scenes to make himself seem ... intellectual? However, if someone can give me a good reason - no ANY reason - for the dinosaurs, I'll be forever grateful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Picture in search of a viewer - are you the one?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick never made it easy for anyone when shooting a film - not for himself, not for his investors, and rarely for the viewers of his work. "The Tree of Life", which Malick also wrote, is his most personal and uncompromising picture to date, his grand oeuvre, with key elements of his biography woven into the plot (his brother e.g. committed suicide at the age of 19). Malick doesn't shun from re-discovering cinema as an art form, go for a meditative slow pace, deal with universe deep issues centering around spirituality and put a popular actor like Brad Pitt in it - with predictable results. Audiences are either alienated by the result or call it pretentious, yet for the group that remains a movie like this is a true gift. Count me in the latter category: "The Tree of Life" is an all time classic, and will have a long life on the shelves of cinephiles.The film is about a Texan family who has to cope with the loss of a family member, and the questions why and how to deal with it. From there we zoom out from the microcosm of rural family life to the birth of the universe and back again to change perspectives and put things in relation. At the heart of it all is the conflict between grace, the life of love and acceptance and the way of nature which only pleases itself. In that sense Malick's work as a whole is desperately in search of a viewer who joins him on the journey to find identity and meaning, just like the characters themselves.Back in the days, in 1968 to be precise, when someone else tried a philosophical approach in a movie, it was not received well at all, resulting in walkouts and complaints about a lacking narrative structure and no entertainment value whatsoever. That movie was "2001" - now considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. Douglas Trumbull once was mastermind of the visual effects that made "2001" an unforgettable experience, and in 2011 he joined Malick's endeavor. Well, the beauty of these shots shows. And as far as I'm concerned, history may as well repeat itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tree of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw The Tree of Life in a stuffy theatre, with a screen the size of a TV, that could take around 20 people and was not even half full. I didn't think of it at the time, but it is a bit amusing that such a huge film was shown in such a small room; the film deals with (the somewhat contrived dichotomy of) nature and grace, it juxtaposes the birth of the universe with the birth of a child and the dialogue is predominantly made up of whispers to god.What I really like about the film is the structure. Instead of smearing the universal images over the entire film, Terrence Malick kind of shocks the audience by throwing it all in after like 20 minutes. I kept an eye on my watch this time and noticed that the segment was a lot shorter than I had remembered (and that I wanted it to be), but it is nevertheless an extraordinary way to break the conventional narrative. Not that the film is all that conventional before or after that; it takes almost an hour before we get anything other than disconnected images or fragments of a conversation.As for the acting, the kids are all wonderful, but the most impressive performance is still probably Brad Pitt as the stern father. He doesn't really play the father, he is the father in a way that I've rarely seen before. Sean Penn is, well...I'm not saying the film would have been better if he was in it more, but I would probably also be upset if I was one of the biggest actors in the world and still had the same amount of screen time as a plesiosaur.I call films beautiful all the time, but it is seldom as deserving as it is for The Tree of Life. The visuals are the most obvious source of beauty; a lot of the images during the universe segment are jaw-dropping, and the way the camera hovers around the characters and into the sky creates very dreamlike and nostalgic feelings. The gorgeous music (such as John Taverner's otherworldly Funeral Canticle) only accentuates these feelings. But most of all, perhaps, it really might be the most beautiful film I have seen about childhood and growing up, and it evokes so many things in me. One scene that stood out to me was the kind of tragic but at the same time unabatedly joyous moment when the father had left for a business trip and the children were running around, playing with their mother. The fractured narrative plays out like a series of memories, just sort of floating around as a brief glimpse of or ode to life in the midst of nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT. I am a movie buff. There is really only one genre of film that I do not like. That would be the 'artsy' film. I have had people telling me their take on symbolisms in certain artsy movies. I understand the symbolism, I just don't enjoy it in a movie. For the first 15 minutes or so, it was a movie, with people. A vague, cloaked story seemed to be lurking in there, somewhere. Then, out of the blue, we were hit with an array of odd imagery and classical music and opera. This went on for a bit, then we had several nature scenes. Then, are you ready for it? ......... Dinosaurs. Yes, dinosaurs. Then imagery from space. OK, we are now roughly 35 minutes in. Where did the cast go? I felt like it was now a different movie, but I don't remember changing it. Oh, now we are back to seeing the cast again. So we had a half an hour of something that would be at home on the Discovery Channel. Oh, wait, OK, well, not sure what that was all about. Now we see a leaf on the ground. Then it blows away. I guess that's it for the leaf. Hmmm, alright, now it seems we are watching a child growing up. Still waiting for some relevant dialogue. Well we are now 45 minutes in, the end is drawing near. WHAT???? This is over 2 hours long? Oh sweet lord NOOOOO!!!!!I realize some people find this type of film riveting and haunting. Which may explain it's high star rating. Myself, I'm afraid I simply can not give it more than a 2. There may have been a good movie in there, but I found it got lost amongst the odd scenes.

It is, however, visually stunning, richly complex, accented with billowing subtle, surreal, and vivid graphic scenes backed with a score of classical masterpieces. Words can't do justice to this abstract cinematographic work of art. But, it is as abstract a film as any painting in a modern art museum. Unfortunately, as with an abstract painting, this film leaves a lot to the viewer to interpret; which is not typically what we expect from mainstream films.Although "The Tree of Life" is beautiful, it is inaccessible to most of the movie-going public, hence all the 1 star reviews. It's cryptic, at best, and has too many holes and interruptions that draw the viewer away from finding continuity in the story. Film is a communication from actors, directors, and writers. Unfortunately, just as with any other form of artistic expression, if the artist(s) don't effectively convey their vision, or provide the audience with a key for interpreting the vision the audience won't understand or relate to the work. And such is the case with "The Tree of Life".It is a noble attempt to convey intensely personal, complex, and emotional events of life in a way that has rarely been attempted. I appreciated from a purely audio-visual art-work perspective. It was too long and disorienting to be considered a good film. It's beautiful and thought-provoking, but not successful in making a connection with its audience.Some day this might be thought of as a landmark in cinematic expression. Today, it's an unsuccessful attempt at stretching the conceptual boundaries of conventional film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I grew up in the 50's. Yes, most of us who did grow up in the 50's in this type of environment had similar experiences as depicted in this movie. Yes, I could write a story of many of these experiences some more dramatic than depicted in this film. Yes, I and others thought many times about the meaning of life and would discuss this. Would others want to see the story of my life with my family, friends, neighbors and workmates? Probably not and I guess that pretty much sums up my feelings about The Tree of Life. I am one of those who kept expecting something to happen, but it never did and left me wondering why I had not read more about the film before I saw it as I won't get that time back and I suppose for some like me, may regret the time spent reflecting on things we long ago had let go. I know art can be very dividing and I understand this so for those who enjoyed the film, I applaud your ability to connect with something that I and others may not share the same enthusiasm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...is a good example of why so many viewers dislike this movie: because they can't handle what they don't understand. I am in no doubt about most the issues he enumerates in his review, but even if I was, is it really so terrible if a movie doesn't provide you with all the answers? So there's a scene where a dinosaur moves on without killing its (easy) prey. So the film doesn't give us an explicit explanation why. It wasn't what I expected to happen in that scene, but that's exactly what makes that scene stand out - are you not tired of movies/filmmakers that do everything the way you expect and have seen in 5,000 other movies before?Peter Greenaway once said something to the effect of "I like films that don't explain everything, because life doesn't always explain everything."I couldn't recommend The Tree of Life to everyone, but if you are (a) not a total cynic (b) tired of watching movies that repeat the same formula you've seen in thousands of other movies and (c) fine with watching movies that prompt you to think for yourself and don't give you all the answers, then this film is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing photography...poor poor story telling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I started watching The Tree of Life it started to fall into an amazing movie in terms of imagery and photography and it will surely win that Oscar! However the story itself really doesn't match and the ending is pathetic! Im sorry but if you go through the effort and attention to detail to make such a movie..and no doubt a lot of effort was made in directing this movie...then you must make it so that the story telling is compatible and complete! Its still a movie worth seeing..for its photography. The film is split in two...one part is about the creation of the world and its worth every second to watch! However once the plot kicks in and we get the human/family side...although its well produced it lacks a pattern...and that pattern simply losses itself towards the end of the movie and then you get a dead end....and you feel insulted by such a ridiculous lack luster ending! Trying to be surreal nowadays seems to also kill sense!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is what I watched: One random scene after another, no one that I can identify as a "character", no message, and no personal connection to any of the moving images on the screen.This is yet another case where the film creator isn't exactly sure what he wants to say, so every single scene is left opened to personal interpretation and countless theories. Now, is that a way to make a movie? Is that what movies are supposed to be about? If I wanted to see a series of random images I'd sit next to the window on a train and look out. But when I watch a movie I expect to receive something. Could be entertainment, visual pleasure, an adrenalin rush, a romantic sensation, a political message, or an intellectual challenge. None of that is to be found in this film.Even when at one point I thought that I caught a glimpse of the boy going through a coming of age, it was ruined by the easily felt hesitation of the film maker to approach that angle candidly which left us with confusing images of closeups on the boy's eyes, his empty looks at women's feet, and a sweaty run to get rid of a stolen female under garment. It's Hollywood's usual cowardice and America's laughable misplaced conservatism restricting certain aspects of creativity.Not wasting any more time on that. Good luck for those who over the next 10 years would be coming up with hundreds of explanations and theories about the contents and arguing endlessly over them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's as if Fellini had kidnapped Malick at gunpoint and forced him to make a version of 2001 set in Texas in the '50s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, that might have been more coherent.Visually, The Tree of Life is beautiful, with highly evocative images splashing on-screen. More like crashing on-screen, one after the other like waves breaking on the shore. In fact, they come so quickly we are robbed of the opportunity to be moved by their beauty. And because of that the whole exercise is oddly disaffecting.Lurking somewhere in this 2-hour montage, is an earnest, if simple, story of a man wrestling with those ontological rascals Life and Death. His existential struggle is represented by a series of seriously omniscient flashbacks (like Big Bang to post-Mesozoic serious) and flash-forwards (again, omniscient, as the Sun goes red giant and shows Al Gore the real meaning of "global warming"). Also, by a soporific Sean Penn shuffling through imposing architecture like an amnesiac who's just been told to take a left turn at the intersection of macaroni and cheese.But wait, there's more!Actually, there's less. While there are frequent flashes of profundity among the film's many disparate elements, they are immediately strangled by relentless editing before we have a chance to care.But if your perfect movie involves an Ornithomimus repeatedly stomping on the head of a sickly Parasaurolophus along a pristine Cretaceous riverbank, a bespectacled Brad Pitt mashing out an abrupt rendition of Toccata and Fugue in D minor on a massive pipe organ, and Bryce Dallas Howard's fair-haired doppelgänger levitating in the backyard like Sylvia Plath on X, look no further, friends. Your search ends here. Prepare to breathe deep the gathering DDT; hurl a stolen negligee into a river; intimidate your little brother with an empty light socket; and frolic on George A. Romero's Beach of the Living Dead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishing film. The best of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see why film by Terrence Malick divide peoples opinions. They can be a little strange to say the least but i honestly think that The Tree of Life is the best film that has been released in 2011 and maybe one of the best films ever.To explain the film is a task in itself. The story revolves around a family who receives the news that one of the sons have lost their life in the war. We then see series of clips showing the beginning of the earth and life itself. From the big bang to the dinosaurs. After this we go back to the family and see the boys growing up , long before the tragedy , with all the ups and down of raising children , to the love that we have for them. This section of the film is quite astonishing. Brad Pitt , as the father , is mesmerising and you absolutely feel the love he has for his boys , yet you know deep down tragedy is the only outcome.Death comes to us all , and as the film shows , even the planet will die at some stage but Malick manages to show just how precious life is and that maybe we don't appreciate it often enough.I'm sure , despite my absolute love for this film . that some people will hate it. It is arty in places but for me it works 100% . Maybe it's because i have sons and most of the story revolves around a family brining up sons but it's much more than that.It's beautifully shot , especially the birth of the planet scenes and the dialogue is sparse which is part of it's appeal. The Tree of Life is what movie watching is all about. An absolute gem that i loved so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Film... it's An Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a Brad Pitt/Sean Penn movie full of dialogue, plot, antagonists, protagonists and a conclusion --- this isn't your movie.To appreciate this film you have to leave behind every preconceived expectation of the type of movie most of us are used to watching.I rented the DVD and began this movie as I do with others, in my living room with my laptop on my lap while I watch so I can multi-task. After about 15 minutes I realized this wasn't going to work. This isn't a movie you halfway participate with as a distracted observer. I wasn't sure if I was going to continue watching the entire movie so I went to IMDb and read a couple of reviews and realized I wasn't the only one who didn't get it. But some of the reviews revealed that it was worth watching and I decided to give it another shot.So I closed my blinds and darkened my room. I closed my laptop and put it away. I turned up my surround sound so I could more clearly hear the whispered narrative.And I allowed myself to EXPERIENCE this film.I am glad I did, too. I watched two other rented DVD's this weekend and they are already forgotten. But "The Tree of Life" has lingered in my thoughts for the last couple of days. My mind continues to replay images and scenes and put together little connections that I didn't grasp at the time.It truly is a masterpiece and I think this is a film that will mean different things to different people. This film allows the viewer to connect with their own memories, their own spiritual views and derive their own meanings from the imagery.Mr. &amp; Mrs. O'Brien could have been my grandparents in a small town in Oklahoma instead of Texas. Even though my youth was in the 1970's and I am female, I remember days spent outside with idle play, overhearing neighbors arguments through open windows, entering an unlocked house of a neighbor while they were away just out of curiosity, playing with my siblings, and fearing harsh words from my father. Dinner time at my house was a much more casual affair - but not so at my grandparents. My grandmother had the aluminum cups that she served iced tea out of at every meal besides breakfast. The table was fully set even if it was just meatloaf and spinach for dinner. And her house was dust-free and immaculate at all times.I enjoyed this film. The nostalgia associated with it and the deeper questions it probed. This isn't a film I'd recommend to everyone, but if someone is willing to experience it instead of just watch it - they won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Infinity in a grain of sand?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film to me seems more about the brittle vast nothingness of existence, it seems to say what we all fear and know and seem most concerned about. That those few fleeting moments of life we have can seem either "natural" and thus brutal, unforgiving and meaningless or they can seem "graceful" having a meaning beyond explanation and far greater than our wildest imagination. It seems sad that some never experience but only a few moments of any sense of grace, with a bookend of brutal violent death awaiting those whom seem most focused on the "natural" perspective of life. To have meaning, or narrative or plot takes away the magic and beauty that we simply experience, once you begin to reflect on it, you are out of the moment, the zen has passed, you maybe living either in the past or the future but not present. To leave childhood seems like a leap beyond or outside the present and into conflict, however that conflict comes about seems irrelevant, whether it comes as soon as you hit 18 or you spend an entire life battling it, if you fail to find the grace, nature will find a way to move you along, to reorganize your matter into something more useful to itself. To question this seems to be in conflict with life and thus of not much use to nature, to not find grace in nature no matter how brutal and unforgiving it may seem merely points to the conflict between the living and the dead. If you don't hang on to those moments you seem more likely to lose them to your own demise, this to me seems to explain religion, this to me seems to point to an explanation,one that would confuse and frustrate anyone unable to see the "big picture" as we so often meaninglessly refer to "everything" in our lives.This film clearly shows and indicates that any description of the universe which leaves you out maybe inaccurate, because you have to include your nervous system that was used in your description of the universe. However you describe yourself can include not only yourself in the description but any events or meaningful memories you might have, but it will never look the same as someone else's description of their life, and we can never really fully know what they glean and care about the most since we sadly cannot reside in each others heads, but I think this film tries to show that maybe when we die we can be anywhere and anytime we so choose and it maybe only our lives in this moment which causes us to forget this, and also that we do not exist separate from the universe in any way at all. Just very profound, how this movie can explain and show this to you in a such a specific and "graceful" manner seems so astounding or amazing. Can you find infinity in a grain of sand? Yes you very much can says Terrernce, let me show you how if you can spare a couple hours out of the vastness of time for me to explain how it happened to someone like myself. The constant quoting of JOB throughout seems to me an attempt to explain the vastness of beauty in life even in the most sorrowful and saddest moments of our lives, just accept it, find the beauty and you find eternity in the simplest moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hunter McCraken's standout performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give the "Tree of Life" ten stars, because I cannot give it eleven. Many reviewers have covered the many elements that make this a masterpiece with much more eloquence than I can muster. I want to concentrate on one aspect, Hunter McCraken's portrayal of the pre-adolescent Jack O'Brien.Like Jack, I grew up as a free-range child in a suburban-rural area in the 50's Like Jack I had a saintly mother and an abusive father. (Actually Brad Pitt's Mr. O'Brien was a pussycat compared to my father, but that is for another place ).McCracken's almost wordless portrayal of Jack captured the toxic mix of love, hate, anger, betrayal and confusion that whirled through my 12-year-old head.Two scenes especially stand out. One where Mr O'Brien is working under a car supported flimsily by an auto jack. Jack walks up, sees his father under that car and surmises he can "accidentally" bump the jack and kill his father. He thinks it over and walks away. McCraken acts this out wordlessly with his eyes and face.In the second scene, Mr. O'Brien tries to apologize to Jack for his behavior. Jack says, with a blank expression, blank eyes, and a blank voice, "It's your house, you can do what you want." (approx.).In scenes like this and others, I cried. This may not sound like much, but those who know me know me as someone who never reacts emotionally to anything, just like Sean Penn's adult Jack, and probably for the same reason.Sixty years later, the emotions still swirl in my head. I have been lucky with a successful career, 45 years of a happy marriage and two loving well adjusted successful and ethical adult children. I hide the storm between my ears.I pray Hunter McCraken's performance comes from his acting skill, not his life experience.</fullReview>

A mixed bag of pieces that I tried to fit together but the boredom took over and at the end I felt that this movie probably instulted my intelligence because it has such a good rating at IMDb.com - and it was such agony to watch.

		<fullReview>You can only approach a film like this with a sense of wonder. Malick's film is a cosmic journey that includes the creation of the universe and a childhood in 1950s Waco, Texas. The central theme is that of the motions of grace - represented by the mother - and nature - represented by the father. Ultimately, grace and love wins. Like all works of renaissance, this film is inherently spiritual. How can it not be? The film is also deeply existential. The "Tree" doesn't bother with the well-worn question of "Does God exist?", rather, it takes this approach: "God exists. Look around you. Look at nature. Look at the universe. Now, how are you going to respond to Him?". The protagonist, played by Sean Penn, ultimately chooses to reconcile with his father and God. Contrary to common opinion, the final scene where Penn's character walks through the door is not the afterlife. He is obviously still alive. The door and beach scene is a highly abstract representation of stepping into faith and reconciliation. All the parts of his journey are present in the end. The climax occurs when the viewer hears "I give you my son".Just a note regarding the unsurprisingly negative reviews. Those who don't "get" this film are most likely part of the "MTV generation" and have a very low cultural IQ. They can't tell you who Job was or what the Book of Job is and can't comprehend a concept of love that is different from romantic love. If understanding this film is a sign of pretentiousness, then most of our parents and grandparents would have been the ultimate snobs. That generation would have perfectly understood the subtleties in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that is as ambitious and grand as it is flawed and obscure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The medium of film is a dying art form. Mainstream cinema has become so superficial and cheaply packaged it appears as if it has mere justification to exist beyond the purpose of servicing economics. I consider Apocalypse now to be the finest film ever made, not on its terms of sheer cinematic brilliance ? though there is much of it, but because it was the end result of an intense passion for the medium. This is not to say that contemporary cinema in its entirety as awful ? though there is much to account for in that department, but the fact that it has resigned to such cheap trickery and formulaic substance is downright sad. So when a film as unique and philosophically engaging as The Tree of Life comes about it piques my interest. Of all the divisive film makers that come to mind it is Terrence Malick who really fits the term. He refuses to compromise his vision and grandeur, instead devoting years; decades even, to an idea, an impression in pursuit of achieving something truly great. His films all share a common motif in that Malick has dispensed with the conventions of a story for an impression ? this is rarely a good thing, but it seems to work for him. Malick is primarily interested in imagery and music more so than dialogue. He is so deeply invested in the human condition and the aural surrealism that surround us that it would be discrediting to tackle such hefty material within the frame of linear story telling. Essentially, The Tree Of Life encapsulates the totality of man's existence and purpose through the dimensions of a family unit in Waco, Texas. What follows is an enlightening, beautiful and frustrating portrayal of nature and grace in direct collision with each other. Akin to 2001: A Space Odyssey; The Tree of Life converges its characters with their universe. Unlike Kubrick's cynicism, however, Malick's philosophy of people is somewhat optimistic, whereas Kubrick's characters were usually caught in a vacuum of immorality. It may be set in the 1950's, but Malick has framed it in such a way that its characters are infinitesimal in contrast to their surroundings. There is a dialect here between the tactile and the divine and how insignificant these two forms are without each other; how in a sense they break down and produce only failure if there's disharmony to the natural balance of things. Malick is more concerned with the uniformity and concord of his characters and resorts to the inquiry of the meaning of life, people's reason for existence and morality. There is a collective philosophy throughout that represents several ideologies beyond the mere Evolution vs. Creationist approach. Each character in the family unit apparently comprises a cosmic view. The father (Brad Pitt) represents nature, whereas the mother (Jessica Chastain) represents grace, but expanding upon that view even further the father represents the physical world and all that has sensory value and the mother represents the divinity and wonders of the metaphysical. Consequently, their tormented son (Sean Penn) is two parts his father and one part his mother, thus he is unable to establish a connection to neither nature, nor grace. Moreover, there seems little justification for Sean Penn being in this film as he serves little in the way of exposition and importance to the narrative, but it's only a minor quibble. The Tree of Life is an ethereal, bizarre and emotional film helmed by a man who clearly has nothing but the utmost love for his craft. With this being said, though, it is not a film for everybody as it can often be long winded and downright pretentious, but it just so happens that it registered with me, but I wholeheartedly understand the criticism it has received as well. However, I strongly recommend it to anyone willing to invest their time and patience into something different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Tree of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film by the reclusive auteur Terrence Malick rarely comes by, with this being only his fifth film in a career spanning decades, and picking up the coveted Palme d'Or at Cannes this year, albeit to a polarizing response from screenings during the festival. Slated to also make its bow at this year's Singapore International Film Festival before its theatrical run, this advance screening today too saw its own share of detractors, with many walking out before the last reel unspooled. This is a Terrence Malick film after all, so it's an acquired taste to say the least.I dare not say I've seen nor understood all of his works, but from whatever I've watched thus far, you'll come to expect a certain quality that comes with a Malick film, such as how fragmented its narrative can be, if it has a coherent one to begin with. There are plenty of moments in the film that he simply allows you to fill in the blanks yourself, providing bookends to scenes, and never shoving details down your throat. The details however comes through in the more technical aspects of the film. Rarely will you find a shot being misplaced or not serving a purpose, and watching a Malick film is observing a beautiful, artistic masterpiece come alive. It's almost postcard picturesque in each frame, that it's a visual treat whichever way you look at them, in alarmingly mesmerizing fashion that screams for your attention and lulls you into an optic trance.It's also an understatement to say this film is ambitious. After all, a good portion of the first half dealt with Creation itself, how life evolved into what it is today, with scenes of nebulas, organisms, and even a moment where dinosaurs roamed the screen which I thought was a surprising move with compassion being showed by predator to prey. The visuals treats continued with the final scenes depicting the end of the world as we know it, as everything freezes over given the sun finally burning its last, and in ways reminded me of how grandeur its visuals are in similar fashion to how Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain had set out to be, only that Malick's film did it the more old school way through practical effects rather than to go it the computerized way.The story sprawls in two uneven timelines, one the present where Sean Penn's character Jack still nurses a heartache with the loss of his brother during the war, and this, together with reminiscence of his memory of childhood both good, bad and confusing through the growing up years, form the bulk of the stories in Tree of Life. Here's where we get transported back to the 50s USA, where Brad Pitt plays the authoritative head of the O'Brien household, ruling his family with such an iron fist that his kids celebrate with enthusiasm the minute he steps out of the house, and go buck crazy when his job requires him to travel abroad. The perspectives as with a typical Malick film, cycles through each of the characters, from Pitt's Mr O'Brien, to his wife played by Jessica Chastain who has this angelic presence in a fiery household, and that of young Jack (Hunter McCracken)While it depicts what would be suburban life in 50s Texas, it is the very human tales that get presented which you will likely be able to identify with, if you feel for it, and give this film a chance rather than to walk straight out when it gets perplexing. Like Life itself, things rarely occur in a linear, sequential fashion, and episodes here get played out in rather choppy fashion, sometimes repetitive through shots at different angles. The neighbours also get put under the spotlight occasionally with their very audible quarrels heard from outside their houses, in contrast to the O'Brien's, and that of their household's upbringing, with its stricter house rules always threatening to boil over and undo everything that's working for it.Stealing the show from under the veteran casts' noses - Brad Pitt in what would be his most humble role in a long while as the typical strict paternal figure, and Sean Penn in a very underused, supporting role - was Hunter McCracken, with his intense gaze toward the screen ever so often, and looking dead ringer for a kid sized Sean Penn. He owned the role as a young boy turning rebellious as he stifles from being under a domineering dad, wait, father who doesn't mince his words when getting spoken back to, or to throw anyone out of the house for talking back. That gaze is worth the price of an admission ticket alone, as he struggles to escape from what he deemed as favouritism shown by his parents toward his siblings, seeking acceptance and love as he vents his frustrations through acts of vandalism, and theft too, in a scene that I felt was sexually charged though with nothing to see save for a lingerie being released into a running stream. Such is the brilliance of a Terrence Malick film, although there will be others who beg to differ.Dialogue is kept minimal, and the soundtrack while awesome with its fair share of classical tunes, can be largely absent to a deafening silence. It may be jarring to sit through with character voiceovers shifting with nary a prompt, and images that come and go in a seemingly incoherent manner, but Tree of Life is still something to be experienced with an open mind given the instances of self-indulgence by the filmmaker, and to throw one's conventions of a film right out of the window in order to enjoy this sprawling effort, hopefully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a lot to say, almost too much to say, as it almost buries a fascinating coming-of-age story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is important to note that when symbolism is added to a movie, it has to be added in the correct dosage. Terrence Malick's latest effort, The Tree of Life, is one of those films that adds symbolism in the wrong dosage. While by all means a good movie, it also shows a little too much ambition on the part of the 67-year-old auteur. It seems like he has so much to say that his message gets in the way of telling a coherent story.Have you ever been in a situation where you were with a group of friends and you had a story you really wanted to tell? And as you tell the story, you get yourself so worked up telling the story you rush through it and end up leaving out certain key aspects? So by the end of the story, your friends have a general idea of what happened, but also give off that vibe that they couldn't fully appreciate the story because you botched it. That's kind of what watching The Tree of Life was like.Malick takes a different approach to the film than he did with more straightforward efforts like Badlands, Days of Heaven, or his ensemble piece The Thin Red Line. The film never stays with one particular scene all that much. By that, I mean a typical scene will contain constant jump cuts showing the passage of mere seconds, generally accompanied by a voice-over. So many jump cuts occur that the scene only lasts for about a mere minute or two and we move right along to something new, and at times something seemingly unrelated. For those with the attention span of that dog from Up, this may prove to be a problem. A big one.This especially proves to be a big problem in one sequence about a half-hour into the movie where we are presented with a lengthy sequence depicting the birth of the universe. It abruptly appears, stops the current narrative, and goes on for a good twenty minutes, presenting us with nebula after nebula, orbit after orbit, and ending with a sequence involving two dinosaurs. It feels like something out of 2001: A Space Odyssey. We leave the sequence as abruptly as we entered it, and just go right back to the film's primary narrative. Like, "Oops, sorry folks. Sorry for that minor inconvenience. Back to the movie." There is a great deal of meaning behind this sequence, and its placement almost directly after we learn of the death of a character is meant to represent one person's place in such a vast universe. It's great that Malick is trying to present this idea to his audience. However, due to the approach he takes to the film, abruptly presenting it in the middle of the narrative, this may prove to be confusing for most viewers. It was during this sequence where I witnessed a great number of walkouts.For those with patience enough not to walk out, there is actually a great deal of positive elements for them to find within the movie. For one thing, if there's one thing I have to give Malick credit for, it's the fact that he does a fantastic job with cinematography. Each of his films are beautifully shot, and The Tree of Life is no exception. The birth of the universe scene, as abruptly placed as it is, is also a fantastic sequence. Each orbit, each nebula, is presented to the audience with such bold radiance and such grace that some will be staring in awe. It also gives off this strange sense to those with patience enough not to walk out of the movie by this point, having them wanting more, even if they don't completely know what direction the film is going to take.Now, the cinematography should not be the only reason to watch this movie, as no movie should be judged for such aspects. There is still much more to behold. Despite my criticism for its lack of focus, there are actually a great deal of times, mostly in the second half of the film, where a focus is found and we are presented with a somewhat coherent story. And a nice story, at that, to put it in the simplest terms possible. At the heart of all the symbolism and all the jumping around is a coming-of-age story about a boy in a family that is going through a lot of internal conflicts.Brad Pitt is one of the film's strongest points. He comes off as cold and demeaning, yet you can very well sense an underlying loving nature to his character. You want to hate him, yet at the same time, you almost want to justify some of his less-than-favorable actions, such as unnecessarily screaming at or hitting his kids. It's as if you feel you would do the same thing if you were in his shoes. He brings a kind of presence to him that feels almost scary, yet at the same time is extremely fascinating.His presence in this film, however, may not be enough for some. The Tree of Life is not a movie for everyone. Some will find it to be a masterpiece, while many will hate it. It's the kind of movie that I had to warm up to as it progressed, and by the end of it, I found it enjoyable. I still feel Malick could do - and has done - a lot better, but he still proves he has it in him to make a good movie. Just hopefully, for all future endeavors, he's able to find the right balance between his story and what he's looking to say beyond the story.3.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst pretentious pice of s**t I ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I go to movies about 20-25 times every year, been doing so for the past 5 years. In estimate I've been to the movies about 170-200 time throut my life. Is there a point to all this? Yes! You could imagine that I've probably seen a couple of bad movies, horrible movies even throut my career, of course! But I've only left the theater 3 times in my life, and this movie was one of them. Before you say it I endured 50 minutes of this horrible pretentious bullshit before I left. My friend watched it to the end thou, and she said I stayed the same till the end. I doesn't matter, this is by far my worst movie experience to date, and frankly I almost (almost) suspect that the people that claims to like this do if because it's expected of them. You know them pretentious-I-know-movies-like-no-one-else type of person. So stay away from this pice of s**t and watch something good instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic cinematic poem to the mystery of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was aware going into this that TREE OF LIFE put some people to sleep and forced others to leave the theatre way ahead of time. Yet, I have seen Malick's other films and have always been a raving fan, so a big part of me did not believe or accept the negativity.I'll take it a step further: the vicious negative "reviews" make me wince. I don't expect everyone to agree or for everyone to recognize "greatness", but I would think serious film buffs would recognize an epic reaching, a monumental effort to plunge bravely into the abyss.This is flat out, hands down one of most spectacularly beautiful movies I have ever seen in my lifetime, and I am no spring chicken.It is an epic cinematic poem to the mystery of life. I am in awe at the effort here. I kneel in awe.In my opinion, this film is a cinematic equivalent to Milton's PARADISE LOST or Dante's INFERNO. It is a non-linear, inventive, original journey.Certainly not for everyone. It breaks plenty of rules. There is no real plot. There is no climax. It is more of a Proustian memory piece, but that is all right with me.I have never seen anything even remotely like it. Check out other reviews if you want to know what it is "about." The truth is: it cannot be summarized. Period.I think it is touched with Greatness!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual Symphony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to be upfront, this is a Malick film. He tends to get a bit pretentious and long-winded at times. That said, on to the film.Malick has structured this as a sort of symphony in visual form, with introduction, exposition, development and finale. The music in the film is not an accompaniment; it provides the most literal interpretation possible. Very early in the film Mahler's 1st Symphony is quoted (and is later repeated). Mahler wanted to capture the universe in his his music, from creation forward to the complexity of humanity. Malick seems to have exactly the same intent. It's a bit much to fit into 2 hours, but you can't fault Malick for ambition.While the characters don't necessarily have leitmotifs, there are certain associations. Pitt's character, for example, is associated with the rigor, precision and religion of Bach. The final scene an the beach, a coming to terms with both death and the conflict between nature and grace, quote Berlioz' Requiem. The film is in the abstract, but the music is quite nearly concrete.This is most near an experience one can get to crossing Tarkovsky (The Mirror) with Kubrick (2001). The same trappings are there--pacing being a major issue at times. But I have to say in films like these it doesn't matter. The goal and execution are so epic that 'rules' that apply to Hollywood movies simply don't matter. I could watch the first 30 minutes over and over and still stand in awe. The cinematography is amazing, and the whole of the work is grand.Mahler often repeated themes across symphonies, building to his final works. Anyone familiar with Malick should notice a similar arc. And despite the sometimes sprawling narrative, this might be Malick's most focused effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I know the phrase 'worst movie ever' gets banded about way too much, there are of course worse movies - for anyone who has ever used that expression for a movie that isn't 'The Tree of Life' then they are wrong, for 'The Tree of Life' is, undoubtedly, irrefutably, unquestionably: the worst movie ever made. This movie is not impressive in any way. If you enjoy it then that's fine, good for you, I'm actually jealous as you'd probably enjoy your own funeral - a place that, while watching the movie, I rather wished I'd have bin. All comfortable in the sweet release of death. It was pretty. If you visit a gallery you might find lots of pretty pictures, although, you usually find one or two that you love which put the rest out thought. Here the director believes it all to be pretty and for the odd minute there will be something nice to look at. But no where near enough to get the rating anywhere near a mighty 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Profound genius ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please, allow me to get this off my chest first. I have no idea why people who hated this film actually took the time to write reviews about it because all they've ended up doing is televising their impatience for and incapacity to digest narratives that stray from a set classical narrative formula and refuse to provide any sense of certainty. I'm loathe to use the word ignorance here, but if the shoe fits ... It's one thing to not understand a filmic text - there's nothing wrong with that - but its something altogether different when you condemn it as worthless, and worse still to condemn those that appreciate it.It's astounding to me that some IMDb reviewers actually defend Kubrick's painfully slow and indecipherable 2001: A Space Odyssey even as they condemn (and compare it with) The Tree of Life which is less esoteric and a far breezier film. It seems dishonest and snobbish to defend a film that over time has come to be regarded with classic status (this is not to say I do not like Kubrick's film as I am a huge fan and see it any time it plays on a big screen near me) while panning another films that is as equally ambitious and plays with such big ideas.For those open to the experience, The Tree of Life is a riveting experience from the first to the last shot. While it is unconcerned with linearity, there is a clear linear process at work within the film. The Tree of Life charts the thought processes of man who has just learned that his brother has been killed, probably in Vietnam. Overwhelmed with grief at the death of his brother, he asks the question, "why?" which becomes the catalyst for a journey that investigates this question from both a macrocosmic perspective while simultaneously analysing its infinitesimal details (I was reminded of Dziga Vertov). Thus Malick imagines, through the most breathtaking photography and use of ellipses, the big bang and the beginning of time, the slow inexorable evolution of species, the first inklings of sentient beings recognising their power over weaker beings and their capacity to abuse that power, the mindless savagery of nature, and the eventual end of time when the universe collapses on itself. In between these two overwhelming universal bookends, there is the micro level in which we get a look at a revisionist assessment of a childhood that locates those moments in time when the child took into itself the best and worst of those around them. Shots of a beach covered with people like a busy train station makes for a fabulous metaphor for memory (reminding me of the opening sequence of Lola Rent), although it also seemed to allude to the afterlife or some such imagined spiritual plain.Brad Pitt heads an extraordinary cast of characters that are all believable and affectionately rendered. Pitt's disillusioned Mr O'Brien is a tragic character whose bitterness so overwhelms him that it spills over to infect his family, making their lives such a misery that it essentially builds a wall between himself and the people he loves with all his heart. Pitt's stunning performance evokes such a range of response from sympathy to outrage to condemnation. The cast of young O'Brien boys reminded me of Robert Mulligan's work on To Kill a Mockingbird and The Other, showing how children may seem distracted but are always in the moment and guided by their impulses.The Tree of Life achieves things with cinema that have never been done before. Amazingly, one reviewer dismissively wrote that this film will be forgotten in no time. I beg to differ and suggest that it will be well remembered and the subject of much future film criticism for a long time to come.</fullReview>

I chose to stick it out.You quickly learn that this is tracing some stupid family life, and beyond that life in general, from the beginning to the end of time.

Without spoiling anything, the first 40 minutes alienates the audience so badly that by the time you get to any action, any acting, any plot, you are exhausted to the point of not caring about any of the characters.There may or may not have been good acting, but by the time the actors came onto the screen for anything significant, I didn't care about them. I just wanted the piece to be over.The movie pretends to be about deep subjects like suffering, faith, and good vs. evil, but it is so trite, so subject to the director's fetish for nature footage, long drawn out computer generated space footage, and volcanoes, that any depth to the exploration of such heavy subjects is lost.

I thought I was watching "2001 A Space Odyssey" that was filmed while everyone was on heavy drugs and lost the script! If you think 2001 is crazy, then you'll freak out on this terrible attempt at making a movie.It's so bad you never even hear the first name of the wife, nor do you really know what it is that Brad Pitt's role does for a living. Horribly cruel to children, there was nothing redeeming in this miserable movie. Mysterious voices and a weird orange light, and then the origins of earth played out so long that it made any association or connection with the actors to be non existent and not worthy of any emotional attachment.Miserably boring, exceedingly long and trying to tell a story of no beginning and no end, I mark this down with "Battlefied Earth" and yet BE had something of a story, a start and an end. This went from nowhere and ended with no finality...was there eventually happiness for the dour looking Sean Penn as he walks around stroking the grass? Or of Brad Pitt, after attacking his son at the supper table or viciously attacking his wife (emotionally).

Jessica Chastain is also tremendous, and the child actors are superb.Cinematography alone is worthy of a viewing, but the development of the characters really made me think and remember and feel deeply; the movie made me appreciate my own parents all the more - even though they've been deceased for 20 years.I recommend the movie very highly especially for fans of Malick and Brad Pitt, but, moreover, for parents and prospective parents.The title of my review does not really do justice to this movie; there is simply so much more to be beheld and experienced.I am a 66 year old lifetime devotee of movies, and I've taught literature through film for 43 years, but I must see this film again - with subtitles.Sean Penn says little but he is a tremendous screen presence, acting without dialogue - He uses space and he uses time and his face, eyes and body are like a stradivarius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be said about Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life that hasn't already been said about the greatest works of art in human history? It defies convention and soars with an ambition rarely seen in modern cinema into the hearts and minds of those who watch it. I was moved deeply watching the film. It's breathtakingly gorgeous, powerfully emotional, mysterious, and thrillingly alive. There are few films that feel as grand, as universal, and yet as profoundly human as The Tree of Life. About as beautiful as any film ever made, Emmanuel Lubezki's gorgeous cinematography is a testament to Malick's love of the natural world. Come Oscar season, this better be a big winner.

I am giving it a 7 because the cinematography was beautiful and it was well acted. This would have worked better as an off-Broadway play or just as a documentary in my opinion. Some have complained about the "birth of the universe" and "dinosaur" scenes, but I felt they could have been even longer, plus a little more of human history that led up to the 1950's would have worked well I think.

		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's "The Tree of Life" is a film of broad avidity and abysmal reserve, trying nothing less than to capture the sum total of all of mankind's existence from the broken moment man crawled out of the primordial soup to the time when Artaud first sat down and expressed his genius to the time when the brush first hit the canvas, the element of being and of needing to be is ingrained in this magnificent picture. It is through Malick's humbleness that we view it through the frame of a group of puny lives trying to make their mark on the cosmos. I am hearkened back to the boldness of the great Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey," and yet Malick is in someways able to out do the great Kubrick. His 'Tree of Live' is a more human film with a greater soul than the cold Space of Kubrick's vision. In today's filmmaking society of horrible blockbuster fare like Transformers and the films of Christopher Nolan it is refreshing to know that there still exist auteur's who strive for nothing less than perfection and occasionally there are those who achieve this lofty goal. Terence Malik is a genius. His career all the way back to his first ambitious picture in 1973 has composed entirely of masterpieces.I had a somewhat spiritual experience watching the film as I am sure a great many people did. I don't know when a film has touched me more strikingly and has found a kinship with my own personal experience of life. In some haunting ways, the core narrative of "The Tree of Life" brings back the ghosts of a time and place of mind I lived and grew up in, and I see my face in the bright eyes of the boys in this film. If I were to think long and hard about what a piece of art might look like that represented my soul, I imagine the timeless imagery of the 'Tree of Life' would come to speak for me and countless other audience members. Malcik portrays a childhood in a town off the postcards from the Midwest, where the days flow carelessly by. At the head of the family is father who has build the house on stern discipline and order and at his side is a saintly mother who emanates forgiveness and love. The children spend their long summer days playing and kicking back, taking a break only to question the meaning of things. Malick's genius is that he is able to find the core ideals of Americana and use them to his will. The ensuing effect is a dream of an idealized past lost long ago. Only when we revisit it's intricacies do we realize how hopeless our plight is as we move to an uncertain future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Reader, Answer the following Question - no hedging: Do you believe that our existence is due solely to random events or the mysterious hand of our Creator.How you answer that question may well preview what you think of Terence Malick's latest film: The Tree of Life.Does anyone remember how strange life is after we are born ? Two large beings seems to fuss over you and perhaps smaller beings or older larger beings take an enormous amount of interest in you. And no one places any expectations upon you.Slowly you begin to develop the ability to walk and talk and then you can choose to go where you will and say what you will.But as this happens you are less and less fussed over and more and more expectations are placed upon you. Suddenly there are "Consequences" for what you choose to do and say - either nature warns you or parents and teachers correct you.At some point in life you go from just being here to wondering if there is a why behind your being here and purpose to why you are here. Meanwhile you keep having to make choices for which you are increasingly held responsible.The near Eden of Childhood disappears far quicker than any child could have imagined and we are left in a world where sorrow and joy are interwoven in ways we cannot neither unwind nor avoid.If we look through a telescope we see what once was and if we look into a mirror we see what is and if we look at our aged parents we see what may well be.So those who believe in nothing but atoms are surrounded by at best temporal meaningfulness of the most airy kind.Those who believe that there is a kind and loving but stern hand guiding all that is are left knowing that to forgive and accept forgiveness so that one might love and be loved are the only lessons of childhood that we all needed to learn and the only lessons to be applied if there is an afterlife which all the characters in this magnificent film truly and solely hope for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Malick's best movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this movie I had heard lots of good and bad reviews about it - people seemed to either love it or hate it. I didn't have great expectations of it when I went to see it. I was surprised how great this film actually is. Actors are brilliant - their concentration to roles brings in a strong realism. Especially young Jack (Hunter McCracken) conveys wide variety of emotions with slight expressions. Camera-work is familiar from other Malick's movies. He uses a lot of wide-angle lens and very fluent movement with camera. I am not going to go to editing and music, but as usual they too are the trademark of Malick's genius. The Tree of Life is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. It has heart and soul. It is humane, honest and it has an natural flow. It had a dreamlike quality, like a memory half remembered. All the situations and feeling had familiarity - it was like a universal childhood shared by all. Some might think that The Tree of Life has a religious message. That is true, but that message is not from Christianity or other major religion - it is from more ancient source. The Tree of Life has deep philosophical meaning which is not to be mixed with the shallow dogmas of major religions. Christianity is represented as a religion of conformed society - full of uptight ceremonies which are only meant to maintain the structure of patriarchal establishment. This film from start to finish is a celebration of life - and it is significantly higher than any mundane religion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Hypnotic Puzzle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I was watching The Tree of Life, I occasionally snapped out of my hypnotic trance to wonder if I was watching the most beautiful work of genius I had ever seen, or if I was watching the biggest piece of artsy lard I had ever seen. At those moments I really couldn't tell. But after I left the theater and over the course of the next few hours as the experience sunk in, I was inclined to believe the former. This movie does not follow traditional standards of what to expect in a film -- the fragmented story line, the seemingly disconnected cosmology, the subtle nuances of truth that slip by you at the moment, only to slap you in the face with their brutal honesty seconds later when you think you might "understand" them -- are all spread out before the viewer like an intense jigsaw puzzle. It was a strange sensation to suspect I was experiencing an event of fluidity and beauty as never before, while at the same time wondering why some people hadn't gotten up and walked out in disgust. The sensation didn't make sense to my logic, but it did make sense to my intuition. This is a movie, I believe, best viewed intuitively. Logic just gets in the way. I predict this is one of those movies you will either love or you will hate, depending on which part of yourself you allow to see it. Regardless, I also predict an Oscar nomination if not a win for director Terrance Malick.UPDATE: Nominations for the 2012 Academy Awards were announced this morning. Tree of Life has been nominated for Best Picture and Terrance Malick has been nominated for Best Director. Love it or hate it, my prediction was good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was just a collection of flashbacks to childhood attached to Plant Earth like scenes of the universe and the Earth. So while beautiful, it lacked any actual cohesion. If I am going to sit through 2 hours of flashbacks to childhood I'd rather watch The Wonder Years. Or if I want to watch 2 hours of beauty, I'd rather learn something watching Discovery Channel. The camera work was painful and made both of us dizzy. It bounced around and zoomed out always while constantly flashing scene to scene, never allowing your eyes to adjust. The movie's ending just kept drawing out. I would of left but decided to stick it out and see if a plot would ever develop or if all the flashbacks would be put together. I get the point of the movie, it just isn't for the average movie goer and the trailers are incredibly misleading in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film in history of cinema, best of my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the best, most spiritual, most philosophical, beautiful film of my life. I watched it 24 times in cinema so far in 10 weeks (I have a lot of time and a card for unlimited access to 3 of the 4 multiplexes in my town). It is deeply touching, consoling, peace giving, mesmerising, inspiring, with superb natural acting. This is a film to not miss in the beginning, as a lot of great importance is said and shown right from the start of this film with no opening titles.Malick (1943)'s only 5th film, filmed in 2008 in Smithville, Texas, is set in Waco, Texas (where he grew up) in 1956 and autobiographical (but we'll never know how much). A film about the grand themes of life and the way to happiness. It encompasses the world and history from creation till end of time but not in an apocalyptic way. As Jessica Chastain as the mother says, it is to WONDER about, just as about all tiny beauty in life when we want to see it.The film can be roughly broken into 4 parts (like a symphony), the mother, the father, the oldest son and him as an adult, with his mind wandering off into a reverie about the origins of life and how he fits into this and a coda about eternity, reconciliation and a way to eternal bliss. The film opens with a quote from the Old Testament, Job 38, 4,7, "where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth. When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy". Humble as he is, Malick left something out in Job 38,4, namely "tell me, if you understand" and that's what Malick does in unprecedented glory. The mother then explains that the nuns taught her there are two ways through life, grace (picture of sunflowers turned to the light of Christ) and nature (picture of father) and one has to choose which to follow. Grace isn't trying to please itself, accepts being slighted, forgotten, disliked, insulted. Nature only wants to please itself, wants it's own way, finds reasons to be unhappy when the world is shining around him and love is smiling through all things. She then gets a telegram about the death of a son (RL). She prays "why, where were You?" and Malick (or God?) answers by showing the creation, with Preisner's Lacrimosa (Requiem) set under it: "Tearful will be that day which from the ash arises the guilty man who is to be judged. Spare him therefore, merciful Lord Jesus". Parts of the creation scenes are from Yann Arthur-Bertrand's "Home" (2009). Malick worked closely with Douglas Trumbull ("2001") and a Harvard scientist for this.Malick uses a lot of (only) classical music and does so exquisitely and uses the most famous recordings of a piece. Toscanini's 1951 Brahms 4 is legendary (but we hear Von Karajan 1978 I think) and of Colin Davis 1969 Berlioz Requiem (Agnus Dei-Communio used in the end) Gramophone wrote in it's review that the playing is superb, thrillingly grandiose. Desplat composed for 2 hours but little is heard of this in the film. His soundtrack CD only contains that and nothing of the other music. The music fits the scenes well, like Mahler 1 at a funeral, Holst's Hymn to Dionysus when the children play with mother and Smetana's Moldau (later used in the Israeli anthem) after mother says "that's where God lives".Father works seemingly in an oil refinery and Malick's father Emil worked for Phillips Petroleum and had 42 patents as inventor, of which 12 when this film was set, so Malick lets father say he has 27 patents."Malick truly loves all his characters, respects, appreciates them", Jessica Chastain said in an interview and added how Malick was most interested in "the accident than the plan", working without script and in her showing emotions by body language than words. She watched films with Lauren Bacall as "we now speak so fast as we're afraid someone is going to cut us off" and in the 50's people spoke slower."The tree of life" is a requiem for a dead brother (for Malick himself possibly his brother Larry) as well as about all of us, inviting us all to think about our life,existence, destiny and Being. There's loads of symbolism in a dazzling amount, which I love, but it demands multiple viewing to grasp it all. Examples: a clown in front of a sign "creation",RL burying a dead fish (Christ) in a cloth under a tree that has a ladder (resurrection, eternity). Also the many animals show this is a film alluding to timelessness, eternity.My favourite quotes are "help each other, love everyone" and "the only way to be happy is to love or life will flash by". This film leaves such powerful emotions as it is about all of us and our eternity in a spiritual sense, not religious. Don't walk out at the credits as the music gives further catharsis when "Welcome happy morning" and the lovely guitar piece are played again.One remark about Jack and the gown. He only took it as he was in a hurry after hearing a sound (as the film shows) and had to then dispose of it. Great to see then such changes in him and also the father (a great storyline and character development in all main roles). I want to draw people's attention to a brilliant, very long (28-page) analysis of this film (and all Malick's films). google Nilesfiles Malick to find it/them. There are more blogs but that one is NOT to be missed if you want to understand this complex film better.DVD/Blu-ray out in Europe on 12 October 2011. To understand the truckload of symbolism better, it's helpful to google for Dream dictionary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A microcosm of Space, Time, Life and Existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many others reviews I need to start with a warning, it is not your typical movie. There is no real plot and no definitive continuity. It is a montage of a man's thoughts, feelings and memories put onto a canvas. If you are drawn to the star names of Brad Pitt and Sean Penn then you will be disappointed as dialogue is minimal and Penn barely even features (he must have less than half a page of script in the movie). Then again the movie probably only has about three pages of script in total.This is not a good film, but is stunning and magnificent art/cinematography. I do not criticise those who say it is dull and boring as no single work of art is liked by everyone, some go to the cinema to be thrilled by action, terrified by horror or moved to tears by dramas and people who enjoy these in a film will undoubtedly leave after 20 minutes. If you are forcing yourself to like it then don't stay as the film continues along the same trend throughout.I, however, hugely enjoyed this movie, the opening 15-20 minutes I found difficult, the degree of whispering and strange patterns of colours that went across the screen made me feel as though I was within some abstract modern art. But as soon as the creation of the universe began I was blown away, the cinematography is unlike any I have witnessed before, it's a proverbial journey into the cosmos.This however was topped by the scene of birth and early infancy (my favourite sequence in the movie). Malick brilliantly represents the innocence of this age, the score and images reflect the joy and vibrancy of new life. The theme of nature and grace is present throughout the film and grace dominates at this stage. You only see the mother (the embodiment of grace) interacting with the son, full of wonder. Contrast this with the previous 20 minutes (creation of Earth) showing the beauty (but also violence) of nature.As we ascend through childhood we see the loss of innocence and grace, the Father (the embodiment of nature) is the main figure. His impression of life is that of natural selection, only the fittest and the most adaptable survive, the good will fail. He is harsh, like nature, note the multiple scenes of injured animals (the sea monster, the dog etc.). The Mother and Father not only represent the contrast between grace and nature but also how they over-lap and inter-twine. The Father admits he was overly tough and feels remorse for his actions even though he was only trying to make his sons be strong. This is reflected by the carnivorous dinosaur early on in the movie which shows compassion to injured and weak prey. Nature can be compassionate, grace can also be harsh shown by the death of the child in the pool and the house fire, they both go hand in hand.This film shows the insignificance of our existence compared to the extent of space, the eternity of time, the power of nature and the wonder of grace. Many may feel down after the movie as they realise that our day to day lives and our extremely short time on this planet are not important. However I felt humbled, it made me realise the beauty of life is what we make it, even though our existence is meaningless we make life meaningful. We laugh, cry, love and hate, we form unbreakable bonds and continuously search within ourselves to understand our place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life, the Universe and Everything - a Cinematic 'Total-work-of-art'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mary and I saw this movie at our usual venue, the excellent Cornerhouse, in Manchester, UK, yesterday. As the credits rolled, we sat for some minutes without speaking, as if awakening from total immersion in some epic emotional experience. And emotion is the word, for in some gradual and subtle way this movie reaches deeply within and stirs the soul. Indeed, it is rather pointless to try to say, or even to ask, what this movie is 'about' because it is not structured in a conventional narrative form, and so speaks most directly to the heart rather than to the head. So it may be better to approach The Tree of Life as you would a complex poem or painting; what you get from it depends on what you bring to it.Although a story is being told, the scope and ambition of the director's vision carries us from the dawn of time to . . . somewhere - perhaps to a post-mortal paradise, or maybe just a beach - just like our own lives. Wherever it is, it is an exciting and unexpectedly moving journey in which we are presented with some of the most stunning images you are likely to see in a movie theatre. With unmistakable echoes of the opening sequence of Kubrick's '2001', we see the most brilliant images of the natural world - stars, nebulae, planets, forests, rivers, seas,...circling, writhing, flowing, bursting - and then, later, the more mundane settings of a suburban house and garden, the petrochemical works, soaring glass-and-steel towers of the city. And there, against this majestic backdrop, we find a human family, adults with children, living, struggling, dying and, perhaps distinctively, questioning. For Nature is at once beautiful but merciless and mute. . .Whereas Grace is . . .Excellent performances from the cast throughout, the young boys being spectacularly impressive. Dialogue is minimal, and what there is is sometimes inaudible. But this hardly seems to matter because the movie communicates so well visually. For example, when we see the boys playing and making mischief, we, like they, hardly need words; we know what they are thinking and feeling. Presenting wonderful cinematography, great acting and superb music, The Tree of Life exploits the medium to the full, doing things that can only be done in cinema. This movie has so much to give; we will be going back for a second helping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie ever? Worst I've ever seen for sure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was thinking about writing a good review of this movie only to try to make other people go through the painful experience of watching it, but thinking that they would contribute to the financial success of their makers has made me change my mind. This is probably the worst movie I have ever watched. And I have watched my share of bad movies.It's the first time I see people walking out of a theater in less than 30 minutes after the movie has started, and the first time I've seen people clapping at the end of one not because it was good but because it was over. The last 25 minutes are a special kind of torture with multiple fades to black that give you the hope the whole thing is over only to get back into it again, and again, and again... Comments I heard after the movie were: "this is purgatory", to which someone replied "then, what is hell?", and "the worst two and half hours of my life". I cannot agree more with all of them.Since I am in such a mood for saving you money and time, I'm going to make a fair description of what the movie is. Imagine playing the trailer non stop, a Discovery Channel documentary about volcanoes, the space, and sharks, and another one from NatGeo about dinosaurs, Yellowstone, and some biology (yes, total nonsense). Now imagine channel surfing randomly between three of them while listening to a relaxation soundtrack with some voice talking about anything you might deem boring. Do this for two hours and twenty minutes. If you record the result, you can call Mr. Pitt to try to get his money to produce it for you.Save yourself and your partner the torture of this movie. Don't watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any movie that starts at creation and goes into the fifties and beyond is going to be too long. Five editors are given credit, five weren't enough.These days everyone receives great photo images via the internet. It doesn't take two plus hours to enjoy them.A good cast doesn't have much to say as there is very little dialogue. At one point the eldest son has the opportunity to kill his father and you wish he did. He wishes his father dead, you wish the movie would be over.No one seems to be able to escape the abuse, except for the audience members who left early. Don't get sucked in.

		<fullReview>I dismissed this movie for a few years because I saw Brad Pitt as one of the leads but when re-watching T. Malicks movies I discovered that this movie is one of the deepest movies, even art pieces, I have ever laid my eyes on. Malick has always been great with making movies about something more than a visual experience (cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, well there's a different story about this genius). This movie touches so many emotions and life truths, makes you think and overthink, and Malick has actually given you time to do that - long shots of universe makes you think - why? Is this a womb? Is this even real? And then you start to think. And then you understand. And then you can't sleep for 3 days thinking about universe and human nature. Nothing's absolute, nothing's completely good or bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Tree of Life' is Terrence Malick's take on the great questions of Life. More than a movie, 'The Tree of Life' is an interactive experience with the audience. Rather than a linear plot, the viewer is given some visual and auditory elements, selected pieces of two great stories, too great to fit on a film: the story of Humanity, which by its turn is infinitely compressed within the story of the Universe. All sort of ominous questions can be triggered by this imagery: Where did we come from? Where are we going? Is there a conscious being behind the great plan of Creation? If there is, why does He painfully takes what He so freely gives? Does the afterlife exists?Writing it this way, you might get the perception that the decision of sacrificing the argument in favor of an abstract approach on the matter is nothing but a curiosity, a directorial caprice. But the openness of 'The Tree of Life' also admits an interpretation for that. The intersection of scenes and whispers in the course of the film works as a metaphor for the human memory. We're constantly playing in the great film that is our own life, but our brain rarely preserves chunks of time for future reference. Our memory is primarily made of images, sounds and smells that are coupled with certain emotions. Seeing 'The Tree of Life' I felt like having V.I.P. access to the memory of a superior being, omniscient of the creation of all things. More than aweing us with the superiority of that visual shrine, Malick's point is on trying that some of those images resonate with the ones from our memory.I noted some other metaphors in the course of the film. An obvious one is the constant presence of water. Water in the beginning as the cradle of Life. Water in the end as the drowner of lives. The vision of afterlife as a beach, a return to the origins. Water, as mysterious as the own Creator.Another one that I particularly liked is the recurrent use of scenes where the camera looks up to the Sun through branches of trees, constantly reminding us of our smallness, crying for justice, or at least answers (or at least for a God), as the Sun, silent, impavid as a Creator, casts its shadows on the branches of the Tree of Life.Well, these are the major qualities of 'The Tree of Life' that I wanted to write about. Even though the film didn't 'resonate' with me (though I'm tempted to blame it to the mood which I was on when I saw it), I found myself lost in thought and eager to write about it. Now, 'The Tree of Life' is not a masterpiece. It's just a very ambitious exercise, and I respect it for that. Where does the movie flaw, then?-Out of all pre-historic creatures that could have been chosen, why so much focus on dinosaurs? An infantile whim that looks out of context.-The part of the film that follows the growth of the O'Brien's children drags like Eno's 'Thursday Afternoon'. Besides the fact of being predictable, the point of it was made well before it was over.-Sean Penn does the greatest puzzled-looking-around of film history. Did they really cast him just to do that?As a conclusion, I can only say that now I understand the critics' hype around 'The Tree of Life'. Is a vast exercise, ranging from the Big Bang to the afterlife, open enough to let anyone feel touched by this or that scene. Unfortunately, for me, it didn't work. Maybe I'll change my mind after a second view but, as for now, to meditate about the smallness of Man and the great questions of Life, I still prefer Sagan's 'Pale Blue Dot' theory and good ol' Kubrick's 'Space Odyssey'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of reviews are describing this film as pretentious but it's not really.I think a lot of the negative reviews have been from people that tried to construct a story from the film and haven't been able to because there isn't a story. If you watch it expecting a plot then you will get bored and frustrated.What this film is is an emotional and even spiritual experience, a film that you let wash over you, that generates gut feelings. Switch your conscious brain off and just feel what you see.It's like watching the stars at night. There's no story, nothing to construct, just an awe inspiring spectacle of nature's beauty that can't help but make you feel something inside.Watch it from that perspective and it becomes an enjoyable experience.I liked it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most brilliant movies I've seen, although flawed (or was i just impatient due to our usual expectations of movies?). I have lived in or near or have been to many of the locations in Texas, and was born there in the 50s, so it had a special meaning for me, perhaps beyond a viewer who didn't have those connections. So many have analyzed each "section", and it was analyzed by IMDb, more objectively, so I'll not put more footprints on that trodden ground, but if you are unsure, you might want to read at least the IMDb analysis before watching (not much to 'spoil' in them or this movie, really), others will want to after they have watched and formed their own conclusions. It needs a few more viewings for me,anyway. Not a one time movie. A LOT of food for thought here, if you look at the plate closely. But, at its core, it is an art movie. Canvas brought to life. And if not taken that way, I think the point is lost. The musical choices were perfect. Great cinematography and fx (some old school, "2001" technology, which, fortunately never really get dated, esp here as they were done by the originator, and were nice to see in the midst of all the digital fx in movies now). If all that piques your interest, then you'll probably like it. It's not a mainstream movie (understatement) so probably either a love it or hate it movie, as evidenced by the overall rating being so close to the middle of the scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful to look at, but it doesn't have a plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a beautiful movie to look at. But the reason most of us go to cinema or watch movies is to follow a story, get involved with characters, and we want to see what happens to them. But this movie isn't about that. It's about setting a mood, a tone... imagine someone told you to make a movie about a sense of loss, brokenness, betrayal, death, evil, brotherhood, and yet do this movie without dialog, without a story line and that's pretty much what we have here. Sean Penn maybe says 3 words for the entire movie. He's also barely in it. Jessica Chastain cries a lot. Brad Pitt (one of the producers) has a lot of yelling and screaming to do. Most of the acting is left up to the 3 kids playing 3 brothers. At the end of the movie I was thinking WTF!!! What was that? There's no beginning. There's no middle. There's no end. 3/10 for nice pictures. If only there was more to it than that.... Unfortunately I'll never get those 2 hrs back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a family and they live happily. One day, one of the sons passes away. Parents and brother regret. The brother calls his father and apologizes to him. Then reminiscence of the family starts from parents marriage. The reminiscence includes pictures of Mother Nature. The father is so strict, therefore his children do not laugh in front of him.I was surprised because father said to his children they must not become person like their father. He treats his children strictly because of his kindness for his children. However, his children resist him. Their mother treats her children tenderly, but they oppose her too. It is natural that children defy their parents. I resisted my parents too when I was young. However, I can understand feelings of my parents for me now. Therefore I think that I want their to understand feelings of their parents and I felt sad. This story is very difficult for me and I could not understand well. I want to know what this film wants to tell me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tree of Life has quiet beauty to spare, but storytelling takes a backseat to cinematography,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautifully shot with gorgeous cinematography and top notch acting from the underused Chastain and Pitt. "The tree of life" is a grand/small scale rumination on the existential struggle. I appreciate the films refusal to cater to the traditional model of storytelling, and the way Malick uses visuals instead of dialogue to communicate the films main theme. The story is very very simple, but Malick is trying to equate the struggles of this family (and the relationship between its parents and children) to some grand evolutionary design. Slow,quiet, and lyrical filmmaking is all well and good, but as this movie tries to be profound and artistic it somehow ends up seeming forced, shallow, and even worse pretentious and frankly boring in its execution.</fullReview>

Who do you think I am wrong please give me your reasons.I think a good movie should serve to recreate and educate people and this film did not find these qualities.I found the film boring, and because of that I think the film quality is reduced. Rating: 5 out of 10Some last words: Just because the movie is different, revolutionary cinematic poem, which want to call it, does not mean it's a good movie ... Incidentally, for those who say it will take to be recognized or futuristic, "far ahead", "a matter of changing habits" and in future then this movie will seem trivial if it evaluates itself and not by the premiums who won or the "revolution in cinematic history" that caused because of attractive recreational and got nothing, and that is that would be the key to success ... Again, I ask those who think I'm wrong to explain to me why, please, because I've thought a lot about it and I see no sense in considering this "the best film of 2011", as the prestigious Cannes festival considered.Is it that the majority is right or a minority which happened some juries are part of the 2011 Cannes?After all, this movie is to be seen by people ... or robots?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remembrance of things past in non-Hollywoodian America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As opposed to the prevailing opinion I happen to like every new movie of Terrence Malick more than the previous one ; that applies also to "The Tree of Life", the director's least epic and apparently most subjective work so far.The film, relevant in content, mostly brilliant in form and deeply affecting in both, undoubtedly has its flaws (cardboard characterization and bombastic finale, for example). But these are not of such proportions as those who marred some of its similarly ambitious contemporaries, let's say "Melancholia" by Lars von Trier. Malick holds his standards even in the pseudo-biblical sequence of Creation, where he does not shrink back from playing games a la Stan Brakhage in frames reminiscent of Godfrey Reggio's opuses, and, right next to it, from introducing CGI dinosaurs, an already stale attraction of mainstream cinema. In this respect "The Tree of Life" represents an intellectual exercise in style - there are references not only to other movies but to works of world literature, and, if I'm not wrong, also to particular European painters, classical and modern. But of course that's not in what the movie's strength and charm lies. Unfolding in perfect accord of image, sound and feeling that underlies and carries the former two, "The Tree of Life" is straight and simple, one is tempted to say anti-intellectual. Through the director's eyes we see his (ingeniously cast) hero as both his and our alter ego in search of happiness, truth and meaning in life ; at every moment we are there, taken in account, allowed to feel what he feels ; none of the beautiful images, none of the accompanying music pieces seemed ciphered, forced, too manipulative, clichéd or cheesy to me .... Malick, painting his story of coming of age and ageing in the United States between a hyper-authoritarian father ("Nature",surprisingly) and a nearly-angelic mother ("Grace")is both less and more than American poor man's Proust - for his medium is modern cinema and he is one of its masters.Times when abstract art was misunderstood and scorned are long gone. Many of us delight in lyrical poetry. Some got used to find pleasure in lyrical fiction, too. It seems we still have to learn to appreciate lyrical cinema. Malick is one - maybe the greatest - of the few American movie makers who are pushing the audience in this direction, and "The Tree of Life" is a true cinematic poem of life, light, love and loss ; for me, clearly a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a spellbinding life-affirming movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i think the best way for me to describe watching this movie is that it's like eating at an expensive fine dining restaurant for the first time. I don't really understand what I'm eating (why are the portions so small, and what are all those strange multisyllabic words the waiters use to describe my food?), but the meal is delicious, the experience is memorable, and somehow we appreciate the skill and craftsmanship displayed.there isn't much of a story, and the little plot that exists consists of short slice-of-life scenes depicting Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain raising their 3 boys from infancy to teenagers, presumably someplace in the south. Terrence Malick's films are notable for having dazzling cinematography, and many scenes of ppl frolicking with nature and animals, and this one is no exception.There's an interesting dynamic between Pitt, Chastain, and their eldest son, who grows up to be Sean Penn (hmm, i don't see a resemblance ;) Pitt's character is overbearing, a military disciplinarian, and Chastain's is happier and carefree, and their oldest son grows up to be rebellious and defiant in this environment. There's a lot of play, rough housing, disciplining, teaching, all the fun stuff of growing up.His films are notorious for having characters deliver numerous cheesy (some say pretentious) inner monologues. I don't pay much attention to them. The best way to enjoy this meal is to sit back, have an open mind, and just enjoy the experience. Every scene is stunningly beautiful - the close-ups, the use of shadows, the way the camera lingers on it's subject for the just the right amount of time before fluidly moving on. Malick has a unique visual aesthetic I haven't seen in other movies. also, The classical music incorporated works extremely well. this was a bit surprising to me, b/c i don't remember anyone raving about the music during awards season 2011. all the pieces fit together very well in this exquisite and fascinating picture.tldr: fans of terrence malick will love this. ppl looking for a conventional narrative, a strong plot, or explosions may want to look elsewhere. to the average moviegoer this may be like watching abstract art in the museum: i'm not sure what's the story here, but it looks damn good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Tree of Life" written and directed by Terrence Malick scored Oscar nominations for its director, for Best Picture and the cinematography. For Lubezki it was already the fifth unsuccessful cinematography nomination until he finally managed the win with his work for "Gravity". I would say that "The Tree of Life" is really more of an experience than a movie. In order to fully enjoy it, you will have to identify with any of the characters/story lines included. I did not and that is why only some scenes really wowed me, mostly in the first 45 minutes. The film runs for no less that 2 hours and 15 minutes and I can't deny there were several parts where it really dragged a lot.What I liked was the documentary aspect in the first half as well as the acting from Chastain as a tender mother, Penn and especially Pitt as the unrelenting father. The kids actor did not really wow me. I am particularly surprised how much praise McCracken got here. I did not feel he raised the movie in any way quality-wise. The film is packed with metaphors from start to finish, but there is really not much action. It is about a child's death which happens in the first 10 minutes already and the rest is about everybody near the boy mourning and dealing with grief in their very own way. The film is pretty religious too, especially early on. It is said at one point that the boy is with God now and that he actually always was. The father-son relationship may very well be the most interesting part of the whole movie.The film is decent to look at, has good music and nice costumes, but all this is not enough as the script did almost nothing for me. At least, the ending at the beach made it at least a bit worth to sit through the unappealing previous 2 hours. Anyway, I felt the title "Tree of Life" was fairly random and I have no urge to watch it again anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate melancholy.Floating in existential whispery sadness doesn't warm the cockles.I can't believe The Tree of Life was nominated for best picture. Sure there's good stuff in there, but it's been a long time since I wanted a movie to end so badly.Let me start out strong with my best argument.The hushed tone head-hopping voice-over. It's artistic, and perhaps it works well with this particular plot.But I doubt it.Terrence Malick used the exact same effect in his film The Thin Red Line from 1998. Thirteen years it later, it's still just as distracting and uninformative.I watched Thin Red Line with my Dad a week ago. He seemed to enjoy it more , because I didn't love it.In fact, I found TTRL dull, preachy and heartless. More 'technically' good, rather than 'unquestionably' good. Throw enough dollars into the visual layout, build a bunch of tension and you've got a thumbs-up.Folks toss around the word, 'boring' too much. 'Boring' is mostly for whiners. It should only be used to describe something that's extremely dull.The Tree of Life is boring.It's not better than The Thin Red Line, despite a similar visual format.What is with the gospel music? Was the plot not dull enough?The cast is excellent. Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain and Sean Penn are all very good.With all the stylish editing, the movie's very difficult to follow.Half of The Tree of Life is nature imagery, and features footage of phenomena from big to scale, from water molecules to supernovae. I'm open to a more whimsical form of storytelling, but eventually it gets tiresome.The reason I disliked this movie is because I think Terrence is saying a lot less than he lets on.As a period piece and a study of a family living in Waco, Texas in 1956, I'm fine with it. But do we need all of this existential stuff, the intergalactic imagery or the vague timeframe?The puzzle pieces don't seem to fit together in any coherent fashion.There are a couple things I'm confused about.When the velociraptor removes its foot from the wounded dinosaur's head, is that supposed to be the moment in Earth's history when humans began evolving? That our greatest redeeming quality is the capacity for compassion?Well, if so, then great! What's it teach us about Brad Pitt's family in 1956?I'm not convinced the dinosaurs belong in the movie.The Oedipus complex is also something I never connect with. Perhaps Terrence is trying to show how it manifests itself even in recent history.I don't know, and I guess I just don't care.The Tree of Life has a few good moments, however.Young men will appreciate much of the father-son interactions between Brad Pitt and Hunter McCracken.Whenever Jessica Chastain's on-screen is generally enjoyable.At one point, she's bouncing and twirling in zero gravity beside the tree and it's enchanting.If Terry cut out some babbling brooks and tossed in a bit more of Jessica dancing on air, The Tree of Life may have been great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story is about family. The father, acted by Brad Pitt, is a strict and serious person and the mother is kind and thoughtful lady. I know this was made in America, but I felt the figure of this family was typical Japanese family image in the past. Father tells children not to talk while eating except the father and tells to act as a gentleman. And if the children do something against him, he gets angry and sometimes becomes violent. The mother wants to tell father it is too strict but she is also afraid of him. So when he is out, she plays outside with the children and laughs together. In the film, the father comes home being tired and sad. Since then, his attitude to the children changes little by little.When I saw this movie first time, I could't understand anything. What's happening? What's going on? But second time, I could read the father's big love to the family and his hope that the children grow up to be an independent gentleman becomes real. There are lots of scenes in nature like sunrise, sea, forest,,, Those are very beautiful, but I still could not read what those mean in the film. Therefor, I want to watch it again.</fullReview>

My parents are this big as this movie shows - every parent is, for good or bad, every individual is.

		<fullReview>This is my first film review on IMDb. I'm not a new member but never before have I watched a film that has made me feel the need to write a review like 'The Tree of Life' has.With a great cast and what sounds like a good plot/concept, I sat down to watch this with high hopes, the only thing worrying me the negative reviews I had seen on here shortly before viewing. A birthday gift from a friend, it seemed like my kind of thing, I like Brad Pitt, I like Sean Penn and I like experimental film. I can tell you now, listen to the reviews, this 'film' is 2 hours of pretentious drivel, without a plot.It could have been so good, but it's as if they tried too hard. I've given it 2/10 because a) it's very well filmed and very beautiful in places and b) the cast, but that is literally all that it has going for it. At times there are points where you find yourself slightly getting into it but these are gone as soon as they started due to the scene changes and lack of plot. Half way through I was thinking perhaps it could pick up but it doesn't, in fact, it gets worse, finishing with a confusing and extremely unsatisfying ending.This film, put simply, is made rotten by trying to be amazing. And it's such a shame. I can see why some left the cinema during screenings of it - I gave a sigh of relief as the credits finally rolled.</fullReview>

Pretty sure that brad pitt was high in signing up for this movie or owed terrence malick a huge favour that he couldn't run for his life when he was offered it. as for sean pen, well he would have been excited at the chance to call younger brad pitt his father so he's excused. As for the rest, i don't even think they realised they were being captured by a camera until the movie came out. and did the director soak his script in his cup of coffee or something? what does the death of the kid have to do with the birth of the universe? or a kid throwing away a stolen nightwear with some dinosaur moving about. how does brad pitt being a bad father and the volcanic eruption correlate and why are they all walking in the beach in the end? i think it would be a more interesting movie to see how the director convinced the stars to act in it. And for this movie, i would like to request the censor board to make it double A-rated for the elderly nearing a 100 years who have no way to while away their time and might as well die in the cinema. cursing their life before they die though.</fullReview>

The scenes displayed made me feel like I was floating in a lake looking up at the clouds and letting my mind wander. There was no real sense, or continuity, to any of it.The cinematography was its only salvageable characteristic, akin to an abstract painting that looks beautiful, but you have no idea what it's supposed to be. Other than that I was very disappointed in the film. There was no plot to speak of, and I felt no connection to any of the characters. I have no idea what the point of this film was. I kept hoping it would pull itself out of a dreamlike state and put some sort of meaning together, but there was nothing to grasp.

Unfortunately I don't believe it is supposed to be a "Nature Film".We waited for some sort of plot development and by the time we realized that none would be forthcoming, we had already committed so much time, it seemed the better choice was to hope that somehow all would be revealed eventually.

		<shortDescription>"Only Here, On NatGeo".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the beautiful images and soundtrack.When I've pressed the Play Button, I didn't image i was about to look an abstract view (from beginning to end).Photography, acting, soundtrack and all those nature views were amazing. It really takes you to the tree of life roots. Nature as God's beauty and we as the beautiful creatures of God (perhaps more poetic than it sounds). The nature-takes were all just stunning. There's even macrophages, there's everything, looks like you're watching Discovery or NatGeo, too bad sometimes it doesn't seems to have anything to do with the plot itself.This movie simple ain't for everyone. And to be truly it is a crap mostly times when it seems to be going nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. And since mostly humans don't know where the hell they're life is going to i don't believe they would easily understand what the Three of Life is about.But see from this side: you're not the bigger, you're not the newest, you're not the strongest... (this list could keep going for ages). And When you see there's something wrong with your life, you'll have to go back till it's roots because this is the way you'll find redemption.yeah, the basics is pretty much it.Don't recommended as a Must See. But see for yourself and come back here to say what you have found.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is most definitely not for everyone and it was too much for my taste. When I watch a movie I want a clear storyline and I don't want things to be too abstract. I love when a movie makes me think deeper about things but this one took it a bit too far. I feel that if I want to see beautiful images of nature and the universe I would much rather watch a documentary.The Tree of Life is a very abstract movie, you really have to go in and analyze every little thing and define its symbolism to the story of these boys. And most importantly you have to be able to relate to the characters in order to care for them, I did not care for the characters most likely because I did not understand all the symbolism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terence Malick's personal vision may be too enormous to grasp in entirety, but many elements from Jack's childhood are relatable to all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A curious moment from the film was when a mightier dinosaur held a tamer one to the ground by its neck but later decided to spare it. Cutting to the present later, Mr. O'Brien holds his son by his neck in a manner suggesting severity, but ultimately shows care towards him. This personal interpretation of mine didn't strike me immediately, but after reading a few pages on Wikipedia about the actual 'Tree of Life' concept and some interpretations on IMDb, I could make sense out of certain scenes. There are many other parts that are hard to decipher and relate to especially when one does not know much about Christian faith and other philosophical concepts, but what one can make out is certain familial values such as relation between mother-son, father-son and brothers. The Oedipal complex was identifiable, and I also could empathize with Jack's rebellious attitude as he grew up ? had the movie done away with everything about Creation and Afterlife, restricting itself only to the O'Brien's lives, this movie would have been simplified for the general public. But Terence Malick, like a few audacious writers-directors such as Fellini, Paul Thomas Anderson, Kubrick, brings his personal vision, experiences and learning (he has a degree in psychology) to screen and we either have to accept it or reject it.Tree of Life reminds me of Magnolia, which I had recently seen ? both the films blanket fundamental emotions with high grandiose and abstruse themes, and we see many beautiful moments on the screen, sometimes too many. This movie too has a high dose of beautiful moments, a glimpse of which is provided on the poster of the film itself ? Mr. O'Brien holding his newborn son's little feet, three boys climbing the tree and playing in the lake, an angelic Mrs. O' Brien levitating, Jack and his little brother crying etc. On top of this, we have an extended scene depicting how the world came to exist and how an evolution occurred after the meteorite explosion. The actors mostly act as narrators, asking questions about life and consequences of actions, while speaking in hushed whispers that sound like a church prayer session. The emulsion of these may prove to be overbearing for many viewers, and had the film lowered its scale and been presented in less radical terms, it would have received a wider appreciation. In spite of the draining narrative, many aspects of the film are presented with utmost regard to personal vision ? Terence never tries to divert from the approach he has already chosen in an attempt to please a wider audience. This love-it-or-hate-it is what would make his films more talked about in times to come.The cinematography is magnificent and the most noteworthy aspect of the film. The angles used during most sequences give the movie a whole new look, and certain frames repeated in the course of the movie reinforces their symbolism. The actors show high commitment to their roles ? Brad Pitt as the disciplinarian father who repents on certain actions he has taken during his life, gives a splendorous performance. Jessica Chastain as the bonny, caring and sympathetic mother succeeds in a relatively easier role as Mrs. Obrien. Hunter McCracken is completely believable as young Jack while Sean Penn does justice to his short role.Tree of Life can drain you with the enormity of its scale but I do think most would relate with Jack's childhood and his questioning views on life. The film's aesthetic value is also a sight to behold.My rating: 7.2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I frequently travel internationally and this film has been making the circuit on various in-flight entertainment systems. Since it's so long I thought it would be a great opportunity to settle in and kill off a big piece of a 15+ hour flight. The first time I tried it I had to give up after about 30 minutes - the first 30 minutes of the soundtrack consisted of voice-overs speaking poetry and what seemed like Bible verses in whispered tones over discontinuous shots of tragic slices of life from a 1950's family, nature scenes, and astronomical shots of galaxies. Because of the airplane noise I couldn't make out what they were saying, even with the volume cranked to max. Since I was sure I was missing the gist of it turned it off and I resolved to try again. So yesterday, on a flight from Newark to Delhi I decided to give it another try, this time with my cool noise-reduction headphones, and I could actually hear what they were whispering. I lasted a full two hours before I gave up on it. I thought, "for sure, this will turn into something interesting." I mean, Brad Pitt? Sean Penn? Among my absolute favorite performers. Interesting cinematography, for sure this will become something to make an impression on me.But it left me cold. I turned it off after two hours. I have no ill-will toward the filmmakers, and certainly wouldn't disparage their craft, which is entirely evident here. I honestly do enjoy all different kinds of films, even many non-liner ones. But this one, it's not for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st third: promises a Kubrick-Esq cosmic reappraisal of post modern man questioning how he could have got it so wrong post credit crunch. Meanders into meaningless spaciness which stubbornly keeps the middle class white American existential angst central to the great cosmic vision. Conclusion: these people have no idea of how the rest of the world live.2nd third: Falling out of cosmic massiveness into a meditation on memory, the past and childhood, a second fruitful promise resonates with notions of Proust and 'Remembrance of things past'. The mundane elevated to great heights. A successful element in the film shows itself where the structure meanders not unlike 'mind' itself, dipping in and out of memory without apparent logic. However the meandering becomes conflicted as the plot less form of this film continues to feel for a way forward.3rd third: We wander out of pure contemplation of memory and the past and into an actual history which is at once very familiar. 1950s America, much revised over recent decades, it's clichés start to turn over. They remain somewhat mundane. No trying on mum's lipstick for these boys sadly, that would be too UN-serious. So we get stuck in a tedious plot- less account of depressing lives, where characters are too distance to form real attachments, but continue to develop through disjointed memory. The Proust effect wanes. Proust and middle America just don't go together. I start to speed through the last quarter of the DVD in the certain knowledge that i am missing NOTHING as the 'effect' is now too repetitive and predictable. The film finally loses the plot it never had in the first place. It does end up with a final reunion of all protagonists which is an idea stolen in it's entirety from the end of the 25 hour German epic film 'Heimat'and so comes across as a bit lame. bye bye thank god - talking of which - perhaps the best contribution in this film is a very convincing sermon by the priest concerning the meaning of the book of Job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word: confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am still trying to figure out whether I liked this movie... like everything else that was in it. It certainly had its moments, some outstandingly beautiful parts, but most of the time it felt like the kind of art where someone painted the entire canvas blue and then called it something like "The pain of the world". Did I absolutely have to watch 20 minutes of what basically looked like a nature documentary? There's a difference between "makes you think" and "leaves you completely confused". I like movies that make you think and I could certainly think a lot about what this or that scene could mean, but do I really want to? I feel like I was shown a lot of beautiful images with great music but without being told a real story. There were glimpses of one, but for me it just wasn't enough to truly enjoy. This movie basically forces you to provide your own entertainment by wondering the entire time what anything means (otherwise you'd be seriously bored) while providing a pretty slide-show with good music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a pretentious attempt to portray human childhood, seen in the context of cosmological history, as a metaphor for life. The hope is that the audience will take the humanity of the subject as the theme of 'grace', while seeing that grace of humanity inside the larger context of an uncaring, yet miraculous and marvelous, 'nature'. The initial biblical quotation from Job is meant as a statement that God should not care very much for the bad attitudes so often seen among humans, since he already has done his part in providing an ample environment. Another interesting philosophical point is that there are two kinds of humans, those that are natural and those that are graceful, and that these two kinds represent the yin and yang that make up human families and society. I say this is pretentious because while parts of it at least make up a good trip to the planetarium, other parts are just a mixture of good and bad acting, during which you have to ask yourself over and over if it really was worth watching the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Soon as I was watching it I was thinking to myself...."this is just like Thin Red Line mixed with 2001: A Space Odyssey." Lol, little did I realize until after I watched it, and read up on it, that it was directed by the director of Thin Red Line, and that all the special effects were done by the guy who did 2001: A Space Odyssey. That old school style of doing it all using real materials etc, rather than CGI. Which really does make everything look so real compared to CGI (naturally).As for the film itself, I agree with what Sean Penn said about it. It would've worked so much better if it was a linear narrative. I didn't enjoy the movie much at all in its totality. Far too ponderous and self-infatuated, far too laboring in how the film just breaks up during a narrative and goes into far too-extended periods of 2001: A Space Odyssey SFX. Especially around two-fifths of the way thru it when it broke off for soooo long. I wanted to poke pencils into my eyes. I mean, 2001 is one of my all-time favorites, and I loved the actual SFX of Tree of Life, so beautiful etc. But it just didn't suit the movie, and not to the extent it was done. It really detracted. It was overkill x100. Too try-hard. Whereas it suited 2001, it wasn't overdone, it was jarring, sinister and beautiful all at once.The reason I agree with Penn is because the actual story/script/acting/directing of the real world scenes were among the best in cinema. So many brilliant subtle little scenes, camera angles, and pov-like angles, so much said in just the unspoken acting between characters. So many aspects of the family life being shown/told that reminds us ALL so much of our own upbringing. That if the film was a linear narrative, only very tiny 2001 SFX, and the movie length kept to something like 90 mins, it would've been a veritable cinematic masterpiece.</fullReview>

Was he was on drugs when he made this one? Thank God I didn't waste any money on this garbage (got a DVD from the nearby library). I have never had so much difficulty fighting the urge to stop watching a movie but sat through it until the end just to see if there was any point at all.Cannes giving an award for this garbage is a further confirmation of the deterioration of their standards. I read somewhere that some of the audiences asked for a refund after walking out of the movie theaters. No wonder!

I'm happy I saw it on TV and did not pay for this, I would have walked out. I tried to stop the review, but it was rejected because they want 10 lines of text and to be honest I hate wasting the time writing a longer review, in my opinion it's a waste of time.

What are we supposed to learn/experience/gain/feel about any of this film if it is so boring you can not watch it? ANYONE who isn't totally obsessed with being original just for the sake of being original WILL either fall asleep or give up half way through the film.Now to fill the required ten lines for a review I will give a bit more information for those that care:Do not try to force art on people and tell them they are ignorant or dogmatic if they decline to watch (or feign enjoyment of) this kind of film. It's not big and it's not clever. Perhaps I wouldn't be so upset if I did not fall into the same kind of trap as others no doubt did, of thinking that somehow the standard plot tools and script tropes are a sign of laziness. They are not. If anything, tactical use of tropes to help get an audience to the end of the film is the least that any good film should achieve. This film does not achieve this, even with a star-filled cast. Maybe I'd be less annoyed if I didn't feel quite so vindictively duped into thinking that this would be a good film just because it has these stars in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peal the layers of life's moments back from the scenes of this movie combined with the flashbacks to the beginning of man's existence and it is clear that the movie is about God's love for each of us. That from the beginning of time to the present we live in our moment set apart just for us as apart of God's greater plan for our eternal salvation. The rebirth into eternal life of the characters at the end of the movie confirms this. We live in such a secular world that it is no surprise that many leave the movie scratching their heads, lost about the movies message as much as they are lost in understanding God's unfathomable love for them.</fullReview>

I enjoy most kind of movies and everyone considers me a very sensitive person, so I enjoy the images, the music, the sequence, the voices but this movie just made me want to die: BORIIIIIIIIIIIIIING!!! the nature and universe scenes made me think I was watching a bad documentary... Were they out of budget? I don't think Brad Pitt and Sean Penn were in total more than 5 min each! If you want to watch it, just do it!

		<fullReview>Another film I checked out from my local library which is where I get all my movies nowadays since I cannot imagine paying 10 bucks to see junk like this.Anyway, I'll just cut right to the chase. Being a Baby Boomer myself, I cannot for the life of me figure out why the main character has a problem with his father, played by Brad Pitt. From all indications, the guy is a great dad, albeit in a 1950s Ward Cleaver way but hey, we could use a few more of those these days I say. The guy was affectionate, caring, balanced discipline with love, took them to church, yet wasn't too preachy, went to their events, etc. What was to hate? And I agree with the dad that mom really had a problem but why? Unless the father was some sort of phony I just don't get all of the angst. The mother seemed more of a free-spirit but moms are supposed to be different than dads so again, why the angst? Was it because it was the 1950s and she felt unfulfilled? The whole creation sequence and then the primeval sequences were very interesting although how they tied into the movie escapes me too. And what are we to think became of the family between the time they left Waco until Sean Penn shows up looking old (as in today)? That would have been about 50 years. I hate to sound like a broken record, but I just didn't get it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I should have read more about this film before I bought it home on BLU-RAY. My wife an I watched it on our 3 metre projection screen and although we didn't turn it off after the first half hour it was hard to keep watching. Honestly in all we found it highly not entertaining and I noticed the stats for the film cost and low box office returns reflect this for most people. As a film experiment of this type I would say it failed dismally after all the purpose of a film is to entertain and/or to provoke emotion. This did neither for us. Yes a story about childhood along with a disjointed view of the creation of the universe using special effect sequence techniques lifted from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 Space Odyssey 1969. I thought I may have been seeing Hubble telescope images but nothing so grand.A lot of the dialogue is in whispers some hard to hear. The film as displayed to audiences used to a reasonable style of story telling will find this film most disappointing. I believe the writer/director has not fully related to the audience in a clear concise manner as to what on earth the story is about as exists in his mind. My BLU-RAY copy will be resold on e-bay along with a selection of other "B" grade films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have a lot of spare time in my life but last night I wasted 2.5hrs of my life watching this and I feel it my duty to spend another 10min in the hope that it might stop just one other person making the same mistake.I put "may contain spoilers" simply to cover myself - I have no idea if I will accidentally reveal what this film is about because I didn't understand it at all. The film opens with a verse from Job. I'm a Christian and had no issue with this, to be honest I think that it just sets the scene of Bible Belt America and few should be upset. Then comes the announced death of a 19yr old: I'm still not sure who (?the second oldest son) or how (?Vietnam - it's 19yrs after the 1950s). Shortly after that, I think the screen saver might have kicked in - certainly nothing made sense any more. There were some more bits from the Bible which I think may start to grate with people who didn't want a overtly Christian film. Oh and some dinosaurs.I think we might then have returned to something of a story - I was starting to get pretty wound up by this point. A few things actually happened, I had to rewind over them to try and see who was actually involved but that was never clear. But mainly nothing happened and there was a limit from what I could discern looking into the eyes of a 8yr old boy. However brilliantly he was acting.Then the screen saver kicked in again. About 2hrs after I really wish the film had ended, it actually did.Look, the premise of the film is good and contains some important themes that are worthy of exploring. Why does God allow suffering? Why do bad things happen to good people? America's difficult relationship with Christianity and possibly the Vietnam conflict. But the audience needs to be prepared that's what they're going to see: not everyone wants that. And *spoiler alert* - the film gives NO ANSWERS WHATSOEVER. There was no redemptive elements at all. Or, if there were supposed to be, I was so angry at having wasted an evening on this, I wasn't in a place to receive them. The camera work was excellent - but it was footage that was destined for another (or maybe 3 other) projects. I wonder if the cast was conned into it - I can't act for toffee and wouldn't want to be associated with this film, I can't imagine what Pitt and Penn thought when the saw it. The abstract bits were just that. They literally added nothing.1 star for good camera work. Oh, and because you can't score anything 0.Honestly, do not waste your time. Watch something else. Anything else. I implore you.</fullReview>

Wonderful, Blew me away, is how I would describe "Ben Hur", or "Gone with the Wind", just to name two brilliantly made films.

		<shortDescription>A challenging but ultimately rewarding masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while, a film comes along that blurs the line between what is cinema and what is art. Akira Kurosawa's masterful 'Ran', Martin Scorsese's 'Raging Bull', Godfrey Reggio's 'Koyaanisqatsi', the list goes on. For the two mediums to become one, it takes the skill of true filmmaker with a vision; not some director who's lazily looked to see what's next on the schedule. 'The Tree of Life' is no exception. It is a dazzling and towering work of directorial passion and cinematic magnificence. Some films enter life with a sense of vision only to have it tampered with, contorted and ultimately lost at the hands of a Hollywood studio out for a financial hit. Only a few filmmakers in the modern age have managed to entirely avoid this; people such as Paul Thomas Anderson or Darren Aronofsky are an example; yet ever since his feature- length debut 'Badlands' in 1973, Terrence Malick has never failed to make anything less than brilliant and with this, his fifth film, he has delivered what may be his masterpiece. One integral aspect that makes it so is its clear definition of vision, because make no mistake, this is indeed an ambitious work. It is a film that strives to embody all of existence since the dawn of time and filter it through the prism of a relatively insignificant family. One moment we are in the late 50s/early 60s where we see a devastated mother grieving over the death of one of her sons, the next we are in the modern day with a disillusioned Sean Penn gazing out an office window, then we are transported back 65 million years into the past as that infamous asteroid crashes into the Earth. And that's only the first 30 minutes. To attempt something like this is the sort of thing that could become an embarrassingly-bad folly, yet in the hands of Malick it comes across as beautiful and awe- inspiring; in the words of the brilliant Roger Ebert, "The only other film I've seen with this boldness of vision is Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'". You and I both, Ebert.From that opening paragraph, you should have a fair idea whether or not this film is for you. Many have declared it to be "self-absorbed", "pretentious", "self-indulgent", "tedious" etc, and while I see their points, I have to disagree wholeheartedly. As I sat in the cinema, mesmerised by what I was witnessing on screen, about fifty percent of the audience had left by the halfway-point, illustrating one key aspect of it ? this is not a film for everyone. Much like Malick's scripts, it refuses to conform to narrative norms, often portraying things in a rather oblique way, such as the underwater house or the doorframe placed vertically on the beach. It asks something of its audience, demanding them to forget simple-story structure and scene progression and most importantly, to be patient. "A clearer and more conventional narrative would have helped the film", asserted Sean Penn in an interview after its release. It's very difficult to agree, because its experimental nature is what makes 'The Tree of Life' what it is - the type of work that only Terrence Malick could make it.It's no secret that Malick has garnered a reputation amongst actors as being someone you should strive to work with, often getting the very best out of them and this film is no different. Despite being often regarded as a 'movie star', Brad Pitt has proved himself to be a serious and often great actor, in films like Andrew Dominik's brilliant 'The Assassination of Jesse James' and he gives his finest piece of acting yet. Remarkably mature, he is entirely credible as the authoritarian and disciplined father, showing signs of true depth in his quieter scenes, such as a scene where he confesses his feelings of failure in life and being let down by the American Dream. Jessica Chastain delivers a silently luminous performance as Ms O'Brien, which given to a less- capable actress would have clumsily tripped into daftly-drippy territory. The three young boys playing the O'Brien's sons fare brilliantly, appearing effortlessly- naturalistic, all-the-more- impressive considering that they are first-time unknowns. And as for Sean Penn, well, it's clear how he feels about his role, yet even so, he competently serves his purpose.All of Malick's films have been visual wonders, whether it the expansive open plains of 'Days of Heaven' or the natural and untouched beauty of 'The New World', yet nothing could prepare me for the spectacle that 'The Tree of Life' possessed. It is a work so beautiful as to rival the aforementioned 'Koyaanisqatsi' and so consistent in its beauty that any frame could be proudly hung on a wall. Yes, its religious theme may come across heavy-handed, with occasional lines of dialogue and one brief garden-set scene (if you've seen it, you know the one) that may feel a bit silly, and yes, it may be a bit too abstract for some, but in the grand scheme of things, these flaws are only minor. It feels like the work Malick poured in his heart into more than any other, drawing from his life and passionately challenging his vision. This is a film about many things - childhood, existence, death, love, and suffering - asking thoughtful questions that Malick wisely leaves with the audience. Simultaneously intimate and epic, it is a stunning and challenging masterpiece of rapturous beauty and profound emotion, truly unlike anything to ever grace cinema screens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt like I was watching the discovery channel after huffing glue. Nice pictures with vague words fading in and out.This is like "The Thin Red Line" meets "Koonanisquastsi", but without the interesting war plot or the awesome Phillip Glass music. I can see what they've tried to do here, but honestly it's like Vanilla Ice trying to write a great Symphony - the talent is clearly missing.You could chop up some of the film's more stunning photography and make and awesome film loop for a dance club, some of it is very pretty. Kudos to Sean Penn for trying to make the film interesting.If you can watch it for free then by all means give it a go - you might get something out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spiritually Ambitious "Tree of Life" Attempts to Graft "2001 - A Space Odyssey" and "Koyaanisqatsi" onto a Coming of Age Tale With Mixed Results</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally finding the leisure time and inclination, I watched "The Tree of Life" (hereafter ToL) on HBO on Sunday, July 8, 2012 at 9:40 a.m. At the end, I concluded that if you 1) like going to church, 2) like thinking about the movies you watch and/or 3) don't mind following a convoluted non-linear plot, then "Tol" should satisfy you. If you don't like doing any of the aforementioned things, then "ToL" will probably be a boring slog.I agree with the posters who advise viewers to watch "ToL" with a calm, contemplative attitude, because "Tol" indeed is not your conventional fun time at the movies. The director Terrence Malick recklessly and audaciously is swinging for the spiritual fences and is daring to ask the Big Questions about morality, God's justice (or lack thereof), man's relationship to God, why even good people suffer, all that deep stuff. However, Malick collides with the inherent, unavoidable problem any director challenging the infinite has: his literal, visual interpretation of God's mind is necessarily, pretentiously inadequate. I am referring to the admittedly spectacular biological, psychological, paleontological, and cosmic images wafting through "ToL". The quiet images, by themselves, announce to those who are receptive that, yeah, God is great and majestic. No real problem there, even if time-worn, if Malick had left it at that and created a balanced version of "Koyaanisqatsi", the 80's film that used human images to illustrate life's chaos.However, Malick artificially grafts this "divine imagery" to an earthy, earthly tale of the chronological history of a '50s Texas family headed by a somewhat disciplinarian, occupationally frustrated father (Brad Pitt) and gentle, compassionate mother (Jessica Chastain). Respectively, they personify the perennial nature vs. nurture conflict (I prefer the word "nurture" to the vague term "grace"). Knowing them only by their last names Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien solidifies their symbolic status. The true conflict revolves around the festering rivalry between the father and his oldest son Jack (Hunter McCracken as a boy, Sean Penn as an adult). The languid, usually silent, and twisty progression of the family's life, beginning toward the end when it receives a telegram informing them of the death of, I assume, the second oldest brother as a (I think) Vietnam soldier, and the events that test their mettle and their faith, is also compelling, again by itself.But when "ToL" attempts to meld these two tropes, the mundane and the ethereal, I'm afraid it dilutes the power of both tropes. I think I see the movie's purpose here; to show that God transcends mere earthly affairs and that the power of caring, of love, of nurture will quash the woes and cares of brute animal nature and will bring us peace, at least in the afterworld. Again, it's a noble purpose that few movies dare touch. But, you know, the result comes across as preachy and simplistic and as platitudinous as the well-meaning but hackneyed words of comfort the Grandmother (Fiona Shaw) gives Mrs. O'Brien after she gets that telegram.If Malick had exclusively taken the "2001/Koyaanisqatsi" route or "Great Santini" route, personally I would have more impressed. By combining them in "ToL" it makes the effort seem a little self-conscious and forced. Lovely and stunning as the "cosmic" images were, I would have excised them and kept the remaining family structure, even the dreamy, stream-of-consciousness elements intact. That way, we could see the O'Brien family legitimately wrestle with their psychosocial and spiritual dilemmas (especially Jack's concern that he is emulating the less admirable aspects of his father's character) and arrive (or not arrive) at a resolution. Frankly, the cosmic images are, I think, a tad artistically dishonest, because we the audience can witness them and perhaps take solace from them, while the mundane O'Briens cannot. Too deus ex machina for my taste.Therefore, my verdict on "ToL" is ambiguous. I aesthetically appreciated Malick's attempt at apotheosis, to remind us that love is the path to God. But my intellect recoiled at the clichéd imagery "ToL" resorted to in order to demonstrate this, even if the movie had to. But I can just envision posters telling me, "Don't think about the movie too much, just feel it." I suppose. If you just let "ToL"s flow bear you along, it may make you feel better. Very well - 3.5 stars out of 5.P.S.: Two trivial points - first, the plesiosaur depicted in the movie could never had curled its neck backwards the way it did. Fossil studies show it lacked that flexibility. Second, the raptor shown later in the movie probably spared the prostrate hadrosaur not because it was merciful, but because it was not hungry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A staggeringly bad movie, exquisitely filmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strong contender for the most boring, laughably pretentious "major award-winning" film ever made.Completely lacking in what most people consider a plot, The Tree of Life is an extraordinarily tedious chronicle of a family, and the trials and tribulations of their largely uninteresting lives. There is very little dialog, and a large percentage of it is a failed attempt at being simple, yet somehow cosmically meaningful.Then there's the pseudo-mystical ending -- which most viewers will never see because they will have stopped watching long before -- which is disappointing, absurd, and ultimately an insulting attempt by the auteur to foist his half-baked philosophy on the by-now brain-dead audience.Technically the film is extremely well made, though, and a lot of the photography, camera-work, etc., is outstanding. The actors do a fairly good job too, with what they are given. But all of these efforts are totally wasted because of the hopelessly dull story line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the moment the bible quote came on screen I knew I was going to find this movie juvenile and insulting to my inquisitive mind. The whispering voice-overs only added pretentiousness to the mix.The ridiculous monologue from the mother, claiming some divine separation between choosing the path of nature, and that of 'grace' threw in some delusional thinking to an-already silly premise.Nature only wants to please itself, she tells us, but that if you accept god you'll have a happy ending. Wait a minute - is there any animal on Earth that wishes to please itself more than humanity?! And this is supposedly a being created in the image of some creator dreamt up to fill in the blank areas of human knowledge.Yes, nature only wants to please itself, for this is the reason life exists itself. It's called a survival instinct and every living creature on Earth is governed by it, or to be more precise, our DNA.Some kudos to the director for the wonderful visuals during the story of evolution, itself a surprising inclusion since the bible denies this occurs at all. This mirrors the current trend of religions to jump on the bandwagon of reality (the sciences, archaeology, etc) since the creation stories are becoming more and more foolish as factual knowledge becomes reluctantly accepted by the majority (the religious).This movie will no doubt appeal to those of a religious persuasion, for it directly aims for their self-pleasing beliefs, such as a special relationship with a fatherly figure, a simple, child-like explanation of the universe, and life after death (despite death of brain and body, all you ever are).If you are not so afraid of death that you'd invent a utopia afterwards to please yourself, or not so self-centred as to believe you are a pinnacle of evolution and 'special' in some delusional manner, then please avoid this movie.In short, stunningly beautiful to behold, but grossly pretentious and utterly ignorant of reality itself, in favour of pleasing viewers who, it promises do not live to please themselves.In a world where religion continues to destroy the world, the last item we need is another movie pandering to the delusional belief that they are chosen, special and morally pure, despite everything in reality appearing to the contrary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A transformative film, Intrapsychic Space Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie that ascends into a new art form. It takes on the most profound aspects of human consciousness, moving in a non-linear way through stream of consciousness, depicting emotion with exquisite forms in nature, outer space, marine life, biology, all streaming into one another to augment and exemplify the twists and turns of recollection, yearning for meaning, faith, understanding oneself in the context of ones childhood and relationship to parents and siblings. Iconic, overpowering images and music coax the viewer into deeper and deeper alignment with the protagonist, played by an adult Sean Penn, who works through the legacies of his childhood?a spiritual, gentle, loving and wise mother, playfully creative, and a difficult father whose punitive attitude harms his children and pushes family life into discord and chaos at times, and a sweet gentle brother, whose death at an untimely age generates a world of grief that must be traveled and transcended. For those who have done deep work on themselves in therapy or other forms of self help, and who are spiritually driven, this film is a rare gift of beauty, insight and light. Intuitive, finding story in non-linear, abstract and intra-psychic ways, the film makes a perfect organic sense, and leads to revelations and healing. An inner world, neo-Jungian Space Odyssey of sorts, epiphany following epiphany, this expansive, multidimensional voyage works a magic of transformation. A work of rare genius, which sets the bar very high for films that are brave enough to take on the human condition in a way in which more is more.</fullReview>

But it is ridiculous to call The tree of life a bad film.It is extremely sophisticated in its presentation of imagery to tell a story. No it is not your regular structured narrative. In fact it is quite cryptic in its use of symbolic imagery, but rest assured, it all has a meaning.I frankly found it very challenging the first time i saw it in the cinema. I subsequently watched it again and now watch it on blue-ray. And i can say it is becoming one of my favorite films of all time.The story, is basically about how everything in the universe is tied. It is realized by the use of loose narrative structure and stunning natural light images to convey the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick's Ineffability</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having at last viewed "The Tree of Life", I find myself oddly unable to add much to all the printed noise already devoted to it. The movie is a kaleidoscope of fleeting emotions, an epic pastiche that weaves a braided cord between the life of one man and the life of all things. The movie argues the innate glory of science, and the "birth of the universe" sequence inspires the awe and wonder its aiming for.Brad Pitt still looks like the slack jawed yokel of Inglourious Basterds and he's absolutely dreadful in it. Brad Pitt's face is too comic to ever be able to convey anguish. Sean Penn doesn't fare much better, monotonously slithering around a modern city, garbling incoherent platitudes. The presence of A listers undermines the integrity of the movie.&nbsp;The CG is equally dreadful, and at least 10 years behind technically. Despite these flaws &nbsp;- the incessant jump cutting, the nonsensical dialog, the mostly weak performances - I found myself quietly mesmerized throughout, in a sort of vegetative state. Malick attempts to find a cinematic equivalent to the affect of poetry&nbsp;and he mostly succeeds. You luxuriate in the sensation of images and it works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tree of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tree of LifeThe visually articulated, The Tree of Life, is a cinematographically beautiful piece of film. Director Terrence Malick's poetic image catches the story of a small town mid-western family in the 1950's, in which the eldest son witnesses death and questions the meaning of life. Just like every other family in Texas at the time, Brad Pitt plays the over-exaggerated disciplinary father, who finds the smallest detail of deficiency, and makes sure that it will never happen again. Due to the extreme conduct, the eldest son Jack played by Sean Penn, rebels against his father and because of the sight of death, has a confused state of mind. Released in 2011, The Tree of Life is filled with the most remarkably appealing scenery I've ever seen in a film; the cinematography and editing are two reasons alone, why any audience should watch this film.The cinematography is a major factor contributing to the elegance the film carries throughout the movie. The scenes captured on film in The Tree of Life seem beyond the genuinely realistic aspects of life, yet it's apprehended in the most natural way possible. Every close-up, medium shot, any shot, was taken with such swift precision that gives a sense of captivity to the audience, which makes them feel at home with the family in the film. The reason why the movie comes off as so uncontrolled is because the life of the family is filmed in a documentary style of fashion but not in its entirety; a few other scenes of the film are shot using different techniques and mechanics such as the dolly; for example there's a scene when the kids are running down a dirt road and the camera is tracking backwards. Terrence Malick also captured natural lighting perfectly, whether it was during a sunset or catching the ominous dark figure of the strict Brad Pitt. At times, it felt as if the film I was watching was an extremely well-made home movie; that's the effect that natural lighting has on an audience. The cinematography in The Tree of Life secured the title of the most angelic feature film of 2011 in my books, but grace can only get so far; a film is nothing without the deep emotional meaning the editing bestows upon it. Evolution in its generality is the concept used for the significant meaning of the film. Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, which is a film that also touches heavily on evolution, is the masterpiece that reminded me of The Tree of Life in almost every conceptual way possible. Although both directors are completely different in their own unique way, their meanings of evolution touched on the subject quite similarly. The way Terrence Malick incorporated his viewpoint of evolution was to use thematic montage, which separate shots are linked together not by the continuity but by their symbolic meaning. By doing this it gives the characters and settings a meaning that is given by the image previously shown, for example the evolution of nature showing a waterfall parallel with the image of young Jack, could foreshadow his rage and rebellion for later events in the movie.As ugly as evolution has gotten in present day Earth, it's quite the opposite with Terrence Malicks extravagant masterpiece. The Tree of Life, its literal meaning of the slow processed growth of a plant, grows on the roots of the fresh planted audience who observe this astonishing well-made feat. The cinematography is unforgettable and the editing is deep impacted, and yes the film is a prolonging two hours and thirty- nine minutes long, but the length of time is not a concern, because if you think about it, we need trees to survive, so take the time out of your day to watch the life of this tree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've given it the title of a 'work' as opposed to a film. Those going to the cinema to watch an entertainment film are not going to get what they expected. It is perhaps the expectations that have resulted in such polarised reviews (mainly 1's or 10's).The film is possibly best watched in the comfort of your own home, as it's not really a weekend cinema outing type of film. It possibly takes a couple of viewings to understand and appreciate it.I've given it 10/10 because it deserves appretiation for the work, cinematography, and boldness of subject matter. To give it 1 out of 10 is an indication of not liking or understanding the film, which is not the same as saying it is a 'bad' film.For those that have not seen it, I can best describe it as closer to a natural history and evolution documentary/drama, than a summer blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie like 4 months ago with a group of 4 which were: my Husband, female friend , 11 year old daughter and me. It is true what people has said there are two options: you will love or hate it , no in between.I think it has to do with taste and what kind of person you are. My 11 year old is an artist and she is in special art program classes, she really has talent and was the only one who enjoyed this movie.When it 1st started my 11 year old would say wow, uh how beautiful images, scenic views and probably saw deep things that we did not.I do want to mention we are Christians in case someone thinks we are not to spiritual.After 40 minutes seeing it my husband says: This is the worst movie I have ever seen and then my friend jumped in and said oh I thought it was only me and I was waiting for someone to say something. I felt so embarrassed because I had chosen it because of the reviews.It does have some beautiful scenes of landscapes,birds flying, sunsets that will blow your eyes away I have to admit.But it does not have much talking, the movie is slow, and the speaking you hear in the movie are the memory flashes of Sean Penn when he was a kid and remembers his family. Otherwise there is a lot of talking not in between characters but more like: Why am I here, Who am I , this is a type of movie that goes all the way along with questions of our existence and God. It looks very similar to a movie with Collin Farrell called the new world. With the difference that this 2nd movie at the middle of the plot gets good . I can not say it is not a good movie or bad like when you see an action movie, I think if you are a person that likes fast paced movies you will not like it. A recommend seeing a movie called the 5 people you meet in heaven, this one does have a very deep spiritual message.</fullReview>

Most of the audience was mid to senior age range. 15-20 mins in the exodus had started.I felt drawn in to the emotional experience without really understanding all of the meaning. By the end I was quite exhausted, not by a marathon film, but felt my mind had been probed,pushed and pulled and, at times, numbed.Waiting in the foyer for my partner, after most people had left, I suddenly found myself crying uncontrollably. Confusing for a 65 year old man !!!! It is only now after reading through some of the reviews that I realise it wasn't just my experience, but that of others too, to varying degrees.

		<fullReview>I don't know if I would categorize this as a "film". It is more of a two and a half hour poem with film used in tandem to express the complexity of the themes of the movie. I'm not a huge symbolism fan, nor a fan of Terrance Mallick's work in general. I have to say, though, that this is a remarkable work and easily Mallick's best.The best part of this film is it's tone. Tonally, this is one of the most beautiful works I have ever witnessed. There is definitely a point of view being expressed, and if you don't feel any sort of emotional weight with the ethereal tone then you might be a little dead inside.The narration is were the suspect definition of "film" comes into play. There is a narrative, but it doesn't have, necessarily, a conclusive beginning or end. And I can hear the complaints here. I personally wanted to know how the son died (my guess was suicide, my girlfriend's was death in combat)? But, I think the narrative bit was more of a backdrop to bring forth the basic question's that is film is trying to convey: "the nature of good and evil", " the nature of life", etc.I will not even pretend I am smart enough to understand this film. As with all of Terrance Mallick's work, I feel a little lost. Ultimately though, I know something beautiful when I see. Like most beautiful things in life, I may not be able to define it, but I know it's there, and Tree of Life is a beautiful work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright... so there will be people that love this movie, others that will hate it. I don't think anything really good or really bad can be said about this movie since it is really like an abstract painting. I think that for the sake of advancement and modernism it is an interesting add to try and figure out new ways to exploit movies as art rather than the usual money making machine aspect of it. But clearly this movie is not for everyone. Myself, working in the art industry, i can say that i thought it was a beautiful film, but awfully boring and dull.I think it could have been resumed to 15 minutes and it would have been great. I would compare this movie as to having a lucid dream, it is an impression, something that doesn't last in memory, it is a glimpse of life, of its grandeur.The thing is, that an ''impression'' usually last but a few second or minutes, the same goes for a reminiscence. those types of feeling are usually fleeting and do not last a couple hours. I think that for this reason this movie becomes boring and dull very fast, beauty and nature is appreciable, but giving an impression of nature, with no voice, no storyline, and no real structure can quickly become something that is infuriating, the human brain is conceived in such a way that it needs a storyline, it needs something to hold on to, and this movie does not do that.All in all, i would say this movie is beautifully made, full of talented crew and artists, but unless you are looking for beautiful cinematography, or you simply like to stare at nature and are a very peaceful and slow-paced person, i would not suggest this movie.</fullReview>

If you want an action blockbuster, a rom-com or Apatow buddy-com, the latest CGI or a horror shriekfest, this isn't for you. Even if you want a conventional family drama about a 1950s Midwestern family ruled by an authoritarian father and the impact he has on his children, this isn't for you. But if you're open to receiving an artist's enormously thoughtful, sensitive, emotive transmission of the inner lives of the people caught up in that drama, with all its love, anger, hatred, grief and mourning, and all the spiritual, cosmic thoughts that goes with that sort of experience, then yes, this may be for you.Many people, most of them young, are lucky enough never to have lost someone close to them, never to have grieved. They don't know that grieving inevitably brings up the deepest, broadest questions precisely at a time when we are least able to logically formulate them but most open to the answers. Questions like What's it all about? Why are we here? Where are we going? Do I have free will? Such people may find Terence Malik's view from inside the griever's mind, including the inchoate attempts to address these deep issues, incomprehensible and frustrating. Others, who have either gone through grieving or are open to an artist trying to tell us about it, may find this film thought-provoking, challenging and extremely beautiful. Malik is one of the very few directors who would take an interest in such subject matter, work out how to deal with it using the unique means offered by cinema as a medium, and dare an audience to take the artistic journey. He must have known that in terms of a wider audience, he would fail. But he also knew that he would be recognized by some as having created a work of art of the highest order, to be savored over the ages as one does the Iliad or Romeo &amp; Juliet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must be honest. The high rating of this movie on IMDb, and the great actors, provoked me to rent it for the family. I just KNEW I had a winner.As the movie started, I was impressed by the direction and camera work. It was dreamy, beautiful and immersive.After about 10 minutes, though, it started to get on my nerves. The lack of dialogue and the fancy camera work in every single disjointed scene really started to aggravate me and the family.At the 15 minute mark we all got sick and tired of waiting for something to happen. The lead-in was taking way too long. What very little dialogue there was ... well it was impossible to hear. Was it background whisperings of a ghost or something? We had to constantly pump the volume up and then back it back down. Irritating doesn't describe it.I suppose we should have waited longer for the movie to kick in. But we just couldn't take it any longer.It was just too artsy for us, and therefore a wretched flop. So much for good actors and high ratings on IMDb. Picking a movie is a lot more challenging these days.We bailed at about the 17 minute mark</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie missed the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, calling this film impressionistic is a serious understatement. I whole heartedly agree with the previous reviewer. While use of an impressionistic style can be a powerful technique of symbolically and or metaphorically connecting a film's underlying thesis, the lack of dialogue and meaningful discourse of the characters leaves the viewer hanging and hungry for such connectivity. Without this connection between characters, the viewer has a hard time relating, and thus, caring about these characters and the pain each of them carries. As such, staying interested in the story becomes a Herculean task. Although I Iam neither a big Pitt or Penn fan, even having such intense actors at the directors disposal could not rescue the film from itself. I regret this movie did not produce the effect it or its director intended. The film's imagery is profound and beautiful and the director made both obvious, and less than obvious, comparisons between life on a micro and macro level, ie, the use of babies/children in water and the birth scene. Yet, the film falls short, I believe, due to a lack of sense of cohesion because of the dearth of dialogue. Some things are better left unsaid, this is true, but the director must help the viewer "connect the dots" otherwise the audience runs the risk of floating aimlessly like the cosmic dust so often depicted in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to watch a film without a story line. I can see why many people hate this film, although I prefer to think it's mere frustration. Hell, I was frustrated when the film ended. The emptiness you feel after a Coen Brothers film is nothing like it. The second thing that causes frustration is that you won't fully understand anything. There isn't a plot, and the things you see don't add up. Especially the 15 minutes of 'metaphorical' nature shots. It's not that Malick should have left them out completely. It's just that 15 minutes of nature shots is no fun, unless you're on acid. If you manage to sit through the nature shots, you'll probably like this film better. It's not a story; it's an impression of childhood. And it was a good one. It felt like diving into a stranger's head to watch fractions of their memories. You see the rough shapes of events that make a person. You don't get to know the characters well enough to understand them, but you do get to watch the events and people that left the biggest impression on them. This makes the film intimate, but at the same time very unsuitable for curious people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One you just have to see for yourself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ostensibly, Tree of Life is about Jack (Sean Penn and Hunter McCraken), a child of the '50s whose father, Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt), was a hard man to live with. I say ostensibly because...well...you'll see. O'Brien isn't a drunk, abusive, or even particularly mean; he's simply hard, the poster boy for the hardworking, blue collar man of his generation. He loves his sons tremendously but has a tough time showing it and Jack takes the brunt of that difficulty. Most of the time Jack is shown in his teenage form and he is used to illustrate the concept of growing up. TOL cuts back and forth between the past and present which finds Jack as a businessman who shows many of the same characteristics of the father who he's always struggled to connect with. In many ways, Tree of Life could really be called Circle of Life and I think (think is a key word here) that's a big part of what director Terrence Malick is going for. But really that's only about 25 percent of the story. Using a non-linear narrative that is all at once difficult to stick with and wholly engrossing, Malick weaves together a tapestry that appears a bit jumbled when looking at each stitch individually but becomes a near masterpiece when viewed as a whole. TOL stretches out its focus to include the creation of the earth, the reign of dinosaurs (yes, this movie has dinosaurs), and the dawn of man. It then diverts to include nature of God, the role of prayer, and what I believe is Malick's own vision of heaven. If that sounds too wide-ranging, let me say that I'm probably not hitting on a number of other subjects that make their way into this film and yet it all blends together spectacularly. It is an insanely personal film, too, and that comes screaming through in every almost every scene. I have no idea what Malick's beliefs may be but whatever they are, he's clearly wrestling with his spiritual identity (again, no idea if that identity is Christian, Atheist, Buddhist, or whatever else). You can see why it took Malick so long to fine-tune and craft TOL and why the reactions to it have been so extreme between those who would call it the best film ever to those who couldn't make it through the first 15 minutes.I wouldn't say I fall into either of those camps. TOL is so challenging that I would stop short of calling it perfect or "one of the best ever." Personally I think there has to be a level of accessibility for a film to be included in those categories and that's definitely not a big part of TOL. At the same time, it is a supremely well-made film that is almost completely left up to the interpretation of the viewer and that in and of itself is a stroke of genius. (It's also the most beautiful film I have ever seen; if TOL does not receive some serious attention from the Academy Awards then I may have to consider anarchy.) In truth, my review and any other review you might read couldn't possibly do Tree of Life justice. It's the sort of film you simply have to see for yourself before judging it one way or another.Check out my reviews at ieatfilms.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Ado About Nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the acclaimed Tree of Life, Terence Malick presents a philosophical and theological reflection on human existence. It is without doubt an ambitious endeavor. The depth and complexity of the matter defies all forms of artistic language.Maybe that's why it's so rare to hear of a film writer willing to address this subject. I can remember a few noteworthy classics of the gender, such as The Seventh Seal (Bergman - 1957), Matrix (Wachowski Brothers - 1999) and 2001 - A Space Odyssey from Kubrick.Simply put, I did not like this movie. Malick started up from a wonderfulmotive, when he spoke of the difference between living according to nature and by grace. He hopefully addressed the eternal perplexity of man before the inevitability of death, touched the delicate question of the conflict between God's sovereignty and human will, but from this point on the narrative is lost in a banal story.Malick depicts, in a tense sequence of scenes - many of them taken in unconventional camera angles - a middle class family, with its warts and its relationship conflicts, but can not go deeper than that, though the actors are excellent, including Brad Pitt, which has one of his best performances.Perhaps Malick's intention here was precisely to counteract the smallness, impotence and the banality of human life to the magnificence, grandeur and beauty of the universe. Or just between nature and grace. However, I could not sense the impact of this contrast with the intensity it should bear.The fact is that eventually the narrative line ceases completely and the film becomes more of philosophical documentary genre, as seen in films like Baraka (1992) and Koyaanisqatsi (1982), but without bringing anything remarkable or innovative.The images flow in a monotonous stream, laden with a sterile, pretentious symbolism without any brilliance. The Tree of Life is worth however, in my opinion, for the beautiful photography, which makes it a bit less boring watching almost two and a half hours of solemn mediocrity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic portrayal of childhood spoilt by corny, slightly pretentious voice overs and shots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me the Tree of Life works could potentially be a fantastic film, but was spoiled by a serious overuse of very impressive and attractive...but really quite pretentious, 'arty', experimental cinematography. The main bulk of the film follows the story of a suburban American family from the perspective of their oldest child, portrayed as the memories of his adult self in the present (played by Sean Penn). For me this was the really great element of the film. The cinematography of the family scenes was stunning and it truly convinces us that we are reliving memories... rather than a more traditional style of narrative. The role of the strict and often violent father was played to perfection by Brad Pitt, and the acting was convincing all round.Unfortunately the film falls apart through the overuse of its artistic cinematography and voice-overs. While the occasional shots of nature were often quite powerful and beautifully shot and edited...they become incredibly lengthy, and in the end, tiresome. In fact the beginning of the family story is oddly and a little frustratingly interrupted by a huge string of quite random shots...including (believe it or not!) a CGI dinosaur... Part of this portrays the rather 'lost' and reflecting grown up child, (Sean Penn) and works to an extent (some of the final scenes at the end are quite powerful)...but I couldn't help cringing a little at his pretentious 'wonderings' through the desert with his wife (while still wearing his suit). The worst part for me, however was voice-overs...which contains lots of corny, 'philosophical lines'. This re-occurs several times throughout the film and it just made me cringe really. The occasional bits of voice over, such as for example the thoughts of the child as he grows up had a valid purpose and worked well. But like the cinematography it was grossly overused. For me the family scenes were more than powerful enough, and simply didn't need any of this additional footage. Apart from everything else it actually makes the film too long to be appropriate for this genre. (about 2h15) All in all I would highly recommend giving this film a shot purely to experience the impressive and powerful childhood portrayal. You may also disagree with much of what I have said about the other elements of the film as well. But prepare for a some pretentiousness (if that's a word!) and the occasional glance at your watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meandering Malick would be better if he was reigned in...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More of an experience than a movie.Okay, there is not a very distinguishable narrative. But is there any other Director out there who would weave a thread from a present day man struggling with the loss of his brother to all the way back when gases first came together to form the earth billions of years ago? Or how about from a carnivorous dinosaur about to feed on a wounded dinosaur felled in a riverbed that changes its mind and allows it to live? In most films, when a character is grieving - the Director doesn't go underwater and film a jelly fish for ten minutes, but Malick does and succeeds.Malick is the only Director out there who is just out there, neck deep in all of it; everything ? and trying to wrestle it all into a film that tells us something about who we are and where we came from. If you want a clear narrative that removes any need to think, I'm sure you'll enjoy Ryan Reynolds in the 'Change Up' or Justin Timberlake in 'Friends With Benefits'. If you want to embark on a journey that ponders all of human existence through a poetic visual imagination, perhaps you'll enjoy this. Brad Pitt is excellent as the very strict father trying to raise three boys in 1950s middle America. The casting of the children is incredible ? no surprise in a Malick film.I wouldn't recommend this to someone expecting to see and enjoy a movie with someone. Go by yourself. Go for the ride. Lean back and soak it up. The only observation I have is that for a Director known for the ethereal, this one is uber-ethereal. In Thin Red Line there was a clear narrative: take the hill. In The New World there was less of a 'story' and more meandering. I would hope that Tree Of Life marks the end of Malick's creative journey that is taking him further and further down the path of willowy meanderings and muses. Malick is in the winter of his career and I'd like to see him draw back to the force and presence of the story and the characters in Thin Red Line. I know he already has another film completely shot with Ben Affleck, and I'm looking forward to see what he has up his sleeve. I would hazard a guess that this script contains at most ten pages of dialogue - and that's a liberal estimate. Sean Penn had a great gig on this one - had to be maximum three shoot days for him and I wouldn't be surprised if it was two.Malick doesn't do interviews and won't entertain any story or film editing. He's totally in control and that's fine. But even geniuses could use an editor sometimes. Obviously, this isn't a film for the masses, but if he could make a film with a clear story and apply his genius to it, then far more people could enjoy his work. What good is it if nobody sees it? Maybe he should Direct a screenplay that wasn't written by him, maybe he should co-write something with a brilliant screenwriter ? something, because genius made for the few is at the end of the day somewhat of a waste.Brian Depalma is another stubborn genius who wants to do it all his way all the time with no editor's input. Depalma should stick to character stories: Scarface, Carlito's Way, Phantom of the Paradise - but he won't, instead we get Bonfire of the Vanities and Black Dahlia. There's no easy recommendation for Malick though, all I can say is that with a tighter narrative and more narrative tension he would draw the audience closer to the characters and make the viewer feel and think more - which is what I believe Malick wants.Here's a suggestion ? there's talk of Cormac McCarthy's 'Blood Meridian' getting made ? now there's an incredible combination of talent ? just wishing.</fullReview>

Then my wife suggested to fast forward to see if it was likely to get better. I was amazed that at 10x speed things still seemed slow and included a planet earth style section....weird.

However, there are surreal movies in the past with equally confusing and perplexity but they worked marvelously for me. The problem with this movie did not really work well for me because it is far from being wholesome, largely tainted by the overly-exposed meaningless screen time of the family life (the non-surreal elements) that does not allow the other arcs to contribute enough to the overall theme.</fullReview>

And I have sat through some turgid dross in my time (most recently the hackneyed, cliché pond scum of a film that is Lockout) and I have always managed to find something to cling on to, something to see me through to the end.Not so Tree Of Life. From the obscure opening biblical quote to the (I presume) visual representations of god, this film totally turned me off. The faux-moody opening ten minutes I watched consisted of people wandering around as if struck dumb, zombie like. There is no sound either. I mean no real sound. We can hear the actors talking, but there are no other sounds. Inside the house we can hear her heels on the floor, and blowing of wind. That's it. Wind. Inside a house. The constant (what I call) buzz cuts - you know the ones, where the camera zooms in on an everyday object, like a cup, and then suddenly cuts to be a lot closer to it, as if somehow this gives the cup some sort of significance, some mystical quality. The fact that people in this film don't seem to talk to each other, they just sort of mumble single short sentences. No conversations. Everything is white. It's almost as if they are trying to turn an a-list film into an indie film and they totally overcook it. Maybe I am doing it a disservice by not watching it. Maybe I have missed the greatest cinematic experience of my life. But I doubt it.</fullReview>

I was put off by the scenes of evolution and it seemed like kind of a stretch, but I kept watching to see if it tied together, and I think it did, very well.The religious content seems to bother a lot of viewers, but you have to remember when the film takes place. The family is religious, as it should be considering the time period. Most families were very religious, and if you don't like that element in a film, you probably shouldn't be watching movies that take place in this period.This film did a beautiful job of capturing the lighthearted way we look at the world as young children, and how we slowly come to learn about the darker side of life and the fate that eventually we will all die. Jack's learning process was very believable and true to life.Also, for those who think the scene at the end is supposed to show the family in heaven, please do some reading about the film's plot and meaning.

The film also does an incredible job of making the viewer feel uneasy and impressed with just how disturbed the young boy is. The plot, however, moves at a glacially slow pace and the movie is mind-numbingly boring. The only reason you stick with it is because you figure eventually something is going to happen. But nothing ever does. It's pointless and I feel absolutely empty having watched it. I can't give it 1 star because there is great effort and attention placed at setting the mood, and it is largely successful. But would I ever watch this again or recommend it to anyone else? Absolutely not. Setting a mood is a good start, but once you've set the mood you have to actually take the viewer on a voyage with that mood you've set.

I ordered a copy as soon as I finished watching it the first time even though I do not yet own a BluRay player.The film does not remind me of "2001: A Space Odyssey" even though one of the same special effects people worked on both films. It does not remind me of "Stand by Me" though I like that someone linked them?I understand why Rooprect compares them. The film is impressionistic more than expressionistic and, thus, does not recall for me Fellini, though one finds traces from the history of cinema, especially European Modernism. I see and hear some overtones from Antonioni. At university, I took my major in religion, even though I am wildly agnostic; Mr. Malick the director, I think, took his in philosophy. The film makes great use of ellipsis and ambiguity; this is not a movie for fundamentalists or those who seek clear and distinct ideas. Like "2001". the film narrative and iconography are highly tensive open to polyvalent interpretations and experiences.A large number of people took part in making this film; it deserves detailed analysis and praise?too much for a précis and subjective one such as this.As I note from time to time, I do not rank films but seek to enjoy each one on its own terms. If you bring to this work desires for a film outside the vision of this work, you might entirely miss apprehending this great work. This film does recall Mr. Malick's graceful "Days of Heaven" but it is not a remake of that work or any of his other films.</fullReview>

I wished I had taken LSD beforehand so I might have been able to appreciate it...I was totally ticked that I had missed Judge Judy for this film. If you think you're going to see a gut wrencher or a sob into your hankie type film, you might appreciate it. I found myself diggin my nails into my thighs to keep from letting expletives fly about having wasted hard earned money for this miserable piece of junk. Not every movie that Brad Pitt is in is a blockbuster, it was just not for me. When I see a movie, I want to get into it. This did not do it for me...but then, most movies made since 2000 are pretty well garbage. Enjoy this movie! Not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the worst movie i've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kid dies and it's not even shown how. That's all.The movie is a bad attempt to copy 2001: a space odyssey. Like the odyssey you hate it or you love it. I hated it but this is even worse because it's just a bad copy. In the space odyssey at least some things DO happen. Tree of life has nothing happening.The first dialog happens at minute 53 and again only a couple of times. EVERYTHING else is a slideshow of images with someone whispering. Very annoying.When i saw the cast i knew what to expect but come on, this is just ridiculous. Sean Penn (from horrible movies like Mystic river and 21 grams) shows his sad face a couple of times (he's crying or being sad or in the rain in all of his movies WTF), Brad Pitt lately (my old worst movie ever - Assassination of Jesse James) does movies just to get people to watch (delivers zero performance). The movie ends like it started and it says nothing. This is a movie as much as petrol is a healthy drink.True genius doesn't need an army of fans to explain why the movie is good. If it's good you get it and don't need explaining. If it sucks, and this one really, really does suck beyond any comprehension, you can't make it good by explaining. It's awful and make piece with that fact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst waste of time and talent EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to come up with the words to describe how much I hated this film. To the extent that the purpose can be found anywhere, Brad Pitt was completely believable as a bitter, frustrated, overly-stern father. Sean Penn had no reason to even be there -- any guy off the street could have done everything Sean was given to do in this "film" (using the term loosely). The beginning-of-life-on-Earth scenes, although visually beautiful, went on ... and on ... and on forever, with no purpose I could find anywhere. In fact, I could find no purpose for making this "film" at all, except to massage somebody's self-inflated ego. 2001:Space Odyssey??? I think not. Not even close. Not even in the same universe, never mind ball park. The producers of this boring piece of nonsense should be ashamed of themselves, and whoever gave it an 8 out of 10 is either trying to pretend he/she got something out of it (and is therefore of a superior intellect) or on some kind of drug that hasn't been used by anyone else since 1969. I dislike making such statements, but in this case I have to: This is the worst movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me tell you something, I should have read reviews first and prepared myself. I am going to prepare you because it is important that you know this. This movie has about 40 minutes of should-be deleted scenes. I don't know what the purpose was for half of this movie. The part of the movie that actually does have acting in it, it's good as far as the production quality, camera handling, and acting skills. But the plot (smh) weak, and pointless. I only watched the whole thing because I have a lot of patience with movies. For example, neither of the Space Odyssey bored me, even through the long scenes of focusing on the black monolith with songs of screaming people. Anyway, 'Tree of Life' bored the heck out of me. Make sure you are in thee mood for a movie that tests your attention, and you must be wide awake for this one, because you will be just starring almost half the dang'on movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying, that I like movies that are different, like movies that are not typical Hollywood mainstream movies. But a movie needs a story to tell, needs to have something on the hearth (even if that is as simple as entertainment).This movie was nothing than a series of images, with no story at all. Yes, I do understand what it tries to tell, I do understand the artistic level it try to reach, but it did not get to me at all. I felt like a 70's hippie on a LSD trip, flying around in beautiful images, but not going anywhere. It was different, but it seems to me that the main reason for this movie is as simple as being different.In the end I feel tricked. The names on the poster promise me good actors, hereby good acting. I guess it did the trick, the poster did drag me, I did waste my time and money see this movie. The only reason I give it 1 star, is because the system does not allow me to go lower.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A celebration of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A celebration of life trough visual expression, analogies between human thinking and the events during the origin of life in the universe, a mixing of human memories and those of the earth, sensations in every moment of evolution. The situations and the events seem to be related with the "book of Job" and "The Book of Genesis" in the Bible. Monologues with a conversation between God and human consciousness. There are Beautiful images representing the creation of biological systems and the expression of divine will trough acts of love. Humanity finds a meaning following a path guided by its own nature trying to be in a state of grace with God, emphasizing that humans needs to accept the will of God, even when it displeases the earthly desires and suffering is implied in it. The film presents the nature of human hearth that leads us to believe that we have enough intelligence to understand the mind of God, but at the end we realize that we will never reach the complete knowledge. It is very powerful at the end of the film the suggestion that we may only need to learn how to appreciate the beauty, instead of trying to find an explanation to all things in the universe, because we have a limited capacity to do so, for me the most important message of the film is: "The only way to be happy is to love, unless you love, your life will flash by", there is also a begging to God in the end: "Keep us, guide us, until the end of time". Good film in order to reflect</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious, boring, annoying...but it looks nice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tomorrow is the 84th annual Academy Awards, and of all the films on the best picture list, the one people seem to be complaining about is Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, for getting mixed reviews. Yet no one is complaining about The Tree of Life, which also split audiences straight down the middle. You either Love or hate this movie, and I'm on the hate side.Now I will give the movie credit, there were two things that were very well done in this movie. The first is of course the cinematography, this is a beautiful film, if nothing else, this movie might be worth viewing at least once if, like me, you want to become a director and want to see how great a film can look. The other thing the film did well was the relationship between father and son, maybe that's not how all fathers act, but that is a perfect representation of a father-son relationship. They love each other, but they also tick each other off.Now for the stuff I didn't like. This movie had no story. Well OK, it did have a story, but not enough to film a film that's almost 2.5 hours long. Most of the movie is just pretty images that have no context to the plot, including a twenty minute scene involving the creation of the universe. And did it look nice, yes it did, but that didn't stop it from being really boring. The dialog is pretentious, no one talks like a real person in this movie, they have to over complicate every single sentence just to make themselves sound smart, when in fact they aren't saying anything. It tries to say stuff about so many things: Family, God, the Universe, death, life, where do we belong, yet in the end it doesn't answer any of these questions. This is the 2001 of our generation, but at least with 2001 the pretty images had context, instead of just randomly cutting to dinosaurs for twenty minutes for no reason.Like I said, this is a love or hate film, if you love the film, good for you, but I found the movie to be pretentious and boring. Like I said, it may be worth seeing at least once for the cinematography, but if you have ADD, you will not make it through this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic symbolism and matching visuals!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Malick's The Tree of life is a stunning look into the mind of a man named Jack O'Brien (played by Sean Penn) with a tortured childhood due to an over-bearing and slightly misogynistic father (played by Brad Pitt) and the death of his younger brother R.L. Malick doesn't disappoint with intricate symbolism consisting of a montage taking audience through "creation" sequences including birth of cosmos to compassionate dinosaurs and all the way to sea creatures with limbs climbing onto land. The camera work is absolutely phenomenal, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki uses a plethora of odd angles and motions creating an almost transcendental feel throughout the film. Although the plot can be a little tricky to maneuver the first time around, it is brimmed with implicit meaning that might take a second or third viewing, however the film is more than worth the time for those looking to uncover some of life's most existential themes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I rented this movie is because I am a huge Brad Pitt fan and I like Sean Penn too. While the former has delivered a good performance the latter is just wasted. After watching about 10-15 mins of the film you can safely skip the next 30 mins or so. I really don't see the connection of evolution of life with the tree of life. The middle part will keep you engaged, in the hope of finding the purpose of the entire film. There are some endearing scenes between the brothers. The cinematography is awesome. But that's it. That is the only excuse to watch the movie. All in all, an extremely boring and purposeless affair. Watch legends of fall instead, one of brad Pitt's best..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Brief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will be very brief and will point on very obvious mistakes that a really good director would not do: 1. Choice of actors:The plot itself assumes not shine actors, as the shiny ones would obviously attract viewers attention from the plot to the actors themselves. The plot did not assume actors to be on their hight, so more human choice rather then Hollywood Apollos (though I really find both Pitt and Penn great actors) would have been more appropriate. 2. Plot itself:The plot is terrible, annoyingly long, no structure at all, it lacks keeping viewers concentrated. Sometimes I was having a feeling that I am watching National Geographic, rather then a "masterpiece". It was about the beauty of the nature, harmony of the humanity but this heavy emphases on Christianity proves the Director's ability to think out of box. I am Christian myself, but when the task is to create something for the humanity, other then south US Christian audience you must break the box and look outside of it. For me the plot was something like an intellectual Big Mac. 3. Music:The soundtrack to the movie by Alexandre Desplat was great, but again the movie the plot did not deserve this music. 4. OperatorAt some points I had a feeling that the operator was shaping his skills by watching youtube. Absolutely nothing special or unique, mostly just copy and pasts. 5. CannesI am not worried if this movie will win every possible and impossible Oscars, but Palme d'Or? This movie absolutely did not deserve to this nomination.Conclusion: Do watch, but do not expect any "masterpiece" think it is more like a National geographic program.</fullReview>

To me it was just a "Tree of.." BORING.It started to make me think of a Stanley Kubrick film at first like "2001 Space Odyssey". But like Clint Eastwood says as a director: "story, story, story...". Impressionistic scenes with out some kind of solid story is pointless. Space Odyssey was hard for me to follow when I saw it as a kid but at least it does have enough story where you can know what was going on. It was just brilliant, this one is fail.Maybe it's fine for the stuffy whine sipping, cheese sampling crowd that are able to see the "Art" that others can not. I'd rather watch something that had some kind of story, some definite meaning, action, something to it..Skip this one, see something else or be bored to death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ad for after life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took over an hour into the film to actually hear a dialog. Until then only mindless monologues and some beautiful imagery and that is what this film has in common with documentaries like 'Home' or 'Planet Earth'. But those were about our planet this is a drama about a family. What does a cave, a volcano or dinosaurs have to do with an American family in the 1950's? The answer: nothing. For those who may say "you didn't get it" I'm sorry but I did get it. It is just an incredibly lame message with absolutely illogical and stupid connections. At first I thought this film was meant to be a prayer and I wasn't half wrong. But what this film is, more than a prayer, it's a Christian cinema commercial for the after life. Well, thank you very much, but if I want to see publicity I'll watch the half time of the American super bowl. I don't expect nor want to see an ad turned into a film. The only reason I did not give this film a 1 rating is because the acting was good even though, for an over 2 hour film, there was very little acting for the actors to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creative, imaginative and highly original piece of filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack (Sean Penn as an adult and Hunter McCracken as a young Jack) feels lost in the midst of the modern world and asks himself about the meaning of religion in one's life. He recalls his complicated childhood and relationship with his father (Brad Pitt) who attempts to rear Jack, who grapples with his defiant personality, and his brothers in a strict manner so as to prepare them for the life full of cruelty as well as ruthlessness. Notwithstanding, his attitude arouses conflicts in his family? Terrence Malick has created a truly impressive and emotionally-tinged art-house which consists of multiple images which are invariably difficult to comprehend. Apart from being an immensely ambitious flick, The Tree Of Life is quite a demanding viewing which is filled with an interesting drama about the problematic childhood of Jack as well as a genuinely one-of-a-kind contemplation on the religion and mutual relationship between God and a human being. It is so remarkable inasmuch Malick endeavours to the whole concept through a prism of his imagination, a sequence of bewildering, alien imagery. On account of visual effects, special photographic effects by Dan Glass and Douglas Trumbull, who experimented with chemicals, paints, smoke and liquids, The Tree of Life is ravishingly opulent, even though it does not always contain a precisely lucid afterthought or a specific message. Particularly the 30-minute-long and plot less overture which aside from a short introduction regarding the protagonist is entirely constructed from a collection of picturesque shots of microscopic and macroscopic dimension which is able to enrage many a viewer. By this atypical touch, Malick intends to expose airiness of human existence which is compared to disparate forms of life and phenomena transpiring in the universe. Likewise, owing to this disorientating structure and bizarre framing, Malick points out that numerous questions concerning the world are still unresolved and many issues remain obscure and incomprehensible for us.Malick's execution might arouse a suspicion whether he only wants to overwhelm with a great deal of experimental elements or all this has a purpose, but frankly speaking the direction by Malick seems to be pretty self-assured and strong, even if sometimes slightly self-indulgent. Subjectivity of the picture is typical of Malick and the utilize of green, blue and white provide the substance with a vital feeling.The chapter depicting early stages of the character played by Sean Penn are masterfully crafted and the mauled consistence truly reminds of the earliest memories of a human ? random moments, unrelated to each other which nonetheless are forged on Jack's mind. Later, the tale gets more consistent as well as sinister, articulate and intense the instant all drawbacks of Jack's father become visible to the naked eye. He unfairly treats his sons in an excessively harsh way, desiring to render them somebody else than him ? a man who hasn't achieved anything. On account of his high aspirations, he is oblivious of the beauty surrounding him and he hurts his children and his wife. This is arguably the best performance by Brad Pitt who proves once again that he isn't a worthless actor, quite on the contrary. Malick's direction and Pitt's remarkably emotional approach entails creating a wonderful, moving climax. The other members of cast give equally terrific performances, such as Jessica Chastain, but likewise all young actors participating. The classical music exploited in the flick (e.g. Brahms and Bach), which delivers a transcendent atmosphere, is a very appropriate and tasteful condiment, conjuring up a virtually fairy-tale-like relish.Cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is absolutely excellent. The utilize of hand-held, low-angled camera give it a voyeuristic feeling and we effortlessly begin to identify with the protagonist and accompany him through his problematic childhood, not to mention all other shots of the Earth and the universe which look inventive and exquisite.The Tree of Life does have a true power of cinema ? however, its omnipresent ambiguity filling the entire ensemble is a little unsatisfying and its afterthought is rather typical and slightly preachy ? love is good, life without love is worthless and meaningless, et cetera, thus it explores this old subject which was tackled many times before and probably became already exhausted by dozens of other directors. It isn't something shameful ? The Tree of Life is a stunning piece of filmmaking which introduces nothing especially inventive to the cinema (except for being technically refreshing). It is sufficiently delightful from an aesthetical point of view ? the visuals and the sound are gorgeous, but on the whole the flick is not that compelling from an intellectual perspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was going to be a nice, quiet drama about a family in Texas. It's not, and as a native Texas I am at best offended by that fact. It's basically Discovery channel footage cut between scenes of Brad Pitt, Sean Penn, and Jessica Chastain acting depressed. There are maybe a dozen sentences in the entire movie that actual humans would say, the rest of the "dialogue" sounds like something that would only come out of the mouth of a heavily sedated 19th century philosopher. The man who wrote and directed this is no Spielberg or Scorsese and he sure as hell is no Kubrick. He clearly does not understand REAL human emotion and he thinks that throwing pretty colors at everything will somehow improve the plot. In summary, if you're a pretentious 20 something film student reading this on your Macbook you'll probably love it, however if you live in the real world you would probably be better off watching an actual movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a handful of truly great directors- Kubrick, Tarkovskiy, and now Terence Malick- who forget about narrative and the audience's need for answers, and make movies that are simply the most amazing visual and emotional meditations on a theme. Let's be honest, on first viewing, The Tree of Life doesn't make any sense, but Kubrick's 2001, a Space Odyssey didn't make any sense, either, along with Tarkovskiy's Solaris. I predict that in a few years the Tree of Life will make it onto everyone's top 100 movies of all time, maybe even top ten... there has to be a place in our hearts I think for directors who make movies about the wonder of cinema, and in Malick's case, the wonder of childhood, and life, and love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To appreciate this, you have to let go of normal movie standards.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one is different from the rest. I mean that in every way possible. Even for Malick, it's different. It's impressionistic, abstract, and fantastic. People have been comparing it to 2001: A Space Odyssey, which is understandable, but misleading. Don't judge the movie until it's finished. Don't anticipate things about the storyline because the story is very roundabout. Just have faith that all will be presented to you by the time it's finished. There is no regular dialogue in this movie. It's best to be rather unprepared on a certain level when you watch this movie. It'll take you by surprise completely with beautiful images and style that really separates itself from every other movie ever made. It's ambitious and "artsy." Watch it and don't expect a normal great movie, one that relies on performances and screen writing. Just watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I surely do wish I had read the reviews before I wasted 5 bucks on PPV of this stinker. I see what the film is trying to say but it works way too hard trying to be art and fails miserably at entertainment. This is not a movie for the masses, but for a select few who can understand why it was made the way it was. I felt it was a waste of time. The tragedy the family endures gets lost with all the artsy sequences. I was totally bored after the earth sequence, and when the minuscule plot finally started to surface, I no longer cared. It is too bad, because as a plot, the story could have been told in a much less pretentious way and been an outstanding film. As it is, it just comes across mostly as nonsense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst movies I have ever had to suffer through. The camera work/editing made me so dizzy and sick to my stomach I had to leave the theater. However, this was not a problem, since I was following a long line of people who were disgusted and leaving the theater as well. The camera work was jerky and seldom held a scene long enough for you to enjoy to cinematography. In addition, the story line was so esoteric as to be incomprehensible. I cannot say that I enjoyed any of the acting since the camera never stayed with an actor long enough for you to get an emotional connection. Awful is a nice way of saying how bad this film was to the average viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie and all I can say is WTF! This movie is almost two and a half hours of hogwash. A best movie nomination? Give me a break. Grace and nature as the themes. Well, I don't think so. The poppy fields at the end are really a clue. This movie is on drugs, or I guess you would have to be to make any sense out of it. Don't waste your time or your money. I don't mind a movie that makes you think, but all this movie did was made me think of drugs, just so I could get through it. This director tried to be artistic and avant-garde, and yes, there is some nice imagery in the film and cinematography, but that alone cannot carry the weight of a movie and this movie misses its mark by a long shot. It's supposed to be teaching a lesson about life, faith and spirituality I suppose, but is far too fragmented to reach that goal. There were never any kind of conclusions or resolutions, and even stars like Brad Pitt and Sean Penn could not rescue this film from its abysmal failings to bring about its points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tree Of Life. I just finished watching this film 15 minutes ago and I am blogging about it while it is still fresh in my head. First I would like to say that this film is a masterpiece. It was one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen in my life. absolutely gorgeous.Normally I would go into a synopsis about the film and tell you all what it is about. But I am not going to. I feel that this film is about something else to everyone. To me it was about relationships. Especially that between father and son. I think I can say that Tree Of Life has meant more to me than any other movie I have ever seen. I related to the story in many ways. Even though I never went through all the things the characters did, especially that of Jack, I have had a touch of what he experienced growing up. Though I did not shed tears during this movie, my heart ached for what Jack and his family experienced. With future viewing I am almost positive that tears may fall. I can't express in words how I feel about this film. I just urge everyone to see this film, especially men and fathers. This movie can teach us some of the most important things about family and life.Enough of all that gushy stuff. The films story was told through expression, editing, music, cinematics and acting. The dialogue was kept at a minimal while throughout the movie a narration told through whispers of the characters innermost feelings was laid out for the audience. Tree Of Life is my favorite film that I have seen from 2011. I have not seen all of them of course. But this film will resonate with me for years to come. A must see! 10/10!</fullReview>

I have just wasted my money on this pretentious nonsense which essentially contains no plot. You cannot relate to the characters because they aren't real - they are like lightly pencilled sketches of stereotypical characters. It's really dull and confusing. Did I mention how completely boring it is?! I can't believe I used up some of my precious life watching this dreadful excuse for a movie. And all because of those blinkin' Oscar nominations.

		<fullReview>I don't know whether I'm going to be spoiling this or not, because I don't know what I'd be spoiling. So...be warned, I'm going to talk about this movie.The description of this movie "the story centers around a family with three boys in the 1950s. The eldest son witnesses the loss of innocence." Sean Penn, I assume, is the eldest son, and the loss of innocence is the death of his brother. This seems like a coherent plot...when you first hear it. But then you sit down to watch the movie. The movie stars Brad Pitt and Sean Penn, and I want to know how much money these famous actors were paid to make this.....I don't even know what to call it.Is this movie good, is this movie bad? I don't even know. What I do know is I couldn't even sit through the whole movie. It was not boring, it was not dramatic, it was not action, it was not romance, it was none of those things. It was a category of its own, along with some eye candy stretched throughout to keep your attention.It starts off....somewhat normal, and your thinking its going to improve. But it doesn't. The story in this movie isn't coherent, it's very unorganized, and there's dialogue that's next to none. I was able to follow what was going on, but the story did not have to be portrayed in this movie as ridiculously as it was.It starts off with Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) being informed that one of her sons has died. It cuts back and forth between this reality, and Sean Penn's reality, after he finds out about the death of his brother. Here's where I want to interject something, isn't Sean Penn too OLD to be offspring of Brad Pitt? Just putting that out there, anyways...it seems that he is affected by this, and what follows this event is the most random collage of random images and random thoughts ever.About twenty minutes into this movie, there is about thirteen to fifteen minutes of the most RANDOM and UNNECESSARY collection of images. The only good thing about them is how well they are portrayed by the visual effects team. If you pay attention, then it's understandable what you are seeing...you are seeing evolution of the planets and everything from a scientist's standpoint. The shots linger and it is the most bizarre thing I've seen. Literally, fifteen minutes of just random space shots and some shots of dinosaurs. Then...we come back to reality, which is now twenty-ish years before the son died. It was actually when the three sons were born, and that's what happens next is them growing up.This is the point where I stopped the movie, because I just couldn't continue to watch it. It was so bizarre, and just unorganized to a point that I just couldn't watch the movie. I would've given this movie 1 star, but I went with four because I couldn't even decide if the movie was good or bad. The movie was great and thought-provoking, and I enjoyed it, but for some reason I could not finish it. I'm not rating this movie, for the movie is masterful in it's thought provoking way. I've never seen a movie like it, but I couldn't finish it for some reason.</fullReview>

Most of the movie looks gorgeous but as a hole it felt like it was one big uneventful film with a massive amount of incoherent footage. Not to mention the fact that the story line of is unoriginal. Although the story is put together in a relatively innovative way, using flash backs, flash forwards and strange irrelevant scenes such as dinosaurs, well let's just say it only makes the movie worst. This film is just not well put together.Anyhow, I highly recommend watching anything other than this movie. It will most likely prove to be one big waste of your time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided to watch this movie after hearing a lot of positive reviews, but without knowing who actually directed it. Then, about 15 minutes into the movie I've recognized all the Terrence Malick "trademarks": incredibly slow pace, lack of a coherent storyline, HUGE gaps where absolutely nothing happens and you just see random "artistic" images with someone whispering some "meaningful" phrase in the background. I was thinking "oooh no, not this again!" since I really find his directing to be THE most boring and pretentious ever. I forced myself to watch it till the end and I must admit that the whole idea of putting a human's death in the perspective of the creation of the Universe is quite thought-provoking but I just can't stand Terrence Malick's directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lifeless Tree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, for those who do not know what The Tree of Life is all about, allow me to (roundabout) quote the prophet, Elvira, el Mistress de Darko: "Yeah, I'll tell you what it's about?it's about two hours too long!"Actually, I'm not going to be pompous and pretend I know the meaning of this movie. Nor am I going to ask anyone to explain it. It wouldn't make a difference. Even if someone granted me the grand ole secret of the movie that meshes a fast-forwarded version of the creation of time with a dysfunctional family and its future grown up son, I would certainly NOT waste another almost 2? hours of my precious time on this boring piece of work to rewatch it.No one can argue that this film wasn't beautifully shot, nor could they dispute the score was anything less than gorgeous. But that's it. Really, there's nothing more that I haven't already explained: We see a somewhat version of the Earth forming and then miraculously there's jellyfish, and before you know it, there's plants, dinosaurs and the infamous asteroid coming to take 'em all to oblivion.All the while, excitedly!, we have 1950's (I'm assuming it's the mid-20th Century) home life filled with endless, countless scenes of close-ups of young boys. That's not my bag, but if it's yours?get help. Oh, and there's Sean Penn ? again, I only have assumptions here ? as one of the boys grown up?You see, in the 139 minutes, you'll have about six lines of dialogue. SIX. Oh, and a bunch of whispering. Mostly the word: "Brother." So, we don't have much to go on for story.Okay, the six lines was a bit of an exaggeration, but don't hope for a complete story here through spoken word. And because of all this built up, wordless tension throughout the entire endurance of the running time, it's makes for one of those movie-experiences that you honestly expect tragedy to strike, someone to get dismembered or worse every three-to-four minutes, and that's taxing for more than two hours of sitting. Waiting. Endlessly praying for someone to actually die so something would happen.Look. Listen. I'm sure this is one of those movies that you'll either hate or love. Either appreciate or fall asleep to. Or either leave confused or understand the meaning of the tree's life. I've already admitted I didn't comprehend the message here. But, I also said it wouldn't matter. I'm not getting my 2 hours 19 minutes back, so, even if I was told, it's not a wash?it's a waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On Malick's "Tree of Life"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last Wednesday, I watched Terrence Malick's fifth feature (in a career that began almost four decades ago), "The Tree of Life", for the second time. I saw it for the first time on opening night at a local theater this past summer, where I brought two friends (who brought two friends of theirs) with me, and we were all fascinated by it. There were definitely not more than twenty people attending the screening, and I saw at least three people walk out during the first half hour of its 139-minute runtime."Tree of Life" is, without a doubt, the most polarizing film of 2011. Visually and existentially speaking, it's a "literal" film. Its non-linear, absolutely unique and personal narrative (experimental and visually stunning, Malick's trademarks), however, left many viewers baffled. A movie theater owner in Connecticut even wrote an open "no refund policy" letter to warn patrons that this is an art film, and they would gain a lot from seeing it - but shouldn't get their money back if they decided not to watch it until the end. Winner of the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival, I can't stop relating "The Tree of Life" to Lars von Trier's haunting, mesmerizing, and absolutely gorgeous meditation on depression and the end of the world, "Melancholia", which I also saw for the second time this past weekend and competed with Malick's film at Cannes. Although both films are different at the core topic, they are both existential, visually hypnotic pieces; somewhat experimental, and with extraordinary use of classical music. They're the two most unique cinematic experiences I've had all year so far; and I would argue, two masterworks for the ages.Although I agree that only time can tell what films are the real classics, it is hard to deny the power of a film like "The Tree of Life", and its impact on the audience and critics. Made with an estimated $32 million budget, it made only $13 million at the American box-office. It is not a financial success by any means, yet people cannot stop talking about it. Now available on DVD, word keeps spreading out of what an astonishing film/what a massive piece of crap "The Tree of Life" is. There's no middle ground. People love it or hate it. But they're never indifferent to it (except those who walked out after twenty minutes, but I don't think they have the right to say anything about a film they didn't see; although it's arguable that this is not a sign of indifference but rather ignorance).Malick is an auteur, a truly fascinating artist (like Von Trier, Kubrick, Bergman, Welles, Murnau, Altman, Fellini, Godard, and a few others) unafraid of taking risks, provoking and instigating us as an audience, and elevating the film experience to another level. "The Tree of Life" begins with a passage from the Book of Job: "Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation... while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" In the Bible, Job is a man tested by God after Satan wagers Job only serves God because of His protection. When Job loses everything - family, wealth, health - he will rather curse himself than God. That was also a concept explored in the Coen Brothers' searing "A Serious Man" (2009). But "The Tree of Life" is not a black comedy, but rather a poetic testament, like Malick's films tend to be.The main character, Jack O'Brien (played as a child by Hunter McCracken, and by Sean Penn as an adult), whose initials are, not by chance, J-O-B, is unhappy in spite of what it seems to be a very (financially) successful life. His childhood memories (growing up in 1950's Texas) are what we see for most of the film - paralleled with images of the foundation of the earth itself, from the black void to the damned dinosaurs. It's not hard to realize Jack is Malick's alter ego. Like Malick, Jack has two younger brothers, and one of them died at a fairly young age. Such loss was obviously devastating to the patriarch, a domineering Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt), and a loving Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain), a woman who used to believe in taking "the way of grace" through life - in other words, to never ignore traces of divine glory in the world. Except sometimes the way of nature brings such obstacles and tragedies our way that the scars won't easily heal - you want to die with the loved ones you've lost. Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien are the pillars of Jack's foundation; his brother's death and his father's severity, the crosses of a lifetime. "The Tree of Life" provides more questions than answers. It is, after all, a meditation (and not an analysis) on the human condition. And there lies its richness. Groundbreaking as few films these days are, it's no wonder it's been compared to Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" (Malick even hired Douglas Trumbull of '2001' to design the film's visual effects - Life was Trumbull's first film since 1982's "Blade Runner"). Time will tell how this Tree will stand, but it has, right from its birth, some deep roots in film history.</fullReview>

But it just crawled through over 2 hours by showing us lovely pictures of space and the ocean, along with some multi-interpretable quotes from the bible that some hippies must have obviously related to. I watched it to the end because I was convinced it had to get better at some point, but it just ended, I was filled with a mixture of relief that it was over and anger that they had wasted a 139 minutes of my life.

		<shortDescription>Not a great movie, but it's ambitious, vibrant, and memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the Tree of Life reminded me of my first time watching 2001: A Space Odyssey. This avant guard picture is a collaboration of ideas worked into an ambitious yet reasonably effective means of non-linear storytelling. Sometimes it's frustrating, and thematically speaking it's not nearly as original as it thinks it is, but the spectacle and execution of it makes The Tree of Life a memorable motion picture.The film is mostly about the growing years of a blue collar Texas family in a rural neighbourhood, highlighting all the little moments in life that make it so valuable. The first act was a little rushed I think, and could've been given a bit more love. It's a little risky I think to start off a movie in the slightly disoriented fashion that this one does. you may win the audience or you may lose them completely when one minute we have our feet on Earth, and the next, we are out in deep space soaring nebulae and the gas giants. The film's greatest strength is imagery. This is easily the most gorgeous film of the year, it's vibrant, and well composed. Brad Pitt definitely brings his a game to the picture, giving an honesty and wisdom to the role, like nothing he's ever done before; An award worthy performance. Sean Penn meanwhile is a little confusing, not so much because of performance quality, but rather he is surprisingly underused. Looking back on the film, one has too wonder how much material was left on the cutting room floor. What would've made the Tree of Life a great movie (for me) would have been a little less rough cutting and montage and a little more time spent with the people. As it stands however, it is an accomplishment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title The Tree of Life suggests a deep reflexion about the most unclear questions of Life. It is mostly set in the middle of the last century, within a 5-membered family. It focuses on the oldest son, Jack (Hunter McCracken and Sean Penn), now remembering his past, centred on his puberty and his first opening to life, seeking answers about to life, existence and our being. In fact, this movie has much more of a reflection than a story being told. Remembering his teenhood, he finds answers in what his mother (Jessica Chastain) thought the paths life could take, in the way his father (Brad Pitt) raised him, in the death of one of his brothers, etc. The Tree of Life is obviously not a concept created by Mallick to this movie, as it comes from very far, like Egypt. Always in time has the Tree of Life been used to unite life and death, life and nature, life and God, nature and grace. All of them are approached in this film one way or another. The best feature clearly doesn't lie in the movie itself, that even gets very annoying and slow in some parts, but on some ideas. It's my first Terrence Malick 's, but it's easy to notice that is a clear attempt to come back after failed ones since The Thin Red Line. It's good, it's an 8/10 and I'll leave you with it's best thought.The nuns taught us there were two ways through life - the way of nature and the way of grace. You have to choose which one you'll follow. Grace doesn't try to please itself. Accepts being slighted, forgotten, disliked. Accepts insults and injuries. Nature only wants to please itself. Get others to please it too. Likes to lord it over them. To have its own way. It finds reasons to be unhappy when all the world is shining around it. And love is smiling through all things.</fullReview>

They hijacked David Attenborough's film crew... interwoven with less than gripping drama about a boy's upbringing and a couple of shots of Sean Penn for validity. The music for the most part is over bearing and seemingly present because of the lack of power that the movie itself generates. I can only cringe to guess what the budget was and how much better it could have been spent. I heard that Heath Ledger was the first choice for this film and if you wanna look for positives in a sad situation then it must be said that him dying before being linked to this film is one. The only thing good I can say is that the acting is bearable which is maybe a forgone conclusion considering the on screen talent but the young boys were pretty good and that's it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beautiful and touching middle is clouded, my view, by the long and pretentious beginning and end; not another Days of Heaven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack O'Brien (Sean Penn) is the eldest of three brothers who grew up in Waco, Texas. At the start of the film, his mother, Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) has just received a telegram that the middle brother has died at 19. She, in a daze, telephones Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt) who is an air traffic controller and he is consumed with grief, too. As they ponder the meaning of life, through a visual feast of creational images, from volcanoes to ocean life to other planets, they all try to come to terms with their family member's death. Suddenly, in his high rise office, Jack goes back to his childhood in Texas. One sees the birth of Jack and his mother's elation. Soon she is blowing bubbles with her young son and welcomes a second child, also a boy, and a third. From the lovely, idyllic beginning of their lives, however, the scene grows harsher. Their father is a strict disciplinarian, who makes Jack close the door "softly" fifty times when he accidentally slams it. He encourages the boys to learn how to fight and delivers sermons at the dinner table so often that no one enjoys the food. It is also clear that Mr. O'Brien verbally abuses his wife, whose philosophy of life is more of love and forgiveness than getting ahead. Gradually, Jack feels himself "changing". He disobeys more often and commits small acts of vandalism and theft. Finally, he understands that he is more like his father where his handsome, blonde brother who died bears an uncanny resemblance to his mother. All too soon, the family is changed forever when their father's job loss results in a move from Waco. Gone is the innocence of that life, forever. First, let me state that Mallick's Days of Heaven would make my list of "top five" films every time. It is beautiful in every way possible and mighty in depth. This one attempts such a meaning but misses the mark. Yes, the middle is lovely and touching, with some thought-generating concepts. Also, Pitt, Chastain, and the three young boys do a superb job of acting. Penn, unfortunately, is wasted in a role with almost no lines. Add on tremendous cinematography, costumes, and settings and you would think it adds up to greatness. But, an overly long and pretentious kaleidoscope of images, at the start and at the finish, mar the overall impact of the film. Mallick should be commended for his ambitions, however, even though they don't reach their summit. While this reviewer can't recommend it for everyone, all fans of serious cinema will want to give it a whirl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most awful movie I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely OUTRAGEOUS. A dismal, dismal film, perhaps the WORST ever I've watched in my life. Hey? What are the images from the Hubble space telescope doing here? What's the Horse-head nebula, the Cat's eye nebula, the Pillars of Creation nebula doing HERE?Hey Mallick, that's not even your art, not even your visual imagination. Its something real scientists worked on, sent up telescopes into space to photograph with great difficulty and cost. HOW DARE do you use those images to 'beautify' your ridiculous excuse of a movie, and use them as a make-up to increase your movie's rating? What did YOU do on your own? What the hell do those images even have to do with movie? Absolutely shameful. And ROTTEN rotten tomato critics. How DARE you praise this film based on its visuals? What meat is there in this film anyways? Anyone could just take images from the Hubble and make a movie about it, would be just as beautiful? Don't you guys ever watch Discovery? The History Channel? Have you no idea what you're looking at?Anyone, Anyone here who DARES to call this film 'visually impressive' has to attend a science class, or watch a science documentary IMMEDIATELY! This film is almost like stolen work. I can name EVERY single visual scene in this movie and tell you where it came from.1) Some interstellar clouds, a shape that looks like a horse -&gt; Straight from the Hubble telescope gallery, image of the "Horse Head Nebula." 2) Some interstellar clouds, something looks like an eye -&gt; Straight from the Hubble telescope gallery, image of the "Cat's Eye Nebula." 3) Some interstellar clouds, something looks like pillars -&gt; Straight from the Hubble telescope gallery, image of the "The Pillars of Creation, in the Eagle Nebula" 4) Images of the surface of a sun/star. -&gt; Straight from images from the SOHO Observatory gallery, images of the surface of the sun. 5) Images of jelly fish -&gt; BBC Planet Earth, Deep Wonders. 6) Images of hammerhead shark -&gt; BBC Planet Earth, Shallow Seas. 7) Images of microbes, microscopic life -&gt; BBC Life / BBC Inside the Human Body. 8) Images of the sunrise over earth -&gt; Images from the International Space Station as it orbits the earth.What else is there? NOTHING. Absolutely nothing else in this film. Some weird kids. Some rolling in the grass, ABSOLUTELY NO DIALOG. How dare you use images that deserve credit on their OWN merit, and came from others, in your film in order to garner credit for YOURSELF!? Unless there was some connection to it in the film? Or a need for it?Its not fair! Anyone can just put in some bits of imagery from space, some bit of imagery from the BBC's Planet Earth, some bit of imagery from a microscopic biology textbook, some weirdo kids and call it a movie.Absolutely pathetic, disgraceful, shameful!PS*/FYI* Hey, Mallick, do you even know how those Nebula images are photographed? Hey? Do you even know which electromagnetic spectrum they're in? Do you even know what individual filters they used before they could color those nebula images? Bet you don't.THANK GOD THIS MOVIE MADE A LOSS AT THE BOX OFFICE. THANK GOD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Waste of an evening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was incredibly slow and boring. It did not make any sense at all - you kept waiting for the plot to come together and make sense, for something to be 'revealed', but nothing ever did. There was also a strange religious element to the film - one minute they were quoting obscure bible passages and questioning God's relationship to the what was happening in the film, the next there was a half hour long visual representation of evolution - which did not seem to have much relationship to the narrative at all. It was if the director was determined to include as much 'symbolic imagery' as possible without there actually being any meaning behind it. It just seemed like a pretentious, meaningless waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible. I fell asleep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can people give 10 stars or even 5 to this film? I love non-conventional movies, but I fell asleep with this one. So slow, boring, pointless. I'm sorry, maybe I'm not a cinema aesthete, but this is really bad. I'm glad I didn't go to the cinema to watch it but decided to rent it and watch it at home. The dialogs are so slow and, most of the time, incomprehensible. The story is hard to follow and after the Big Bang, dinosaurs and whatever the director decided to put in it, I just couldn't wait to see what was happening in the family. The only positive things are Jessica Chastain's performance and the kids acting. That's it though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Terrence Malick's once-defending admirer, this film is an ignoble "avant garde" failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are times when the most talented filmmakers specializing in avant garde fall short, or, in rare case for the ardent admirer, fail so spectacularly that it leaves the admirer confounded and flabbergasted.Consider me one of the admirers who felt so disappointed with Malick's final cut product that, after a few months pass since the anticipated DVD rental, upon seeing the title in a Redbox, it brought back a negative memory of viewing the film to the end, that is so pretentious, frustratingly mysterious and all over the map it is almost unendurable.Malick do not deserve the Oscar nomination for Best Director for what amounts to filming in the flimflam style. How the Academy Awards thought it merits a Best Picture nomination is a mystery, other than to serve as the filler for the absurd 10 'best picture' nomination list. (I would not be surprised if it is revealed The Tree of Life has garnered the least votes from the academy members out of all nominations.)All I recollect from the film is that it is comprised of three things: random and overly long nature shots, bizarre familial relations, and Christian theme of spirituality. Malick dedicates this film to his current wife who, I suppose, had him re-evaluate his life as a once-reclusive philosopher and France-resided teacher.I would think Malick lost his mind with this directorial mess because even he could not make sense of it, so he left it to the audiences and film critics to interpret what the movie is about. In the case that differentiates critics from the audience who comes in, somewhat familiar with Malick's previous work, expecting a Malick masterpiece, the film critics have proved themselves pretentious, tripping-all-over-themselves suckers for praising this film that doesn't make sense at all in terms of muddled themes and bizarre editing choices enforced by Malick to frustrate, confound, and mystify the audiences as much as possible.What Malick was thinking is never certain, because we know he's a very odd man considering his fortunate background as the child of privilege and impressive sport, journalistic and academic background. Here proffered is why the film may have ambition, but ends up tortuously hollow and shamelessly self-indulgent.The clue to the film's failure as an incomprehensibly meandering and tedious indulgence is Sean Penn's frustration in the interview with the French magazine 'Le Figaro' concerning Malick's unconventional filming style that essentially abandons the screenplay in favor of forming a random art film suitable for showing at Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan.Penn stated the script was the most magnificent he ever read, but complained that what happened is vastly different from the final product -- the emotions and the motives in character and thematic development lost in transition to the screen.Given Mr. Penn's credential as a director in his own right, albeit similarly pretentious and overly liberal, his revelation reveals Malick, as far as his motive of making The Tree of Life -- which is much ado about nothing but semi-autobiographical musings and superficial interest in the mixture of metaphysics of nature, spirituality and evolution -- to be the modern equivalent of the Emperor's New Clothes, on par with Sofia Coppola's hideously turgid "Lost in Translation".I know art professors (many superbly established artists) love "The Tree of Life," for no reason other than to call it "profound" and "his best work so far," in the same vein as the film critics who tend to dismiss the general, average moviegoers as unsophisticated and vapid. But for them to say those who criticize the film may be vapid and unsophisticated reveal their character as snooty, intellectual know-it-all, who see the world in their narrow prism, mistaking Duchamp's Fountain for profundity when the artist's intention was only to mock the museum as the incubator of ostentatious and degenerate art.In this case, Malick is either the new Duchamp of filmmakers, or he simply failed to make what "The Tree of Life" is about, at least in plain terms, whether deliberately mysterious or obvious.I believe it is the latter, whose preoccupation with constant editing and refinement, including frequently incorporating classical music and nature sequences (including the bizarre scene with the computer-generated dinosaurs that is overlong and perhaps unintentionally laughable) to the obnoxious degree, which may have obviated the perfect understanding of the original point of the film. The original point, embodied in the screenplay referred by Mr. Penn, which is either minor or altogether obliterated, courtesy of Malick's own human flaw as a Jekyll/Hyde type that began with good intention of producing a masterpiece only to turn in the locked cut that is utterly incomprehensible (I asked myself, "what's" and "where's the point?" throughout the film, in frustrated resignation) and simply embarrassing which exemplifies that even if the artist has an excellent reputation, it is self-evident he will trip up that should disprove the consensus a great filmmaker will make the incomprehensible marginally interesting.Malick did not respect the audience, so he gets no respect from me (and many disappointed Malick fans) and only for himself in selfish devotion to the pseudo-intellectual aspect of filmmaking whose purpose is to offend the audience with frivolous boredom, not unlike Andy Warhol and his unbearable 60's films.In summation, "The Tree of Life" is a failure that is not even worthy of comparison to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey which, while mysterious and slow-paced, makes universal sense that transcends the immersive movie-going experience with respect to the audience's ability to enjoy the aesthetics.* out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers? Impossible. This movie is so bad it is hard to know where to begin. Oh, I know, the beginning of the universe, cut to dinosaurs treating their young sternly, oh the foreshadowing! The review that compared this film to a piece of abstract monochromatic art had it about right, but imagine having to sit still for over two hours looking at it. To be honest, the acting was well done, but that risks misleading one to think there was a story. Horrible. Two plus hours of my life I will never get back. My wife thinks its the worst movie she has ever seen. That seems hard to believe but I cannot think of one worse. We wanted to walk out but we were home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is really hard to describe this movie. As a lot of other reviewers have already stated, this is more of a spiritual approach to life. An exploration if you wanna call it that and evolution over time. The movie takes it's time (and is superbly acted) and will divide peoples opinion for sure. There will be those who see Brad Pitt on the cover and rent it. But they will be disappointed. This is mostly heavy stuff. And even it's lighter moments, it is not a movie that can be just "watched" ... it is an experience.I liked the movie, but I can see how people can feel it is dragging along slowly. There is one sequence at the beginning that had me "confused". It is a 10 minute (I didn't count, let's say more or less) sequence of the circle of life/evolution and many other things. While it is beautifully photographed, I'm sure that some people will feel that it is unnecessary. Again: this is a love it or hate it movie. But while it has a family as facade for its themes, it does work on many levels!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love indy films and obscure art films but I just wasn't expecting what I got on this one. I guess with Sean Penn and Brad Pitt involved, I had anticipated something that at least made sense. It was like watching a slide show of slow, hazy, piecemeal scenes of a boy's life combined with images of volcanoes, waterfalls and dinosaurs. Yes, dinosaurs. And Sean Penn staring pensively out of what I believe is Pennzoil Plaza in downtown Houston....Frankly, if it had moved a bit faster/started tying it all together earlier, I might have survived to the end. I can't tell you the last time I couldn't finish a movie - it's been years - but this one had to come out of the DVD player without seeing the end. It had a few memorable images, but it took too long to help you understand where it was headed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a movie buff, never have i written a critique before, but this absolutely the worst movie ever made.There is no script, no meaningful dialog,no character presence. Brad Pitts character could have been played by anyone from the local theater.The photography was great, but irrelevant, sea creatures, dinosaurs, waves and etc. lend nothing the already limited story. If you want to see a good Pitt movie, watch "Snatch" he has a small but powerful role.The director needs to what ever he/she is good at, and it is not directing movies. To have 2 of the bigger names in movies and to misdirect them is a travesty. Some actors are criticized about influencing a movie, this an example of when they should flex their muscles.</fullReview>

I don't know what it's about since I did not make it past the first 9 minutes (this is why I'm alive, I stopped it before I died from boredom, you have been warned!!!). It did remind me of 2001 a Space Odyssey, but only if 2001 a Space Odyssey was a slow, boring, painfully bad movie made by the guy who made Tree of Life instead of Stanley Kubrick. Roger Ebert wishes he had a million thumbs to point downward (and a jaw, so he could drop it at how bad this movie is).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very slow movie. Not what I expected from Brad Pitt and Sean Penn. Was I watching a movie or national geographic? There were a lot of scenes that were left unexplained. Beautiful scenes though, but what was the purpose of these scenes? The slowness got boring.On the background there was boring classic music. Then suddenly it became Jurassic Park, the boring version.More than two hours I watched the movie and I hoped for something to happen. Before I knew the movie was over and nothing really happened! I thought a kid died in the beginning. Maybe Brad Pitt was sad because of that. I don't know, maybe he was sad because he lost his job.

		<fullReview>(A non-narrative movie deserves a non-narrative review).? "Visual melodrama" of the worst kind.? Koyaanisqatsi light - 2001: light (but without great music).? Malick here is like the heavy Asian girl on stage in the movie Donnie Darko. I'm like Drew Barrymore in the wings, looking on horrified at the spectacle, yet prideful of the effort.? The Tree of Life is definitely a heavyweight contender for the most self-conscious mainstream film in history. That alone makes it a "must watch" (rental).(pillow shot) closeup of acorn.? I'm reminded of Coppola's comment about a director's worst nightmare: "Waking up one day and realizing you've made a pretentious piece of crap".? Sean Penn.. as Jessica Chastain &amp; Brad Pitt's son (I bellowed in laughter at the chutzpa).? Self absorbed to absurdity. Not for a moment could I suspend disbelief; or could I escape the fact that I was being shown a contrived piece of art-for-art-sake.(pillow shot) young boy in museum ?fascinated with the text on the descriptor plate rather than the abstract painting the plate represents.? His overuse of poetic visuals here comes off to me like manipulative music from the 50's; huge swooning orchestra crescendos that reek of kitsch, that reek of "dated".? For a movie that manufactures so much visual subtlety and innuendo, oddly, there ends up being very little subtlety and innuendo. It lacks contrast/counterpoint in visual style. (Perhaps a cinema counterpart to droning ambient music?).? Special Features states they had "10,000" auditions for the 3 young boys, so there is no mitigation for a slight budget, or rush to market.? Overly spiritual and sentimental. Bad poetry. Incoherent.? I've loved all of Malick's work, but am unable to fight-the-good-fight here. (So of course I must go watch it again).</fullReview>

Sean Penn, another favorite of mine since I watched I Am Sam. He has that charisma that few have. Went to this with a great expectation. Heck, the IMDb rating of 7+ usually indicates a good movie.

		<shortDescription>Awesome and Mysterious - just like life itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Tree of Life was screened at the Cannes Film Festival the audience reaction ranged from boos to standing ovation. I wondered how one movie could possibly polarize viewers to that extent. But after seeing it for myself, I now understand. In much the same way as a painting or a poem can mean different things to different people, dependant on their various life experiences, Tree of Life is open to interpretation. And what you take with you when you leave the cinema is the films greatest achievement. Written and directed by renowned filmmaker Terrence Malick, this is a film that challenges your thinking and will have viewers questioning their lives and place in the universe. The plot revolves around a middle class family of the 1950's. The father (Brad Pitt) raises his three boys with fierce discipline and excessively high expectation. This is contrasted against the unconditional, gentle love of their mother (Jessica Chastain). As the boys grow the eldest brother begins to rebel against these two extremes of parenting. This is transposed against his adult life (played by Sean Penn) where he struggles for meaning in his life and for the loss of his brother. This insular microcosm is in itself set against the enormous magnitude of the origins of the universe and life on Earth, in some truly staggering sequences. Tree of Life is worth seeing just for this. Except for a few whispers there is no dialogue in these sequences, which is one of several reasons why this film will be dismissed by some audiences. Three of Life is visually stunning, the cinematography and direction masterful. Brad Pitt delivers another exceptional performance. Sadly I think the movie is too left-of-centre to garner any attention come Oscar time. Considering that Tree of Life has a dearth of spoken word, it is a testament to the skill of the cast that they are able to impart so much emotion and description in their expressions. I think one of Malick's intentions is to broaden the way we see movies beyond just superficial story telling. He wants to challenge the audience. It reminds me of this quote from Jim Morrison - "If my poetry aims to achieve anything, it's to deliver people from the limited ways in which they see and feel." In a time when movies are becoming more about spoon-feeding the audience with special effects and little substance, Malick doesn't offer any easy answers, or indeed resolutions. In that way it's more like real life than a film. It's hard for me to recommend this film. Not because it's bad (I loved it), but because it breaks so many rules of film making that it won't sit well with many people. It's disjointed, confusing, and mysterious, and you will probably leave the cinema with more questions than when you went in. But it is Malick's ability to evoke these questions in you in the ensuing days after seeing Tree Of Life, that is his real achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Life" Imitates Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tree of Life begins visually with a shot of pulsating light/energy -- the author's visual depiction of God. Next, Jack O'Brien speaks, addressing God directly. He says:"Mother, brother, it was they that led me to Your door." Mother, because her religious teachings and her personality have shaped Jack's own spiritual journey, and brother, because his brother RL's death has shaken the family and caused them to question God and the meaning of existence. RLs death, combined with Mother's faith &amp; her impression on Jack, have led him on a spiritual pilgrimage, to the door that he cites at the beginning and that is shown in the desert periodically. What follows is a prolonged meditation on life, suffering, and human resilience.Something interesting happens early on. Subsequent to RLs death, Mrs. O'Brien goes for a walk in the forest, looking up at the trees. This walk, connecting with nature, precipitates an extended, awe-inspiring sequence that imagines the creation and evolution of the universe. Later on, after a thorough examination of Jack's childhood experiences in Waco Texas, there is a return to the scene of the mother in the forest. So in fact, both the evolution sequence and the Waco, 1957 sequence are book-ended not just by Jack's existing in the modern day, but also by Mrs. O'Brien's forest stroll, something that suggests the movie, in addition to serving as Jack's testimony to existence and a telling of his own spiritual odyssey, plays out as the collective retelling of an intense family drama by several of its participants.In particular, Jack's mother appears to be a very active participant in the "contemplative" portion of the film, envisioning the birth of the universe, and recalling and analyzing the days in Waco. (Her memories of early childhood unfold exquisitely just after the opening words and images.) The questioning and the introspection exist as a joint exercise between the mother and the son, a conversation that has bound them together through the many years. (Although he has some secrets.) It explains why the opening declaration includes her specifically, rather than Jack's father, and it explains the necessity and importance of her farewell to her son RL at the end. It also explains why the thematic nature/grace collision is not really a fair fight, "nature" as embodied by the father clearly holds the weaker hand. While the father is also directly present as a narrator and a collaborator in shaping the memories, the guidance that he has given to his sons is severely undermined both by his bouts of capricious temper, and his later pronounced status as a broken man.Jack's mother on the other hand, representing and expounding the quality of "grace," only grows in stature as the film proceeds.By this way of thinking then, the film fills two key roles. Primarily as a spiritual self-portrait of Jack, (very possibly an alter ego of the author,) who articulates his search (the response to RL's call to "find me") and carries the audience along to its conclusion. Secondarily, of great importance, The Tree of Life is a gift to his mother. From all appearances, the author, Terrence Malick, is an extraordinarily humble and private man. But this has not prevented him from revealing himself through his art, and certainly through his protagonist Jack, saying in effect: This is who I am. This is the road I have travelled, and the place that I have arrived. The bridge at the end also points to future destinations. But he has done something else. He is saying to his mother, in a very personal way: it is not in vain. Our time here has meaning. Your son, my brother's death may have broken our hearts, but it has not robbed us of our joy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a film-goer who enjoys art house movies, foreign films, campy B-movies and the occasional Hollywood CGI explosions festival. I only ask of movies one thing: to have at least some entertainment value. You can tell your story as long as you can keep me interested and don't insult my intelligence. This highly-praised movie has absolutely zero entertainment value, or the entertainment value equal to watching paint dry. The story -if there's one- is unfocused and disjointed. The beautiful cinematography doesn't hide that most parts doesn't seem to belong in the same film. In resume, is a film you endure through it.Now, the genius of the film, which has so many critics and idiots masturbating to it, is that all the disjointed imaginary put together opens the film to interpretation. Such as an abstract painting can be interpreted by the public as they see fit, or give it a deeper meaning once they learn about the author's intension. This is how Duchamp was able to turn an urinal into a work of art.The problem is, I don't go to see films to interpret them. I take them at face value (even the best abstract paintings allow themselves to be taken as face value if you wish). If they're entertaining, I am able to read between the lines through smart subtext placed by the director or the actors. This film is not smart. It's lazy and self-indulgent. So let me flip the finger and extend a cordial eff you, to you who consider this film a masterpiece. You are idiots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first time in my life I left the theater after 30 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all: I am not the kind of guy that watches Adam Sandler movies and expects lots of cheap laughs and simple entertainment. Which is exactly why I was even more motivated to watch this piece of *insert random insult here* - when I saw that it was nominated for best picture - yay.Second of all: I am not even the kind of guy who takes a girl to the movies and leaves early because she makes other suggestions of how we might spend the rest of the night, even if the movie is kind of disappointing. I want to make up my mind about a film - and yes - I have even passed on other activities, just to see if a movie turns out to be interesting after all.I knew, this movie is going to be a bit challenging, so I didn't read any reviews and tried to avoid perceiving to much information about it, like I always do when I consider a movie worth watching.But beware: There was no girl involved. I had no 'better option' of spending my evening and still I left the theater, checked my phone for user reviews and decided not to go back in. That's two firsts in one single movie.I spare you the rest. Check the other one-star-reviews if you want to know what to expect. Unless you're a pretentious religious moron, you're probably going to doze off a couple of times in the middle of the 'movie', if you can put yourself through it. This movie does polarize. It's not like a Clockwork Orange, Requiem for a Dream or Fight Club - it's not a movie that tells apart people who are able to appreciate art and those who don't.It's a movie that has no point and no plot - it's just filled with pseudo-intellectual bible-crap and 'distant memories'. I would advice anybody who honestly says that they liked this movie to see a shrink or an exorcist.Horrible - Decades of watching and enjoying movies. Never ever left the theater. Not even to take a leak. Damn you, Tree of Life, for ruining my stats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe this movie has actually made it to my top 10 list of worst movies that my sorrowing eyes have ever beheld in their existence. Truly words can not begin to describe the agony I felt during this movie it was that boring, and I only wish I were lying. I to give spoilers for how could someone do that? How can I let me think...?OK, so a lady is thinking and mumbling a few words about some random events for what felt like 25 minutes. Some other stuff happens but by that time I was almost asleep. The next thing I remember was an opera was playing or something, then there was some chapel like hymns being sung.The next time I was looking at the screen it was like the discovery channel. There were single celled creatures developing rapidly into some weird creatures. Then there were strange large creatures humping the ground or something. Let it be known that at this part there was no music at all it was just science channel sh*t with no narration or anything. Just pure boring as fu*ki#g he=l science channel sh*t. There is a little random whispering here and there but mainly just complete bull sh*t boring retarded crap!To make a long wasteful story fast read the following:Essentially, if I were to pull down my pants after holding the contents of my colon for 2 months in a row, and then took a very large sh*t in front of the camera it would be 999 x 10^999999999999 times more entertaining then this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema at the highest level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies I have ever seen. In my mind, it is on par with John Ford's Grapes of Wrath, The African Queen, Dr Strangelove, Midnight Cowboy, To Kill a Mockingbird, and other masterpieces. Yet it is nothing like those movies in style or content. In my opinion, one has to be aged 35 to even begin to get this movie; or maybe younger if you have struggled hard in life. Pitt is just brilliant (so is the big-eared kid sorry I don't know his name yet). The ambitions of this movie are nothing less than illuminating the meaning of life. It recognizes the struggle that everyone goes thru. The movie shows how everybody does their best ... fathers, sons, mothers ... but none of us know what we are doing. We try, we fall, we get up, we try. In the end, the message of the movie is forgiveness. The photography is beautiful. Just awesome. It made me ache and my eyes fill with tears more than once. You could almost watch this movie with the sound turned down, just to enjoy the stunning visual beauty of it. I heard the director needed 10 years to make Tree of Life. I am not surprised. This is not a mere entertainment. It's not a thriller, not an action blockbuster, not a formula plot line. It is cinema at the highest level. I look forward to seeing it again, which I will do soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame period drama mixed with Nova "Discover The Universe"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, once again the critics bamboozled me. I was watching the "best of 2011" movie reviews on channel 2, and the 3 main reviewers (including Ebert)all had this movie and none other on their respective 3 lists. They were all gushing about what a masterpiece this was. For some odd reason I believed them and rented out this "movie" at the local red box machine. They must have been paid off!I can sum up this movie pretty simply: A family "drama" set in the 1950's that occasionally flashes to the present, and sometimes flashes to the time of the dinosaurs, and even the creation of the universe. That may sound interesting, but the execution is extremely annoying. You keep seeing little bits of Brad Pitt, his wife (all bones and red hair) and three generic sons at various stages of their life.It is shot in a cloying, pseudo-artistic way of extreme facial close-ups, light shining through branches, and other clichés. Meanwhile there is this annoying woman whispering nonsense, and sometimes a boy whispering nonsense. I kept expecting the kid to whisper "Zoom zoom", like in those old Mazda commercials. At least that would have added and element of humor, which the "movie" totally lacks. Oh, and the computer generated dinos look totally fake (inexcusable!), Sean Penn wanders around looking constipated, and the ending (may contain a "spoiler", I don't think so, though)is everybody frolicking on some beach! Stupid!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This total scam of a "film" literally made me want to vomit.Unbelievable (and I am using that word in it's truest sense). That they actually allowed this to be released. And after they did, it was criminal to put it out on DVD. I have never ever, in all my entire life, seen anything this horrendously bad. This makes every single bad movie I have ever seen worth a second look.Not just a bad movie...it shouldn't even be called a "movie". There was no dialog whatsoever, unless you count occasional unintelligible whispers or mumbles. Must have been an easy script to memorize. There were no scenes - just snippets of faces - brief glimpses of people, hypnotic, droning music, intermittent flashes of fire literally. Intermittent senseless nothingness. One brief "scene", Sean Penn in a high rise, mumbling a couple sentences, then flash to Sean Penn walking in the desert, in a suit, saying nothing. Total senselessness and the combination made me literally nauseated.The people who made this "film" and the people who "acted" in it and the people who gave it any kind of award should all be sent to Guantanamo And, the worst offenders - whoever wrote the movie write-up who claimed it was about "a mid-western family in the 1950s." Sounds harmless - how bad could it be?I would say don't watch it - but I actually wish everyone could see 15 minutes of it - just so everyone could see what I am talking about and so everyone could rise up and speak out on this atrocity.Man, wish you could get an instant refund from cable movies on demand</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a film or a story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At 25 minutes in my wife and I said to each other, "We will give it another 15minutes. Soon a plot has to start. At the beginning it hinted that it might have a plot about a boy's journey to manhood or a mother's grief and how it might effect the family... but no. We laughed a lot at the movie although it wasn't a comedy. We were laughing at the direction and writing and how obvious and incredibly trite it was. It was a non-stop visual cliché. The problem is with this still going on... there was still no plot, no story, not even dialogue.At an hour and a half in to this stock footage "movie" we said to each other, certainly the movie will start now, we can see some acting and a plot will develop. I could go on and on for the 2hours and 20 minutes that I will be billing the "director" for but it is just rinse and repeat of the first hour and a half.It was SO amateurish! Everything went into it including the kitchen sink from a 'what I learned at director school'. Every angle, every level, every photographic technique, it makes you want to vomit. The whispering monologue, the ridiculous CGI enhanced space telescope images, 15 minutes watching a dinosaur at a stream... at stream level! Brilliant!... not. Every scene was too long. This theory, not a movie, could have easily been portrayed in a 10-15minute artistic short.If it didn't have Brad Pitt and Sean Penn's name attached to this, whatever it was, it wouldn't have been picked and would never have made it out of festival if it even was at festival.It gets a zero from me as it wasn't a movie. At the end of this 80million dollars spent I told my wife I would have rather watched a B rated zombie movie, which I have never watched. It is THAT much of a waste of your time. Sure ignore me and try it but 25 minutes in when you say let's give it another 15 minutes, don't and do something else with your life that will provide better entertainment, like watching paint dry.</fullReview>

But right about the time where Sean Penn is reunited on the beach with his family, I simply could not put myself through any more of this mess. I stopped and was distraught because I had just wasted 2 hours of my life. Yes, I appreciated the visionary masterpiece of beautiful images having been assembled on a screen, but I can get a bunch of pictures from National Geographic or Time, add reflective music in the background, ask a few questions on the "meaning of life", and I would have created a replica of this movie. This movie was simply thoughts, images, and some scenes with Brad Pitt. I cannot get over how bad this movie was, and going through some of the reviews, so happy I am not the only one.</fullReview>

If you would like to watch the Big Bang Explosion, the dinosaurs exploring the earth, and the inside of a kaleidescope, have at it. I saw this because of the cast. The problem is they had nothing to do and nothing to say. I think Sean Penn said about ten words - Brad Pitt uttered a few lines. That's it, folks. It is a series of flashbacks to a 1950s childhood, but it is not explored. In fact, I was never sure which son died in Vietnam. The kids are sullen, the father more so. The mother kisses everyone and even has a ballet scene. What a waste of dough this was!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay it's fine to have abstractions and surreal scenes when they contribute to the storyline. This movie however does nothing of the sort. Instead we're bombarded with random nature videos or clips of stairs, jellyfish, or whatever else they could get their hands on. All of this while listening to classical music and wondering when the storyline is going to develop. The movie seems to be an attempt to make an examination of the meaning of life, but if that's the case then the disconnected scenes make little sense. Sure we have galaxies, our solar system formed, then there were dinosaurs, then there was a meteor, but what does this have to do with the main characters who we barely get to know? There is just so very little substance to this movie if any at all. It was painful, what else can I say. With that said everyone involved in making this movie should re-examine the meaning of their life.</fullReview>

Whispering poetic sounding BS while choirs drown out ambient noise, that isn't Art (yes. capital A).Cinematography was nice, though. Also, making the creation of the universe look boring is not an easy task, yet Malick succeeded. Kudos for that.This has nothing to do with entertainment, not even in the David-Lynch-way. It's boring, everything is a symbol in the most surreal way and there is no plot. If you think that makes a movie great or is the main criteria for Art, you will probably like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no way I could write a spoiler, as I've no idea what this movie is about. Okay I know it is about life, but aren't all movies? I also know that I would never have rated it so highly if the categories included negative numbers. I am a total movie nut, usually I can enjoy a movie for its' badness alone. This movie exceeded even my tolerance. It is full of anachronisms, the eighties house detailing in the sixties. Notice the brickwork anyone? How about the schoolyard where the girls and boys play alongside each other? Maybe now, but not then. I could easily forgive those type of things if the film had other redeeming qualities, it doesn't. Yes much of the film work is of very high quality, the space shots and the microscopic shots especially, too bad I can't say the same for the painfully overloud score. As for the plot, Sean's brother died at the age of nineteen, and it would appear that life was not all beer and skittles (whose is?) after that. If you continue to watch in the hope of finding out how the brother died, don't bother, they don't tell you. I'm guessing that father killed him when he found out he was gay, but it may have been Viet Nam, I certainly don't care anymore I'm just glad it's over. Now to watch something more coherent, like "Glen or Glenda".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you discount his first effort "Lanton Mills" - which I haven't seen - then as far as I'm concerned this is Terrence Malick's best film to date. From my point of view, it's everything that Lars Von Trier's "Antichrist" should have been aiming for, but didn't quite fulfill. Perhaps Von Trier's well documented issues with depression soured the conception of his treatise somewhat, but I believe that the two films are essentially making the same point. Malick's focus on stark beauty instead of routine degradation means that this is a much more affirming viewing experience, if you are properly attuned to its message.Both films deal with bereavement, and the difficulties of inhabiting a universe where, no matter the personal tragedies that befall you, the continuing processes of life roll ever onward. What a person does is unimportant, but how they act lets others know if they merit treating fairly or unfairly. This cruel world of ours unfortunately makes no such distinction.I don't pretend to understand every point that Malick was trying to make with his employment of certain details, and the loose framework of the story - such as it was - didn't grip me, but the pleasures that it offered right from the outset were that it perpetually intrigued me. I believe that its basic theme of 'acceptance' is so universal and simple, that if it has any impact at all, then it will be immediate. Malick can create a mood like no other; the fact that he achieves this in such an esoteric manner doesn't make his films any less interesting, in fact, rather less accessible. You'll either like his style or you won't. I love it, because it raises existential questions that I'm fascinated by in my own life philosophy.I'm not campaigning for a level of awareness that shows that everybody must value the same things I do; I'm just trying to explain why this piece of cinematic art touched me on a profoundly personal basis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Tree of Life" is not a film that can be understood, nor can it be explained. It also does not want to be described in any one way. We jump from decade to decade, from solar system to solar system, and from era to era in the history of the planet. As specific as can be allowed, it's about life, also the universe. In parts, it's about family or childhood, but certainly, not on the whole.It's a masterpiece in its visual presentation. There are eye-popping, breath-taking and heart-stopping shots of nature beyond comparison to anything you would ever see in an IMAX nature documentary. We see Earth from beyond our atmosphere, from under the sea, and then we climb to just above the clouds?the heavens, I presume. These cinematic journeys are accompanied by an opera orchestra and Jessica Chastain's narrations of spiritual philosophies.Eventually we do settle down to one definable place and time: Waco, Texas in the 1950s. A probably typical family with the silent, reserved mother, and the strong, cruel father and their three sons behaving in a destructive manner as young boys do. Interestingly, we knew most of this before we were really introduced to them all based on a few early, near-silent scenes with the three leads, the father (Brad Pitt), the mother (Jessica Chastain) and their eldest son (Sean Penn), and with some subtle implications from the filmmaker.Some shots were clear references to birth, death and the smallness of mankind in the universe. I was beginning to assume that it would be like "Synecdoche, New York" but without defying the logic or boundaries of time-scales. When we then went back to meet some dinosaurs, my theory was clearly shot. There is even less structure to the story. Here, you're just supposed to be enveloped by the magnitude of everything on the screen.I was able to pick up on a few visual metaphors and could at least provide myself with a little meaning, but that's probably the most I could hope for. Such is life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm an idiot. I looked forward to this movie for months, watched the trailer, went to the website. And when I had my chance to see it in the theater... I blew it. I had plenty of time too. I just didn't want to deal with parking downtown. Moron. I promised myself that this year I would see more movies in the theater, and I haven't been to a single one. More than any other, this is the one I regret missing. What you're about to read is gushing. Effusive gushing. Effusive, incoherent gushing. Effusive, incoherent, RELUCTANT gushing because my stupid cynical self doesn't want to gush over something that's already received so much gushing from others.To say this is a beautiful film, perhaps even the most beautiful film, isn't enough. The film embodies beauty. Impressionistic fragments of memory flow into each other, and even when the images aren't gloriously bedazzled with natural light (Malick seems to be constantly striving to include the sun in the proceedings, as if the camera itself is seeking God) they exhibit a captivating sense of framing and movement. The film also showcases some of the most breathtaking use of special effect photography and CG I've ever witnessed -- it's no surprise that 2001 maestro Douglas Trumbull was involved. Is it enough for a film to be aesthetically brilliant and have breathtaking visuals? Well, yes, but that's not all there is to it. You could accuse Malick of being too ambitious here, his philosophical musings perhaps not as profound as the incredible imagery and rapturous music (a terrific score by Desplat with a thoughtful selection of classical music) suggest, and I wouldn't necessarily argue. But I was swept into the poetry and rhythms of the voice-over, the gentle exploration of life, its beginnings, its conflicts, the duality of nature and grace. I also love that we are presented with a father figure (Brad Pitt) who is fearful without being monstrous, and whose own voice is given equal weight as the more sympathetic characters. And the casting of the three children is superb as well. This is a movie I'll be returning to, and soon. It's hard to say at this point whether this or THE NEW WORLD is my favorite Malick, or even if such a comparison has any meaning.</fullReview>

It begins by portraying the entire history and evolution of the universe, from The Big Bang through the age of the dinosaurs (yes . . . dinosaurs!) and then shrinks it down to the memories of a boy growing up in Texas whose entire universe seemed to end at the edge of the driveway.What makes the film so amazing is the way that Malick encompasses both of these elements into a poetic film that is not always easily understood, but is never-the-less moving and very entertaining. The hub of the movie is seen through the eyes of an architect named Jack (Sean Penn) who looks back over his years growing up in Texas in the 1950s. The movie follows him from the moment that he comes into the world up until he is about to enter his preteen years. We watch him from the moment of his infancy, through toddler-hood and up through the beginnings of his understandings of the world around him. Into that world also come two brothers, one of whom will eventually perish, making his story all the more poignant.Unlike the opening of the film, which shows the expanse and colossal landscape of the universe, Jack's world is very small and is headed by two authority figures that are his entire world. One is his father (Brad Pitt), a stern and sometimes abusive disciplinarian, but not a one-dimensional bully. He is a frustrated man whose dreams of being a musician withered away, forcing him to enter the corporate world. His approach with the boys is harsh, but is not unfeeling. The other is his mother (Jessica Chastain), a graceful, angelic figure who is an enabler to her husband and an emotional cushion to her put-upon sons. One of the things I noticed about the film is that the adults are never given first names, they are only called mother and father. There was a time when no one called an adult by their first name.The movie sees Jack's emerging understanding of the world, but there is no firm narrative. This is a series of memories from Jack's childhood and they don't flow like a normal film would. He remembers the dinner table. He remembers following a girl home from school. He remembers his brothers running to the edge of the yard when daddy came home from a business trip. Yet, the movie leaves a lot of things open. It doesn't point to the highlights, but rather lets us fill in the blanks.What is most effective about "The Tree of Life" is the way it remembers specific details of childhood just in the backgrounds and the foregrounds. It remembers fireflies, wind chimes, a birdbath, grass on the front lawn. It remembers the decay of the siding on the house and dad's garden out back being eaten away by insects. It remembers boys rolling on the grass in their Sunday clothes. It remembers kids being at the cemetery and playing on the headstones. It remembers stalking around in the woods with the pellet gun and making mom squirm when you brought a reptile into the house.Those details are so beautifully observed and observed in a way that no other film in my memory has done. Yet, it also remembers the growing realization that the two strongest forces in our childhood universe - mom and dad - are human beings who are loving but flawed.Malick is the most reclusive of filmmakers. Not much is known of his past. He is so reclusive, in fact, that this is only the fifth film that he has directed in 40 years. My guess is that The Tree of Life is a collection of memories from his own upbringing in Texas. His film is very spare and not always easy to understand. I will confess that I an unable to comprehend or understand the last ten minutes of this movie. Perhaps he is saying something profound that comes from his soul, I don't know. Perhaps my next viewing will give me a better understanding. Malick purposely leaves much of the film unexplained, leaving us with deep discussions after-wards."The Tree of Life" is not for everyone. It is, at times, baffling and other times just plain incomprehensible. I like that about it, I like that it leaves me with something to discover. Not since Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" has there been a film that considers how minuscule we are on this planet in relation to the rest of our cosmos. I am going to become a student of this film, just as I have been with "2001", watching it again and again and trying to unlock its vast and baffling mysteries. Here is a film the considers the enormity of our universe and relates it to the tiny spaces in our memories. What a wonderful movie.**** (of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I've ever felt mad at a movie before. There was so much scope to make this a great movie and it ended up a pretentious, drawn-out visual rambling of one man who should have kept it as a home movie. Its a film that professes to thrive on nuances of life and death and space and time, but it is just plain bad, boring, pretentious and a waste of a talent. Truly disappointing from someone with so much promise. I will not be watching another Terence Malick film ever again.Why this film got moderately good reviews is way beyond me. I guess its refreshing to see a film that doesn't fall into any specific genre, but that doesn't make it good, or even remotely watchable. Watch this film and mark it down, it deserves to have its rating reduced. Stop fooling people into thinking that this is a masterpiece, because its no where close. It belongs in an art exhibition, not cinema. Truly awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a religious movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing I kept reading about this movie is, that it is a meditation about life and how things come into being. This is not exactly true. The movie shows, without really saying it, the history of the universe in a lengthy sequence (about 45 minutes) of pictures from space, the early earth etc - many of those are animated. Most of the views are nowadays well-known and not really fascinating - so the only thing you can find interesting here is that the movie tries to tell "the" story, I guess.What looks like a scientific approach to the origins of life is in the end only the base, the background, for a religious movie which propagates a monotheistic god.Throughout the movie light, water, life, "doing good" (grace) are major subjects that are repeated again and again in all possible forms. It is never really said what "doing good" means, but there are example of family members which seem to act not good. The good mother (she is glorified beyond everything - seems she is even better than god) is just dancing around in the garden, flying like an angle at one point, sometimes looking happy, but always worried about the good in the world.The kids are normal kids and you see mainly one of them growing up and gathering a guilt complex - it would be good, if the movie would be about a child gathering a guilt complex, but it is about god.In the end there are angles (young, blond, skinny ladies), the light of god and a lot of forgiving and good.The movie is mostly boring if you do not believe in anything spiritual. There are very few scenes which show you something that has a meaning outside the "there is more to it" interpretation. I liked the scene when the boy broke into the neighbors house, for example - but this movie destroys every good scene with an over-interpretation.My recommendation: watch 2001 (a Space Odyssee) if you want to see good pictures from space mixed up with a fair amount of mysticism - that movie does not bother you with "I know the truth, just read my pictures right".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got home from seeing this with friends. I'd been looking forward to it for months. As I sat through this incredibly pretentious movie, all I could do was fidget and check the time. All I was thinking was, "My friends are going to kill me for choosing this!" I study film and literature. So I understand what is visually beautiful and what is a moving story. Sadly, Tree of Life is only one of these. I know it's about the concept of childhood and innocence and all the rest. But this film was completely boring, and a complete waste of time. The 'moving' nature scene went for far too long, and honestly just annoyed me. I found myself craving to see people again. Sadly when I did, they didn't say a word. Which again, annoyed me. I did enjoy Brad Pitt's performance, and Jessica Chastain is absolutely beautiful. But the film was completely pointless, the death mentioned at the start is never completely explained. It seems as if the summer that the filmmakers focused on, had absolutely nothing to do with future event, which again annoyed me! If you like sitting awkwardly for two and a half hours watching half of an imax movie and half of a family drama (without any dialogue) then sure, this is for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether you have been reading about its long and sordid history since the beginning, or if you just recently learned about it after winning the Palme D'Or, there is nothing that can prepare you for watching The Tree of Life. Terrence Malick, one of his generation's most critically acclaimed directors, has created a dazzling mediation on life and death, but one that is more challenging than it is entertaining. That alone should suggest this film is not for everyone. Even offering a plot synopsis proves to be difficult, outside of poking at the vague notion of it revolving around a young boy and his family growing up in the 1950s. But of course, that skips out on some of the other more "artsy" elements involved within the film.Simply put, The Tree of Life is the most important film of 2011 thus far. The year has only produced a handful of very good films, but none match the sheer power or audacity of Malick's work. You can tell this is the work of a unique and creative mind, albeit one that is not quite worried about giving the audience any sort of cohesive steps to grip to. It reminded me a lot of Gasper Noé's Enter the Void, but I feel that comparison is a bit offensive. Where Noé used perversion and ridiculously abstract images to complete what is best described as thinly veiled pseudo-intellectual art school thesis, Malick uses elegance and allusion to spin his tale. Having never seen another Malick film, I cannot easily compare this one to those acclaimed masterworks. But it is obvious we are in the hands of a master of the craft after the production logos zip by. He makes Noé's film look like the work of a complete amateur.I mentioned the lack of cohesion earlier because the entire thing comes off as fragmented. The entire first half of the film is all over the place, jumping around time period to time period, focus to focus. Malick even pulls a Kubrick and throws in shots of the planets coming together during the big bang, and even shots of dinosaurs. I knew they were coming, but I was still totally thrown off during the lengthy sequence. Astoundingly beautiful or not, it still comes off as one of the most bizarre and baffling scenes in the history of cinema. Once the second half rolls in, the film starts to feel a little less insane as it focuses on various points in the life of the family. There is no real set length of time holding these events together, and some of the scenes feel more episodic than they should, but keeping some semblance of focus proves allows the film to become ridiculously fascinating and potently intriguing. While there are red herrings and bewildering amounts of narration sprinkled throughout, the main crux of following main character Jack as a boy (portrayed brilliantly by newcomer Hunter McCracken), is where the film finds its most emotional potency. We follow his experiences of him losing his innocence, we see him trying to understand and find his place in the world, and we can see him trying valiantly to move out of his father's (played surprisingly low-key by Brad Pitt) permanent shadow. The images of Jack playing with his brothers and fighting with his father brought on a wave of nostalgia for me, but it also gives the film new heights of fascination. It may seem simple and boring just watching Jack move from moment to moment as if living his life in episodes, but it just seems so natural and so captivating that I dare you to not feel emotionally inclined to keep watching.But this is also where the film proves to be the most maddening. Leaving aside one of the most ludicrous and outlandish endings ever filmed (one that does not even attempt to hide the religious and Christian elements heavily embedded within the script), I kept asking myself what Malick was trying to say at every turn. A character dies early on in an unseen sequence years after the rest of the events that take place in the film, and it has a profound effect on Jack in his older years (played sombrely, almost catatonic by Sean Penn), but we are never allowed to understand why. The film allows certain moments to pass by almost montage-like, but then focuses and expands on certain other moments for almost no reason. But Malick is not in the business of explaining it out to the audience, so we are left trying to unravel the pieces and trying to figure out why scenes with Jack's mother (played by Jessica Chastain, who gets to say more with her facial expressions than she does with her voice) floating around like a ballerina/butterfly hybrid are meant to make sense in the grand scheme of things.My critical analysis of The Tree of Life may sound horrifically unbalanced, but that is because I am still left grasping to try and comprehend what I watched. I unforgivably dosed off a few times for momentary lapses, but I am still left reeling in a state of confusion. What is Malick trying to tell us about the human condition? About life or death? Why are so many scenes played out with only ambient noise over them, and why are so many others played out with just music and muted dialogue? In the end, The Tree of Life is a harrowing experience that will inherently leave you more curious with questions than it will with any real answers. I warned early on that you cannot be prepared at all for what you see when you venture into the film (if only because the 140-minute running time is a real test of endurance). But if you leave in the trance-like state I did, you may just need to watch it all over again.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where cinematic art becomes just art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally. The ultimate culmination of the Terrence Malick experience. Here is a film with all of the existentialism and symbolism of your typical Malick film, only this time he takes it to a whole new level. The Tree of Life is about a family growing up in Texas in the 1950's. The eldest son, Jack, develops a complicated and confusing relationship with his father as his innocence slowly slips away. The film cuts between Jack as a child and Jack as an adult. The adult Jack wanders about in the modern world reflecting on his own existence and questioning his faith. The film mixes in artistic imagery that instill all sorts of bewilderment as the film examines life and the universe up close through a scope so large and so small it encompasses all of existence itself.This is the kind of film that comes to mind when you say art-house picture. The Tree of Life is not a film grounded into reality or reason. It is a work of abstract art open to various interpretations, none of which are necessarily wrong. The mood and emotion of the film is allegedly autobiographical of the elusive Terrence Malick. There isn't really a way to know if this is true or not, but I did get the feeling that this is a very personal film for Malick. He made the film more for himself than he did an audience. And if he made it for anyone but himself it is the artistic demographic that are more open to interpretive art through cinema, rather than a mainstream audience. It isn't a film that provides any answers and lacks any kind of catharsis. It is an open ended work of art that is as abstract as any Salvador Dali painting hanging in a museum.It is difficult to review a film like this because it isn't the kind of film that demands a review. To talk about the dialogue or acting would be trivial. I can say that the cinematography is gorgeous and Malick's camera work is gracious and awe inspiring. He captures beautiful imagery through a sharp and careful lens that never intrudes on the action of the film but instead allows us to glide through all the films beauty and grace. The film can, at times, be harsh and at other times be sweet and lovely. It is a frivolous examination of what time does to us and the way life bountifully moves past our eyes. It is a film truly unlike anything ever seen before. I can compare it to other abstract films like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey but it resembles a film like this only in that it is another piece of abstract art that can't be finitely defined.Despite anything about this beautiful film I can put into words, it is still difficult to get every point across and then assign a rating towards. It would be like going through an art museum and giving the paintings in there star ratings. With real art you absorb it and examine how it makes you feel and what it makes you think about, rather than just look at it. The same principal applies with The Tree of Life. You don't just watch this film, you absorb it as a piece of art. And once absorbed it either has an affect on you of some kind or it doesn't. The Tree of Life had an affect on me. I was absolutely mystified by its beauty and found myself in a haunting trance as the films grandiose imagery flashed before my eyes in ways I never expected.For me, a film like this can almost be too much, but when I take a step back and look at this film the way it is meant to be looked at which isn't really like a film at all, I can find the greatness in it and appreciate it for what it is. The Tree of Life is a completely different experience than any you will ever have through cinema because it is true art. There is nothing tangible to get a grip on with this film and there is no point of easy access to understanding this film. You simply have to take it for what it is and enjoy it, or don't enjoy it. It's the wonder of interpretive art. For me, I greatly enjoyed it and I'm sure I will find myself thinking about this film for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrance Malick was inspired off Stanley Kubrick, cause the beginning is an example of that, and places where he has the camera, it's enough to make you dizzy, maybe that was the point. It's really hard to say what's this film is about, without giving too much away, so I'll just sum it up, it's basically the joy and downside of parenthood, and the joys and horrors of childhood.Brad Pitt was believable has the tough loving father, and Jessica Chastain is great, has the mother who takes so much joy in motherhood. the boys where pretty good also. And Malick really captured the late 50's in a very realistic way. Although one miner problem I had was with beginning, I felt it was too longly drawn out, but that was my only complaint. And Sean Penn was also good has one of Pitts boys in the present, this movie proves what a visionary Terrance Malick is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If film could be poetry, then Terrence Malick's film, The Tree of Life, is one such film. The Tree of Life is a non-linear, visual experiment of a film that jumps around in the life of a small town American family, in particular their eldest son, Jack, from childhood to manhood. Through the eyes of Jack, Malick takes interludes into outer space, microscopic surroundings, and all the way to the dinosaur days, to explore greater ideas such as the creation of the universe and religion, tying them into Jack's arc of slowly discovering the world around him, through his strict father, brushes with death, rebellion, and angst. Simply, The Tree of Life is a metaphysical journey that makes the viewer think, reflect, and remember, and not many films are special enough to say that.The imagery that Malick and cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, concoct is so lush and filled with details, that each shot, from cut to cut, requires thought as to the symbolic meaning of what that shot means and what is its purpose at that moment in the story. The film often has moments with odd jump cuts that displace one from the moment, as well as some quick cutting from luscious image to luscious image, often not allowing the viewer to drink the images in long enough to even attempt to figure out the symbolic impact. In all actuality, only one man truly knows what this all means, and it is writer/director Terrence Malick. This is a film that shows how he views life, and how he feels we should view life.The film opens with a bible verse from the Book of Job, constantly referencing back to Job's story throughout the film, of how every bad thing imaginable happens to one man, and yet he still manages to praise God. The Tree of Life shows life as it is, thanks to the experiences of Jack and his family, and it makes a viewer question why bad things often happen. Malick chooses not to answer that question, for that is not his place to tell us, but he does tell the viewer that through love and grace is the only way to have life, so it is through love and grace that we should live.I give The Tree of Life a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice trip back to childhoods of the 50s, imagined and real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made a huge detour to see this movie in Chicago. Can't say I was disappointed, but it's not my favorite movie either. My generation had visions as shown here of the cosmic mysteriousness of our little lives against the backdrop of the eons and the vastness of space. It wasn't all that popular a point of view (so how are we to respond to that?), but I'm glad to see it reprised here as it blended well with my own attitude, at least.Despite a recent article in the Chicago Tribune noting the biblical references, I did not find there to be an oppressive or even annoying amount of those in this movie. I'm not a fan of religion and would have really felt cheated if there were. The great sweep of the movie is more in terms of how little we really know and how, somehow, it doesn't really matter. We are what we are and there's not much we can do about it except enjoy our lives and live them as best we can. It's well argued in this movie where the main characters are all fully invested in their parts and quite convincing.It's good to see Brad Pitt take on a role that's not very flattering. And Sean Penn makes a convincing grown up version of Pitt's somewhat troubled son. Chastain is excellent as a kind of everywoman, a little too attractive to represent ALL mothers, but you hardly notice.Enjoyed thinking back to those times but am left unsure whether this younger generation will be able to relate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A middle-aged man, Jack, has fragmentary recall of a childhood summer, or summers, growing up in middle America circa 1950s with his two brothers. His disciplinarian father exudes ambition and frustration. His mother bears all the family's faults. There is a coming-of-age of sorts for Jack, though nothing is so clearly defined in this episodic, imagistic outing. What is a life? Jack asks himself, framed in the context of the loss at 19 of his younger brother, possibly in the Vietnam war, given that the news arrives in an official brown envelope.I saw this in Glasgow Film Theatre at a screening introduced by an academic. "It is a film that demands to be admired," he said, "but can be difficult to embrace." I shared that sentiment, admiring the visuals, though finding myself wondering if some of the frames were too self-indulgent at times. The performances are sublime, the children incredibly realistic, brash and vulnerable. Pitt, once again, excels. But I couldn't help feeling the technical prowess was leaving me feeling distanced from it all - until a climatic scene on a beach, people wandering and mingling in some kind of sunset-drenched purgatory - or maybe not: it is difficult to say anything with confidence about what exactly is going on at any one moment. It may have been the end of time. Nothing is said, but the glanced touches, embraces, and looks met, proved charged and incredibly cathartic. It is a challenging film, but in the end, a deeply rewarding one.Malick sets out to hit the audience with shock and awe, and does so superbly.</fullReview>

If you enjoy movies with no plot, emotionally and physically abusive parents, segmented by lava lamp screen savers and then under the sea scenes dripping into Jurassic scenes with sympathetic dinosaurs, then maybe you will like this movie. But for me, I didn't get it. It seemed to me that maybe the movie ended up being too short for it to go into theaters, so Terrence Malick probably decided to fill it with nonsense scenes accompanied by bad music. I'm a bit concerned for Malick, it seems as though he has full blown dementia. The only way that this movie would be enjoyable or make any sort of sense is if you went to it while tripping balls on acid.</fullReview>

Some brilliant shots of planets, jellyfish, a thoughtful predatory dinosaur (the deepest thinker in the movie). Then it was back to the main plot with the dis-functional family. I went home with only recollections of rock formation's planetary explosions, a wonder for nature and a confirmation that the USA is brilliant at creating and living in a world of obsessive irrelevance.

		<fullReview>The Tree of Life is the most boring film I have sat through in the last ten years. No, make that fifteen. Why didn't I walk out? Somehow, I didn't feel like pushing my way past the nice people sitting next to me. Also, I had no idea it was this loooonnnnnngggggggggggggg. I put my head down and took off my glasses for the last 50 minutes. The film is turgid, pretentious, slow, obscure, preachy, self-indulgent and maddeningly boring.The only kind things I can say about it are that the soundtrack features classical music and that there are some fine shots of lava flows and hammerhead sharks. What these have to do with the rest of the film, I have no idea. I liked the dinosaur sequence too, though it was not immediately clear how this related to the banal suburban family story of this film. However, it has won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and 85% of critics praise it. So maybe there is something wrong with me. If you are insatiably curious to see how boys played in 1950s US then this may be the film for you.</fullReview>

I have no problem with that in principle, film is often at its best when it relies on visuals, but this movie lacks not only dialogue but also a story.So what's the point of the movie? Well, I get the point of the movie and I also get that the movie demonstrates it badly and in a self-indulgent, boring way. To be generous and I suppose with the right frame of mind, you could possibly take the movie as a surreal comedy. I don't think that was the intention however.

		<fullReview>I had never seen a Terrence Malick film before The Tree of Life. Despite not having any sort of expectations, the final product still wasn't what I imagined it would be. The trailer didn't really reveal much of anything either, at least as far as the story is concerned. Brad Pitt plays the father of a boy who eventually grows up to be Sean Penn. That's about it. While The Tree of Life may come off as slightly pretentious and more than a little overbearing, it's difficult to argue that it isn't exactly that. But at least it offers an incredible cinematic vision in the meantime.The cinematography in The Tree of Life is truly mesmerizing. Every frame seems to tell its own unique story thanks to the way it was shot and the vibrant colors that are used throughout the film. Malick has a way of making things like trees, waterfalls, and shadows seem way more spectacular than they really are. There's a fascination with the third person perspective as we're constantly staring at the back of the actors as they react to the extraordinary world around them. Everything in the film just seems to be so full of life.Less delightful things in life are shown in a fantastic light, as well. Devastation and how it's portrayed is one of them. Jessica Chastain's emotionally powerful reaction to the letter she receives in addition to Brad Pitt's face slowly melting into a look of both recognition and sorrow as the sun bathes his look of despair as he receives this news over the phone illustrates this point to perfection. Dying trees and the way their branches plague the sky leave a fairly large impact, as well. Then there's the use of colors in the film. There's a heavy use of green for scenes that take place in the past while shades of gray are littered throughout the present. White is also used to symbolize innocence. Clouds and the sky in general are utilized throughout the film while skyscrapers seem to replace trees in present day. Perhaps the most enthralling visuals are the scenes in space. The magnitude and vast infatuation of watching nebulae, planets, stars, and life from space as the film offers is something marvelous in itself.The story is where the film stumbles. We're shown various different circles of life, so to speak, but the O'Brien family fits in there somewhere amongst outer space and dinosaurs and their story comes off a little forced rather than natural. Jack's childhood takes a front seat as we see him get into mischief with his friends and brothers and we eventually watch him develop issues towards his father, but it doesn't really go much deeper than that. A tragic event seems to bring the family together just as much as it pushes them apart. We're shown some of the trials and tribulations of life, but the story doesn't feel like it goes nearly as deep as the visuals do. The ending doesn't provide much closure either. Is Jack in heaven? Is this just his way of letting go of the past? Maybe it's just a way to symbolize his thoughts and emotional process? Is it acceptance? All of the above? The Tree of Life just left something to be desired when it came to its story.The Tree of Life is beautifully shot and eloquently acted, but is a lot to take in and feels twice as long as its 138-minute duration. The film's score is breathtaking. In addition to its use of Brahms and original pieces, simple sounds like birds and wind chimes and nothing more during certain scenes made the film sound and feel like an expression of life itself rather than just appear to look like it. The Tree of Life is incredibly abstract yet gorgeous and engrossing. It just has trouble finding its footing when it comes to storytelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is as pitiful as I could ever imagine a movie to be. It spills out a world of self-induced mental pain over you. In case you have children yourself, you will probably find the whole topic unbearable. In case you suffered yourself from the loss of a child, you might feel like burning the movie theater down.The movie is also religious in a very crude way and shows that the people making it did not understand at all what God could be. For them, God is a "trader" who grants all wishes if paid in good deeds.Especially US, who like flying to other countries bombing the s**t out of the people living there, yet drowning in an ocean of tears if one of their people dies. What hypocrisies.I left this disgusting piece of film history after one hour since it became mentally unbearable. It is also unbearably boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Terrence Malick; This is in reference to your latest release; 'The Tree of Life". I'm sorry but I lasted only 30 minutes. After which I walked out and got a refund. When we see films, we need to be told a story, NOT hearing the inner mind thoughts of your characters on screen. Tell us what happens. You need to enroll in Robert McKee's "STORY" course and put that into your scripts. Then, we get images of the creation of the Earth? I stood up and said, "I've already seen 2001. What is this?" There was absolutely NOTHING going on and this thing won the Palme D'Or. Now I know why you don't show up to do interviews and let your cast speak of the film for you. You need to get out there and do it yourself. The same thing happened with me and "The New World". I want to be entertained not bored to tears. "Steeerike three, you're out of here!" Signed, A bored film-goer. No More Malick for me. 'Bye'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally didn't like anything about the movie. OK the picture is great but I prefer turning on Nat Geo wild on my 50" Plasma for that. The classical music in my opinion fits awfully to the nice pictures as it gets too much. Add Jessica Chastains character's biblical, nonsense talk and the beautiful images are totally ruined.The problem as I see it is that I don't want someone to throw me everything right in my face, leaving me feeling dump.The religious undertone makes it unbearable for me since I am an atheist and consider religious people, more or less, brainwashed.Director Malick should've killed at least half of his darlings and cut the length to about 1.40. But it would't have saved the movie.I felt bad and honestly like throwing up when leaving the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that speaks to the heart of future generations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the film twice last week (before it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes), and both times it's beauty left me deeply moved. I know now that I will enjoy it countless times again.A Belgian film critic (cynically intended or not) called it a prayer rather than a movie. And maybe it is a prayer, in the shape of a movie. But although the film refers to the bible, it did not feel to me as a sermon or an attempt to turn me into a Christian.I've had a (rather superficial) Christian upbringing and certainly many of the Christian values have survived inside me, but I don't consider myself to be a Christian. In fact, I am more drawn to a Buddhist approach to life, but I wouldn't call myself a Buddhist either. In Buddhism there is no god; it is therefore different from any other 'religion'. This is to say that, strange as it may seem, this film feels for me religious in a Buddhist way. I am not advertising for Buddhism.As the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk recently stated, I believe that the new generation does not turn to religion, but does also not turn it's back to religion: it is looking for it's own spiritual way, without the burden of institutionalized religions.One could say this kind of spirituality is mainly about a sense of awe and wonder about life and the universe (of which many so-called scientists seem to be forsaken), a love of all things, that I believe might just save the planet. It is this kind of love that I feel is magnificently called upon for in this film. It radiates from every image and sound.Therefore, being a film fan for about four decades, I feel this picture transcends cinema: for me it is a great work of love and art. A great many thanks to Terrence Malick and everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people that don't get the movie are probably going to enjoy the next Transformers movie a lot more than this one. This movie does not have a religious agenda. It appeals to anyone who has ever wondered about our origin and I believe its purpose is to start conversations between us. I had a 2 hour conversation with a person I hadn't met before right after the screening and even though our belief systems are completely different, we both found many elements that actually brought us together as human beings and trivialized our religious upbringing. It's a film about all of us and whatever got us here. It doesn't reward the dumb viewer looking to be mindlessly entertained for over two hours. But it has ability to change one's perspective on life and death, nature and grace, and love and hate. Asking anything else from a film like this would be like asking for an "Idiot's Guide" to life itself. Watch it yourself. On a big screen if possible. It's too beautiful to watch on your not-big-enough TV. Form your own opinion. Start conversations with others about what the film did in you...</fullReview>

It was hard for me to watch this film for about two hours. This film is about family. Actually this film story is very difficult for me. I completely couldn't understand what happens in this story. Through this film, just I got it is Mr. O'Brien stared by Brad Pitt is severe and has a heart of stone. If I have such a father, I can't endure to live together. I certainly run away from home. I completely couldn't understand why he is so cruel. In addition, I couldn't understand what this film expresses us. If you watch this film, I recommend you learn some backgrounds about this film before you watch it. I can't say this film is wonderful and I was impressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, this movie has all the components to be a great film,and at the same time had certain moments which played into its downfall to some people and critics. Basically the only aspect i didn't like in the film was the planet earth type imagery that Malick felt compelled to show for some time, when leaving so much good material on the cutting room floor (Malicks forte). All in all i always fast forward that part. Next to that the is film is amazing. The acting is phenomenal, Pitt never disappoints and Chastain is beautiful as ever and is a talent that only comes around once in a while. The cinematography, the natural light, the questions that are raised, crisp editing, beautiful score,good child acting as well as veteran acting, poetic dialogue, the scripts portrayal of family struggle, child upbringing and parenting, are the reasons why i absolutely love this film. If your a fan of all the things i just listed then this is a film for you, one you will watch over and over again.</fullReview>

Jessica Chastain and Brad Pitt's and even the young actors have such a wonderful presence in the film that is almost haunting yet beautiful. The script itself makes the film what it is due to it's emotional depth that all the actors have admitted is the most amazing script they've ever read. It does sadden me that none of the actors were up for an Oscar or even that Malick did not win one, and i do wish the film had more recognition as it is a film i will not be forgetting any time soon. Basically if you understand that this film will be different and you're into interesting and unique films and even art then watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teaching creation to evolutionists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beloved friend of mine recommended "The Tree of Life" to me. Hereby, I didn't watch the movie indiscriminately. Both the perception I have about my friend and the personal appreciation I consider for "Terrence Malick" caused me voraciously sat in front of the screen with extremely high level of expectations.When the movie commenced, after a while -not important exactly when- I felt I was kind of immersed in a strange atmosphere. I'm pretty sure neither were I excited nor infatuated, neither sad nor happy, but I was just abnormally touched. The movie tries to determine an overlapping area of divine, existence, pulchritude, tragedy and happiness which is definitely a tiny region, so I think relatively a few number of people will find the movie pleasant. "The tree of life" is not an intellectual movie. It is not emotional or theological either. In my book, the fundamental purpose of the movie is just to touch your consciousness, to walk you through your garden of memories to your childhood and the whole way back and leaving you wondering at the intersection of medians of triangle of God, life and death. This profound effect of past life which was supposed to be played by "Sean Penn's" appearance - tops ten minutes- in the movie, has been marvelously described by the prominent British female writer "Virginia Woolf" ." the past is beautiful because one never realizes an emotion at the time. It expands later, and thus we don't have complete emotions about the present, only about the past." Woolf has said.Considering Malick's background it seems to me that in some points the movie makes a hopeless gallant effort to teach creation to evolutionists. Paradoxically, I put this next to what "Richard Feynman" - one of the noblest minds of history- has said:" It doesn't seem to me that this fantastically marvelous universe, this tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals, and all the different planets, and all these atoms with all their motions, and so on, all this complicated thing can merely be a stage so that God can watch human beings struggle for good and evil ? which is the view that religion has. The stage is too big for the drama."To put the whole thing in a nutshell, "The tree of life" is a fascinating piece of art which is very difficult to interpret. Somehow like a train of cute pictures passing by. The movie presents an outstanding photography and background music. Moreover,In spite of the fact that two stars -Brad Pitt and Sean Penn - play in the movie, I'm strictly of the opinion that the whole acting job is incredibly performed by three kids and those super names are totally futile. Last but not least, I found "The tree of life" a delightful and inspiring movie which is absolutely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird or art?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is really very hard to say if this movie is a masterpiece or just a short film with random shots from nature documentaries added to it. It is even hard to decide if the movie's good or bad. I can't decide if I liked it or not. Well, by the end, I think I learned to like it, but at the beginning I was like "What the friggin' f_ck is going on here? What's this weird crap?" But then, slowly, I started to realize, that this film is not about the story, nor the characters. It's about feelings and it tells you the meaning of the film, the feelings not with action or dialog, but images. And if that's the case, this movie could even be brilliant.On the other hand, The Tree of Life fails on so many levels. Number one: storytelling. I know it's not supposed to be about the story, as I stated before, but it is helpful if a movie I'm watching is interesting, or at least makes a little bit of sense. Number two: editing. It is so awful! I haven't seen worse editing in in a film in my whole life: it's jumpy, messy and you can't pay attention to the movie because of it. Number three: metaphors. The movie is full of them, making it really hard to understand. I had to keep focusing on these metaphors, I had to think things over constantly, trying to figure out what each aspect meant. And I don't think most of them meant anything at all! Some say this gives a movie depth. I don't think so. The Shining is also full of metaphors, but it is enjoyable as well, unlike The Tree of Life, which is like a weird mass of things about life.Now there's one thing in the movie that's ambivalent. It's also the best and the worst thing in the movie. I'm talking about the photography. At some parts it is really beautiful and nice, but the unnecessary use of the shaky-cam at some points and the way they focused the attention to unimportant things annoyed the hell out of me.The acting is really good in this film. Brad Pitt delivered such a strong character that I hated him throughout the film and I really wanted him to die. Another positive aspect is that with its extremely visual style and subtle music it delivers such strong emotions to the viewers, that people don't want to stand up after the film is finished. If most of us don't really understand the story and the meaning of The Tree of Life, I'm positive, that all of us understand it on an emotional level, and at that, this movie is perfect.I understand the studio took a pretty big risk with this film, and I appreciate that. I also appreciate that the creators tried to make something different for a change, not the same movie we've seen over and over again. I like The Tree of Life as an experimental film. It had many flaws, but it had a great aspect, which, I think, should be used in future films (they way of interpreting the emotions into images, I loved that!).As I said, I have mixed feelings about this film. It had too much from good and bad at the same time! I recommend seeing it for any movie geek, for it is a nice piece of art, but most people won't like it, I think, because it's too damn weird.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretentious, dull, drawn out beyond belief. Part National Geographic documentary - all it required was a David Attenborough voice-over - and largely padding (though I did like the dinosaur special effects). In between all this there is a story, and it is reasonably interesting (the Brad Pitt story, that is. Heaven knows what was going on in the Sean Penn story). However, there is no momentum with this - the drama is drawn out, and interspersed with more pretentious imagery. And then the story ends, anti-climatically. So you feel cheated, because you found one reason to continue to watch the movie, and even that was a dead end.Cut out all the pretense and padding, tighten up the Brad Pitt story and give it an ending with a point, and this would have been a decent, 90-100 minute or so movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bold and Singular Vision: Its idiosyncratic storytelling offers a glimmer of where English-Language Cinema industry could progress.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Terrence Malick's film functions as a conversation between Jack O'Brian (J.O.B) and God as a haggard Sean Penn questions the foundations of his life after personal heartbreak. The film opens magisterially with the biblical quotation Job 38:4: 'Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth?' and an oblique red image. Thus 'The Tree of Life' serves as religious response to the soulless vacuum at the heart of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Douglas Trumball was Effects Supervisor on both films and his photographic effects are once again iconic; his innovative techniques are exemplified by the use of Milk for CGI effects. This origins of the Universe sequence is introduced as a result of Jack's turmoil after the death of his brother, Steve. The impressively realised shots of dinosaurs battling each other for their very existence is hauntingly echoed by Jack's reflection upon when he playfully taunted his now dead brother with a gun. The implication of humanity's similarity to his less apparently civilised ancestor is disturbing with its suggestion that if life throughout time is simply a battle for survival, as part of Jack's father's 'force and will' philosophy, what is the fundamental purpose? The comparison of the macro (the story of the Universe) and the micro (Jack's upbringing) highlights a human life's brevity in comparison to the life of the natural world. Jessica Chastain, who plays Jack's mother and embodies the way of Grace - seeking to live a virtuous life ingratiating oneself with one's natural environment, states about the tree in their garden 'you'll be old before this tree is grown'. The accompanying production design creates a veritable depiction of 1950s Texas. Indeed Malick's eye is as glorious as ever: the blissful images of waterfalls and harmonious father-daughter bonding through nature rival that of the crocodile which opens 'The Thin Red Line'. The film also possesses the vocal lyricism of Malick's previous films with his trademark voice-over technique and multi-narrator style. Chastain, in her breakthrough performance filled with poignantly frail paralinguistic codes, makes opening remarks about existentialist accountability. Yet young Jack, inquisitively played by impressive newcomer Hunter McCracken, shoulders the burden of the narrative responsibility. Jack's stark rumination 'Oh mother, father always you wrestle inside of me, always you will' hauntingly surmises one of the key concepts of the film's thesis: the underlying dichotomy of 'the way of Nature and the way of Grace' are ambivalent phenomena. Tragically, the viewer watches Jack O'Brian, this Job-esque symbol of modern society, despite his best efforts, seemingly inexorably drawn towards the way of Nature. Jack's father, through his insatiable urge for dominance, embodies this way of Nature, encouraging his children to hit him to toughen their resolve. Indeed Pitt delivers one of the finest performances ever committed to the medium; his domineering style with austere kinesics complements the film's introverted tone. Pitt's character is forced to consign himself to playing music at his local church, performing sedentary work, having dreamed of being a concert pianist. Hence the climatic speech he delivers to Jack in an attempt to justify his stringent disciplinarian methods as trying to encourage Jack to be 'strong' and 'his own boss' is one of the most pathos-filled in film history. Nonetheless, the strictly controlled environment means Jack's awe-struck upon encountering less palatable realities like when he first sees suffering (a debilitated war-veteran). The coming-of-age tale serves as both a microcosm of the struggle for complete autonomy and an allegory for the struggle to maintain spiritual direction: leaving the house with the eulogised tree, the titular and overarching symbol of the film, marks Jack's loss of purpose. Analogously, Adam and Eve experience a spiritual void after they are expelled from the Garden of Eden and 'The Tree of Life'. Therefore causes of loss of faith are also discussed as the film has a discursive, engaging tone; Young Jack's suggestion that suffering is the primary source of faith dissipation is left for the viewer to ponder. Thus the film asks what the foundation of religious belief should be: is the father's stoical obedience to his church faith? Or is an approach reliant less on a rigid value system but rather underlying 'love' true belief? This is just one talking-point from a film that poses a question with every image. The manner in which these themes are resolved makes the ending probably the most uplifting ever. Tender hair-rustling shots show young Steve being released down a river as God allows Jack a window to crossover into his more ethereal domain. Steve literally becomes part of the natural world - emblematic of the film's pantheistic as much as theistic ideals. Moreover, witnessing Jessica Chastain humbly cry 'I give him to you, I give you my son', a reworking of Job's 'For the Lord hath giveth and the Lord hath taketh away', is a transcendent moment. The film concludes with the rueful smile of Penn, a restoration to the way of Grace, followed by the reiteration of the enigmatic opening shot, beautifully conveying God's omnipresence. Malick thereby achieves his noble aim of establishing religion, specifically Christianity, as a holistic force of personal nourishment. The film's genesis dates back to the 1970s when Malick conceived 'Project Q' about the universe's origins; the film's ostensible importance for its creator highlights the autobiographical tone- Malick did indeed have a brother die in adulthood; an authoritarian father and Irish mother. Attempting to turn one's personal experiences, regardless of how painful they are, in conjunction with one's cultural interests to articulate any insights into the human condition accumulated along the way is to my mind the definition of art. A refreshing antidote to focus-group malaise, the film is Malick's most ambitious in scope and didactic in tone. Hence it is rewarding to see the film recognised with the 2011 Palme D'Or. A sensational visceral and cerebral journey, a must-see for anyone with an interest in the possibilities of an audio-visual art-form. 'The Tree of Life' is a summation of a life's work: a Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will be straight forward from the start. Either you will love this movie or hate it. If you are any bit intelligent and enjoy artistic approaches to cinematography then this is one of the best ever made. As with most Terrence Malick films, the camera is constantly filming stunning views and angles. This movie is told through its images just as much if not more than the actual dialog. Those who have given this bad reviews interestingly rave over such brainless movies like "fast and the furious". Its no wonder that they thought this spectacular movie was nothing more than a stream of images to them. Malick has put out very few movies through his career but when he does he is always swinging for the homerun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Unless you love, your life will flash by.." (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't subscribe to any school of thought which limits the scope of your enjoyment. I don't watch films and think "This is amazing" simply because it's artsy, or it goes beyond what most people generally see as cinema; just because something is weird, or eccentric, or a little out there, it does not make it good. Sure, there are opinions, but generally there has to be something universal about a film to propel it into greatness. Some things are objective while others are not. So going into a Terrence Malick film like The Tree of Life, you have to just take it for what it is: a work of art. In the same way 2001: A Space Odyssey zips from different times and places and moments in space, The Tree of Life is a stream of consciousness-type film that leaps forward and backwards through time. The film is not supposed to be a linear story from point A to B, but more in the way of how Eisenstein saw montage: image A and image B produce another meaning of C, which is evoked in the viewer. It's a highly subjective journey, but objectively it is a beautifully shot film, which touches on the nature of compassion in our lives, as well as all the way back to dinosaur days; a viewer can't deny the cinematography and effects of the film are absolutely stunning. Whether or not you can enjoy the "plot" of the film doesn't matter in a film like this; if you don't understand what it's about then that's it. That's the purpose of this film is to recreate some sort of semblance of what existing is like. As the quote says, "Unless you love, your life will flash by", and as we see Sean Penn play an older man who appears to be existentially in disrepair, it's easy to understand how quickly time can go by when love is hard to come by; the universe, all the way back to those dinosaurs, is complicated by the way we come together, and how we deal with our interactions in the right way. This is a journey that I highly enjoyed. At times, it would have helped to be a little more linear and concrete, but it's a Malick film, and I find they all seem to have the dreamlike qualities of sleep at times, which is part of the appeal of his films for me. Highly recommended. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For sure, this is one of the best films I have ever seen. I am not so keen on the 2001 Grand Creation of the Earth scenes, but they do put the main section in perspective. Brad Pitt does a great job, as do the 3 boys, the wife (many of the beautiful scenes feature her)... and last but not least Sean Penn. I'm sorry he felt a little disorientated post filming.. I can understand the editing changed his scenes a lot.This film brings back many (childhood) first impressions. It is shot beautifully, with great sensitivity. It can be understood by all... we all struggle in life, and this film is a typical example of such a struggle. In this day and age where people are spoilt rotten and have everything they wish for, it is no wonder the film does not 'register' or make an impression on so many minds.I cannot think of another film which is on such a vast scale, yet which contains minute sensitive details that we can all identify with. What a masterpiece; no doubt too sophisticated for an American audience, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not realise that even though he has been in the film industry for over forty years Oscar nominated director Terrence Malick (Badlands, Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line) has only made five films in his career, this his fifth film was included in a new edition of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was looking forward to it. Basically the story revolves around the life of Jack O'Brien (Sean Penn), now middle aged, he reminisces on his suburban life growing up during the 1950's in Waco, Texas with his parents Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt) and Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) with his two younger brothers R.L. (Laramie Eppler) and Steve (Tye Sheridan). For some hidden reason in Young Jack's (Hunter McCracken) childhood he distanced himself from his parents and the realities of the world, his parents did love him and his brothers, but in different ways, his mother was kind and nurturing and helped them embrace the wonders of the world, but his father he found it difficult to bond due to his strict rules, his intolerance of disobedient behaviour and his temper tantrums. These actions by Mr. O'Brien caused many emotions to conflict within him, making him question his reason for living, the meaning of life and what he wants to do with his life, and middle aged Jack is also reflecting on the tragic of R.L. was killed at age nineteen while serving on military duty, but when he has images of death he is reunited with those dead that he cares for, included his brother and his father appearing happy. Also starring Fiona Shaw as Grandmother, Irene Bedard as Messenger, Joanna Going as Jack's Wife, Kimberly Whalen as Mrs. Brown, Jackson Hurst as Uncle Ray and Crystal Mantecon as Elisa. Pitt proves himself really dramatic as the strict father, Penn hardly gets anything to do apart from look longingly into the sky, as well as seeing the domestic story going there is also some fascinating beginning of the world sights, such as the start of life ? like with a dinosaur, a strange breakaway, but actually it fits into the idea of the questioning of life, and the visuals used are a sure way to keep you engaged, an interesting fantasy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Motion Picture of the Year. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a beautiful and wonderful film this is!But as I read the reviews, it is clear they have missed a great deal.The story is simple and told mostly through imagery. Relationships between the characters take place in how they look at each other, the expressions on their faces. Terence Malick has done a masterful job. His ability to capture the inner depths of children, the joys and difficulties of their lives, is stunning, and to show how deeply those bonds between father and son, mother and child, brother and brother...really go, well beyond the fragility of this life. Indeed, the entire creation's culmination is in the love between brother and brother, father and son, mother and son, wife and husband....And in loss these culminate in the ultimate connection...prayer.Comparisons to Kubrick and to Robert Wise's Star Trek the Movie are appropriate except that here Malick adds the human soul and compassion at a level well beyond Kubrick, though attempted in Star Trek. This film has an even more beautiful sentiment. And Malick has gotten the soul of his actors on film. Brad Pitt does a masterful job, so understated and meaningful. He gives the other actors the center stage, constantly puts them in the center, especially the children. What a generous and fine actor he is!...but his performance thunders with truth when he whispers in prayer to God 'I'm ashamed I wasted time caring about foolish things when so much beauty was going on around me.....I am nothing.'The story begins with a very successful and hardworking architect (Penn) who, in a brief conversation with his own father on the phone, reveals his grief over a lost brother from years ago. That grief has become part of who he is, how he carries himself, how we works, walks and even looks. Then we are taken back to scenes of their life as children growing up, and the deep love of both of their parents, however flawed each was. Mom, a little naive and child like herself; Dad, a bit harsh, but deeply in love with his kids.Finally, the architect has an epiphany, a vision of heaven, where angels bring us to the ones we have lost for reunion, and finally, help each of us let go, and ourselves take that walk beyond. The man awakens from his vision, looking around the modern world with surprise, and a small grin. He understands.It's just that simple. There is just a deeper spiritual layer as well. We see the stunning creation come into being, as we hear the silent prayers and thoughts of the lead characters...Why am I here? And why did he die? And the wonderful conclusion of the creation shots are the baby brothers each laying upon their mothers chest sleeping soundly: The purpose is that simple: this entire creation exists to bring us to that very moment of prayer!In one sequence we see a dinosaur showing compassion on another injured dinosaur, and if you look closely, you will see that it takes place on the same river the boys play together on later in the film, in their family filled with compassion. The hardships of their life lead them to humility, and that to prayer. That is the purpose of the creation.Never on film has that connection been made to strongly and so beautifully, so stunningly, if silently.People who know little of prayer will have no comprehension of what they are watching or hearing. But this film isn't for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Felt like I was watching one of those cologne/perfume commercials composed of a series of eye-catching images, human faces and classical music. After about ten minutes of this I started to get annoyed. After twenty minutes, I just wanted it to end. I did not care about these characters at all because I knew nothing about them. This was not a movie, this was a traveling art exhibit. Apparently, a lot of people enjoyed it. For me, a movie is about characters, and it is worth watching because the dialogue and acting are compelling. This movie has been likened to 2001: A Space Odyssey. While there are some similarities, in 2001 there was enough dialogue and the scenes were long enough for me to care about the actors, even HAL. Furthermore, 2001 was a futuristic film in which the grand cinematography was useful in drawing me into the setting - making it believable and helping me experience it. In Family Tree the grand cinematography was not a tool to convey the story, it was the story. The characters were the tool - a vehicle for stringing together eye-catching video segments, one after another, ad nauseam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrence Malick is no Tarkovsky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Suddenly, I found myself standing at the door of a room the keys of which had, until then, never been given to me. It was a room I had always wanted to enter and where he was moving freely and fully at ease. I felt encouraged and stimulated: someone was expressing what I had always wanted to say without knowing how.' So said Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman, of his first encounter with the work of Andrei Tarkovsky, the Russian film director who, as Bergman put it, 'invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream'. It is unlikely anyone familiar with Tarkovsky's work could watch the Oscar 2012 Best Picture nominee The Tree of Life and say its director, Terrence Malick, has accomplished a similar feat. Malick does not possess the keys to the room that Tarkovsky ? and, indeed, Bergman ? confidently created their works in. But he is at least trying to speak these masters' language, aspiring to reflect and present to us the kind of poetic vision they had. And in a climate where any attempt to provide depth of insight into the human condition is likely to be booed (as The Tree of Life was at Cannes), those artists who do strive towards this 'lofty' goal should be commended. There's no question that Malick's film is ambitious. It's a sweeping attempt to present the audience with the birth and end of the universe, with the emergence and maturity of life on Earth, and with the full palette of human emotions, all encapsulated by the experiences of a young family living in Texas in the 1950s. Many, from film critic Roger Ebert to actor Robert De Niro, have praised Malick's ambition accordingly. But is ambition enough to make a great movie? The Tree of Life has hardly gone unnoticed. Apart from the Oscar nomination, it also won the Palme D'Or at Cannes last year, despite the audience's booing. But critics have been as likely to gush about what sets The Tree of Life apart from the standard Hollywood fare ('not for this director the dreadnought snarls of Nickelback, but extracts of Couperin, Berlioz, Brahms, Mahler and Bach', said one) than about what actually makes it a great film on its own terms. Indeed, you could detect a faint sense of fear among critics that if the flaws in the film are acknowledged and it is seen as anything less than a revolutionary masterpiece, then audiences won't give this abstract epic the benefit of the doubt and will avoid it. The implication is often that this would be a great loss because we'd miss out on something that would be good for our souls to watch. Well, compared to Malick's earlier work The Thin Red Line, notorious for its long scenes of wind blowing through grass, The Tree of Life is actually a remarkably impatient film. Many of the scenes are short and fragmented, pared down almost to the absolute minimum needed to convey a meaning. In one scene, Mr O'Brien (Brad Pitt), the father in the young Texan family, stares wondrously at his newly-born son's foot. Then, the plot lurches restlessly on, alongside a soundtrack of symphonies and vague philosophical mumblings from the cast. Not content with simply presenting us with the experiences of the family, Malick takes us through a kaleidoscopic journey from the birth of time. Most of this is entirely unnecessary. In trying to show us literally everything, Malick tries far too hard. He ends up losing control and undermining, rather than adding to, the themes he wants to explore. It makes you want to shout at the screen, 'slow down and give our imaginations some credit!' Malick's vast array of CGI worlds, galaxies and nebulae appear flat, devoid of any depth of meaning, almost the opposite of poetic. It's a real shame as, among the fragments of events and experiences Malick presents us with there are some aspects of human relationships here that are rarely captured on film. Leaving aside the death of one of the brothers and the tense father-son relationships, which can lead you to think that Malick gained script ideas from sessions with a psychoanalyst, Malick gets the best out of his actors. Particularly good is Hunter McCracken as the young Jack. He brilliantly portrays the struggle for dominance, independence and control experienced by young boys and the ways this leads them to develop a sense of morality, brotherhood and dependency. A scene where Jack betrays the trust of his brother through shooting his fingertip with a pellet gun, and the aftermath showing Jack's growing sense of regret, stands out. But such moments are suffocated by Malick's desire to present us with the complete wonders of the universe. Sometimes this can go terribly wrong,like when he shows a wounded dinosaur being spared by another in some bizarre, prehistoric exhibition of compassion. This attempt to suggest that grace existed even in dinosaurs, rather than being a unique characteristic of humanity, makes Malick's understanding of the world seem facile. This single instance makes you doubt the profundity of the ideas he is trying to get across in general. In a film such as this, where a leap of faith is required from the audiences to make them trust that there is method in the director's apparent madness, such a lapse into Disneyesque anthropomorphism can be terminal. The Tree of Life, being fragmented, shows frustrating glimpses of more impressive work Malick could have achieved if he'd slowed down, put the CGI to the side and furthered the narrative of the Texan family living in the Fifties.It gives the impression of reluctance, perhaps shyness, to bare his soul in such a way without distracting his audiences from it. Exploring the relationships between the characters throughout the film would have made more effective use of the remarkable cast, could have been equally ambitious and might just have created a better film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie The Thin Red Line was amazing - I'm adding the book to my reading list as I type this. 2001 Space Odyssey was also amazing....but borrowing from them both and/or squeezing them both together with a sprinkling of Sean Penn and Brad Pitt and a dash of CGI dinosaur is not enough to impress. Random beautiful images, whispered narration, the theme of death and classical music does not automatically a great movie make. "A period piece"? What period? The period before time began? The period after death? Before birth? Wow. Deep.I may never understand..and I won't care. Maybe this was a very personal project of Mr . Malick; a story that needed telling in a particular way whether the viewer finds it interesting or not. Some movies are like that - and they work...this one doesn't. It comes across as a pretentious, condescending, masturbatory piece of Hollywood fluff that the viewer feels like they're meant to like because of big names and a heavy storyline. Oh,the tension.Nice camera-work, though..and Pitt's pretty convincing as a heavy-handed father.In the end, switched off the monitor and watched the fish tank instead because it was faster and more interesting. This movie needed neither dinosaurs nor spinning nebulae.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie tackles not just a global, but a cosmic theme. Yet, the vehicle used in very time-region specific: traditional small town America in the 50s. The fact that this can generate such universal appeal to allow it to win the Palme d'Or attests to its success.Starting with a heart-wrenching scene showing how each of the parents (Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain) receive the news of the death of their 19-year-old eldest son, the movie flashes back to, would you know, Big Bang and follows the evolution of the human species through molecular ocean life to dinosaurs, to the birth of the third child of the protagonist family. Anchoring on the reflections of the second son in present days, a successful architect (Sean Penn), the flashback continues through coming of age of the three brother, focusing on the bond between the two older ones.This is really not much of a plot as the movie is character, idea and emotion driven. The opening scenes say much ? how in complete silence (the mother reads the telegram and the father's telephone conversation inaudible behind noises) the parent's shock and agony upon hearing the devastating news. What follows is another silently eloquent scene showing first the mother roaming purposelessly on the quiet road in front of their quiet suburban home. As the camera moves to place her at the centre of the frame, the father appears at the far back and moves closer and closer to her to give comfort.The parent's characters are tenderly depicted. Father's authoritative nature is typical of the period but he is not embarrassed about showing affection to his sons in public. The mother's loving gentleness offers a good balance and she is even playful (insert ice into the boy's pyjamas to wake them. Pitt and Chastain are simply wonderful. The movie ends with a familiar-looking surreal scene with Penn in a sort of after-life vision.</fullReview>

The other part that stayed until the end were just wondering what was that. We tried to tie up the plot and realize what we've just been watched but however you try to understand it, it just doesn't come to make any sense. I'm so sorry for the negative words I wrote, but I think there are another ways to make a SENSIBLE movie for the meaning of life and which can reach easily the audience.

		<shortDescription>Sloggish and tiresome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a slog. At a little under three hours it would take a master filmmaker to avoid stretching my patience over such a long amount of time--a filmmaker like Stanley Kubrick, whose "2001: A Space Odyssey" is borrowed from liberally by director Terrence Malick, however inefficiently; there are long periods without dialogue, which I understand turns off many viewers immediately. 2001 is one of my favorite movies, so I tried to keep an open mind during these stretches. I thought of it as a marathon, with its payoff at the end. For me, at least, the payoff didn't come: Malick's 'style', for those who aren't familiar--and I definitely wasn't, having never heard the name before and watching the movie based on praise from Roger Ebert and Cannes--is to create very distinct, separate segments of a movie, with each of those segments running together with an active, moving camera and one drawn out thread of focus on one character or another, often being severed abruptly when that segment ends. You might be wondering why I haven't even mentioned what this movie is about. The answer is because I don't know myself. The IMDb summary does as good a job as I could. Without a plot, do we have a movie? We certainly don't have a story, and I don't know about you, but that seems like a must if I'm going to take the three hours of my time to watch this creation.So if it's not a movie, what is it? It's everything else that goes into a movie, minus the plot: the acting*, music, especially the cinematography are all fantastic and masterful.A screensaver. That's what this beast is. A long, wonderfully rendered, unspeakably expensive screensaver that moves and speaks (in non- sequiturs, of course). To me, that's not worth your time or money.*Oh, yes, and if you're seeing this because you're a fan of Sean Penn, don't bother because he's in it for literally five minutes and all he does is walk around with a big dumb look on his face.</fullReview>

Making them watch this won't do you any favours, you'll probably probably end up very lonely.I can't work out if it would be better to turn the picture off and listen to the music, or turn the music off and watch the nice pictures... the problem is either way, the depressed people keep coming back into it . . .Would be better with Elton John singing Circle of Life.There is a story line, it's pretty morose and it's also quite disjoint, better have another glass of wine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>to begin: yes the visuals are out-of-sight gorgeous. both the natural shots and the special effects. and, yes, it's an over-the-top pretentious, self-indulgent movie that purports to deal with ultimate meaning-of-life questions and ends up being simply borrrring.I guess one could say that there are two ways to deal with these issues of faith, god, meaning of life, etc. One is analytical, works by means of words, logic, etc. (think Aristotle, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Sartre and many more philosophers), while the other is transcendental and works by means of faith, symbols, etc because it cannot be expressed in words -- much less dealt with by logic (think of peyote cults and, forgive me, some of the extremes of the Catholic Church). This movie is a daring experiment in the second way. Perhaps for some of those who are already there, who have faith in these inherently ambiguous ideas, it's an audio-visual expression that may or may not come close to their own dream images. But for at least one person who isn't there -- guess who -- it's kitsch, trash in a beautiful dress, just a mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American imagination and the meaning of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are all conditioned by our culture. When this American director tries hard to explore the deeper meaning of life, he readily turns to Lord and Dinosaur. Not much social conditions of the particular time and space was addressed or referred to in order to understand human feelings of life and love. Indeed, religious beliefs - inevitably Christian ones here - are one important factor in shaping people's perspectives and emotions. However, the director doesn't deal it well IMHO. The music, the bible citations and inspirations are superficial, overwhelming, and imposing. As to dinosaurs and things like that, they are not relevant to ordinary people lives in the movie. Unfortunately the director probably grew up and lives in the era of dinosaur movies that became the easy cultural sources he could draw metaphors from.I don't mind a movie without clear plots. But I expected to see people - real ordinary people in everyday human conditions that they have to struggle with and how they make sense of their life in a particular identifiable cultural and historical moment.The young actors are good. One star for them. It could have been a touching story about a young boy's troubling development - emotionally and sexually - and his relationship with other family members.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Tree of Life. I had great expectations for this one. But I've had one of the biggest disappointments of my life. Saturating subjects, extremely long and slow, with a lot of plot lacking. It's not about the greatness in little miracles in a beautiful cinematography, as the defendors of this crap stand. It's about the pretension to be transcendental. The Tree of Life won't persist in time. It will be soon forgotten as a rough, strange and deliberately blurry attempt of a metaphysical movie. So, we have no plot, we merely have some good acting-- Sean Penn is a wandering spirit who hasn't clear statements though I liked Brad Pitt (poor Brad, going from Benji Button to Tree of Life spiralling down his acting talents). I couldn't understand the praying along the film. It has no sense at all. Seems like someone opened a Bible in a random page and said two or three lines that made sort of good sense. Wrong thing to do. It is known that Terrence Malick has a particular way of filming. I can understand that. But seeing kaleidoscopes in the screen, the big bang, the birth of man, and hours and hours of beautiful nature footage is kind of an underestimation to me as a viewer. Mister Malick; I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT DO YOU MEAN IN THE FIRST 3 MINUTES. But there's some time to move forward in regards of the continuity and SENSE of the plot. If I want to see how beautiful nature is, should I keep on studying biology. I love our human condition (in fact I'm a man who loves nature and science films) but this hybrid thing Malick delivered is too much for me. I came for an artistic and intelligent, deep movie, but I saw cells, dinosaurs, quantum mechanics, stroboscopes, faunae and florae and mitochondria moving for an hour at least. And of course, we interrogate our Creator about the bad things in life despite the miracles and the beauty in human condition. But in the style of HAL 1000. Almost mumbling and drooling repeatedly, like the thing we are not: robots. Malick wanted to integrate the human condition and the surroundings of that, and ended mechanizing it. I tended to think as the movie went by, that its director said to me: "Hey! Look at me! I'm a deep and profound director, am I not?"So we are kind of wandering images with no points, no conclusions, only questions and suffering (and lots and lots of mitochondria)? I can't understand a bit of this film. And I don't think I'm not qualified for that as a cinema lover, human condition-lover, pro-greenpeace, anticapitalist and spiritual person I consider myself. Even if you want, I like intellectual movies rather than popcorn ones. But still... Tree of Life made me laugh sometimes on the naive and pseudo-phylosophical statements.I still seeing Sean Penn wandering with no point, like he is a senseless ghost. And mitochondria.. lots and lots of mitochondria.A well deserved 1 out of 10. The 1 is for the beautiful collection of screen savers I saw in the film.Cheers from Argentina.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why, when some ambitious, existential movie comes out, do the professional critics feel they have to fawn over it? Does the vagueness of such movies drive them to pretend that they "get it" for fear they will be the ones who don't seem to "get it?" when everybody else acts like they've been privy to some incredible, artistic, and spiritual insight? Yes, the cinematography is good and I enjoyed the acting, especially the main kid, but no, the movie is not particularly a good movie. It starts out slow and continues to move along at that same pace for nearly the entire move. Even Sean Penn admitted that while "The screenplay (was) the most magnificent one that I've ever read...I couldn't find that same emotion on screen." However, after reading many reviews, it's almost a guarantee that at least some people will still connect with this film and you may be one of them. To me, though, this is the kind of film that you can multitask to. So if you feel like you need to see The Tree of Life because you want to be "in the know," then I suggest that you watch it at home, have a Plan B, like keep your iPad handy, and when you find yourself getting bored, you can fire up Angry Birds while keeping one eye peeled to the screen. If you do that, you likely won't be so upset when you realize you wasted two hours and forty minutes of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give this film a 7 because I love Terrence Malick's films. I also gave it a 7 because I thought it was disappointing overall and thats why he didn't get a 10. This is a synopsis IMDb wrote of this film, read this:"The impressionistic story of a Texas family in the 1950s. The film follows the life journey of the eldest son, Jack, through the innocence of childhood to his disillusioned adult years as he tries to reconcile a complicated relationship with his father (Brad Pitt). Jack (played as an adult by Sean Penn) finds himself a lost soul in the modern world, seeking answers to the origins and meaning of life while questioning the existence of faith."So first the Bad:I am a reasonably intelligent man, understand these art-sy films fairly well and for the life of me could not bridge these gaps. Terrence usually makes his films that reflect the human condition juxtapose with nature. I saw these correlations however, I couldn't find the connections. The synopsis was what I was expected, but my overall interpretation was foggy, because I couldn't see the message the film.Now the Good: As always, the film was beautiful to watch, a bunch of beautiful scenes placed beautifully together. So the film was aesthetically please to look at. Brad Pitt, I feel, is getting better and better as an actor and he was phenomenal in this film as were the children in this film. The "meaning of life" part in the film was my favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Extensive and vivid exploration of our existence..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American screenwriter, producer and director Terrence Malick's fifth feature film which he wrote, is an American production which was shot on locations in USA, Chile, Italy and Iceland. It premiered In competition at the 64th Cannes International Film Festival in 2011 and was produced by producers Dede Gardner, Bill Pohlad, Brad Pitt, Grant Hill and Sarah Green. It tells the story about the American family O'Brien who's good and quiet life in a Texas suburb during the 1950s, is disrupted by the eldest son's confrontation with his own adolescence. This philosophical, religious and scientific journey through time and mind is a surreal and evangelical allegory, a family portrayal, a depiction of childhood, a period piece, an existentialistic drama, an all-embracing and retrospective study of character and an atypical science-fiction film which renders an extensive and vivid exploration of our existence. Merging various voice-over narrations with ethereal music from French composer Alexandre Desplat, a fragmented narrative structure and versatile camera movements, this nuanced, experimental and symbolic piece of modern cinema is notable for it's fine editing, production design by American production designer, art director and director Jack Fisk and cinematography by Mexican cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. This character-driven epic about the loss of innocence, the past, the present, the future, grief, faith and family relations, is a profoundly moving fictional tale from a visionary and impressionistic filmmaker who correlates and marks the differences between human kind and nature in his particular way.American actor and producer Brad Pitt, in yet another unconventional role and one of his greatest acting performances, and Jessica Chastain who expresses more with her body language than with words, is notable in the unorthodox role as Mrs. O'Brien. A role certainly as enigmatic and somewhat similar to Australian actress Miranda Otto's character in "The Thin Red Line". At the center of the story is Jack who is played by American actor, screenwriter and director Sean Penn as an adult and as the young Jack by Hunter McCracken in his debut feature film role, an impressive acting performance in the demanding role as the eldest son who is torn between a father and mother who has very different ways of showing their affection. This indelible and life-affirming fable which makes it's mark in cinema history gained, among numerous other awards, the Palme d'Or at the 64th Cannes Film Festival in 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phoney and affected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I read the other reviews, and still think this movie with whispering thoughts, grey scenes, and unsubstantiated pouting faces was way to pushy. Nothing subtle. How this won the Cannes is my concern. Where's the beauty when the director has pushed his way into every scene in the sound, dialog, and visuals. So brusque and effort full. I was about to be sick after ten Brad Pitt scenes with that affected, Robert Redfordesque jowl he's adopted for effect. Sean Penn did not sell that role. He seemed more Sean than the role. I will forget this movie, as the cinematic world will. If you need a Brad Pitt fix see 13 Monkeys. For Sean Penn...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thank this wonderful team of photographers for the stunning shots they took. This is the only good thing I can say about this one. I can't even call it movie because I didn't know what exactly this was, probably a wannabe fantasy of meditation that failed BIG time. The script is far too flat to be inspirational or meditative. The length is not justifiable! Half of the frame actually can be deleted because they don't add any value to the plot. The same applies on the script. Unfortunately I HATE IT, and was so glad to read some of reviews and find out that a lot of viewers agreed on how unsuccessful this tentative was!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3, just because of beautiful cinematography.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't know where to start this review...I was very skeptic, because Malick's movies never really had impact on me. This movie has no plot, it is completely non linear and some parts should really be shortened. As for pros, I would say that i was really stunned with the images coming on screen. Terrence really showed us some spectacular shots, and that's one of the reasons I can't give this movie a 1. Also, the kid that plays role of Jack did an amazing job. It's very hard to deliver such a performance with just a couple of lines. The bottom line is- completely abstract and not to be watched just for fun. You have to dig deep for this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would expect nothing less from a generation of short attention spans. The need to have instant gratification was never more apparent as witnessed by the exodus of viewers mid film who chose their selfish needs ahead of others by disturbing us of a higher understanding from enjoying a master work of art. A completely original piece of cinema way ahead of it's time. Beautifully shot and acted. For those of you who feel the need to understand something without allowing it to be absorbed and pondered then perhaps you can still catch "Harold and Kumar". This is an adult film intended for viewers looking for something other than the formulaic pablum usually offered by the big studios.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious artsy movie but still worth seeing once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a artistic movie that has both grace and nature in it. When it comes to artistic movies it's usually hit or miss. And I must say this is a artistic film that I for the most part like and didn't really like, I guess it was in the middle and yet it still sort of got me immersed. Now I don't agree on some of the message behind this movie. But overall this is a artfully well made film that is worth a watch. This is a movie that doesn't just go with the artistic camera approach but it also has artistic substance to some degree. I personally think Brad Pitt is a good actor and enjoyed watching his performance in a lot of his movies. It just stands out and sometimes memorable, and can also be entertaining to watch. I just get the feeling some critics bash on actors or actress that are good looking when they can actually act sometimes. Anyways his performance was good, not as memorable as his other movies but still good. But I still can't shake off the feeling that a bunch of other actors could have easily played his part good as well. It's basically a artistic movie that is worth investing your time for at least one watch. The imagery also plays a big part in the film and is actually effective, although it can seem like something from the discovery channel. But at least it plays a part with the story and not just for artistic effect. Not that I agree with the imagery that is portrayed in the movie. But I usually don't make opinions about a film because of it's own opinions. Except maybe when it goes in a really really nihilistic to the extreme way, where it's very offensive that really bash on other people's beliefs in a very rude way. The musical score in this is simply superb and is easily one of the best part about this movie. Now this isn't the greatest artistic movie I seen and isn't for everyone, actually I can see why some audiences will dislike this movie and not because of the message either. But it's a nicely crafted movie that has a decent combination of grace and nature. The movie can be unconventional at times and also pretentious but like I said I still think it's a movie that is worth a watch. But really isn't a film for everyone and I can see why some will like it and some won't. I probably won't be seeing this movie again, but sort of glad I saw it.6.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick has finally made his Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I saw the trailer and heard of the buzz for The Tree of Life many months ago I realized that I had never seen a Terrence Malick film before. Of course, for four years now I have been trying to become a film buff so I decided to see all of his four previous feature films. I liked his style, and of course they all had great cinematography. However, I was never in love with any of them. Badlands had his best- developed characters, but I felt as if the plot gave up on that film a little bit. I still really like it a lot, but can't help but feel disappointed in it, even after my rewatch of it. Days of Heaven must be the film from his I like the most? some of the best cinematography I had ever seen. The plot was more effective here, but unlike Badlands, I felt as if while there was a better plot here the characters brought it down- to me they were pretty weak. But the film's visual look and narration were probably his best and his strongest suit therefore the one I liked the most. Both The Thin Red Line and The New World had some strong aspects but as a whole they both let me down a lot, and to me stand as only 'OK' films despite their ambitions. So here I come to watch The Tree of Life. I had an idea of Malick's style, but here he finally puts together that style with powerful themes and story to what I consider his only Masterpiece to date.I wasn't too worried about the film's opening. I mean in the past both Badlands and Days of Heaven had great openings which didn't translate throughout the entire film. Here, I kind of stopped thinking about his past films and was engaged throughout. Sure, one can call it from the opening scene 'pretentious' but only at times do you truly wonder 'What DOES it mean to be pretentious'? For all of the big blockbuster films ever year, not many films nowadays have a truly epic feel to them. This did, and not because it had grand special effects or anything. The scope of it is incredibly large, as some could already know. The way it starts off, then to the cut to Sean Penn to the transitions of the world's creation to the era that came before us, it was all done beautifully. Not once did these scenes feel like they didn't belong, which is very hard to do. Sometimes some scenes are so visually-impressive that they don't feel as if they belong, but this entire film never crossed the line. That is a strong feat to do, especially for me to say so. The entire film could have easily, and I mean it, EASILY, turned into something that I would consider pretentious, or maybe too 'out there' or maybe too showy. But alas it didn't, nor any scene. The cinematography was incredible, the music fit the film perfectly, and never once did I question the editing. Of course, one knows how much skill was put into the technical aspects of the film. But that wasn't what made the film what it is. Well it is in fact, because the technical elements came together and gave the story its power. I don't usually try to watch films that involve whole families or kids, or even love them. I don't usually connect deeply with films with life meanings that are uplifting in their transcendence. Why? That's just me. I just don't, but this film hit on a strong personal level. I could resonate the eldest boy, with how he felt, with how his brothers and parents felt. I don't consider Malick an "actor's" director, but here the performances are nothing short of superb. The faces of the kids hold so much on screen in terms of conveying the narrative, and both Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain are wonderful as well. Some people seem surprised by Pitt, but I ask why? To me he has proved the talent that is in him time and time again. I also want to say that here the narration has never been better, for the simple reason of how it was used. We have different characters speaking, and not all the time, just when it fits the most.I don't want to make the review unable to fit on IMDb so I am going to end it here. Everything that I had said Malick had never connected me with, here he finally does. Ambition is never this high in a film, and its rare. For that alone it should be congratulated. If there has been another film this epic and ambitious in recent years then I surely haven't heard of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great in many respects, but completely fails to engage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing much of the rave reviews, The Tree of Life was rather disappointing. There were, of course, many great things about this movie: It had very poetic and thought-provoking messages, the cinematography was amazing, and the director did an amazing job giving us a sense of childhood in the 1950s suburbs.The problem with the movie is that it completely failed to engage its audience. There was neither a story nor a character we could really cling to, and that makes for a long 2.25 hours. While people often blame the laziness of American audiences for demanding engaging stories, I'm of the opinion that it's a failure on the part of the writer and director. Take a look at 2001 or, to take a more recent example, Inception. Those movies are both engaging and thought-provoking.In The Tree of Life we get to know a family, true, but only vaguely. Perhaps those born in the era or those with similar family dynamics will relate to the characters more, but this doesn't help me (or most audiences) very much. So while I enjoyed the movie on one level, it was still ultimately a boring film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Tree of Life is a film I cannot recommend to anyone except religious fanatics. I have never seen a film waste so much time trying to explain evolution without a word. It basically stopped a story 20 minutes into film to go on a Malick ego trip.Brad Pitt and the child actors did what they could to show middle income and strict upbringing in the 1950's. Malick had a good movie within his grasp and left it on the editing room floor.Sean Penn was lost and wasted in this film and by his own admission had no idea what Malick expected or was striving for in this movie. I really was looking forward to seeing this film but it was so convoluted and bogged down by Malick's vision that it sank under the weight he created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ontogeny recapitulates Cosmogony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An audacious piece of movie-making, Tree of Life resists easy conventions of narrative and dialog to create a film simultaneously brilliant and banal. Its meaning is conveyed by images, lighting, camera movement and editing, and these elements are usually more important than either the acting bits or the the actors' words. This results in a movie of poetic images, loosely tied to a Manichaean conflict between Nature and Grace, linked even more loosely to the biblical Book of Job. Curiously, the visual archetypes which preoccupy Malik seem more pagan than Judaeo-Christian. In particular, the sun seems to function as a sort of solar-cult motif for the director. (When the sun appears in the story set in the 50s or in the present, it's almost always shot to make the rays flare as a sort of stylized icon.) The recurrent shot of heavy sunflowers, pregnant with meaning as well as seeds, seems transposed in color from Dovzhenko. There are also echoes here of Tarkovsky, Kubrick and of Fellini, especially towards the end when adult Jack steps through the open doorway to make peace with his memories. Whether the human story supports, reflects or indeed enriches through association all this pretty but cosmically-clichéd imagery is the gnawing question that remains unresolved in this viewer's mind. What does endure are vivid glimpses into our characters' lives, especially the brothers' experiences of trust, love, resentment and fear growing up in a household with a stern father and meek but loving mother. Tree of Life is a flawed masterpiece, because the brilliance and seeming-randomness of the scenes of small town life in 1950s Texas are unimaginable without the lovely but ponderous profusion of images of cosmic creation and evolution which make up the rest of the movie. Ironically the visual upheaval of creation seems more stillborn and far less vital than the quietly human scale of the acted half of the movie. The result is that the volcanoes, nebulae, stellar clouds, eclipses and solar flares fly off into a parallel universe of director's conceit, and can't be brought organically to work with the human story. Still, a flawed non-linear cinematic masterpiece is better to me than any conventional narrative film. On that basis alone, Tree of Life is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't originally planned on seeing this movie for the simple fact that the trailer did not entice me and make want to rush out to go see it. However, when the reviews came in from the critics, they were all positive, though there were the haters who could not understand what the movie was about and trying to portray. Fascinated by the amount of different views on the movie, I went in with an open mind ready to be amazed and or confused. Terrence Malick is not known for making very many films in his lifetime, but the films he has made are ingrained in film history and are known by all or at least all of his fans. He is known for making visually striking movies that make the viewer think and his films have several themes spread throughout that depending on the person, one can relate to. This is a very long movie clocking in at nearly 2hr 30 min. For an action movie, a run time like this can pass relatively quick; but for a movie that has no action and is very story and character driven it does feel long and at time drags to the point where you are fidgeting in your seat wondering when something is actually going to happen. The movie has three separate things going on and 2 main story line's. The film inter-cuts throughout from a family in the Texas suburb, random shots of nature and the big bang, and finally we spend time with Sean Penn's character who is an architect who now middle-aged cannot stop thinking about his brothers death which happened as a child. For the most part, I understood what was going on and I could relate to what was happening in the family what with the kids growing up and learning lessons. Brad Pitt's character is portrayed as the force of nature that wants his boys to succeed and not daydream about things that are not reality. The mother played brilliantly by Jessica Chastain is more in the form of grace and teaches the kids about god and all he does. This movie is not for everyone, and it has a fare chance at being nominated for best picture of the year, and Malick for best director. I didn't understand certain parts toward the end and certain ideals portrayed I did not believe in. Overall though, if you have patience and enjoy thought provoking films, this is one worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious, yet strangely wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1968, I struggled to comprehend the meaning of "2001: A Space Odyssey", but it 'only' covered the history of humankind and at least it had some dialogue and a linear narrative - although the ending was really obscure and I only really understood it when I read the novel.When it comes to "The Tree Of Life", we have a whole new level of bewilderment: it kind of embraces the history of the universe, although we only really know that from the reviewers who had the benefit of media briefings; there is virtually no real dialogue with most of the speech in the form of mumbled voice-overs veering between banality and bathos; and the narrative line is like a zig-zag, jumping from the extinction of the dinosaurs to a flip-flop between the 1950s and the present and a final scene that could be in any place and time. I think you get the picture ...It is no wonder that at the Cannes Film Festival "The Tree Of Life" both won won the Palm d'Or and attracted hoots of derision. Neither reaction will have fazed writer and director Terrence Malick who occupies his own parallel universe. This is a man who moves at a pace which is more glacial than galloping, so that this is only his fifth film in 40 years and, at this rate, the 67 year old may not have many more creations to offer.The plot ? such as there is one ? is simply told. The O'Briens are a pretty typical American family of the post-war years living in Waco, Texas: a repressive, disciplinarian father (a mature performance from Brad Pitt), an ethereal stay-at-home mother (Jessica Chastain), and three boys growing up in a small town where nothing much happens. But, aged 19, the middle boy is killed in circumstances which are never explained.So at one level this is work about the meaning or the meaningless of life with the pain of one family set in the context of all time and all space. At another level. I'm convinced that this is a deeply autobiographical work: Malik grew up in Waco, his brother committed suicide, and he is a man of Christan faith.If the work sounds pretentious and opaque, it is. But it is audaciously ambitious and it is full of stunning imagery, magnificent photography, dazzling camera work and wonderful classical music. I'm pleased I saw it, I would see it again, but this is not a particular tree that everyone will want to climb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing "The Tree of Life", one thing is quite clear: Terrence Malick likes (1) Stanley Kubrick, (2) Federico Fellini, and (3) a lot of perfume commercial directors. But, mostly (3). Though not completely free of life, "The Tree of Life" plays as an extended perfume commercial, where beautiful people are walking in beautiful locations, and there are mystical sentences (or fragments of them) are uttered in a breathy voice- over, signifying some deep, mystical sense. Except that CK commercials do it in under one minute (and probably signify more meaning). Terrence Malick's reputation as the world's best perfume commercial director is likely to be solidified with his forthcoming "To The Wonder".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the most pretentious film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I want to say is: What a worthless piece of cinematic garbage. The way I interpret this movie is as follows: it is the cinematic version of the Sokal affair: the director was testing the credibility of movie critics. He just gave them some random pseudo artistic drivel to test whether movie critics would fall for his "vision", they did. This movie basically shows how intellectually bankrupt mainstream movie critics are. It looks exactly like a satire of a film movie critics like and the public doesn't. Also movie critics, you should learn that films are not philosophy papers: if one wants really smart stuff, stop watching films! Try picking up some serious stuff instead.I watch movies for the same reason that I read novels and listen to music: because they induce emotions. I do not watch movies that "make you think", that's because for someone who has read the likes of Plato, Einstein and Hayek (yes, the "right wing economist and political thinker"), almost anything that tries to be "intellectual" made by a film director looks rather naive, with the exception of the likes of Tarkovsky.For instance, I had all this movie figured out in the first 20-30 minutes: first they show some random dramatic scenes of a family in the US of the 1960's, then they begin playing classical music and showing "space stuff" (stars, nebulae, etc), to show the "greatness of the universe", then, they are back on earth, on prehistoric times, showing aggression between dinosaurs, then it shifts to the 1960's showing aggression between humans. Anyway, I have noticed that other people also expressed their opinion that this film is intellectually offensive. It is indeed very offensive as it is very simple and shouldn't take the length of a feature length film to explain things out.There are similarities between this movie and Atlas Shrugged. Both appeal to a small set of people, movie critics and randians, both films are a worthless bore to the people outside these two groups. Both films failed at the box office as well. And yes, both films are ideological: one advocates the ideology of the movie critics, the other advocates the ideology of the randians.It almost doesn't have anything substantial: almost no narrative. Just random fancy images of the earth, constellation, some poorly done GCI dinosaurs. Also, there were some characters in the movie and some pointless dialogue: the father appears to be a psychopath, just beating his kids for no reason at all and never showing any humanity at all. Though this can be interpreted as a selection of some of life's conflicts. Some have compared this drivel to 2001. Well, 2001 is actually one of my favorite movies, while this is just a collection of random fancy images put together.Malik is what Tarkovsky would look to be with half the IQ. He tries to shoot for the stars but lacks the capability to do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Malick outdoes himself with this stunning and very sensitive effort.If, like me, you often choose movies to see based on a high critical score combined with a low score from the general public, then this will be right up your street.If, however, you are similar in mindset to the general populous, haven't seen 500 movies, read 50 books or have a sub-120 IQ then trust me, you're probably not in a position to get anything out of seeing this.Personally, seeing this made me feel better about myself and my life, knowing there are other people who even think at this level, never mind having the ability to get a movie like this actually made.Thank the lord for Terrence Mallick...Truly sublime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's 'The Tree of Life' is Artisic, but, it's NOT meant for everyone. It caters to a niche audience, who have an appetite for deeply insightful films, that lack "typical commercial content".'The Tree of Life' chronicles the origins and meaning of life by way of a middle-aged man's childhood memories of his family living in 1950s Texas, interspersed with imagery of the origins of the universe and the inception of life on Earth.'The Tree of Life' is about loss, pain, redemption &amp; memories. Malick's uses images &amp; the use of nature as a style of narrative, which, with due respect, gets impossible to understand at times. However, Malick's vision &amp; contribution to this story, is extremely note-worthy, at places.Malick's Screenplay is artistic &amp; confusing at times. His direction, as mentioned before, is extremely note-worthy, at places. I loved the way he showed the relationship between the Father &amp; Son. It left me satisfied.Cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, is magnificent. He holds the film &amp; captures each moment with absolute flourish. Editing is well-done. Art &amp; Coustume Design, are fair. Visual Effects are passable.Performance-Wise: Brad Pitt's portrayal of the Father, is detailed. Jessica Chastain, as the Mother, is astonishing. She gives everything to the character &amp; passes off with flying colors. Sean Penn plays the Son, with honesty. Hunter McCracken is fantastic.On the whole, 'The Tree of Life' works in it's own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One might think that writer/director Terrence Malick is trying to test your patience and ability to examine your own conception of his two-hour nineteen minute drama. Definitely thought provoking and you really don't need to pressure yourself to fully understand what you are watching; but be able to make sense of your own innermost thought of life in comparison to what is on the screen. This story takes place in 1950s Texas. We follow eldest son, Jack(Sean Penn), as he struggles through a confusing childhood; innocence doesn't seem to last long while trying to live up to his stern father's(Brad Pitt)concept of life. Jack's mother(Jessica Chastain)wants her son to approach life with an open heart in contrast to his father's belief to take care of yourself first and press on with your own private interests. One of Jack's brothers dies and effects him awkwardly different than his parents. Jack primarily seems to be a lost soul trying to survive in a brutal world that questions his own perception of the existence of faith. There are some magnificent scenes that may to some border on indulgence. Jack's complicated and disillusioned life's journey may now have your own under suspicion. If you watch THE TREE OF LIFE a second time, it is most likely you will see something entirely different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film by that rare cinematic genius, Terrence Malick, who wrote and directed it. It is truly astonishing, or should I say 'mind-blowing'. Some might find it slow and hard work, but that it is because it is not an entertainment film, it is art. I would say that Malick got a bit carried away by adding all those shots of volcanoes and natural phenomena, fascinating and beautifully photographed as they are. Those could all have been dispensed with and put into a separate documentary. What really matters is the poetic evocation of a lost childhood, which is the heart of this film. In this, Brad Pitt gives an outstanding performance as the stern father. Pitt has now moved beyond the glamour boy stage of his career and has become a really serious actor with much to say and convey. I hope he will do much more of this sort of thing, especially as he acted as joint producer of this film, proving his commitment to profound and important projects. He is thus behaving like Robert Redford before him, another deeply serious person who also went through the glamour boy stage and emerged on the other side as a major force for quality cinema. Although Sean Penn is billed as a star appearing in this film, he is seen very little, and his shots probably did not take more than one or two days' shooting. He is, as one would expect, extremely good in those rare moments when we see him. The acting revelation of this film, however, is the amazing Jessica Chastain, who plays the mother. The camera lingers on her lovingly, and no wonder, as she is a perfect marvel. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lebuzki is stunning and imaginative. Five different people headed by Hank Corwin edited this film, and this too was brilliant. In evoking the past, a surprisingly frequent use is made of sequences of multiple jump cuts. Although this served to reduce the running time of the film, and must have made the distributors happy, it was done with artistic effect and somehow intensified the story by emphasizing the jumpy and episodic nature of memory. Hunter McCracken is wonderful as the young Sean Penn, and let's hope he grows up to have a career like him. This film is pure poetry. We really need more poetry on screen, and if only there were more Terrence Malicks to provide it. This film will remain a classic as long as there are eyes to see. I notice that the many reviews seem to oscillate between one star and ten stars, with few judgements falling in between. Either people are bored to death or they are uplifted. Well, I guess that says more about the viewers than the film in this instance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destined to be a classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through a past tragedy of the death of a brother and early childhood experiences the protagonist in this story, Jack O'Brien, has come in later life to ask himself questions like: "Where did I come from?"; "How did I come to be what I am?"; "Can I find God?" In answer to the first question, director Malick takes us from the big bang to 21st century Waco, Texas in about a half hour. It's quite a trip--more relevant to the movie and more impressive than the light show in "2001." To answer the second question Jack reflects on that time in life that molds us all, early family life. Jack's father was a disciplinarian and was a frustrated man with burdensome attitudes: the rich don't deserve their wealth; it takes fierce will to get ahead in this world; if you're good, people take advantage of you; the world lives by trickery. His mother was angelic, a person the movie presents as having chosen the way of grace. The opposing personalities of Jack's parents are reflected in the personalities of Jack and his younger artistic brother R.L. Submerged for decades while Jack climbed the ladder to become a successful architect, working in the glass and steel warren of downtown Dallas, the influences of the disparate personalities of his parents and the relationship with his brother have surfaced to produce an existential crisis with his searching for God and meaning in an apparently indifferent universe.Many movies seem scripted, but this one I think came straight from the heart. Without having grown up in a small Midwestern town in the 1950s, there is no way that Malick could have written this and gotten all of the details exactly right. If you grew up in the environment depicted in this movie (as I did, southern Illinois) you will likely be seized with an overwhelming sense of nostalgia; if not, then you will never get a more detailed and poetic presentation of a time and a place. The scenes with Jack and his two younger brothers make for one of the strongest early coming-of-age stories on film. There are scenes showing the joy of being young and carefree and delighting in the animalistic pleasure of simply being healthy and alive. We see the effects of young Jack's gradually becoming aware of how tragedy and misfortune can strike in an apparently random manner, raising the question, "Can this happen to anyone?" This theme is driven home in a priest's homily that starkly states that bad things can happen to anyone at any time--there is no way to protect yourself or your family. We follow young Jack up to the dawning of sexual attraction. The bonus of this coming-of-age story is that we get to see the product, Jack after several intervening decades.The music and images alone are enough for me to give this a high rating. Malick must have tossed in many of his favorite classical pieces, but they are carefully chosen to accentuate what is on screen. For example, there is a montage of the boys at play--rolling in the grass, throwing a ball over the house, playing kick the can, and just goofing around--all to some rousing music from Smetana's Má Vlast (The Moldau). I was stunned by how masterfully those scenes were filmed and scored. Without its music the movie would lose much of its poetry.There are many magnificent scenes. Consider the scene with Pitt at the piano and the middle son playing a guitar on the porch. Pitt suspends his playing and looks out at his son with an expression that says, "My god, there is beauty in this boy of mine." There are some scenes that I think will forever remain a mystery to me, like the scenes in the attic, or the mysterious orange mist that appears from time to time. The only sense I make of the latter is that it serves like a chapter break. Some scenes could stand more of a back-story, like the scene at the barbecue in the black neighborhood.I found the acting to be most effective. Not a typical role for Brad Pitt, but he carries off the part of Jack's stern father well; and there is some tenderness in him too. Men of the era did not show much emotion. Jessica Chastain is perfect as Jack's ethereal mother. And then we come to the boys. How do they get kids to behave so naturally on film? These boys are fantastic. They say so much with subtle facial expressions that you have to believe that is in good measure the work of the director. But this is not to take away from the ability of the kids, particularly Hunter McCracken as the young Jack, to express nuanced emotion. In fact, facial expressions play a big part in this film. Sean Penn is called on to do little else--the hint of a smile he expresses in his final scene is a perfect ending.This movie had a profound effect on me. Articulated in the terms laid down by this movie, the duel between nature and the better angels of our nature (grace) is something that most everyone is challenged with on a daily basis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hated this movie. First it ran well over 2 hours and the first 30 minutes made absolutely no sense. First everyone whispers and if it wasn't for sub titles, I would have no idea what was said. Of course, you don't really need to know what was said because it makes no sense. It shows things like dinosaurs, creatures swimming, waves in the ocean, etc... Worst film making ever! And what exactly did Sean Penn have to do with anything??? He made no sense what so ever. After the first 30 to 40 minutes, we finally have some dialogue. There is a husband, wife, and 2 or 3 kids. But there is little talk, It shows the first kid from being a baby to growing up to a toddler, with little being said. It was like it was the point of view from the kid. It was pointless. Then finally when the kids are older, it shows the dad being mean to them and the mom has a pointless role. Just dumb FINAL VERDICT: This has to be the biggest waste of money ever. Anyone associated with making this movie ought to be ashamed at the millions wasted that could have been used for a good cause. Avoid this at all costs!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I ordered this lousy movie from my on-demand cable service and called them back to request a refund. It's absolutely unwatchable. Why they bring in top-shelf talent like Pitt and Penn and then devote inordinate amounts of time to rehashed NASA footage is beyond me. Hey, don't get me wrong. I like NASA footage as much as the next guy, but just didn't think it worked here. I mean, the first 2 minutes were OK, but it just seemed to go on and on like a bad marriage. I will admit that when I look at some of the other reviews that actually liked this film, it makes me wonder that maybe I missed something. But then I recall that I was with a group of friends when I rented it and none of us could stand this garbage. We're sitting there for like 25 minutes thinking, "OK, now it'll get better. Surely with all the hype and Pitt and Penn this must be a decent movie". Nope!</fullReview>

There follows a faint storyline: flashbacks to controlling father;weak mother; boys growing up in the 50's. One gets killed. Another one looks back.

		<fullReview>Terrence Malick the eccentric genius of the cinema, a fit successor to Stanley Kubrick? Eccentric, sure, genius, I'm not so convinced.On the positive side, every frame of this film is beautifully shot, the editing is wonderful and it is a visual feast. The theme, period and setting, growing up in the Texas town of Waco in the 1940s and fifties are all beautifully invoked. The acting is superb, especially the kids playing the O'Brien brothers, Jack, RL and Steve. And there's not much wrong with Brad Pitt's performance as their father. The mixed in creation sequences to which Kubrick's designer contributed are also spectacular. But why oh why bundle the two together? It's the Last Picture Show meets 2001. The reclusive Malick seems to think he has no need to explain himself but this film is said to be an autobiographical exercise. Malick's upbringing was not particularly horrendous on the evidence here. Like anyone with half a brain he is concerned with the ultimate questions about life ? what are we here for, who is God, what does he want of us, what it's all about, and these questions arise in Texas as well as everywhere else. Putting all this into a movie about growing up though is just too big a call. The acting is great, but the actors are rather hobbled by the dialogue, or lack of it. It might as well be a silent film, for all it advances the story. We get more sense out of the narration. I don't quite know why the book of Job is quoted. Of course mankind was not present at the creation. Malick has a rather comprehensive background in philosophy and doubtless had a point to make, but I suspect its right over most viewers' heads. Abstract concepts are not easy to film and Malick at least has to be respected for trying, but there are too many loose ends and inexplicable incidents for a coherent argument.What does work well are the portrayals of the relationships between father and son, older brother and younger brother and mother and son. There is very little insight into the parents' relationship, which rings true, since children seldom understand it, at least while growing up. I was a bit bothered by the closing sequence where a disullusioned adult Jack (Sean Penn) meets the rest of his family and his younger self (I think) on a beach in what seems to be a state of rapture. The universe can hardly be explained by reference to a religious myth and I find it hard to believe that someone with Malick's background in philosophy would give any credence to it. Perhaps it was a gesture to the religious right, but why bother ? they are perfectly capable of producing fairy tales themselves.I thought The Thin Red Line, based on James Jones' novel was a truly brilliant piece of work, especially since the novel had been filmed previously. Perhaps Malick is one of those directors who sees new possibilities in others 'work, rather than one who is an original creator. Compared to Thin Red Line, this film is gorgeous to look at, but a real dogs' breakfast otherwise. I was annoyed when I saw people walking out half way through, but at the end I had to acknowledge they had a point.</fullReview>

Coming from a fan of artsy films, that's saying a lot. To the average moviegoer however, it may appear to be more of a slideshow of wallpaper-worthy images than a full-length feature film. At times it's as if you're watching the National Geographic Channel.If what you're looking for in a movie is merely entertainment value, you will find this film very tedious and perplexing. But if you want a unique cinematic experience, then go see this. Just a heads up, though: this movie requires your undivided attention.

		<fullReview>Terrence Malick can't count himself among the most popular directors working today, but he can certainly count himself among the most respected. His work tends to follow suit, and "The Tree of Life" is no exception. This meditation on life, death, God and the origin of the universe can be described as nothing short of visually masterful, but as well as Malick commands everything within his frame, he has a lot of trouble commanding his audience's attention span.Not that he cares ? or should. Malick is cinema's finest poet, and poetry has always been an art form belonging to the artist. We are not meant to understand "The Tree of Life," but to be affected by it, struck by it in some way. The general public won't take kindly to this, but anyone with an eye for expert filmmaking had to tip the hat to Malick's latest."The Tree of Life" tells a non-linear story using non-linear visual sequences. Jack (Hunter McCracken as a boy, Sean Penn as a man) grew up in Texas in the '50s to a kind and spirited mother (Jessica Chastain) and a tough-love father (Brad Pitt). Although we know Jack loses his brother at the age of 19, this has little bearing on the rest of the story, though it complicates older Jack's perspective. We then see the universe in action, followed by Jack's life growing up.The film ultimately becomes about Jack forgiving his father for making him "choose" between his parents, for the psychological damage done to him because of his father's strict rules and rough life lessons. We see this in scenes best described as fleeting memories accompanied by voice overs of the characters' conversations with God.As we all do in less cinematic ways, Malick wrestles here with faith and with our place in the world as individuals. Rarely, however, does he manage to make a concise point about any of this. Also, the film's emotional impact comes only from the way we see Pitt's character treat his children and how it damages Jack. There's a disconnect then between what the film is about and how it leaves its deepest impression.Pitt and Chastain give excellent performances despite the fact that "Tree of Life" is not a film about performances, at least not in the traditional sense. As much as they must be able to act, they must also be able to soak up the camera and bask in the expert lighting. That's what it takes to be in a Malick film. McCracken also impresses considering how little he's given to say.Not enough can be said about the beauty of this film. Malick's camera takes on a life of its own, moving fluidly throughout scenes and only pausing to capture something remarkable, usually with regards to light. Surely if he devoted these skills to more traditional storytelling he'd be among the most celebrated filmmakers alive.It's easy to dismiss "The Tree of Life" as pretentious. Unquestionably we expect certain things from film that we don't expect from poetry; we value accessibility in our movie-going experiences and "The Tree of Life" offers little of that. At the same time, it has valuable things to say and does so with a visual power rivaled by little else.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit my site, moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS PRESENT***Life and love seem to combine in vast, almost overwhelming ways in my latest viewing, the perplexing art-house feature known as The Tree of Life. This is only the fifth film in the forty year career of auteur Terrence Malick, director of one of my top five favorite films, The Thin Red Line.The film begins with a passage from the book of Job: "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth? When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" The film opens with the parents of the O'Brien family mourning for their child. The mother (Played with gentle care by Jessica Chastain) embodies the loving, kind form of grace, while the father (Played fiercely by Brad Pitt) embodies the raw, harsh form of nature. Decades later, on the anniversary of their son's death, their oldest son, Jack (Played by Sean Penn) appears lost, wondering whether he fits into nature or grace.But, bigger ideas lie ahead. The prologue leads into a sequence of the aforementioned earth's foundations being laid (A sequence that made my jaw DROP). Through volcanic eruptions forming land, waves of water rolling into the oceans, the birth of prehistoric life, and the subsequent destruction by a meteor crashing into the Earth (Brought to life by an impressive sound mix, and truly special effects). The images in this portion of the film are also themed towards the elements of earth, water, fire, and air, and are captured effectively by Emmanuel Lubezki (Who, if there's any justice in the world, will be locked to win this year's cinematography Oscar). These four elements are also utilized within images of our next portion of the film.We then get back to the O'Brien's, and like the creation of the universe, it shows us their origins in the 1950's. Marriage of the parents, and then the birth of their children, where the oldest of the three, Jack (Played in his youth by Hunter McCracken), has great love for his mother, but great fear of his father. He seems to have an uncontrollable angst trying to figure out if he fits into nature or grace, his actions seeming to ask "Where are you?" in trying to find God. Perhaps nature and grace are needed to work together, hand in hand.The most polarizing sequence in the film is the ending on the beach, which is an enigmatic, but also fascinating sequence with which that feels like a meditative dream. Of what it means, I can't be completely sure, but here's what I took out of it.Earlier in the film, Mrs. O'Brien is distraught by her son's death, but in this sequence, she seems to be joined by angels, and accepts the death, and offers her son up to God.Also, Jack seemed to be on a quest to find God. What he didn't realize was that he already did. God was all around him, ubiquitous, even incarnate in his own parents. His mother is the gracious side of God, his father is the natural side of God. When the sequence ends, we cut back to adult Jack. It feels as if the sequence was a vision to Jack, and the final image of a bridge seems to be a metaphor for the bridge to eternity.If that was what was meant, I'm still not sure, but it was a brilliant conclusion to a film I was enthralled by. It's worth noting that the film has flaws, but even the most revered masterpieces need their flaws in order to flourish.But is it too soon to call The Tree of Life a masterpiece? The film opened at the Cannes Film Festival (where it went on to win the Palme d'Or), and in limited release in American cinemas, to a mostly positive, but highly divisive reception. Either they love it with the utmost affection, or hate it in total bewilderment. Everyone agrees that it is visually beautiful, but the detractors seem to be pointing fingers at Malick's directorial and screen writing methods. Even though I was amazed by the film, I don't begrudge those who dislike The Tree of Life. I appreciate that the film isn't for everyone.It's definitely gonna try your patience. It's slow, doesn't rely heavily on dialogue, completely throws the three act structure out the window, and often opts more for visual storytelling that can leave one a bit confused. I'm still not entirely convinced with what all I've said, but I think this is a film that calls for serious reserve. If you do see the film, I suggest that you give it time to digest, and then see it again. Whether that be next day, next week, next month, next year, next decade... see it again.There's just too much within the film to absorb all at once. It could take a hundred viewings before we finally understand the film, but even after a hundred viewings, we might discover it wasn't meant to be understood at all. A lot of it seems left wide open for interpretation. Everybody can take something different out of this film, and nobody would be wrong, making it a perfect film to discuss and debate, and I have a feeling that we'll be debating over the film's message for years and years to come.But take every review you read, including mine, with a HUGE grain of salt. Not everyone will have the same experience. You will need serious patience, and it's going to require repeat viewings, but hopefully you'll leave with staggering food for thought. Just remember all of that, and you'll be fine.And after three viewings of the film, I confidently award the film my highest rating.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Terrence Malick, the acclaimed director of such classic films as Badlands, Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line, The Tree of Life is the impressionistic story of a Midwestern family in the 1950's. The film follows the life journey of the eldest son, Jack, through the innocence of childhood to his disillusioned adult years as he tries to reconcile a complicated relationship with his father (Brad Pitt). Jack (played as an adult by Sean Penn) finds himself a lost soul in the modern world, seeking answers to the origins and meaning of life while questioning the existence of faith. Through Malick's signature imagery, we see how both brute nature and spiritual grace shape not only our lives as individuals and families, but all life.Starring, Brad Pitt, Sean Penn, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken, Fiona Shaw , Jessica Fuselier , Nicolas Gonda , William A. Wallace , Kelly Koonce.Directed by the wonderful and enigmatic director Terrence Malick. who directed The Thin Red Line, Days of Heaven and Badlands.Winner of this year's Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.well here it is, another drama with surrealism and very experimental elements used in it. this officially was my most awaited movie of the entire year after i saw the trailer, it really touched me and reminded me of 2001: A Space odyssey which right now is my most favorite movie of all time. The Tree Of Life surpassed my expectations from it, literally this movie was such an outstanding work. it stands alongside HP7 2 and Midnight in Paris to be my most favorite movies of the year. and the most favorite to be exact.the film revolves around the meaning and origin of life by perception of a middle aged man, Penn's childhood memories in Texas 1950's, finding his place in this universe shown with the graphical imagery of origins of the universe and the inception of life on Earth. this movie definitely received great reactions from Critics for the artistic and technical merits but many people didn't liked it for something i love, non- linear and fragmented narration. there were polarizing reactions when it was shown with Cannes with boos and claps.the style of Malick my be, or actually it is a hurdle between viewers but i think those who actually like these kind of movies or arty indie flicks, those who are patient will love it and it will provide a emotional and visual treat for them. this movie has an extreme boldness of vision just like 2001 but this one has more human feelings and more concerned with humans than that was. this is such a magnificent movie, epic and spectacular, it showed a childhood in a way i never seen before and also what goes on in a mind of a growing child seeing like this was really overwhelming.Direction of this movie is pitch perfect, though if he handled the narrative style a bit better in the quarter of 2nd half, the movie would have been an actual flawless movie. it looses a lot of momentum and loses that whole track there and feels a bit flat. that is the only flaw i saw. great direction. screenplay was good, very good. plot was really heavy and confusing for many viewers, for me too. i still have those imagery and scenes in my mind even though i didn't understood some of them. spectacular cinematography and art direction. with lovely costumes and sound. greatly done editing and really good visual effects. dinosaurs and earth's imagery is lovely with universe too.Brad Pitt gave a brilliant performance, almost in a sort of way reminded me of The Curious Case O Benjamin Button. really good performance by him. also Jessica Chastain outshined in this movie, she is an angel, a beautiful lovely and very delicate fairy. loved her. she as their mother was just perfect. among the children, Hunter McCracken surprisingly gave a marvelous performance. Sen Penn is not much in it but still he leaves a bit of a mark. overall brilliant performances, one of the best things about this movie.about Oscars, it deserves recognition in Best Picture, Director, for Best Actor Brad Pitt (maybe) not sure though but Jessica Chastain is a lock, she deserves it truly. also for Cinematography, visual effects, art direction, editing and Screenplay.it begins with the life and finishes with the death. the movie has a very sad tone. the way the life on earth, the formation of universe and then a simple family growing is shown is just spectacular. brilliant camera work with those imagery of flora and fauna alongwith everything else. this movie feels like an encyclopedia on Origins Of Life. i loved and you will too.an utter masterpiece of the first rate. two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick's directing style is like a more artistic Michael Bay in many ways; truly groundbreaking cinema (despite it's flaws)!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'THE TREE OF LIFE': Five Stars (Out of Five)Terrence Malick writes and directs yet another overly ambitious overblown cinematic masterpiece. Yes it is far from flawless but it's still a masterpiece none the less. Malick's previous films have included 1973's 'BADLANDS', 1978's 'DAYS OF HEAVEN', 1998's 'THE THIN RED LINE' (after a 20 year break!) and 2005's 'THE NEW WORLD'. All of his other films have been very grand and epic in scale (except for his earliest work) but none of them even start to compare to this. With this it's like Malick is attempting to make the perfect film, one comparable to the greatest art of all time, and for that he has been criticized greatly. Some call Malick pretentious, too full of himself and some have said he has a 'God complex'. All this may be true but he's still a great director and this film is in my opinion his best work to date (as flawed as it is).The film attempts to answer the greatest of all questions: 'why are we here and what is our purpose?'. It centers on a family in 1950's Texas. Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain (who bears a striking resemblance to Bryce Dallas Howard and was even born with the same last name in the same month and year, but is no relation) star as Mr. and Mrs. OBrien. The story focuses on the eldest of their three sons, Jack (played by Hunter McCracken in his debut role), and is narrated by him as an adult in modern day (played by Sean Penn). The film follows Jack's coming of age as he struggles with his abusive but loving father. He explains as an adult how he's come to question everything after the recent loss of one of his brothers. The movie attempts to depict the meaning of life, God and our place among things through the mind of Jack. It even has a detailed scene exploring the creation of the universe and it's first inhabitants (dinosaurs). The editing is very quick and all over the place, making it very hard to follow at times. The narrative flashes back and forth from the present to the 50's, as well as the beginning of time, in a very hectic and somewhat overwhelming fashion (at least for the first 30 minutes or so). It does settle into a more relaxed and coherent method of storytelling and pacing as the movie goes on but it definitely takes a little while to get used to it (at the screening that I saw multiple people walked out on it, in the first 30 minutes, before they even gave it a chance). The cinematography is beautiful and the visuals are breathtaking. Malick's directing style sort of reminds me of a more artistic Michael Bay in many ways. The film is definitely not for everyone, as you can probably tell (it already has a great deal of haters), but those who do like it will most likely love it. It definitely is flawed both in style and compass but it aims so high that this was almost always a given. Walking away from it I was torn, quite a bit, on my overall opinion of the film. I really liked the film's emotional elements, strong character study and miraculous ability of capturing both the magic and trauma of childhood (it reminded me of what it's like to be a child perhaps more than any other film, not with the father conflict (my dad was great) but in almost every other way). I didn't like the film's overly broad scope though as well as it's bizarre franticness (I thought those elements really hurt the film, at first) but the more I thought about it I really began to admire the film despite those elements and maybe in part because of them. The movie is nearly impossible to take in and fully understand in one sitting, so I really want to see it again before I know how I completely feel about it (sadly it only played in local theaters, at 9th St. Cinemas, for one week before it was pulled. I'm hoping the Darkside will get it soon as well) but the fact that I desire seeing it again so quickly and immensely is a true testament to the power of the film. It's like nothing else you've ever seen before and will undoubtedly be examined, over and over again, for many years to come! Truly groundbreaking cinema (despite it's flaws).Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKd3ajZbngo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The meaning of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie about the meaning of life is by definition a difficult and ambitious one. But this one corresponds well and successfully enough to that ambition. The great and complex questions of what is (and what means) life and what is death are not solved (nor could them be) in the movie but several clues are left to the spectator to make him feel and think through all the images, scenes, dialogues and attitudes presented to him throughout the movie. A few minutes after the first scenes we are drawn into a whirl of powerful, beautiful and poetical images portraying the origins of the universe and of life, establishing a link with the apparently more prosaic events that follow portraying the life of a middle class couple and their three sons of whom the eldest one soon has problems with the world surrounding him beginning with his father with whom he is never in full harmony. The tonic stress of this narrative is put on the behaviour of this boy while he tries to understand life around him. One of the three sons dies when he was nineteen and this is remembered by the eldest one as adult (Sean Penn) while he recalls his childhood making us to see the whole story through his eyes. The movie develops itself from a certain moment on in a metaphysical dimension through scenes of great visual beauty and elevated sentimentality and emotion passing a message of love as a key for human behaviour even in theistic terms without forgetting the permanent appeals to reason in order to try to understand God and His relationship with mankind. A difficult movie indeed but one to be seen without fail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing...and overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good points: Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is majestic. The performances were stunning, particularly the leads. Editing was adequate for what the editors had to deal with. I suspect Corwin et al could have done more if they'd been given more.The bad points: The entire movie reads like bad, sentimental poetry. Poetry, to be sure, but trite, sentimental poetry full of saccharin clichés (e.g. returning to the sea, passing through doors, and on and on). The soundtrack was wholly inappropriate for the images. Sickeningly sentimental. Structurally, it was like national geographic footage + beautifully shot home movies laced with overly dramatic whispering, as if whispering would make the mundane divine..."mother," "I can be me," "how do I get back,"...on and on. I realize some people think this movie is great. But before they attack my intellect and aesthetic sensibilities, let me assure them that I understand the movie. It was not lost on me. I get the wonder of childhood, the role of memory, the subtle grandeur of growing up, the sense of something greater than oneself, etc. But this film reminded me of Bergman without Berman. Lynch without Lynch. As a whole, I found it melodramatic, overbearing and self indulgent. Throughout, I kept thinking what could have been done with 32 million dollars, Lubezki on the lens, and the brilliant actors in this film. I gave it 3-stars for the performances and the cinematography. Beyond that, there is not much to recommend.</fullReview>

I felt I was taken on a spiritual journey through a life filled with contemplation on the mysteries of faith. Sure it's a deliberate pace but it's meant to convey a life lived and it does that. This is surely the best acting I've ever seen from Brad Pitt. The classical music was as gorgeous as the visuals. When the film was over, I was changed in some way.

		<shortDescription>Great in specific moments but ultimately doesn't come together as a whole and is surprisingly pretentious at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The occasional films of Terrance Malick are something that many look forward to because the man is an artist and his films are often touched with that aspect rather than being what they appear to be at first glance. I always remember how taken I was by The Thin Red Line ? a film I did not know was his and one I watched expecting it to be a competing film with Saving Private Ryan; I loved it and it stayed with me for some time. So I came to Tree of Life knowing what to expect (or at least knowing not to expect a "normal" story) and I was quite looking forward to it.Although at times it far from it, most of the film follows a rough narrative that is a lot more sturdy than I expected. In 2011 a man is recalling his childhood as he reflects on the death of his brother many years ago when he was 19. These memories are of a harsh father and a loving mother and they are preceded by the birth of the universe, the evolution of life from single celled organisms, dinosaurs being kind to one another and the adult son stumbling around in what appears to be a desert. The official line is that Malick is a genius and that this film is a meditation over life and spirituality and I have read far too many reviews where those that love it gush generally about it while those that hate it are dismissed as being idiots and having an IQ of penguin weather levels. It doesn't help this massive split in opinion that Malick doesn't appear to give a tinker's cuss what you think ? he is making the films he wants to make the way he wants to make them.The first 40 minutes is the real tester and if you are loving the film after them, then you'll love the whole film. For the majority of the first hour we have lots of whispering voices saying profound things, lots of universe-creating explosions and shots of planets and life forming. We also have a terribly pointless moment walking with dinosaurs. All of this plays out under operatic music which practically screams "look how epic and beautiful all this stuff is". As it is at the start of the film, there is no real context for it and you really do have to trust Malick at this point ? although that is not to say that he will reward your trust if you stick with it. For me this part of the film was overlong and really added very little once it had gone on for so long.After this we get to the heart of the film for me, which is the memories of the family. As individual moments, the majority of these memories are great and well delivered ? telling us a lot about the adult son even though we've barely seen him. I enjoyed many of these moments because they were naturally written, consistent, had characters that rang true and engaged me and were really well acted by all involved (Pitt in particular seems to totally "get" his character). However, as a narrative linking back to the adult son, it doesn't work as a whole for me and at the end of the film we are spat back out into another beautifully shot but pretentiously delivered moment of spirituality and "beauty" where the adult son learns we are all connected, are all part of the universe, are all loved or, to be honest, whatever lesson the specific viewer wants to take ? as with a lot of art, things are wide open to be interpreted however you like. For me personally I only found visual beauty in these parts of the film, while in the family parts I only specific moments that worked really well, but nothing that joins it all up.I wanted to be drawn in by it but at times it seems deliberately difficult and for many viewers (myself included) the film will come across as pretentious. The whispers and shots of nature that worked so well for me in Thin Red Line, mostly smacked of artsy navel gazing at best and out and out pretentious waffle at worst ? and sadly, as a whole, this is how I took the film. I will stress though that the majority of the film is focused on the family in the 1950's and that these scenes all worked for me as individual scenes, which meant I enjoyed the film when there, but looking back on it I do have to say it never even slightly came together as a total package for me and I didn't really want to think about the wider spiritual parts because I felt so alienated from so many of them by the overdone music and the many shots of "beauty" and "meaning".The Tree of Life, like many of Malick's films, is not for everyone, and in this case I unfortunately am one of those on the outside. It has a lot to like about it and I really liked the core of the film in the specific moment, but when I looked to the film to expand for me beyond any of the specific memories, it just didn't ? instead I got dinosaurs petting one another, overly earnest opera, Sean Penn touching someone's feet on a beach and lots of shots of nature and beauty. Worth a look for the experience and the strengths in the core, but you may find yourself with me and be unable to see the awesome film that so many others are gushing over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film told a very simple story of an angry and slightly abusive father (Brad Pitt) and his wife (Jessica Chastain) and three children, one of whom we see in later life played by Sean Penn. This, however, would have been a five minute segment of any other film, but this was spun into 138 minutes by the inclusion of seemingly random and endless unconnected clips to other things, for example, sperm swimming around, planets, dinosaurs, nature and CGI of... well... who knows? Sean Penn, one of the major reasons I watched this film, is named second in the credits and yet he appears in the film for less than five minutes. There was lots of beautiful cinematography of nature and other interesting things, but it was all scrambled together with inappropriate music, intertwined with a story that had no link to the images.How this film scores 7.5 I really have no idea. One of the worst directed, most badly thought out, most indulgent and most irritating films that I have ever seen. This is the cinematic version of chat roulette.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrence Malick made a inspiring movie that involves the origin of species, having some connections with the movie from Stanley Kubrick, that both talks about "the dawn of men", and the movie have too a religious side, a side of faith, showing us that the only way to overcome the problems and intrigues with among a family its with forgiveness. This film has two sides, one talking about science and another about the casual problems of a 1950s family, and our philosopher Terrence Malick, that has grew up in a farm, connecting the two sides, he studied philosophy in Harvard, and was because of this and the thing about farm he did "Days of Heaven", that I consider his best work.Brad Pitt and Sean Penn have a plausible role, doing all necessary, but nothing to be indicate on academy, BUT Jessica Chastain did a different role, a different role and she worked very well, it can be a award. "The Tree of Life" is a important movie for the history of cinema, is a different experience and it can inspire you. Alexandre Desplat make a great original music for the film, but what was really important on this, was the cinematography, with a great editing and scenario. If you are not so addicted to cinema, you will think that the movie is a little somnolent, but I said, the movie is more to think that our existence is really important, show us to don't do bad things, because a little problem can destroy several lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film that didn't completely connect with me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went and saw this film with a few friends after traveling over 100 miles to UC Irvine's theater and I have to say that this film left an impression. It had the beautiful cinematography with the voice over narration that we have come to expect from a Malick film. However, it also had some awkward transitions that left the audience wondering what was going on. As a biologist, I appreciated the evolution scene, but also felt it was introduced in a slightly discombobulating manner. The movie was no doubt a beautiful and original film, but it wasn't particularly an entertaining film. It was more of a very complicated art piece that will require a few viewings to just scratch the surface of being able to interpret it.The acting was rather good in this film. The two actors that shined were Hunter McCracken (little Jack) and Jessica Chastain (the nurturing mother). They both will undoubtedly have good careers ahead of them. I do have to say though that the movie was disappointing for me. I saw it expecting it to leave a profound mark on me similar to that which The Thin Red Line left (one of my favorite films of all time). However, the movie just didn't come together as well as TTRL did. That is not to say that I won't come to love it after viewing it a few more times. I just couldn't help but want to watch the film, Local Hero (1983), which to me is a better film that deals with the same issues of The Tree of Life. Local Hero was a more entertaining film with a better sense of humor than The Tree of Life. With that said, I do highly recommend seeing TToL as it can connect with a lot of people in a deeper level than a typical Hollywood movie. However, only time will tell whether I will come to fully embrace the ambitiousness of it.</fullReview>

I have found it difficult writing reviews for this film as it is almost a contradiction to explain in words what is meant to be viewed. Mallick uses the actors as a means to catalyze this story which tackles the origin of the universe and what religion represents and the role it plays for humans. If you can be receptive to visuals over endless dialogue then this film will dazzle you. You will be left speechless when the credits roll. Simply put the best film I have had the pleasure of viewing in theatres.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's fifth feature in as many decades is a kind of extended montage, wherein middle-aged architect Jack (Sean Penn) recalls a happy/sad childhood dominated by his aggressive, pragmatic father, played by Brad Pitt. The plot ostensibly concerns Jack's efforts to come to terms with the death of his brother (an event as mysterious to the viewer as it is to the character), aged 19. Reportedly, Malick's own brother committed suicide aged 19.Aided by Malick's faultless eye and five listed editors, Jack's memories arrive in fragments: glimpses of half-seen faces seen from unusual angles, and snatches of dialogue, half-heard or sometimes booming and unforgettable. This is impressive, impressionistic film-making brought to the multiplex on the back of star power.One can't help but recall Andrei Tarkovsky's haunting Mirror, which dealt with similar themes ? the subjective distortions of childhood memory ? albeit with a broader range of emotional responses. Both films appeal to the senses, but The Tree of Life, for me, while nailing the thrill, fails to capture the horror and unreality of childhood to the same extent as the Russian's masterpiece.At times during The Tree of Life ? the best times ? one is struck with the feeling that one is experiencing a new way of watching cinema: a feeling of utter intimacy and privilege. But often, usually in the scenes involving the disappointingly under-used Penn (in a mood and in a suit), the film comes across as an extended perfume ad. This is not so much an indictment of Malick, but rather the advertising world's penchant for mindlessly hijacking visual art and shearing it of its philosophical content, reducing it to beauty and beauty alone. But I fear that the film's form may lead some to reject it on account of its sheen.It is clear that Malick regards the human race with a towering affection. With this film he is continuing his exploration of forbidden emotions set against backdrops of some vaster conflict ? of law, labour or war. Here we have nuclear family dynamics in the 1950s Deep South versus the birth of the Solar System. So we begin with light years of swirling gas and dust and gradually work our way to human gestures and glances. Malick is asking us to recognise that our roots are not just in childhood but in the baby steps of mutation and, before that, in the formation of stars.Pitt's showing is mature and controlled, although Jesse James still stands as the moment he became an actor, proving Babel wasn't a fluke. Jessica Chastain and Sean Penn are fine in smaller roles. But the real revelation is newcomer Hunter McCracken, as young Jack, whose eyes provide a thousand miniature sub-plots as his ambivalent feelings toward his overbearing father spark a fire of insurrection.The Tree of Life is Malick's least coherent film to date, and at times his most frustrating, unfocused and unsettled as it is, like an unruly boy with too little to do with a balmy summer evening. But it surely resists a single reading and demands repeated viewing. It'll keep film studies students busy until the end of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Word of Mouth Review: Tree of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review Score: 8.5/10 ? Go see it in theaters, IF you aren't a typical blockbuster fan.Every now and then a move comes along that sets a new milestone in the accomplishments of cinema. This year Tree of Life is that film.If you've heard anything about Tree of Life then you probably already know if you're interested or not. To recap, Tree of Life is a movie about a family unit, and some of the complications that arise in their lives. The movie more or less starts at the end with the death of one of three brothers in the family. Afterwards a large chunk of the movie is dedicated to a slide show of universe sized film snippets, followed by nature and micro life film snippets. Then the movie comes back to the family at the beginning, going from the birth of the first son to the conclusion of complications near the end of the first sons pre-teen years.The movie itself does not have a lot of dialogue. The majority of this dialogue is whispered and poetic and set on top of montages of artistic film pieces, cutting from image to image, and well? go watch the trailer if you want a better idea of it.As goes with this type of a movie, there isn't much action. The central conflict focuses on the relationship between the oldest son and his father and the effect this has on the rest of the family. Classical music plays behind most scenes, and some scenes have no sounds at all.This is not to say there aren't tense moments. One particular scene in which the oldest boy trespasses in someone's house, is silent and very tense as you wonder whether or not someone will catch him or not.In the end Tree of Life is about imagery, and then about life. The film makers tried to capture the prettiest, largest, smallest, most basic, and most complex moments of life, death, hate, love, creation, destruction, and beauty in the universe, micro verse, nature, and human life.Listen, if you are a movie goer that is not impressed by simple minded action flicks, or if you are just looking for an experience that is entirely unique to the world of cinema, then this is the movie to go see. This is not really a movie for everyone.By the way, if you are going to go see it, see it in theaters. Lots of the imagery will be harder to grasp if you see it on a small screen.I'm the mouth, and this has been the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Monumental Waste of Time...I repeat...MONUMENTAL.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although one should really be for more articulate when giving a critique on a film, despite having racked my brain for a more appropriate initial reaction, there is not one that seems more fitting than "WTF?" After all that has been said about Terrence Malik's "The Tree of Life" all year, I really did not know what I was getting into when I finally sat down to watch this, but I didn't expect to sit through two hours and eighteen torturous minutes."The Tree of Life" is about...um...absolutely nothing. It's over two hours of random images strung together that tell you absolutely nothing. In there is some sort of reference to a young boy whose father is extremely tough on him because he feels his sons could not succeed in life if they were not tough...and one of them ends up being killed in what you assume is Vietnam. No, that is not a spoiler, as it is the first thing you learn in the film before twenty minutes of images that give the impression Malick is trying to decipher the origins of the world through a montage of images before turning the "focus" (and I use the term loosely) back to the family at hand for an endless montage of scenes that lead nowhere before the credits roll.I should have lowered my expectations when Sean Penn himself said he did not understand the finished product at all. Penn, is one of the most ridiculous second-billings in cinematic history, is in the film for about maybe ten minutes, playing one of the sons as an adult, and whose entire script could have fit on a Post It yet whose point is completely meaningless.Critics heralded Brad Pitt's performance as the tough father, yet he hardly acts at all. He is merely an element of fatherly strength in some scenes where he really hardly says anything either. Jessica Chastain, if anyone, had to do the most "acting" here, but she hardly strings more than a few words together either.A film that deserves absolutely no award-season recognition, I do hope it gets at least one Oscar nomination as that would at least justify me having wasted two hours and eighteen minutes that I will never get back. But it better not be for acting, direction or editing, because this film deserves no place in any of these categories at all. The entire film is absolutely nothing more than images strung together randomly, not saying anything, with religious jargon thrown in for no real reason. The end result is nothing more than an absolute and utter monumental waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't the normal action, who is the hero, where is the plot kind. There is a little in it for everyone, from the fact how beautiful our world is and we tend to forget it. Being reminded of the simple things in life during our childhood days. This movie left me asking myself the questions, what is the meaning of life. Why am I here and what am I doing to myself and my surroundings. PERFECT! It is a meditative movie, peaceful, calming - a "stop" moment in all the busy things around us.Everyone is entitle to his/hers opinion which is fine, but my advise is to be able to really enjoy it and receive a deeper understanding you should be at peace with yourself and ready to close your mind from everything you know and have seen.I love it because i felt a since of being quiet afterward. Thank you so much for this film, I needed to slow down and think and this helped me to do just that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film tree of life was my personal most boring visit to the cinema to date. I would state that this critic contains spoiler only this movie has no plot what so ever. The story is quickly told, parents received note of the death of one of their sons, in a flashback the birth and growing up of all three boys is shown and their struggle with the authoritarian father. The whole film shot in most extreme camera positions and underlined with loud classical music and hymns. So why didn't I like the movie: The plot line could have filled about half an hour however it where 2 and a half hour In the middle of the film a puzzling sequence of countless random pieces of film of ocean, universe, jellyfish, lava and ocean, lava, universe and universe is shown mounting in the depicting of a herd of badly animated dinosaurs. An off voice whispering accompanies the film to get an esoteric or religious touch Worst of all is the end which drags on with scenes of every actor on a beach like place hugging, walking about and smiling and of course there were pictures of candles, hands and yes a field of sunflowers (I just waited for the rainbow and unicorn to make the goodness complete)So if you want to be bored out of your wits watch this film or better watch paint dry. If you want to see a film where a father mistreats his son, better watch "This boys life" with Robert De Niro. If you need some religious input why don't you go to church? And if you want to see little children learn to play baseball go to the park and don't forget the classic music. And of course: For scenes of lava and jellyfish turn to national geographic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tree of Life, Death, and Infinity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is recommended.When I began to ponder life experiences and muse about my own fate, as Terence Malick's visionary film, The Tree of Life, expects its audience members to do, an old television drama series from the 60's came to mind that had the same universal theme as this film. Both the film and the television show, though fine dramatic efforts that dealt with larger issues, seriously were in need of some doctoring. That series' famous catchphrase: Man...Woman...Birth...Death...Infinity concisely sums up the celebrated director's fifth film now on view in movie theaters.The Tree of Life is a film so visually stunning but emotionally inert. Children climb a gnarled tree filmed with skewed perspective and heightened dramatic angles giving the appearance as if they are scurrying toward heaven itself. A young child becomes fascinated with rainbow hued soap bubbles spinning randomly before him. The upside-down shadows of children at play cast against the cement pavements of yesterdays sear into one's memory of a time so long ago. ( I mention these three indelible images of children as they become the focal point in the director's conflicting theme of child innocence lost and the wonders of nature regained. ) The images are strong, the story is not.Malick's latest film needs more room to grow into the masterpiece many deem it to be. The film structure confuses rather than awes its movie audience. Its thematic roots run deep, but its message seems shallow and pretentious, especially the film's uplifting and ultimately unsatisfying hereafter ending. The film follows a non-linear narrative, jumping from present day to 50's suburbia ( its most solid and involving portion ), back to the beginning of our planet's origins ( yes, giant dinosaurs, the Big Bang theory, and psychedelic colors aplenty that would make Kubrick proud ) and forward again to modern times. It's a long ride with some glaring detours and no stops along the way for one to pause, let alone, reflect.The director's slow mediative process is readily apparent in his latest venture into filmmaking. That lyrical poetic styling always has been the director's trademark, but some of his films ( A New Life, The Thin Red Line ) seem to lack any focus and promote Malick's delusions of grandeur, which are grander than most grandiose filmmakers nowadays. He deludes himself ( and some critics ) into thinking that his films are important achievements in art, even if they are lacking any coherent narrative. The rush we feel as moviegoers when experiencing his films is purely sensory due to his unique vision and thorough visual craftsmanship at work. One rarely feels any emotional connection or true satisfaction with his final end product, although two of his earlier works, Badlands and Days of Heaven succeed in all departments as beautifully modulated minor masterpieces and must-see viewing for any serious film lover. Somewhere in this film, hidden among the metaphysical clutter, the Judeo-Christian teachings, its National Geographic inspired science lesson, and its multi-story format, there essentially lies an interesting tale about a young boy named Jack ( an appealing Hunter Mc Cracken ) growing up in a small Midwestern town complete with stern disapproving father ( a solid Brad Pitt ) and nurturing loving mother ( a lovely Jessica Chastain ) completing the family unit, plus two younger brothers, one whose destiny will impact the older one's future. Brooding Sean Penn plays the adult disillusioned Jack, questioning the meaning of life...typecasting at its best. ( Sadly, the great actress, Fiona Shaw, has what amounts to a cameo as the grandmother, yet she's fourth billed in the film's opening credits. I assume much of her role made the cutting room floor. )Malick has always been an accomplished filmmaker and wisely surrounds himself with gifted technicians when assembling a film crew. This is yet another of his well-crafted films that boasts perfect compositions, memorable imagery, and intriguing photography by Emmanuel Lubezki. ( Special kudos must also be mentioned to the film's production design by Jack Fisk, musical score by the talented Alexandre Desplat, and special effects by Brian Cross and Ryan Roundy. ) Malick's films are remotely intelligent exercises, visceral studies that tend to deal with big issues that usually dwarf his storyline and characters. Such is the case again here. In the enormous scope of Malick's work, the plot and character development are small. It's the pictures that got BIG! Too BIG in fact! Scenes that are strikingly beautiful and stunningly shot overpower a lame script that makes the actors mere props servicing his universal theme. Credit Malick as the fine director he is, but fault him as his own writer, with far too many ideas to communicate and explore and no self-editing in his artistic journey. Yes, life and death are the real stars in The Tree of Life. Everything else is visual trickery. Never has a film looked more alluring and artfully presented. The film basks in its high pedigree and stylish cinematic panache. Yet one has to ultimately admit that The Tree of Life, though a remarkable and sumptuous feast for the eyes, is not a feast for the soul as Malick intended. It left me wanting more ( and, at many times, less ), just as life sometime does. GRADE: BNOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just watch it and go under its spell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just go &amp; see the film and let it wash over you like a piece of music. Like Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring or J S Bach, the film can be enjoyed as a deluge of emotions. I stopped trying to make sense of the film in a linear way after 5 minutes, and just let it take me away like a dream. The photography is a always arresting. I have no idea what Sean Penn is doing in his office, but, as someone who likes looking at buildings, the capture of the architecture in the Penn scenes was breathtaking. This film did remind me of 2001, but the big difference is Tree of Life is awash with emotions and has an extraordinary ability to provoke memories in a visceral way. I grew up in the 1950s, with a brother and a sister. My family was nothing like the one you see in the film but the film captured the looks between the children, the suppressed emotions of family life, the intensely physical play of the boys, in a way I found astonishing. It captured how, in childhood, home is all you know. Before you go out into the world, your back yard and your family are your universe. It conveyed how a suburban garden can encompass both heaven and hell. I'm not religious, and I don't believe in god (though I do find religious music beautiful, including Bach and gospel music) but I didn't feel I was being preached a religious message. The scene on the beach at the end did not suggest to me baptism, or absolution or an afterlife. Just the sense that you have to forgive your parents and accept what they did, for better and worse, in order to feel psychologically whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At the end of the year no other film released in 2011 will have reached the same levels of ambition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tree of Life is a metaphysical journey that centers on a family, living through 1950s American suburbia. The patriarch of this family is Mr O'Brien (Brad Pitt). He works in a factory and believes in trying to toughen his sons up because kindness doesn't allow people to succeed. He himself is a failed musician, who still loves the piano. Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) is a far more timid parent, an almost angelic figure. We watch as one of the boys, Jack (Hunter McCracken), grows up and starts rebelling against his controlling father. Shifting to the future and Jack (Sean Penn) is stuck in a modern corporate future. He's still reeling over the death of his brother during the Vietnam War and has had a recent fallout with his father. As these characters question their faith, we are taken back in time to see how the roots of the Earth came to be. At the end of the year no other film released in 2011 will have reached the same levels of ambition as The Tree of Life. The winner of the Palme d'Or is not a masterpiece or writer/director Terrence Malick's best film. That arguably belongs to The Thin Red Line (1998). It's a deeply flawed picture: overlong, inflated and vague. And yet without these issues you would not have a film of the same scope and imagination. Some early reviews have labelled the film pretentious. But with Hollywood bereft of new ideas, can you really lament an auteur like Malick for his determined innovation? This is an experienced but sparse filmmaker, who is extremely selective about his material. In his last two films, The Thin Red Line and The New World (2005), Malick attributed warfare to be an extension of modernity, a corrupter of the human soul and the natural world. But his argument in this picture is even more sophisticated: that evil has existed from the very roots of evolution, through man and nature, time and space. The most cinematic representation of this is in a twenty minute montage of the formation of the earth. It covers the violent explosions of the Big Bang, right into the dinosaur age, as one prehistoric creature slaps its paws down onto the skull of another. In placing this episode deep into the film Malick avoids imitating the opening of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to enhance the unique thematic concerns of his own film. In moments of grief the characters phase the question, assumedly addressing God, 'where were you?' The placement of this montage suggests they are asking in their minds how they reached this point in time, where God allowed us to become a part of a violent nature.But the film is most engaging when Malick returns to the suburbia to develop the characterisation of the family. Malick was born in Texas, during this same era, so these scenes hold an additional power for being autobiographical. And we assume that there is also a personal level of guilt here too, as we see the boys growing up, developing the flaws of ordinary people. The images of a new born baby are juxtaposed with moments of jealousy and self-importance. Malick's formal control over these scenes is delicate. He uses tight framing and low angle shots to give a child-like perspective of curiosity to people and objects. There's truth in this because children always see adults as giants. And Mr. O'Brien becomes a God-like figure, from whom Jack gradually separates himself. O'Brien is unrelentingly repressive. He's frustrated that his dream has already failed but also determined to show his sons the correlation between ruthlessness and survival. Pitt is sublime; perfectly cast as a raw and painful representation of failed ambition. He embodies this character's toughness, aggression and self resentment. And Jessica Chastain, an actress I'm admittedly not familiar with, shows tremendous maturity with a performance of the rarest kind. Her inner torment is displayed not through words but through the most fragile expressions of a deeply passive individual. What a beautiful talent. But the tension between O'Brien and Jack is so honest and powerful that some of the scenes in Pitt's absence feel amiss. It's often deliberate, showing how children drift through life, but several scenes lose their meaning and could have been shortened considerably.Heavy criticism has been directed at Sean Penn's portion of the film, mostly because of its ambiguity. For an actor of his calibre, Penn is underused, with little to say or do. Nonetheless, he still has a face that is effortlessly repressed. Symbolism remains equally dense here, often to a fault, but Malick's selective use of colour is intelligent. He contrasts the natural greenery of the suburbs and the dream world with a cold, isolated, dystopia. It's a steel coated nightmare, overrun by thick, grey corporate towers and glass windows that remind us of the world's mindless ambitions and social barriers. "The worlds gone to the dogs," Jack says bluntly. There are endless visual cues like this requiring decryption. And many of these are a pleasure to resolve, provided you have the patience. It's assuring that there is a director willing to let an audience to think for themselves. Two people left during the first forty minutes but most stayed and a few applauded. Whether you grasp the entire scope or not, it would be difficult to admit that you weren't at one point moved by the performances or curious about the visual composition. How many Hollywood pictures will you be able to say that about this year?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An appreciable result for an ambitious intention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exploring the mystery of life, trying to offer an all-comprehensive perspective is certainly an ambitious project, and this movie, indeed, does not hide its ambitious intention, since from its beginning, which gives the explanation for the origin of human species, and where the use of elaborate images makes the viewer realize that we are going to see something original and big-thinking. The movie gets more and more involving as we get in contact with the life of a normal family, the fragmentation of shots and the anti-linear sequences, are no doubt original although sometimes tiring to follow, but we feel gradually captured by its increasing depth. There's nothing exceptional in this life, as in most families, but there's life, there's emotion, there is love and hatred, suffering, joy, an urgency to grow up. Nothing exceptional as I said, but the depth of every single life lies in its unexceptionality, and uniqueness at the same time, in those deep questions stirring in each of us, at least in each person living consciously and asking questions about the meaning of things. Very talented performances help convey the real intention of the director, and the result appears convincing, although sometimes a little puzzling. Not a pretentious but certainly a big-thinking movie, in the end we perceive the humble need for a kind of spirituality, in any form one may conceive it. The finale is really mesmerizing, the force of vivid images together with the power of music make it emotionally strong and intense. There's no doubt we are only a blink within the infinity of the universe, but always moved by the need to transcend our finiteness, to find or simply look for a meaning which goes beyond the limited space and time of our worldly lives. That's what I got and most liked in this movie, which far from being the masterpiece it constantly strives to be, is certainly worth seeing, at least for the depth of its content and for the original art direction.</fullReview>

It was like the director wanted to put as much art house as he could in it and in doing so, he has enormously over art housed it into a tragically slow, meandering, pretentious art for art's sake type of disaster that left the audience in our cinema either unable to decide if they had enjoyed it or had been tortured and worst still; half of the cinema was laughing.If you like to be entertained, don't see this film. If you like going to art galleries, don't see this film.If you like watching a 2 hour video of people looking at paintings, then this will be right up your street.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lack of dialogue. Slow to the point of being boring to tears. This is an awful film. The family story is most unoriginal - seen at least a thousand times - but presented in the most unashamed, conceited manner. So that we see it's inarticulate development side by side with - nonetheless - the evolution of the universe and life on earth. At one point, you feel you are watching Jurassic Park. Yes, there are dinosaurs as well. Can you believe it? They have the same business being in this film as my grandmother. Supposedly, this is the story of a family. Yet, one of the three brothers is completely ignored. To the point that one has difficulty identifying him in the movie. Sean Penn has no discernible role. Pitt's character is a stereotyped caricature. The mother does not speak. Do yourself a favour, go and see a different film.</fullReview>

I was bored out of my mind waiting for this to go somewhere, to have an inkling of meaning and to stop being a melancholic feast of depression whilst pointing out the shear pointlessness of a human life. About an hour and a half in, I suddenly realised that my own life was much more interesting than this film. I had bills to pay on the internet, food shopping and washing to do. Not to mention my tax return.So I walked out.Wait for DVD and roll up a fat one before bothering with this waste of talent and time. Malick should make more films.

		<shortDescription>Life: an odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a film. It isn't often that I get to have such a spellbinding cinematic experience. The best two examples of films that are at least somewhat similar are "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Koyaanisqatsi". Neither those films and "The Tree of Life" are perfect, but then I don't think any film is. At the same time, I think they come somewhat close. However, these films have something very particular in common: they really bore certain people. I saw "The Tree of Life" with three guys I know. Two seemed to be unsure what to think of it, but one said it's among the worst films he's seen. It obviously wouldn't be fair for me to judge him on that and I showed respect to him. He asked, along these lines, why would the film spend over two hours for messages on loving one another and whatnot when they're things we already know? I didn't have an answer, but maybe it's to embed them into you, regardless if you already know.I know little about what a tree of life is. It isn't explained in the film and I don't feel like extensively researching it. Nonetheless, according to Wikipedia, it is "a many-branched tree illustrating the idea that all life on earth is related". This is probably why there is the beginning scene of the dinosaurs and the ending scene of the various people on the beach. The main story focuses on a nuclear family living in a suburban neighbourhood during the 1950s. Brad Pitt plays the father, a strict and hard-boiled man who *can* also be caring and loving. Sean Penn only has little screen time as Jack, a grown-up man of one of the boys in the family who now seems lost in his life and reflects on it. The family in the '50s have their share of ups and downs. There's the occasional and gentle voice-over from a few of them about things like loving, nature, and grace. One particular thing I don't understand is the father(?) and one of the sons in the attic. Even so, I find it interesting and that goes for the other things I don't understand.The film feels very dream-like with its visuals, music, and voice-overs. Loads of precision must've gone in to make it. It's completely embracing. The characters are believable and I cared about them. To me, the film never drags on. Probably my absolute favourite shot is the spiral of the church glass, even though it's less than a few seconds long. This film will probably be nominated for a few, if not many, Oscars, like Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Picture. Mark my words.This is a film that has to be watched differently than Hollywood blockbusters. It requires relaxation. You have to experience the film's unusual artistry, even if it can sometimes qualify as art for the sake of art. To me, there's nothing wrong with that, as long as it's engaging. Even though at least a few of the messages are admittedly clichéd, I don't care. The film actually got me thinking about my life, like the joy of hanging out with other guys I really know on the same day before I saw the film. I don't remember the last film that did that, though it was probably "127 Hours". Still, it happens rarely.I unfortunately haven't seen any of Terrence Malick's other films, but with making "The Tree of Life", it's like he was channeling Stanley Kubrick in a way. Malick must've had a lot of passion. Only time will tell if this film becomes a classic, but I hope it does. I look forward to repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick's Job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The poet, painter, engraver, visionary, William Blake spent over 40 of his 70 years illustrating the Book of Job and his final set of 21 engravings brought him his greatest recognition as an engraver and visual artist, but not until after his death. He worked in almost total anonymity in his lifetime and was misunderstood and unappreciated. The engravings are remarkable for the subtle complexity of the symbols. The story of Job was obviously an important one to Blake.The story of Job is important to Terrence Malick too. The words which open the film from Chapter 38 when God answering Job's complaints about why he and his family are being unjustly punished God speaks from within a whirlwind, "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" Basically God answers the question of the existence of evil in the world by showing that unless you understand the whole of existence you cannot understand the parts.Malick sets about showing the viewer both the good and evil that exists in the world and he names them "the way of Grace and the way of Nature". The loss of a dearly beloved son and brother much before his time is the dramatic vehicle to attempt to "justify the ways of God to man" and why he allows the existence of good and evil in creation. If the question of good and evil is "prattle" or "pretentious" then what questions are worthy of pondering? On the visual level the film is stunning and the cinematography and camera work incredible. The "child eye" angles, the swooping, swerving, circling, movement capture my memory of growing up. The story is driven by the images and not through dialogue which I see makes some uncomfortable. The acting is also marvelous given the same "limitations" of plot development and narrative.I grew up in the 50's and for me the film does a masterful job of recreating the flow and rhythm of those times and the frustrations of growing up in America then. It is not an easy task Malick attempting and for me he succeeds completely.I knew before the film was released that this film would be greeted by derision by those viewers who need to be told directly what a film is about and that people who appreciate subtlety in art would appreciate another Malick masterpiece. He has been working 40 years towards this achievement. I remember the reception "2001 A Space Odyssey" received in 1968 and how it is looked on now. In '68 a majority of professional film critics got "2001" wrong. I think the positive critical response to "The Tree of Life" in 2011 came in part because of the genius of Stanley Kubrick leading the way making films which challenge the audience. Thank you to Stanley and Terrence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a thought - provoking experience about life's mysteries and purpose. A landmark to come .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>" The Tree of Life " is the most original film I think I've ever seen. Its unlike any other film I have ever seen. But its more than a film. Its an experience. The plot is about a man , Jack , played by Sean Penn. He seems lost, and empty. It becomes evident he's questioning life, his existence and purpose. This causes him to relate to where life began. This beginning part of the film consists of beautiful imagery. This part shows images such as cosmic explosions, landmasses expanding, space , and even dinosaurs. This part is superly - significant to the film though. These parts are accompanied by these eerie and mysterious voice - overs, that have us thinking about them while we're watching. In my opinion, I think Jack thinks of the beginning of the world because, its where all existence began. We often think of our lives. We think of how all of this began. And this part, I very much improved the movie.Then Jack references back to his childhood, growing up in Waco, Texas in the 1950's . This part is focused on a lot more than the creation of the universe . And it should be. Because what I think this part represents is Jack trying to understand his own life, on a personal ,and a realistic level. So he thinks about his childhood , where he learned and experienced lots of life's wonders. He, and his 2 younger brothers explore the area, nature. They're guided by their two parents. Brad Pitt plays Mr O'Brien . He is more strict and and old - fashioned. But the way Brad Pitt portrayed him was perfect. He makes him strict, of course, but makes him just as much a loving and caring parent. He just can be too hard on his kids. He wants them to be what they want to be. And live life to its fullest. You figure this out when he says he could have been a piano player. But the fact is , he's not a bad person at all. He's just old school . And at no point do we think " geez what an abusive father " . Then there's the mother , played by Jessica Chastain, in a much more quiet, but equally impressive performance. She embodies spirit, nature, love , and patience. She is some-what passive to her husband , because he's not afraid to be hard on the kids. But she is still a good parent. She understands her children. She loves them dearly. She plays with them outside. The entire movie doesn't have a whole lot of dialog, and her character has very little. But what Chastain does here is great. She is all body language. Just by the way she moves or looks, or her facial expressions, you know what she's feeling in a very specific way. There is a voice-over in which she says "there are two ways in life. The way of NATURE, and the way of GRACE . " Brad Pitt embodies nature. Strong, unflinching, and can even be somewhat destructive. But again , Brad Pitt is not a villain . And grace. The mother. Spirt. Earth. Graceful. Soft-spoken. Well either way, this is a film unlike no other. I really can't stop thinking about it. It really unravels questions. And this a very subjective film, a part which makes it so great. It asks so many questions. Some parts you are certain mean something, but you try to figure out why. I saw this film 2 weeks ago, and I'm trying to come up with my very own opinion of how to feel about it. Everyone will interpret this film in many different ways. But that's the beauty of it. Its not something like " Inception " where you're confused, and you're dying to know what is happening, and what the answers are. In here though, you're not confused, but full of thoughts and questions . Even if you're on the fence about this film , go see it . In a summer filled with lame , generic comedies ; mindless , heartless action flicks ; and other mainstream waste, ... " The Tree of Life " is really something new. You will only hate the film if you don't give it a chance, and walk out in the middle of it . This is a film that you must watch to the very end to really be blown away, and left asking what all of it meant. Its also very visual and beautiful . Every scene has a certain naturalistic beauty to it. But more importantly , it will make you think , and will make you become part of a beautiful experience.</fullReview>

The former half, with its stunning visuals of the developing Earth, sets a mood of wonder for the film's duration. The latter half tells the heart-wrenching story of the O'Brien family. These segments allow viewers to compare Earth's life to human nature, with their shared fragility and imperfection.Mrs. O'Brien is a manifestation of the "Way of Grace": kind, unconditionally loving, and readily willing to take insult and abuse. Mr. O'Brien epitomizes the "Way of Nature": harsh, self-centered, and mainly concerned with his own comfort and satisfaction. The strong clash of the couple's personalities sparks intense frustration and confusion in their son Jack. The boy's torrent of emotion forces him to let go of his childhood innocence very early on.Jack's bitterness with discovering humanity seems to stick with him into adulthood. However, with intense contemplation of his mother's words regarding the "Way of Grace", Jack finds the solace he's been searching for. He realizes that life is full of imperfection, but he can make the best of it by living with a sense of love for all he meets. He may not have control over the whole world, but he can control how he impacts it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Jack's voice all the way through. Sometimes captured in the voices he remembers as his younger self, his mother, father, brother. Penn is the older Jack. Reflecting on what his life has been. How it all is a part of the grand universe.This story is fragments of memories, and the one long passage - it's the older Jack putting things into perspective. Like we all do. What's important to us at the time, when we are children understanding the world. What makes us who we are. Taking in what has come before our birth, and what come after. It's all connected. Insignificant at one level, our lives. It's everything.The scene with the dinosaurs is a key scene. Habitating in a world. The rap-tor-like dinosaur runs out to an injured horned animal. Ready to pounce. Then, shows something. The way you would treat a brother. Jack's version of how he sees it.The fragmented story is the way we recall our memories. Watching this movie, I can see why the "give me bang now" audience might get bored and "that's enough already!" You'd want it to end. The final 20 minutes - that's the test. But if you consider it's Jack's trip, you might get it.If taken that it's the adult Jack's memory that is the main character, you'll appreciate it more. The sliding chair. A ghost. That's all in Jack's mind.So much more is here. I want to see this 100 times. I might just scratch the surface. Best Malick so far. Thanks Terry for everything, especially Days of Heaven and this one. If you retire now, I will be sad, but I understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Biblical Parable Of Epic Proportions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand this is not a movie for most folks, but I thought it was fascinating. Just to make sure, I watched it again a few days later and had an even-higher opinion of it.Whether Terrence Malick intended this or not, I found the film to be very Biblically-oriented, a very spiritual film. It opens with Scripture and ends with a heaven-like scene with the words "I give you my son!" Throughout the movie we seen the earth in its beginning stages while also being told a parable of grace versus nature in the form of 1950s family from Texas.That battle between grace/love vs. man's nature is played out especially well between a father and one of his sons. Brad Pitt, as the dad, "Mr. Obrien," and Hunter McCracken as 12-year-old "Jack" excel in here, particularly McCracken whose facial expressions alone are haunting. Anyone who has grown up with a stern-but-loving father and less threatening and loving mother can identify with this story. Jessica Chastain as the mom (Mrs. Obrien) also provides numerous haunting looks. She plays a very understated, billing-wise, but important role in the story.As in all Malick films, the visuals range from very good to astounding. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, along with Production Designer Jack Fisk have captured many memorable images in this 2-hour, 19-minute piece of work. Looking at this in high-def is a real treat.Speaking of "treats," the soundtrack to this movie is epic. Never before I have heard so many classical pieces in one film, and they sound glorious. "The Tree of Life" is just as much an audio experience as it is a video. It helps, too, when you appreciate the story!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE TREE OF LIFE, Terrence Malick, 2011.Every once in a very rare while a film comes along that not only changes your view of cinema and filmmaking but your view on your whole existence. For me, The Tree of Life is unquestionably a film of this nature.The Tree of Life is only legendary director Terrence Malick's 5th film since 1973, and is a non-linear journey through Malick's memories, thoughts and beliefs. Oh, and there's even time to fit in astonishing sequences of the creation and evolution of the universe! There's so much content here but the strongest feeling I got is that Malick is interested in where we come from, both as individuals and as inhabitants of planet earth. What makes us who we are? Also the Job-like musings of why bad things happen to good and innocent people. But what is evident most of all is that this is a form of autobiography.The 'plot' and that is a loosely used term here, centres around flashbacks of an architect Jack (Sean Penn) who remembers his childhood and the brother who (we find out v early on in the film, and which was true in Malick's real life) would end up dying at just 19. On this note Brad Pitt is excellent as Jack's father and Jessica Chastain as Jack's mother who both shape young Jack (clearly an autobiographical version of Malick himself), and the child actors (in particular Hunter McCracken as young Jack) are tremendous too.Another point worthy of mention is the score by Alexandre Desplat (who also did the Kings Speech) and also features original music from Mahler, Bach, Berlioz and Tavener.The only downside that people may point to is the older Jack (Sean Penn) was a bit of a one note character and could've been fleshed out more.But that's all I can really criticise. Malick bares all in this beautiful film; his guilt, his shame, his regrets, his life. I don't think I've seen a film in which a director gives so much of himself, and if you know anything about the reclusive, secretive man Malick is (he hasn't even a public interview since the 1970s for example) then this is even more remarkable.Hypnotic. Mesmerising. Moving.... Malick Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Return to Ambitious Filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm so glad The Tree of Life has both thrilled and annoyed audiences because it's a film that reaches for a very high branch on the cinematic tree. Every filmmaker wants to make good movies--me included--but we create within the confines of our times. Malick seems to have ignored what most of his fellow established filmmakers have been producing, and chosen a course that is both intimate and grand, bordering on grandiose, and outside of what an average audience expects on a Saturday night. He's not being pretentious, because that would suggest an ego in service only to itself; he's being ambitious. It's as if he wants to wrap his arms around the profound questions of creation, both the universal, and the small steps of a baby growing into a man, and share his feelings, visions and memories of it. The movie is like our own memories--sad, sweet, half-remembered,--and told with more originality-per-minute than a stack of blockbusters out this summer. I understand if not everyone can connect to Malick's ambitious film about life and what it feels like for a young family in Texas, but I do hope that critics of it will appreciate the honest heart that made it, and demand more from movies, and movie makers, than just distracting entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film of the decade. Simply Flawless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick directed his first feature film, Badlands, in 1973 and subsequently has made only four films since then. Each is a masterpiece of film making, and I am very happy to say The Tree of Life is no exception. Quite possibly, it is his most important and most heartbreakingly beautiful film to date.The film does not follow a typical narrative structure - we see Jack as a man, Jack as a young boy, Jack as a baby, Jack in the afterlife, and the creation of life itself - all weaved across 140 magical minutes. There has been much written about the meaning of this film and the messages and symbolism Malick may (or may not) be telling us. I am not writing to discuss that - that is for another essay all on its own. Moreover, 'understanding' the film in that depth of detail won't necessarily enhance my viewing pleasure any more than it could possibly be right now. What will enhance it is repeated viewings, and this is a film I will watch over and over again for years to come.Let me begin with the creation of life sequence. The beauty of Malick's work technique he has to 'capture' moments and place them on film for our viewing pleasure; nothing ever seems forced or deliberate, but natural and organic. When I heard that he was using CGI for a large segment of his new film, I was immediately intrigued to see what he would do. I knew it wouldn't be some ILM-created digital world, but nothing could have prepared me for a 22 minute sequence which holds the attention unlike anything I'd seen before. I had purposefully stayed away from reviews and essays before seeing the film for myself, and was unsurprised to read afterwards that Malick had indeed worked with Douglas Trumbull to create the effects - it is the single greatest visual feast for the senses we have witnessed since 2001: A Space Odyssey. Using fluorescent dyes, flares, CO2, paints, chemicals, and even milk to create the effects, this sequence MUST be seen at the cinema to do it justice. It is beyond special effects. I won't even begin to describe its visual beauty, but I am happy to admit it brought a tear to my eye - this is what every film lover wants to see, and seeing it was an emotional experience.The Tree of Life immerses the viewer with shots and scenes of pure cinematic poetry - this is the experience of cinema at its grandest. The 70mm sequences (if only the whole film were shot this way!); his trademark low tracking shots through grass; his trademark low angles, looking up a man and nature; the voice-over and narration; the classical score; It is all there throughout the film.The lighting and cinematography is a thing of beauty in itself - the innocent soft whites of the 1950s, and the metallic, harsh palate of the modern day. It was interesting to see Malick's first representation of the present day on film, as all other films tale place in the past. The low angles are distorted by glass ceilings, the tall trees replaced by skyscrapers, Sean Penn rides an elevator as the scenery disappears behind him. Malick does not seem happy with the modern world, yet his style never flags, not for a second. We can tell so much of his thoughts with what the camera does - it is a talent unlike no other. His camera rarely stays still and the sense of movement is so natural, floating around the characters and scenery, that we get caught up in its flow, taken along in the journey of just a few seconds, before the next one begins. Malick doesn't linger on shots for too long, but scenes like the perfectly framed shot of the new born baby's foot between the hands of Brad Pitt stays in the memory long after it is over - perfection.I can not fault this film. To me, it is film making of the highest order and has no equal. Yet I understand why many people will not enjoy it. They will say it is boring as there is no plot; they will say it is two or three different films put together and neither fit the others; they will say it makes no sense. I say the same thing about 75% of the new films released. Each person enjoys different things. Moreover, The Tree Of Life doesn't have the same level of enjoyment I get from such greats as The Godfather, Taxi Driver, The Searchers, The Apartment, or even Malick's The Thin Red Line.What it does have is a unique quality that I had not seen before, and a cinematic experience I may never have again.VERDICT - 10 OUT OF 10. Flawless film making and a true experience for the master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad achievement? first time I walked out of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** This review definitely contains spoilers ***Wow, just scrolling over the user reviews here shows that the opinions are very much mixed on this film. I am sorry to say that I am with the ones that are negative about this film.Yesterday I went to see "The Tree Of Life" with high expectations. I am not familiar with Terrence Malick's movies but I was drawn by the names of Brad Pitt and Sean Penn. Quality stuff? or so I thought. This is now the first time EVER that I walked out of a movie and - mind you - I have seen quite a few, ranging from very very good to very very dull. This one I found unbearable.I am a sucker for slow storytelling and it takes a lot for me to find a movie too slow, but something is not right when I start thinking to myself while I am watching the beginning: "OK, they could have left this out". At the BEGINNING of a movie! All the way through the first half hour I was thinking: "when is this movie actually going to start?" To me, that first half hour did not contain any storytelling. After endless images of beautiful landscapes (very befitting a BBC-documentary) with a very odd short bit about dinosaur-like creatures in there I thought there was finally going to be some sort of story. And there was, to my relief, albeit not a real story in my view but more a collection of short scenes. However it clearly depicted the family dynamics and gave a good impression of the tyranny of the Brad Pitt character.And then, without rhyme or reason, the family moves house and a sequence of incomprehensible scenes (for example the one in which characters of past and present mingle on the beach) begins all over again. This, combined with the whispered comments (those really got on my nerves) all through the movie were too much for me and I decided to call it a night. I am not proud of walking out but I really couldn't take it any longer, especially since I knew I was only about two thirds in. I was not the first one to leave the cinema by the way.It has to be said that the imagery and photography of this movie were flawless, but that is really all the praise I can give. I just did not understand it, obviously I am too thick for this kind of movie.A loose thing that bothered me is that the son who dies is 19 years old, but the actress playing his mother (Jessica Chastain) does not look a day older than 25 when she receives the telegram about his death right at the beginning of the movie. I was irritated by that right away and that stayed with me all the way through. Changing a woman's hair from 'down' to 'up' does not necessarily make her look older, Terrence. A little bit more effort in that respect would have been good.I am happy that there are reviews here giving this movie 10 out of 10, because that only shows that movie-goers are a diverse audience. A chacun son go?t! It was just not mon go?t.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Tree of Life" is visually very beautiful; has the names of Sean Penn and Brad Pitt in the cast; but unfortunately has no story and the result is an overrated, boring and pretentious film. An acquaintance of mine said that "The Tree of Life" is a pseudo-intellectual crap for pseudo- intellectual viewers and critics. I liked and found very appropriate his comment. The good thing is, you can read e-mails, access Internet and do other things while watching this film; otherwise you may take a nap like I did the two other times that I tried to see this pointless movie. My vote is one.Title (Brazil): "A Árvore da Vida" ("The Tree of Life")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth?" The Book of JobIn the spirit of Terrence Malick's other four feature films, The Tree of Life is a visual poem about the big issues of life such as creation, innocence, and death. The cinematography is sublime, from big bang images to sunsets and dooryards, all meticulously crafted to support the epic impression of a 1950's family living out life amid hope and despair.Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt) and Mrs. Obrien (Jessica Chastain) have three sons. One is most normal, Jack (Hunter McCracken), who gets into the usual trouble; and one is artistic,who dies at 19. Mr. O'Brien is a stern father with edges of refinement such as the classical music he shares with the family; Mrs. mostly looks ethereal and endures her husband's control. As she says, "There are two ways through life: the way of nature, and the way of Grace. You have to choose which one you'll follow." Hers is grace.Cut to Jack in middle age (Sean Penn) struggling with the father's stern legacy and his brother's death. And that's all there is, folks; the rest of the film is comprised of stunning images to serve the poetic background of the narrative, such as it is. Among the memorable moments is a toddler inspecting his recently-born baby brother and its parallel shot of a dinosaur stepping on the head of a reclining animal as the dino inspects and considers.The final scene on the beach in the afterlife with everyone happy and interacting is a tour de force of sentiment and existentialism, but not a big help in the narrative category. The abstractions rule for Malick, not the story, and I love the metaphysics and the art work. Malick was probably influenced by this thought from Walt Whitman: "In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass, I find letters from God dropped in the street, and every one is signed by God's name. And I leave them where they are, for I know that wherever I go, others will punctually come for ever and ever." "Song of Myself" If you want a linear tale, go see Thor; otherwise enjoy film at its visual and philosophical best. It is one of the best films of 2011</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Monumental Achievement in Cinema History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since watching Terrence Malick's latest masterpiece The Tree of Life a few days ago I have attempted to write a review at least 5 times. There is no way to write a review of The Tree of Life that can adequately describe the experience of watching the film. I am going to attempt to describe the film's details, but even that will not do it justice. Terrence Malick works in a unique way. Malick does not go for traditional narrative storytelling, his films seem to abandon storytelling all together, but his films always feel as if you are watching a structured story. Malick is not interested in dialog, most of his films running time are essentially silent. Malick is a big fan of using voice-over, his films deal with his characters inner story which most of the time is the opposite of the visuals and "story" being told. Malick uses imagery and silent passages to tell his stories, or the essence of his stories. To watch a Terrence Malick film the viewer must disregard every type of preconceived notion of what a movie is and how a movie should be presented. Malick's films ask philosophical questions about human nature, man's relationship to nature, the existence of God and the soul, but most importantly his films always ask Why. They ask questions that have no answer, but the questions cause the viewer to think about how insignificant human life is in a universe that is infinite. Malick's latest film, The Tree of Life, is far and away his most ambitious film, and easily the most ambitious film ever made. Malick incorporates essentially everything in The Tree of Life. The film which on the surface is the story of the O'Brien family and the summer days that they occupy in a small Texas town in the 1950s, also summarizes The Big Bang and a spiritual realm, but is never preachy or even religious. The film details the freedom of summertime for children, and the relationships between Mother, Father and their three sons. The eldest is Jack (played by newcomer Hunter McCracken as a young boy, and by Sean Penn as a middle aged man) the film is from his point of view. As a boy who is reaching the age where he can be influenced, where his body begins to betray him, where he is reaching that age when the battle to become an adult and the longing to stay a child conflict, Jack is seen as an inquisitive boy who begins to question the polar differences between this father (Brad Pitt in his most mature and best performance) and his mother (a lovely, milky white Jessica Chastain) who take different approaches to parenting. Father is a walking contradiction, he is a man of strength, he demands respect in the strictest ways, he is also a lover of classical music, he plays the piano for pleasure, he is affectionate and loving with his three sons offering hugs and kisses whenever possible. Father is a good man, but he strikes fear in his children. Mother is like an angel, giving her children only love and affection, never punishing them or causing them any type of harm. The film begins with the news that the O'Brien's middle son has died at the age of nineteen. The film follows their grief, and their questioning...Why? The film then shows Jack as an adult, who is conflicted in his daily life and the experiences he had as a child. In a voice over narration a character asks God "What are you?" The film then goes back to the beginning of time and in beautiful images shows the birth of the universe, the planets, the earliest lifeforms on earth and the evolution of life. Here is where the film provokes most thought. When the evolution process slows and focuses on the interaction of two dinosaurs, questions about that interaction arise. Why do these creatures behave this way, what is it's reasoning, and what does this behavior mean? The film ends this portion with the birth of Jack, then the film follows the O'Brien family as two more sons are born, and the relationships between the family members are developed. The film is a collage of images used to tell a family history. The film's final act is about Jack, now middle aged, but still haunted by his childhood and the death of his brother. I cannot remember if a character asked "What happens next?" but for some reason I feel very strongly that those words were uttered in voice over. The film then moves past life existing on earth and goes into the beyond. Here where family members reunite in joy and harmony. Where parents are forgiven and redemption is achieved. And in a film that openly states that human life is unimportant, not that life has no meaning, but that humans may not leave a mark during their brief time in the universe, the film does offer an answer to what is important in life...Love. The only thing that humans can give to one another is love and to live without it is not to live at all.The film's beautiful images washed over me, creating a sense of awe where I did not take my eyes off the screen once. The film's emotional power, taken from those images is unimaginable. As the movie progressed I kept having this heaviness in my heart, while my mind was spinning with questions. There was a sense of an inner experience I was having that I have not felt from any other movie experience. I have been a great believer and advocator of Terrence Malick's work for over a decade, which began after seeing The Thin Red Line. I knew how he worked, how he arranges his films like symphonies, but nothing from those past experiences with a Malick film prepared me for The Tree of Life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Important Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I walked out of the theater, I felt the way that people must have when they saw Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, or 8 1/2 in theaters for the first time. "I've just seen something terribly important. Something that must, by its nature, change things." Tree of Life demands attention, and I for one was glad to give it my utmost.In the theater a man I had not met before took a set behind my girlfriend and me. He and I spoke briefly about reviews we had seen for Tree of Life and our expectations, which led into a quick talk about Takashi Miike's 13 Assassin's. He had seen it, and I am excited to do so this next week. When the lights dimmed we wished each other a good viewing and drew silent. I'm normally the kind of person who talks a bit during a movie, making a quick comment about this or that piece of action on screen. Tree of Life kept me completely silent. When it ended, not a person moved until all of the credits had run. In contemplative silence, we got up to leave. As we walked out of the theater, I turned to the man who had sat behind me and started talking about the film. He and I spoke, briefly, but deeply, about what we had just seen. It was, we agreed, important that others see this.I won't say that this is the best movie ever made. There are a lot of factors that could be argued go into what makes "the best," and there are some well entrenched favorites in the debate (the above mentioned films certainly fall into that category). However, I will say that I have never watched any movie that was greater, in scope of vision, or in the skill with which that vision was handled. I would call this the greatest movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Kaleidoscope of Images and Ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tree of Life is such a rare film to experience that it truly feels like an instant classic. Up there in ranks to those great films which at the time ushered in a new generation of film making (such as the Chaplin's first films to usher in true narratives in cinema, Star Wars and The Godfather, 2001: Space Odyssey, etc.). However, even though it appears that way, I do not believe that a new direction or new age in cinema is upon us yet. Why? Because the breakthrough that the Tree of Life makes is truly next to impossible to replicate. The breakthrough here is Terrence Malick's ability to give voice to what goes on in ones mind through a significant part of ones life. Our thoughts, our emotions, as a child growing up to the point in our lives where it feels like we're coming to an end. Its these thoughts and these emotions which are so clearly defined and far reaching that are so beautifully and honestly put down on film that makes this one of the greatest pieces of cinema to ever be conceived and produced. The Tree of Life is a film so perfectly executed that it will no doubt withstand the test of time. It also presents the same ideas that so many books, poems, songs, and films have striven for but never achieves. Malick can be seen and felt here as being able to truly give voice to the stream of consciousness and cache and flow of memories that we ALL have. Think about that for a moment, think about how each and every person has a different interpretation of the world we live in with staggering amounts of similar interpretations in bits and pieces. Now think about how it's almost impossible for people to conceptualize other people's interpretations of the world simply because none of us are able to truly live the lives of others. The fact that Malick is able to find the common threads in all of our lives and brilliantly put it into a narrative that we can all truly relate to on one level or another, it is something that is truly not replicable and a wholly unique experience.One might now be wondering "how about the other group of viewers, those who do not see the point in this self indulgent and overly pretentious film." Well, for those that do feel that way, nobody can say that they are in the wrong. They are a product of their environment and are so conditioned by modern cinematic and narrative trends that anything which asks the audience to put their systematic way of thinking, interpreting, and living aside for a moment and tap into that childhood frame of mind where the world was a large field of curiosities, is next to impossible. It is understandable that not everyone has held onto their childhood views of the world where absolutely anything could happen thus the only way to live is to explore, ponder, and experiment. It's extremely challenging when one watches a film like The Tree of Life that is wholly executed with the level of curiosity and imagination that is usually only in the minds of a child or teen growing up. One can also argue that the messages in The Tree of Life could have been presented just as easily using standard three part narrative structures which would be true IF the film was to have just one large overarching message. The Tree of Life however is dealing with MULTIPLE messages simultaneously. It's dealing with the meaning of life in relations to the scale of the world and the universe. It's also dealing with life growing up and how a child comes to understandings with the world and the people around them. Another narrative the film works on is how our memories are interpreted and what that means in our lives. All three of these distinct narratives (and probably more, but these are the main three which the film can be seen as from start to finish, in other words, one can watch the film at least three times, each time focusing on one narrative while ignoring the others) are made in such a way that it's ambiguous enough so that one can put ones self in place of the characters we see on screen. In a way, what some sees as self indulgent, pretentious, or overly art house abstractions are actually quite necessary because without the ambiguity and without the abstract imagery and flow, there would be no way that practically anybody can feel like they are watching their own lives playing out on the screen. Without the ambiguous and the abstract, The Tree of Life would simply be us watching another slice of life, coming of age story about someone else. It wouldn't feel as personal as the film felt.The Tree of Life is a masterfully done once in a lifetime experience that feels like a lifetime in the making for not just Terrence Malick but for the history of cinema. Regardless if one leaves the theatre thoroughly awestruck or hugely disappointed, it will make you think and it will strike up many conversations. Even if you do end up disliking The Tree of Life, the conversations and thoughts that it will provoke afterward will be priceless and worth the time spent with the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many things have and will be said about this movie. Regardless of the easy critics: it's boring, there's no action, it's self-indulging, etc.., I would only add this. There will always be 2 kinds of people (whether they are film-goers, tourists, readers..): the ones who like to "recognize" things (the same stories being told, who is the hero, who is the villain? the same places to go to, the same food...) and the ones who like to discover new things. As to the film, why don't you try it? How many films have you seen that take your hand and take you to a place you've never been before? On the contrary how often do you understand everything from the very first minutes of a movie? who is going to marry who, who is the bad guy, who's going to betray, will there be a happy end? Aren't you ever fed up with this? Try and see The Tree Of Life. It's about growing up in a family. It's about seeing the world through children's eyes. It's a very American story, and what it's like to be torn between religion, ideals and the lust for success and power and money. It's about betrayal by the people you trust. It's about love.You may not like it but at least you'll have tried. Be curious! Stop being cinematographically correct.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that must be experienced with the heart and soul.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by first saying that this movie divides a lot of opinions; some people call it "Boring and Pretentious", while others like me call it "a deeply spiritual and philosophical" movie. The story of a family in Waco, Texas in 1956. The eldest son witnesses the loss of innocence and struggles with his parents' conflicting teachings. The movie follows the story of a Texas family in the 50s. The film follows the life journey of the eldest son, Jack, his childhood to his unhappy adult years as he tries to heal a complicated relationship with his father Mr. O'Brien played by Brad Pitt. Jack, his son, played as an adult by Sean Penn, finds himself a broken man in the modern world, seeking many philosophical answers to the origins and meaning of life while questioning the existence of faith. Roger Ebert said that the: "The Tree of Life is a film of vast ambition and deep humility, attempting no less than to encompass all of existence and view it through the prism of a few infinitesimal lives. The only other film I've seen with this boldness of vision is Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and it lacked Malick's fierce evocation of human feeling. There were once several directors who yearned to make no less than a masterpiece, but now there are only a few. Malick has stayed true to that hope ever since his first feature in 1973." The Tree of Life is a deeply spiritual and philosophical movie on many levels and it is an incredibly underrated movie that unfairly gets a lot of negative reviews. Whatever you think about the Tree of Life it is a movie that must be experienced with the heart and soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the history of life has lead up to Sean Penn staring moodily into space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first: The Tree of Life is devastatingly beautiful, with the cinematography making the film's natural landscapes and beautiful actors truly shine. This in itself makes the film watchable, and perhaps even worth watching. But for me good movies aren't just about pretty images, but about ideas, and while The Tree of Life certainly has ideas, they aren't quite as deep as Terence Malick probably thinks they are.Although there are flashes backwards and forwards, the bulk of this film deals with a young boy, Jack, coming of age in 1950s suburban Waco, Texas. From the start, everything is presented idyllically, with endless scenes of a smiling Jessica Chastain frolicking in the grass with her young boy. Was anyone's childhood actually like this? Later, when things start going terribly wrong, the film is similarly unconvincing. This is a film that means to say a lot about human development, but it completely fails to capture the everyday triumphs, tragedies and tedium that defines childhood as well as adult life. This isn't a realist film, but its insistence on hyperbole mutes the effectiveness of any point that could be made.The Tree of Life's central conflict is Jack being pulled between the influence of his different family members, who are all gendered archetypes: the hard-but-secretly-loving father, the naively-kind mother, the traumatically dead brother. Malick wants to tell a story about family breakdown that serves as a metaphor for essential questions about how to live, but the problem is that this is a story and a message that we've heard many times before. In addition to the stereotypical characters, the thematic contrast between peaceful benevolence and hard- nosed realism is one that echoes the same themes of every warmongering political speech of the last century, themes that ignore that peace is usually the most truly difficult and most truly pragmatic choice. (The Waco setting and the father's military job makes a political reading easy to grasp.) Malick reaches for the universal, but comes back with the generic.The Tree of Life has its pleasures: the gorgeous cinematography mentioned above, as well as the great performances by Pitt and especially Chastain, imbuing stock characters with real life. At times, particularly in the second half, the film can be gripping in a queasy sort of way. But considering its ambitious, as well as its massive hype, I couldn't help but come away disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorite films. It poses so many questions, which is what intrigues me most: our place in the universe and its relationship in our daily lives. Presenting a movie that tries to answer that is brave and bold, and Mallick does it in such a humanistic way. The cinematography is breathtaking, the is acting superb, and I admire the soundtrack, despite so much of Desplat's work not used in the film, but is available on the commercial soundtrack. To me, "The Tree of Life" is best described as a 'human fantasia'. Despite the public's mixed reviews, I recommend this film to those who want to have something to ponder on, well, the rest of their lives. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A metaphysical Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time Terrence Mallick releases a movie, it's a big event, considered by many as one of the great masters of the 7th art, he has only directed 5 movies in a 40 years long career. The tree of life is a complex and contemplative movie about the meaning and the origin of life. The movie is divided in two different kinds of sequences. One of them shows contemplative pictures in relation with the creation, the big bang, the nature and the other is about the childhood of a boy with a tyrannical father in the 1950's. At first, I thought it was fascinating, on a visual point of view, the movie approaches perfection and the scenes in relation with the creation are quite sublime. Terrence Mallick takes you on a metaphysical journey about life and nature and I really enjoyed it. The parallel with the boy's life is brilliantly done. The different parts of the movie may seem to have nothing to do with each other but they do and the alternation between the sequences is masterly done. In addition, the movie has a superb casting with Brad Pitt, Sean Penn and the uprising star Jessica Chastain who acted in many of the greatest movies of last year with Take Shelter, The Help and of course The Tree Of life. Aside all his great qualities, The Tree Of Life has some weak points. The movie is complex, too complex and you would need to see it 20 times to maybe understand half of what Terrence Mallick tried to realize. I really enjoyed the first hour but I slowly lost interest after and until the end actually. The movie is too pretentious, the questions it raised are metaphysical, almost divine and even if I have a great respect for the all the work produced on a cinematographic point of view, I can't help myself to think that Terrence Mallick tried to make it look more significant than it really was. It tends to make the movie one of the less approachable of the last decade. I really think this is worth watching if you have any interest in cinema because this is a real experience and the picture and the direction are sublime but this is not a movie for everybody and some might get bored quiet quickly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Tree of Life is one of the most ambitious films ever made which tries to understand meaning of life. It has scenes from beginning of universe to its end. It is an emotional as well as visual treat. It is a metaphysical, psychological and spiritual inquiry into mankind's place in this universe. It is one of those movies which even after watching multiple times is difficult to comprehend. It reminds one of Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey". It is one of those movies which either you'll love and consider as great work of art or will find it pretentious, abysmally slow and self absorbed.. It's a brave attempt. Highly Recommended.

I have never got to the end, but it has a lovely suite of images with beautiful soothing music and very little dialogue. Seriously as if like me you usually have to take night pills to go to sleep, this is one of the best films to watch to stop taking them. The beautiful photography and music put your body in a rare state of peace and harmony which is perfect to find sleep. I would rate it 2 as a film because clearly a film's purpose shouldn't be to make the public sleep, but 10 health-wise for it helping me go to sleep, so overall this is why I rated it a 6.</fullReview>

As an artist, this film captures me with its grace, beauty, flawless acting, outstanding directing, spectacular music, and a mind blowing look at the world around us. Now, in the pint of view of a person who enjoys movies: this film is no doubt weird as f*** in many instances. honestly, some people might not understand what this film is about. This film requires everything the bible requires: patience, an open mind, love, hate, acceptance and denial. This film does explore the confused mind of a boy who is struggling with the ways of his parents and his own knowledge. All in all, if you have a cast mind for movies, see it. If you just like to see movies for entertainment, you will probably end up hating this film. As for me, though, this film is everything I could ask for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, I have a great idea! Let's throw some random, but spectacularly beautiful images of outer space, a creekside dinosaur fight, deaths, violence, emotional turmoil, forests, idyllic 50s small towns, and a chicken embryo together with a nearly-impossible-to-follow story about a family growing up together and their struggles and see what happens. OKAY, let's do it!Boom, you have this movie.Brad Pitt plays a seemingly bipolar, jerk of a father who is borderline physically violent towards his wife and kids. At the very least, he is emotionally distant and verbally abusive. I still don't know which of the 3 kids died or how or when. I absolutely HATE that the story jumps forward and back through time at random intervals, thus making the story very difficult to follow, get emotionally invested in, hard to pay much attention to. The story is very depressing and has no real resolution. Rather, there is what I think is intended to be a "reuniting everyone in heaven" scene at the end that does not resolve anything. At least it's a soft sell on faith and religion. Honestly, all of the cosmos footage reeks of 2001: A Space Odyssey to me. It just feels like a blatant copy of something that's already been done.Color me unimpressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I granted the film the 5 of 10 stars for three things: 1) The actors' performances were fantastic.2) Absolutely gorgeous - and I mean GORGEOUS - visuals.3) Despite the absolutely laughable results, really, A++ for effort. There's an immense amount of love put into this film and it shows.Unfortunately, there is such a thing as over-doing it, and this film is the epitome of that ten fold. Anyone can take their sweet time trying to convince you to feel a certain way, but it takes an artist to bring you to your knees with a simple phrase, a single stroke of a brush, a simple melody - or God help us, that one perfect shot.But take a song with the perfect chorus, and repeat the chorus 20 times, and you're left with genius work repeating itself so much that it completely loses its impact before you're a quarter of a way through.The kids with a nubile eye think the film was "too deep" for us, when in fact it was far too shallow - and obnoxious. Believe me, we get what it was trying to do. We got it within the first 5 minutes of the first 20-minute stretch of natural imagery - and like hearing a great chorus to a song, it really was great the first time, but not the next 15 times. This film is gorgeous, lovely, awe-inspiring, masterfully-crafted, mindblowingly pompous drivel.It's a tech demo, a display of craft across multiple fields, a mirage of wondrous light &amp; sound - but it's a terrible movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>10 stars for the kids and the mother superb performances and camera action As far as it goes in the direction of masterpiece this movie fails to bring the effect that 2001: A Space Odyssey or A Thin Red Line are able to deliver. The pathetic dinosaurs were just too much-a failed attempt.I was very impressed and moved by the story with the three children, but the rest was too much and too prolonged to hold the viewers' attention. You can't have chocolate and meat together since either you go in the dramatic story of his life direction or you go in the contemplation of the world direction in a scientific manner. This movie was just a salad with too many ingredients.Third, Sean Penn just looked older than everyone else in the movie which was really funny to me. Sean Penn should have played the father and Brad Pitt should have been the son. Sean Penn would have delivered a 5 times better performance of the father with all the inner torment. Brad Pitt would have been a good confused son wandering around in the and squinting with his eyes almost going to cry. Poor choice of the older actors and a waste of a fair sized budget for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does not belong in a cinema. It belongs in a museum of modern art running in a continuous loop. (At least "Melancholia" has a plot.)Terrence Malick's ruminations on the difficulty of balancing Nature &amp; Grace is beautiful bore.There are images in this film that are as breathtaking as any I've ever seen in cinema.The 19 minute sequence that depicts "Creation" is easily worthy of favorable comparison to "2001"'s "Voyage Beyond Infinity" sequence. I was practically floating out of my chair while watching --experiencing-- it.It also features a couple of brief dinosaur scenes which surpass any in "Jurassic Park" in terms of sheer realization &amp; beauty. This portion of the film was definitely worth the effort put into creating it.BUT there are 2 other hours of this film which occasionally stir emotions &amp; don't really connect to anything except Malick's own cosmic navel gazing. I love "2001", "Walkabout', "Koyanniqatsi" &amp; "Brazil". "The Tree Of Life" shares these films uniqueness &amp; sense of wonder but didn't connect with me on a deeper level like them.Call me a low brow, but I'll take "Caption America: The First Avenger" over this film any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand people who say they want to be entertained and not to think. It seems that thinking has become the most complicated and exhausting thing to do in life. Well, I have to say that I'm sorry for them, because turning off their brain won't take them anywhere, plus they might miss on many entertaining and beautiful things. In the case of Malick's film, the more you see it, the more you can find. It is so vast, so "free-form" that you can project anything on it and come out with an answer or at least another question. You can see the film, for example, through its use of architecture. Malick has always been interested in the image of "THE HOUSE" not only as an important character, but as the point where all characters "ARE". THE TREE OF LIFE shows three basic landscapes: The house (and neighborhood) where the O'Briens live, The house and working area where Adult Jack O'Brien inhabits, and the natural surroundings of prehistory and where Jack's inner self dwells. If you pay attention to the work of art director Jack Fisk's divided environments, you will unveil the three stages of self that Malick has carefully designed. On a second view, you can notice the influence of the internet (with its immediate visual chaos) in our life. The film is built by thousands of images, millions of colors, interiors, exteriors, images that are a cliché, others that are very intimate and new. With their unconnected nature, they form a kaleidoscope of a life, much like Ridley Scott's project LIFE IN A DAY, where thousands of people submitted their little day stories and made up a whole movie experience. Malick has connected thousands of images captured in unique unconnected moments of pure reality, to convey life's length and how we all repeat each moment as creatures of a bigger plan. Using merely generic episodes that we can relate in diverse depth we are transported to what makes our life simple, yet impossible to forget. And if each moment seems to have been taken from the Discovery Channel, or from any of the millions of web pages, you have just "discovered" the source of Malick's film: our current visual culture, made up by an information shock, at arms-length. In the scheme of things, Malick has minimized the importance of the super-man and turned it into a living thing in an ever changing universe. Another viewing would put you right on the religious aspect of man. Needing an explanation to overcome certain death, men turn to a extra-corporeal belief, which only teach them to let go. We are mortal, nothing lasts, there is nothing material that can prolong a life, and why would we want to? Each story is different yet the same. And in the episode when a Dinosaur decides not to eat a wounded one, you can interpret it as the inner force that lets life continue, or simply a strike of chance. Finally, the character that seems to tie the whole film: Jack O'Brien (Sean Penn) can't seem to find solace. He feels displaced, anxious, empty. The film puts all the images and sources available to bring Jack back from this depression, reminding us that we are not a profession, or a class. We are living species, influenced by our past. I can understand why so many people find this film so hard to understand or like. It's not an easy task, to sit and watch the unedited episodes of our life. We might get bored of our own existence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I'd been looking forward to this movie for quite some time. The trailer made it out to be visually impressive and thought-inducing. It looked deep and philosophical. It received heaps of praise and awards round the festival circuit. This was going to be my next favourite film. It reached the cinema, but nowhere nearby was showing it, so I missed out. Several months later, my sister buys the Blu-Ray for my birthday. Stick it in and get ready for my thought muscles to get racing, and my eyes to be pleasured.That's exactly how it went down for the first hour or so. Beautiful, amazing, brilliant. An exploration of life, death, religion, and everything in between. It was emotional and interesting, pure perfection. The visuals, the music, the pace, the acting, it was all perfect.Then it stops.It's at this point we get an extremely long and pointless segment about the kids in what must have been 1 or 2 years of their lives that dragged on and on, where nothing really happened. My thought muscles started to fall asleep, and my eyes were getting bored. It just felt like Malick stopped caring about the movie at this point. He lost the flair and interest of the first hour, the visual marvel and any resemblance of relevance.By the time the end came back trying to wow my mind and eyes again, I had stopped caring as well. Don't get me wrong, I understood and followed the film perfectly fine. I picked up on every little hint of every little point, but I still felt like I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life once the credits rolled.5/10, because the first hour really is that awe-inspiring and perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Terrence Malick achieves some of the best cinematic and touching images seen on film in years with The Tree of Life. Starring Academy Award Winners Brad Pitt and Sean Penn along with Jessica Chastain and newcomer Hunter McCracken, the film is a terrific ensemble that gets some of the best work of its actors. As the overbearing father, Pitt is ferocious and innovative delivering one of the finest performances yet. As the mother, Mrs. O'Brien, Chastain is absolutely gorgeous and mesmerizing. One of the best Oscar-caliber wonders of the year. Hunter McCracken shows one the best debuts by a young actor in years. Holding his own and nearly carrying the film on his shoulders, McCracken touches the deepest parts of the cinematic soul. Penn is the briefest of the performers but bookends a wondrous tale with a fully capable performance. Malick's direction is brilliant though at times disengaging especially in the second act. Alexandre Desplat's score composes the best work of his career hands down. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is the single best technical work by any person in 2011. He continues to raise the bar considerably for all camera-work by any man or woman. Though the narrative is at times overkill, the appreciation is present entirely throughout and should be applauded for such a distinct and unique piece of cinema.***/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any vague acknowledgment of a plot during any point of this film is a pure manifestation of the viewer's imagination. The total disregard for any kind of cohesive narrative is masked by eloquent visuals, grandiose motif, and the illusion of visual poetry. Narrative has been abandoned for a series of captivating images. This is an attempt to create an avant-garde film that can only be understood by whoever made it. A master in the rhetoric language of nonlinear storytelling has been replaced by a self conceded image-maker. The Tree of Life is nothing more than 139 minutes of self indulgence and mind numbing randomness. Terrence Malick wants you to feel as though you are experiencing an extraordinarily unique piece of cinematic genius. Sadly this is only a schmorgesborg cohesion of visually alluring sequences that beg to tell a beautiful story, but fail in the most elemental of ways. My former love of this director was all that made this bearable to watch.</fullReview>

Intersperse this with some random, over-used, and unimaginative 'arthouse' shots and a full storyline that makes no particular sense and has no particular meaning or significance and you get 'the tree of life'.Why was it made? Who knows. This movie says nothing new, and the things it does say it says very badly.Was it nice to watch? Not at all. Some nice visual elements of course, but the 'creation' scenes would be better suited to a documentary about the Earth (which is exactly how they look, minus narrative) Imagine a silent documentary movie about the beginning of the world, throw in a cheesy dinosaur element, and add some retro 50's style non-action loosely linked to some incredibly boring modern sequences. Nothing happened! It was like the most boring childhood story ever. The one interesting thing (brothers death notified by mail) was more like an annoying tic by the end of the movie. And then there are the end sequences, the salt flats crowded with bad actors constantly touching each other in very contrived ways. It sucked, it blowed. And it deserves not even a one star. I give this movie 1.5% due to it somehow inexplicably managing to capture a lot of peoples imaginations.Conclusion: Best to watch a documentary about the creation of the universe and Earth and follow that up with 'Stand by me' -you will feel better after..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had my fare share of nonsense movies, but this one took the icing. I am really dumb-founded by this movie. As I sit and watched the first 20 minutes of the movie, I kept asking my husband, has the movie started? I fast forward in hopes that something will make sense, and when I saw a dinosaur I thought that my husband accidentally changed the channel to discovery. What a waste of time and money. My husband kept asking me to please change it, but I kept hoping that some where, some how it will make some sense, but after an hour of what seem to be the most confusing movie ever, I had to walk away, not to argue with my husband because I was so angry. Do not waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully made but still made me go; so what!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt about it this is a visually impressive and well directed movie but the whole point and purpose of it still confuses me.I just can't really see what this movie is exactly trying to tell with its story and images and the movie doesn't really put me in a mood to start thinking deep about it. It's not really engaging or intriguing enough for that, though as a random observation of life, I can still enjoy this movie for what it is.Yes, I enjoyed it and it really isn't half as boring as most people try to make you believe it is, though it might be all just a matter of taste of course really. You could say there isn't really happening in this movie, or you could take it as a sort of ode to life and our existence. I really thought the movie did an incredible job following and capturing the early years of a young boy's life and that of his family. Everything that is happening and they are doing is something incredibly genuine and realistic feeling. I'm sure that especially Americans will recognize a lot that is in it and should remind them of their own childhood.And really, no matter how you think or feel about this movie, you must be able to admit that it still is a really well directed one. It's really visually orientated and it also very often chooses to tell its story with its images, rather than with its actual story or dialog. It give the movie a sort of artistic and poetic sense to it but not in a too pretentious way really. Now, I'll admit that I can often appreciated Terrence Malick's work, so if you don't, then simply just stay away from this movie, since this obviously isn't the right movie for you and there is nothing wrong with that of course.Besides the visual orientated directing approach, also the cinematography itself and the editing are truly fantastic. Really, you could watch this movie still for just its visuals and you'll most likely won't regret it afterward.This is a perfectly watchable movie in my opinion, that works visually splendid and also as a simple, straightforward movie. Problem is that the movie obviously tried to be far more than just that and who knows, maybe you'll also still get more out of this movie. I surely didn't.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex and unique different look at life and death showing it's tied to nature, growth, afterlife, animals, and the universe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that a film like "The Tree of Life" is one that may require a second viewing before you understand it's point and meaning. As director Terrence Malick's film is a complex journey of the growth of life and death and his enchanting and very bold universe type visuals are complex and mind challenging, yet they prove that everything all thru the universe is connected to one or the other. This visual theme is just the ground and frame for his flashback story of how a now grown man remembers his time growing up with family and the loss of one brother.This epic done in flashback style shows how a now grown up Jack O'Brien(Sean Penn)recalls his upbringing and childhood as it follows his journey from childhood to that of an adult. Jack the oldest of three boys remembers good times yet sees that his Texas family was flawed and they were meant to fracture especially his tough as nails yet loving authority type father Mr. O' Brien(Brad Pitt). Loving memories are shown of Jack's mother Mrs. O'Brien(Jessica Chastain) as she was the boys loving overprotective shoulder to cry on.Overall many may not like this work it's complex and visually connected to themes of love, death, memories and faith making a film that one must think while watching. Still it proves that nature, life, and love are connected all thru the universe in many forms with many type of beings. Really wonderful and different complex work from Terrence Malick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick's God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Materialism frequently mines efforts to attain spirituality, the immaterial joys of inner growth, enlightenment and some kind of transcendence. This struggle is illustrated in the strategies behind this film. On one hand Terrence Malick tries to convey spirituality through moving images, which in a few instances he greatly attains, except when he divorces it from inner search, a path to reach a sound definition of the concept of divinity, and he associates it too specifically with humanity's turn to religion, in this case a faith related to Christianity. On the other hand, a more mundane and secular Malick makes a film that contains signs of his decadence as an artist, in his lack of economy to tell a story (as interesting as his method is, as he resists Aristotelian narrative), and the absence of humility in his self-image, taking himself too seriously as he portrays the limits of the American way, and takes advantage of the financial means supplied by the society that he criticizes. I realized this while watching a visual metaphor of a child's birth, when a boy emerges through a window from a submerged room. For a few seconds images of this room appear on the screen, while I thought how very expensive those shots were (other fragment is used later). But I would never tell anyone not to watch "The Tree of Life", wrongly arguing that it does not have a plot (it does not follow a traditional way of telling a story, but it does tell one, and does it with complete skill and control of cinematic resources!) This is a major work that deserves to be appreciated, and Americans should be proud of also having Malick making cinema besides the usual industrial concoctions that we are offered, time-fillers without any value, thanks to which viewers are becoming dumber and dumber, finding something as easy to understand as the whispered reflections addressed to the characters' visualization of God most of the time, and sometimes to members of the family, as something pretentious or obnoxious. Not my favorite Terrence Malick film, but it is by far much, much better than the usual movie coming to a theater near you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing God's love for us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most popular reviews are very polarized...raving about the brilliance of the movie or condemning it as fast moving edits of life with no clear purpose.I guess I am in the middle.Tree of Life destroys a small vision of life as we know it. It's not something that started when I was born. The top song on the radio, the latest celebrity romance horrors, success at work, etc...is not all that life offers or contains. We live in a vast universe that has seen dinosaurs drinking from the streams that we swim in today. Many people have lived, worked, and suffered on this planet. I walk away from this movie realizing that life is bigger than my daily focus on mostly trivial matters presented to me in the 2012 America that is so popular.The failure in my opinion is that an openly Christian view of a Creator God presented in Tree of Life fails to deliver the whole point of this life. The reason God made us was to have relationship with us. He loves us and proved it with His Son Jesus. I won't reprint the Bible but that is the message, that is the point. An aimless wandering through suffering, not knowing where God is, is not the point. If you are going to present the creation of the universe you need to know the Creator's motives, purpose, and heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where we are shown our place in the cosmos.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a film for mainstream audiences despite being written and directed by Terrence Malick whose earlier efforts were - beginning with Badlands (1973), the movie that made us sit up and take notice of Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek. And, if you've seen all of Malick's work up to and including The New World (2005), then you know he can indeed show a story that appeals to the masses.That is not the case with this Tree of Life. There is a story ? reminiscences of a middle-aged man (Sean Penn) ? and a rudimentary plot ? a series of vignettes of those reminiscences, which together attempt to provide suggestions about why we exist on this planet. Hence, to that extent, there is another, overarching story: nothing less than how it all happened over the thirteen or so billion years the cosmos has existed and where we are now.That's a grandiose idea and you have to acknowledge the quality of the production, photography, sound track and special effects that help to meld the two stories into a narrative that makes sense ? even if it's confusing at times and even if you might not agree with the implicit and explicit philosophical and scientific underpinnings.Think of the story thus: it's about Nature, how it all evolved and how we, as humans, are part of Nature despite out efforts to control it. We can't get away from it and we can't overcome it. This line of thinking goes back to Malick's own views, of course, and his studies of Heideggerian philosophy. And, arguably, the human story (with Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain and the boys) about growing up in 1950s, small town USA probably has much of Malick's own childhood experiences within it.Pitt and Chastain are picture perfect as a 1950s couple. The settings are beautifully detailed. Their boys are suitably boisterous. There are fights, but there are also times for saying sorry and for forgiveness. There is tragedy and loss. Trying to make sense of it all, Penn wanders through his mind even as he wanders aimlessly through his day's work, obviously searching for definitive answers ? much like all other humans who live, love, work and play on this world.But if you are momentarily nonplussed by the scene of an aggressive dinosaur standing on the neck of another during the early history of this earth, take note of the scenes of Pitt acting out the domineering father with young Jack (played by Hunter McCrackern), particularly. Dinosaurs were part of Nature just as we are now. And Nature, after all, is first and foremost about the strongest and fittest who survive.Occasionally, the voice-over narration - a Malick technique for all of his movies I've seen - is extremely low in volume; but, that's my only serious criticism.Viewers who like action movies, thrillers, cop shows, and so on would not find this movie appealing. But, if you're in to reminiscing about your own life, and those who are close to you, then you could do worse for two hours or so to see this one.Recommended ? and obviously for Malick fans.December 10, 2011</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps something happens in the last quarter of the film that redeems the whole thing. I dropped out, so I'll never know. Up to then, I thought I'd seen only 10 or 15 minutes of good film, consisting mostly of interactions between Pitt and his wife and children. There's nothing wrong with shooting for the moon and falling short. But it's hard to see that this effort ever had any chance of success and the film comes off as pretentious and dull. As an inquiry into the nature of man and his relationship to god, this can't hold a candle to Wings of Desire. Taken purely as a film about a family under stress, it can't hold a candle to The Great Santini or Ordinary People. Better luck next time to all who were involved.</fullReview>

For a human being who loved his family, especially his mother,it is poignant beyond all comprehension. The acting is stunning. Jennifer Chastain is the most beautiful woman on earth. Brad Pitt is "Everyman". The boys in the film are some of the most talented I have every seen. How can kids be this good. Maybe it is great direction.

		<fullReview>***may contain (light) spoilers:The Tree of Life is a beautiful film, but its HARD to watch!Its hard to watch because its not a regular movie with a straight up story. Its basically a (NatGeo or Discovery channel) documentary of LIFE narrated 90% of the movie.Do not watch it if you are tired or if you have a hard time understanding non-conventional movies. Its 2 and a half hours long of reflexions and questioning about life and faith. It has great acting and you can really relate to the characters. Pros: -Beautiful Cinematography. - Amazing use of classical music. - reflexions on life and faith - childhood memories. Cons: - Hard to understand (no clear plot, but open for interpretation). - long (over 2 and a half hours). - actors appear only half of the movie (the other half is mostly visuals). BOTTOM LINE: If you're the type of guy that falls asleep with slow movies, if you are in the mood for a light, easy to follow movie, if you hate abstract, artistry, draw-your-own-conclusion movies, DO NOT WATCH IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artsy and meaningful or just pretentious?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, this was painful. As an aspiring writer, as well as an intelligent, cerebral person, I generally pride myself of my enjoyment and understanding of complex and abstract films. It was for that reason that I was really excited to see this title available on my red-eye overseas. I had heard such great things about this movie, like how complex it is and how long it took to complete the storyline. This movie proved to me that those factors in no way mean the movie will be any good. To begin, there was no plot and absolutely nothing to draw the viewer in. It was like a very beautiful and disjointed clip shows. It would jump around from the 1950's to the present to an erupting volcano. This would be fine if it were leading up to something, but instead this just continued for what I imagine was about 10 minutes, but really felt more like an hour. Truthfully, I shut it off after about 45 minutes. So, even though I consider myself an intellectual, I'm also a human, and a teenager none the less, and I really need a little more than some philosophical B-reels and A-listers making faces to keep me interested.I must say, I believe here is a little bit of an Emperor's new clothes thing going on here. Since it's so out there and "philosophical", if you think it sucks,. it can't possibly be because it actually sucks. No, it has to be because you just don't get it. Seriously everyone, stop being so pretentious and admit it: you were just as bored as I was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, my review contains spoiler, the "movie" though, is a spoiler itself.I actually thought it passed 40 minutes, watching the first 15 minutes (and i have to say one of my favorite movies, Jeanne Dielman takes more than 3 hours, almost "nothing" happens and it passes much to soon). I like slow movies but this movie is like watching some kind of DVD intro screen of some kind of national geographic epic whatever in an endless loop.After 50 minutes i was like.. is this it? It all seemed to be similar to movie "Home", accept that there you have this Holly Mother Nature and here you are stuck to God. Although this God is more like a HD propaganda of achievements of western science and (film) technologies completely overloaded with very disturbing and penetrating music (though otherwise i like classical music). From time to time deep male voice says things like "Mother" or "Oh, why are we here?" reminding me of "Oh, why am i here, watching this?" Story.. Oh, some kid dies in war i guess, and mother's emotions flip into some pathetic loop of photo-shop big bangs, dinosaurs scenes, waterfalls, space images etc.. that take like forever... after showing all of the possibly imaginable clichés, including dozen of sunsets and angelic chorus music, tears in slow motion etc. ,"story" finally seems to go on..seems so. next hour enlighten us with very "smart and poetic" Oedipus complex sequences, another remix of "Oh, father, oh, mother" whispered lines and "great performance" by Jessica Chastein, playing a more or less dumb model (accept from time to time saying "Shhhh, shh.") for old fashion luxury clothes and Valium. She and Brad Pitt must have had an intern competition- who is going to kiss the kids more often in this epic saga of nonsense. I guess this is next to sunsets and scenes where people are observing their hands illuminated by a kind of wannabe EdwardHopperish light falling through windows with windy curtains one of the central loop pictures in the movie. "Happyness is love." "Oh, God..." As i thought nothing can go more wrong, there is this epilogue, showing people gazing at a sandy beach that should represent something like Heaven, hugging, kissing and doing other politically correct things and a sequence of a sunflower field and Sean Penn standing and laughing in front of a some sort of Wall Street background (after his attempt in something which looks a lot like a bad remake of the famous desert end scene from Pasolinis Teorema).I did not find this movie only very trivial but also insulting by being really have-to-see-it-to-believe-it pretentious. It was perverted and shallow. It tries to tell something like, how important it is to love and be spiritual blah blah blah and how materialism and money etc. don't mean nothing. sure, i definitely believe in words of wisdom and humbleness from a director, getting and spending millions on this kind of crap. I was so happy this director did not use Erbarme dich from J.S. Bach in this movie, cause it would ruin it for me, like it ruined Vltava from B.Smetana used in an utterly disrespectfully way here. Its like using Schubert in commercials for dishwashers or something...Another thing that really scared me or made me mad, was this fetishistic way how people are shown. People in movie look like some kind of Arians. Even the "sick child" without hair looks like a Calvin Klein model. All in all cast looks like a cast from some hair product or perfume commercial. At the same time it tries to be critical (or even not really) towards the family model of 50s, but everything is shown in a way you just want to go there and live that perfect little life there. Its very nostalgic in a very disturbing way. We can even accept Brads characters machismo and golden watch on his hand, since he can also play piano and therefore holding mouth shut (what woman and children are to do, when he is around) kind of makes more sense. The movie aesthetic glorifies Nature and Man, but all of this Beauty is shown in a very high-class, stylish, HD, modified, superfied, polished.. very unnatural way, discriminating all the other aspects of Beauty, reminding me of Nazism ideology. This movie is not a movie opened for discussions. Watching it felt like shut up and adore me. I am so humble and deep.This may get the Oscar... its even more pathetic than Avatar and it teaches people how to give their hands from money back to God, which is a good business idea before the awaited apocalypses in next year.summary: whispered "God, NO!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holy crappola "the tree of life" is boring. After reading some fantastic reviews, I thought I'll give it a gander. For the first 30 mins. I had to keep going back because I didn't understand what was going on. Then when I finally started to get the gist of the story, they bring in a science educational video about the beginning of the earth with dinosaurs and stuff. Somehow that's suppose to tie in with the whole entire movie. Now at this point, I've fallen asleep about twice already, and had to go back and start this movie all over again. After enduring about an hour of it, I felt like I was waiting at the doctor's office, and I swear it felt like I can hear the slow ticking of a clock. I had to pause it and grab a cup of coffee so that I can finally finish it.The movie is suppose to be about 2 hours, but because I fell asleep twice, had to go back numerous times just to try to understand the movie, I would say real time for this movie is 5 hours. 5 hours of complete boring ass slow as molasses story. Even the music sounded like something out of a high school orchestra or choir class. I understand some people would say that it's artistic, I say that's bunghole bs. There was suppose to be some metaphor with some bible references, but it missed the mark. If "tree of life" is about life and death, it certainly tried to make its point literally. Even the end didn't make too much sense, why are his brothers young and Sean Penn is still an old fart? why did his mom have a double? why was everyone else roaming around endlessly while their family gets a reunion? See what I mean? doesn't make any sense.If I could give this movie a negative out of ten I would. It certainly brought the meaning of death to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slowest movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After checking IMDb for the rating of this movie, and found it was quite high,and with good actors, so I decided to go to the cinema. I am sorry for the people that love this movie, but this was the first movie ever that I walked out. This brought me to write this review to spare other people a disappointing experience. Basically you will have 5 to 10 minutes of acting, and then a picture show in movie format. Granted, the pictures are beautiful, but you can go to a photo exhibition for that, and not a movie. The story was simple (how hard can it be in 5 minutes), but to come to the plot was so dreadfully slow, that I could not bear to waste more of my time on it. I think an LSD trip must be like this, so if you do not want to use LSD, but like to have a trip, this is your movie of choice. I guess I am shouting in the desert, as it seems many people like it, but it was definitely not my cup of tea. I suggest to wait for the DVD to come out and watch it on 8 speed. It will still be a slow movie, but you might make it till the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a movie in which even 38 minutes about nothing happens, except dream scenes. Subsequently, the approximate time to be okay ...... still not really for reviews I've read about it, it seems that the movie director wants to express many things in it. I, in my view, I do not see any clear message, and if a set of images that I think he tried to imitate fairly and Stanley Kubrick 2001 Space Odyssey through another topic. Even the almost final scene in which different groups of people out that cross in the sand of the beach is extremely forced. Brad Pitt, say that although I could have done more in this film, acting in his usual line. Sean Penn, just get out so that you can not say anything about his performance.The best ..... the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religious tosh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need for me to go into details. The film is pretentious nonsense. I have a feeling that the director tries to give out religious message on behalf of the catholic church. Some of the nature footages seem to be based on evolutionist/Darwinian theories, but they conflict with the final scene as the mother look at the sky, shouting out "I give my son to You!" which clearly conveys a message from Creationist point of view. Perhaps this is an attempt of re-interpreting the bible. Second point, the director obviously tried to make a "deep" and "philosophical" film in the same vein of 2001-a space odyssey, Solaris, and some of F.Fellini's films, with slow-moving camera work, minimal dialogues, and plot less narratives, but there is no comparison. The classics by Kubrick, Tarkovsky and Fellini are by far superior, they are original to say the least.I wouldn't slag off this film completely though. The use of classical music was very effective, even moving at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I created an account here just to review this movie.So we watched this movie thinking it would be pretty interesting and at the request of my mother (Brad Pitt and Sean Penn). It was all looking a bit odd with eerie voices and loud cello music.My mother says "Aye if this carries on like this I might have to leave". This was followed by, and I am not joking, a twenty minute montage of loud orchestra and images of the galaxy. I even started thinking someone had put on this movie as a joke to trick someone and I started killing myself laughing.After the loud cellos and the galaxy shots there was a dinosaur walking along a river bed looking down at a baby dinosaur lying on the rocks trying to stand up or something. Then the movie cuts back to humans and 'normal' scenes. I almost soiled myself laughing at one stage thinking what is this rubbish mom and i are watching.i don't mind the artsy fartsy but this was pushing the envelope.Needless to say... avoid</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with my wife and a very dear friend of ours. Just before we went we watched the trailer online and thought: Nice, a different movie with deeper layers and great actors.Stepping out of the cinema we had mutual strong emotions.W.T.F. was that all about? It was like going to an art gallery where everybody is looking at a dot on a white canvas and acting how they understand the struggle of the artist. I'm glad I saw it though and sat through the whole thing to make sure that I didn't miss anything.I just feel that if you have something to tell and people are willing to open up and listen to what you have to say, it should at least make some sense.Must admit that I am one of those persons that still feels cheated by the whole "Lost" series (what a waste of time!)Guess that using the "Heaven" ending mixed with prehistoric creatures is not my thing.Oh and maybe you can look-up Sean Penns thoughts about this movie.The trailer was a 1000 times better than the actual movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what kind of people these are that gave this movie good reviews. They must come from another planet. This was the most boring 2 1/2 hours I have ever spent in a movie theater. This movie has no story and very little dialog. It is mostly videos of nature and some computer graphics generated images designed to portray God and some prehistoric images of Earth filled with dinosaurs (for no apparent reason). There is a lot of whispering of simple questions to God like "Why do bad things happen to good people?" or "Am I a good person?", but there is no real substance to this movie and it just drags on. If you can stay awake, you will probably get to the end and wish you had fallen asleep. At least then you would have gotten some value out of your 2 1/2 hours!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the plus side, impressive cinematography and good acting especially by the children. However, on the negative side, I found the pace to be slow after 90 minutes, it made a painful effort to be profound and had a jumbled storyline - no clear odyssey here! For me, it fell well short of the high bar set by Stanley Kubrick with 2001: A Space Odyssey despite SFX maestro Douglas Trumbull being coaxed out of retirement by Malick. The jumble was so great that I had to read the IMDb plot synopsis, after seeing the film, to understand that the Sean Penn character was the adult oldest son looking back on his childhood - not clear from viewing the film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent spectacle if perhaps not a magnificent accomplishment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A big budget movie with religious themes treads warily to recoup investment without alienating viewers. Tree of Life (at $32 million) ? is no exception. Even with Brad Pitt and Sean Penn. It succeeds not by pleasing a mass audience ? but by being sufficiently wonderful to behold so enough people will come to stare. Each scene is almost a master-class in sound and vision.Malick is true to himself, and draws a central line with philosophical sleight-of-hand. On one hand Tree of Life is a semi-biopic of a 1950's, God-fearing, small-town family in America. On the other, momentous special effects look at the 'God question' in cosmological terms. God as the formlessness from which all things spring (including the Big Bang); versus an anthropomorphised Old Testament God that lives in the sky. Christians can well enjoy the large-scale attention given to their beliefs in general terms. Tolerant atheists (as opposed to Dawkinesque evangelical ones) may appreciate the spectacle, and honest commentary. Just as one marvels at Gothic architecture or gargoyles, without condoning the questionable practices and beliefs of the mediaeval Church.Malick's stated approach posits a fundamental choice between grace and nature. (This is a red herring: the film is conceptually broader than these two 'options' from the voice-over.) Standard religious questions (and answers) fall from the mouths of the characters. The 2001-Space-Odyssey ?style visuals might suggest God (if he/she/it exists) is light, from whence cometh all things: evolution, the world, disparate beliefs, and so on. By adroitly avoiding the biblical Jesus, Malick gets reasonably close to harmonising science vs religion camps, as well as the more atheistic creed of early Buddhism (to which Pitt often seems to give more than the occasional career nod).But on to our story. A Christian reading needs no interpretation. The struggling family (by middle-class America standards) is raising their three young boys. They 'do their best,' go to church, deal with bereavement, and look at their own shortcomings as parents. The story of Job is recalled as inspiration.Brad Pitt plays Mr O'Brien. A strict, controlling father. Although there is only one instance where O'Brien verges on violence, the (well-intentioned) power he emanates is still intimidating. Mrs O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) is housewife-mother, exuding a simplistic love-and-peace. She leaves hubby to deal with the harsh realities of the world - and lets children (and hubby) walk all over her. (Critics of Judeao-Christianity might observe that the father epitomises faults of the Old Testament Jehovah, and the mother many of the faults of New Testament Jesus).Our oldest son, understandably, makes hard work of his Oedipal journey. He reacts against Dad's unbending discipline. He fails to respect Mum's lack of backbone. Mrs O'Brien, with the luxury and frustrations of a 50's kept woman, opines that love is nevertheless smiling through all things. "The only way to be happy is to love. Unless you love, your life will flash by." Of course, she doesn't find true love or such meaningful and lasting reflection of it hubby. True to New Testament thinking, her love is one of self-sacrifice (though the angels do offer her some comfort).Mrs O'Brien's "giving" of her son to God, as a way of mentally coping with bereavement, struck me as unrealistic. Compare, for instance, Nicole Kidman's character, faced with a not dissimilar loss, in Rabbit Hole . . . (soothing voice): "God had to take her ? he needed another angel ." (seething Kidman in reply): "Why didn't he just MAKE another angel!!?" Similarly Tree of Life feebly tells us that the suffering of bereavement will, "one day go away." Whereas Rabbit Hole (with a script far more worthy of shouting about) says more realistically, "At some point it becomes bearable. It turns into something you can crawl out from under, and carry around like a brick in your pocket."With or without love, at 139 minutes, Tree of Life doesn't flash by; and a lot of people in the screening I went to walked out. Although I felt entranced for almost its entirety, I admit, nothing much 'happened.' This is a warning to cinema-goers demanding 'a good story.' There isn't one. You could write it on the back of a communion wafer. But more precisely, there is no plot development. Mrs O'Brien recalls the Julianne Moore character from The Hours. Trapped 50's housewife. But whereas Moore made a break for self-enlightenment and freedom, O'Brien doesn't. The Tree of Life is not so much a story as a painting, a meditation, a beautiful canvas. The result is truly magnificent. Its staggeringly gorgeous visual collage of ideas is used almost to convince us that the Heidegger-like approach to the phenomenology of religion isn't full of holes. Serious viewers might recall that this elision of God and Nature was done with far less profligacy in Tarr's recent Turin Horse (which also managed to discard it with Nietzschean frugality). It's almost like an enthusiastic preacher saying, "If I play the beautiful Mozart Requiem captivatingly enough, will you please believe in my God?" The Tree of Life offers little in the way of answers to the deep questions it pretentiously tries to raise: yet that should not stop you meditating on them ? or even just enjoying the wonderful spectacle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We went and caught an early show at the Landmark Theater Sunday. I only wanted to take my wife to a movie that I thought she'd enjoy and I figured with Brad Pitt and Sean Penn, how could I miss? Well, I did. I'm not really one to criticize other people's creative works because I understand that part of the creative process resides in the mind of the writer of the tale, part in the screenwriter, part in the director, and part in the actors. Having said that, my assessment is this: the message and the meaning of the movie (according to the written synopsis I read which enticed me to purchase my tickets for it) escaped my wife and me. Somewhere between the first third of the movie and an enjoyable, well told story, there is a disconnect, and we found ourselves watching abstract, colorful, meaningless imagery such as volcanic eruptions, intergalactic voids, planets orbiting their suns too close, and violent fires for seemingly endless amounts of time. The movie was abstract to the point of distraction, and maybe that WAS the point. It certainly didn't convey the mechanics and dynamics of the complex intertwined relationship between a father, three sons and their mother to either one of us. I'd take a pass on this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw Malick's "Tree of Life" yesterday. Malick's 2001. Not my favorite Malick film and not 2001. If you're a Malick fan like me, chances are you enjoy his masterful weaving of images with dialog to produce what amounts to visual poetry. The natural world becomes a central character in all his films. Unfortunately, he forgoes the natural world in segments of this movie by using computer generated effects to recreate the the earth's beginning--including dinosaurs and very unrealistic looking primordial goo. Computer generated organisms never look completely organic no matter how well done, and in a Terrence Malick movie they stick out like a sore thumb. There are many other impressions I have of this movie, but can't go on. Overall it was worth seeing--I did enjoy it, but not one I'm going to likely feel a need to watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look, I know what you're thinking, reviewing something you didn't finish is the cardinal sin of being a backseat critic. Rules are meant to be broken, and this movie is the golden goose of exceptions!I made it a whole, maybe 20 minutes in.That was enough to know the turd from the bowl. This is not a standard film. It's not meant to entertain anyone but people who believe they're above the normal way of thinking. So straight shooting, it's crap. Dead on arrival. It's a collage of mumbling narrative and beautiful art shots. Anything that pertains to the characters is filmed in a stomach swirling moving shot and has all the integrity of a teen Age boy experimenting with a sony handicam. I only made it 20 minutes because it somehow simulated motion sickness for me. If you're sober and want to watch a movie avoid this film like a Plague!!!BUT! And this is a big but! If you have a big, stinky bag of weed and you are looking to watch something to trip to, (I'm assuming, because I haven't touched the stuff since high school) this film would be better than spongebob. So if you didn't feel like reading all my rambling this is the point : Anyone who told you this is a must watch is smoking some Jamaican grade wacky weed. If you are in a sober state leave this movie on a shelf.</fullReview>

I may have either decided not to bother or get it and have a better expectation of what I was about to view. Since I did not, I could not make it through watching it at all. The beginning of the disc is a message to watch with the volume turned up.. for good reason; most of the dialogue is so quiet you can't hear to know what is going on. It is supposed to be "whispered" but it is irritating at best. My husband and I proceeded to start the movie and were very lost and then it went into a looooong operatic music with glimpses of world evolution. I tried fast forwarding through it but it seems to be never ending. When I finally got to a part that had some acting in it again it didn't make any sense and then started jumping back and forth. We ended the movie with a very unnerved emotional state. After reading the reviews I understand why. The world evolution part is 45 minutes long and there isn't a real plot. I don't watch movies to feel bad. I watch movies to feel good. This is not a feel good movie or even one that I could grasp.</fullReview>

Malick could've easily reached into a bowl and randomly selected the order of all the scenes. And that's why this movie is awful. YOU could make this movie.A cohesive storyline take real talent because, when well done, you are drawn into the story and emotionally invested in the characters. Both of which are accomplished with deft writing, directing, and great performances.I rest my case with the simple statement that a film of this ilk can be seen in most film schools, where you can find those abstract art-house, student films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When images speak louder than words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨The nuns taught us there were two ways through life - the way of nature and the way of grace. You have to choose which one you'll follow.¨The Tree of Life is a beautiful movie, which works more like a poem than an actual narrative. Terrence Malick has made what is in my opinion one of the closest movies to Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey. There are several similarities, including imagery, use of music, and very little amount of dialogue in the picture. There is one moment where there is no dialogue whatsoever for about thirty minutes straight, so be warned this film isn't for the average moviegoer. Film lovers and critics alike will probably love this film thanks to the beautiful imagery; it's truly a poetic movie and it will stick with you for days to come. It's an exploration of the meaning of life and the existence of God. If God exists than why does he allow evil? It's a question we all make sometimes, and Malick answers it quite simply with a verse from the book of Job in the Bible: "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? ¨ Then there is a thirty minute montage of images beginning with the creation of the cosmos and universe, to the creation of Earth and the first living creatures up to the birth of a baby boy. This is where we realize that we are truly small creatures in the midst of such a vast universe. This boy ends up being the protagonist of the film as we see several flashes of memories he's had growing up in a small Texas town. These are the experiences that have shaped him and led him to question God's existence. In The Tree of Life, Malick manages to explore these common questions with great use of imagery. It is said that actions speak louder than words, in this case images speak louder than dialogues or typical narrative structures.The main protagonist of The Tree of Life isn't a character, we actually see much more imagery such as trees, water, rays of light, and other natural things, than we see people. Most of the imagery from the film comes from Jack O'Brien (Sean Penn) as we get to see his childhood memories and the things that have shaped his life up to the present day. He grew up in a small Texas town during the 50's under the love of his caring mother, Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain), who represents the world of grace, and his stern father (Brad Pitt) who represents the world of nature (a more selfish view of the world). Jack (who is played by Hunter McCracken during his youth) is the oldest of three brothers. His fondest memories are of the three always playing together outdoors and enjoying life, although always fearing their father's discipline. One of the moments that impacted his life was when the three were playing at a public pool and they saw a boy drown. Jack, who had up to that point lived under his mother's vision of grace, now questions God and doesn't understand how he could allow such a thing to happen. After his father goes away on a long business trip, Jack begins to go through a rebellious phase in which he does things he is not very proud of. We get to see all these memories and experiences Jack goes through as he recollects his past and tries to find meaning to life and the death of one of his younger brothers.This is a movie in which every viewer will possibly leave with a different interpretation of the movie because the images can speak to us in different ways. It is a very thought provoking movie and Malick really has created a memorable and poetic film. Some of these images will remain in my mind for the rest of my life. I wasn't really a fan of Malick's work since I hated The New World and found The Thin Red Line quite boring, but after seeing this film I want to go back and re-watch those movies to see if perhaps my young age was a factor for it. Malick doesn't make Blockbuster movies, but only time will tell if this film will become a cult classic. In my opinion this movie will be the most talked about film of 2011 over the next decades kind of like in the same way 2001 A Space Odyssey became such a cult fan favorite. This isn't a movie for everyone, many won't be interested in all the poetic imagery kind of like in the same way young kids aren't expected to get excited about listening to classical music; they would much rather go to a rock or pop concert. The Tree of Life doesn't have that kind of entertainment value, it's more artistic than anything else. It makes you think about the meaning of life, and it really made me recall several moments of my own childhood. In a way, this is the same way I remember some of my own experiences throughout flashes of recollections I've had of my past. We all remember these vague experiences in which we first felt love, remorse, and guilt. This is truly a beautiful film and one I wouldn't mind sitting through again.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick's Metier Is Life As We Don't Know It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The intense craftsmanship of Terrence Malick's beatific 2011 film is what stays in the memory far more than his storytelling skills. It's the unique product of a reclusive filmmaker ("Days of Heaven", "The New World") who does not feel bound by traditional narrative structure or any proved Hollywood conventions beyond casting star actors like Brad Pitt and Sean Penn in pivotal roles. Malick has clearly invested thought and care into every image of this film, but achieving a tangible level of clarity around characters and plot is not nearly as big a priority to him. If viewers are willing to overcome this hurdle - and this is quite a hurdle for many viewers including myself - then one can appreciate how his meticulous approach can seize upon the deeper emotions he is trying to convey in his time-traveling tale of spiritual replenishment. Malick presents two intertwining plot threads - one revolves around Jack O'Brien, a bereft middle-aged architect who appears to be searching for a deeper meaning to his younger brother's years-ago death, the other is a mid-century flashback to his childhood in Waco, Texas, where he is raised by a nurturing mother and a taskmaster father. The parents represent two seemingly irreconcilable ends of a philosophical spectrum with the mother following the path of grace and the father the way of nature. The tragedy of their son's death deepens the chasm that the grown Jack is still trying to rectify in his life.Once Malick presents the situation, this is where he stops to contemplate the origin of life and evolution. This extraordinary sequence begins with a pinkish-blue glow floating in space, which transitions into bubbles of primordial ooze, life-forming amoeba, and then jellyfish. This gives way to dinosaurs (with one contemplating the fate of another on a riverbank) and a school of circling hammerhead sharks, all ending with an asteroid impacting the earth. Somehow, Malick gets away with this piece of filmmaking brio and comes back to the more immediate family story because he can bring a level of universality to the emotional turmoil brought forth by the personal tragedy. However, his grand intentions also run roughshod over the characters whose motivations remain elliptical in the scheme of his story. Toward that end, the filmmaker makes liberal use of diminutive jump cuts, three-quarter profile shots of the characters, and fantasy images to carry his story along to the strains of majestic orchestral music (courtesy of Alexandre Desplat) to evoke the presence of a higher being in their lives. He comes back to the greater existence by showing the future of the planet five billion years in the future where the earth becomes a lifeless shell orbiting around a sun that has aged into a feeble white dwarf.When the story itself returns to the present day, Jack appears to be traversing the Southwest canyon country and magically ends up on a beach where he finds emotional closure. The cross-pollination of reality and fantasy into a cathartic state is something Malick does with greater aplomb than most filmmakers, and it helps that he gets a solid performance from Pitt who accurately captures the prideful sensibilities of a father from that period of history down to his frustrated dreams and his buzzcut. Jessica Chastain ("The Help"), 2011's "It" girl among critically lauded actresses, has less to do as the mother since she is given barely a word of dialogue, but she provides a memorably lingering impression of repressed feelings and maternal instincts. Penn is not given that much to do either except look pained during his journey of self-discovery. Special kudos need to be given to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki ("Children of Men"), who provides a vivid grandeur to all the startling visual elements no matter what eon needs to be captured by the idiosyncratic Malick. The filmmaker's hyper-sensitive attention to cinematic detail will definitely impress cineastes, but it will confound and try the patience of the more undemanding viewer. Granted there is a fair amount of pretension and self-absorption here, but one can't help but be awestruck by the end result.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece, but, let's face it, rather enigmatic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I should tell you that I had to watch this movie twice so that I could definitely conclude that it is a real masterpiece.The first time I watched it, a lot of people, by the middle of the film, started giggling and whispering, obviously for not following the plot. I was somewhat divided then: a part of me could notice that the film was absolutely deep and a must-see, another part was secretly agreeing with those people and finding the movie quite boring and incomprehensible.Then I had the chance of watching it again in a relax mood, at home and alone. It was a completely different experience.It's the story about everyone's life and it's also the story of the universe. It's the story of grace - represented, in the film, by the loving figure of the mother and the forgiving figure of the young brother. It's also the story of nature - represented by the dichotomy of good x evil and the rules imposed by the father. And it is, most of all, the story of a boy in the very last days of his graceful, motherly childhood, just about to enter the adult world of his father, full of rules and competition.If you watch it with an open mind, The Tree of Life will talk directly to your emotions. Love, judgments, punishments, forgiveness, doubts, competition, sexual desire, mistake, faith, hope, redemption: it's all there. The film shows the human path from grace to nature, then from nature again to grace - which is given to us by our acceptance of the paradoxical character of life as a whole. In this sense, it's similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey not only because of the stunning images they bring, but mostly because they both tell the story about the mystical journey of a man towards enlightenment (or, in other words, towards God). A must-see. But get prepared: without a slight notion of Psychology and some knowledge of Gnosticism or eastern religions, it will probably be not much more than an incredible visual experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amalgam of Art and Drama Infused with Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too long, overly ambitious? With various strands of classic movies and bold, creative endeavors from the past, Terrence Mallick has created a visionary and auditory film experience that captures a spiritual essence of stream of consciousness and memory and emotions. Taking the immersive authenticity of Lost in Translation (2003) and incorporating a semi-linear storyline with plotpoints from movies such as Stand by Me (1986) and using the visual, conceptual elements from 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and powerfully, haunting, non-verbal Koyaanisqatsi (1983), A Tree of Life depicts a collage of sensory experiences about death, about the intimate small details of living as a family in the 1950s.Avoiding the dramatic drama of a movie twist such as found in Seven Pounds (2008), or the traditional strictly chronological presentation of emotive drama as found in The Soloist (2009), Under the Tuscan Sun (2003), The Pursuit of Happiness (2006), The Tree of Life closely captures the more sensual and more elusive essence of life itself. In capturing our sense memory of real life, Mallick as avoided the technological 3-D advances that were so well adapted in Hugo (2011) and instead relied on a much more older form of hand-held photography found in the ground breaking work of Brain Storm (1983) and somehow retained the power of realism as with Unreal. "The Official Handbook for Starting Over (2004) or even Touching the Void (2004) and at the same time presenting in the unconscious format of luscious art piece like the brilliant Picnic At Hanging Rock (1975).To accomplish his vision of similar material as found in Where the Lilies Bloom (1974), Holes (2003), Revolutionary Road (2008), and Rabbit Hole (2010), Mallick can be seen as having taken film ideas from eerie water planet of Solaris (2002), even otherworldy Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), the sliding between reality and visionary Slipstream (2007), the time shifting Slaughter-House Five (1972), and mind altering Being John Malkovich (2000).The film's weakness seems to lie in its remarkable fusion of elements and the perhaps too scattered and fluid its threads among its primary characters, past and present, and the spiritual connection being as strong as it became towards the end with the more solidified presentation on the salt flats in comparison to the more veiled Picnic at Hanging Rock as well as the difficulty in understanding a number of the internal self-talk going on, which in reality would be sharp and distinct in most instances - connecting to the solid core.The Tree of Life like the original Solaris (1972) pushes the boundaries of human tolerance and understanding with its extended length and ethereal elements. Nevertheless, The Tree of Life somehow retains its grounded essence with the more familiar period movies such as The Informant! (2009) and The Lovely Bones (2009) and holding its own with the powerful emotive, graphic family dramas of Margot at the Wedding (2007) and A History of Violence (2005). With the brilliant sensitive acting of Brad Pitt whose role in Legends of the Fall (1994), Seven Years in Tibet (1997), and Meet Joe Black (1998) helped prepare him for his role and production of this amazing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exquisite Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "The Tree of Life," Terrence Malick's first feature since 2005's "The New World," started, I admit I thought it might be a slog. As soon as those Malick tics (the whispery voice overs, the restless camera, the copious shots of trees, flowers, rocks, etc.) made their appearance, I gave an internal roll of the eyes and thought, "Here we go again." I've loved some Malick films ("The Thin Red Line") and I've greatly disliked others ("The New World") and I know how tiresome his particular style can be when he's off his game.Then early on in the film, I found myself mesmerized by a long montage of images showing the natural world at work, and from that point on I was hooked. The sheer aesthetic beauty of the film would probably have been enough to keep me interested, but the story that begins to emerge from the images -- about where the life cycle of one human being fits into the greater scheme of the world and the universe -- is equally as compelling. The film's central theme is the difference between living a life founded on the belief of a higher being and one founded on the belief in the randomness of the natural world, and the pitfalls that go with both.I imagine what "The Tree of Life" is ultimately "about" will be informed largely by the personal beliefs of the viewer. But I think Malick is suggesting that one need not choose between two mutually exclusive ideas. That one can believe in a God without expecting answers to all of the scary unknowns the world might throw one's way while at the same time accepting the sometimes arbitrariness inherent in the world's natural processes without neglecting to see the beauty and majesty amid the chaos.This is a truly exquisite movie, one of the best I've seen this year.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sat down to watch "Tree of Life" directed by Terrence Mallick after dinner recently and after about 30 min was asleep on the couch. It was right about the time where dinosaurs appeared and cosmos/stars are erupting and waterfalls and the earth look sort of primordial. After asking my friend if it was worth finishing, negative was the answer. I got that there had been a death in a family, and then images become interlaced with near whispering and the movie kind of floats away. I give it 3 out of 10 for the beauty of some of the imagery and the effectiveness of it as a sleep aid. I was lights out and in dream-land, pretty much the same place the filmmakers were for this.</fullReview>

I do not wish to insult anyone writing his/her opinion, like other reviews have done, but this was a complete waste of time. I have never been a Sean Penn fan, and he did not let me down. He showed no trace of acting ability. I am surprised that Brad Pitt allowed his name to be associated with this film. Sorry Brad, never again.

		<shortDescription>Being and time; cyclical and linear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haters gonna hate. A certain fact rendered manifestly true by a majority bombastic and simple-minded 1-star reviews previously posted. It is certain that this film is not for everyone. I would not recommend it for people who arrive at the end a film and immediately demand what the 'point' is; i would not recommend it for individuals who are not comfortable with ambiguity; nor people who are impatient; nor those who have a strict affinity for linearity in films.People have an insatiable tendency to confuse ambiguity with pretension. An easy mistake. But certainly not one that justifies the vehement disregard this film has received from more narrow-minded viewers. The Tree of Life is difficult to call a 'film' in the conventional sense. It is one part exploration, one part essay, one part artistic vision, one part stab at that 'je ne sais quoi' element of human creative existence. There is no 'argument'; certainly no 'point' that one walks away with. It is simply a jab, a try--an exploration at existence, transcendence and genesis executed with a sharp and powerful artistic vision. There are references to the bible, which naturally is a big turn off for me in general; but I find it more a gesture at exploring the human relationship with life and death, which is the perspectival linchpin of the film itself.The film has no point except for provocation. Ideas? likely; a thesis? almost certainly not. The fragmentary nature of the film makes it difficult, but it mimics the function of our own memories, which is similar to the structures of dreams: outlined by strong yet undefined tidbits, strongest in their emotional and conceptual ramifications. The film is long and it can be difficult to follow but only if one wants to understand every scene independent of the context of the whole film. The music is splendid; the production and the cinematography is one of the best I've ever seen; there are a few elements that did not strongly resonate with me, that is certain. Most importantly, however, is the film's ability to captivate and shape its audience and leave you not with something to 'think about', but moreover with something unique and spurious, planted within you that may always remain undefined (hail the haters).For those of us who approach a film not with a Berlin wall of prejudices and expectations but a tabula rasa waiting to be colored and effected into ourselves: you will enjoy the beauty and questions brought about from this unique and visceral film.... ***I would recommend a higher resolution TV and a at least mad decent sound system turned up to 'Thunder' level.*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Dumb To Recognize A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a perfect film. That is a fact. No one is trying to be Kubrick, and in many ways (especially after this film) I would say Malick has surpassed Kubrick. When people do not understand what they are watching they decide to hate. When people do not get explosions or a similar formula they decide to hate as well. Just search any fantastic film that does not have the standard film formula. Drive and Bellflower both come to mind. Both are filled with reviews by people who understand the film, and those who do not. Read the reviews by those who do not, and you will find the reviews are identical. Pretentious is the word they love to throw around the most. I challenge you to think of all the films similar to this, and you will find the negative reviews have the same context. It must be in the negative review by wanna be critics 101 handbook along with repeatedly answering questions they have asked themselves in their own review. Like the WHO KNOWS? guy. Any way this is the greatest film of the decade so far, and I can't wait to see it again. Oh and THIS FILM IS THE REASON BLU-RAY WAS INVENTED! Don't watch it any other way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meant to Draw Reactions from Viewers as Exclusive and Individual as What Malick Shows Us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rapturously beautiful to an overwhelming degree, lyrically captured with a poet's eye and a metrical, symphonic ear, this purely individual vision is a film of cosmic ambition and profound constancy, meaning no less than to embrace all of existence, including its infinite unknowns, and see it through the spectrum of a few microscopic lives. The one other film I've ever seen that seizes the inconceivably extraordinary magnitude and nature of the universe is 2001: A Space Odyssey, and still it lacked Malick's intense suggestion of human emotion. There used to be numerous directors who longed to make nothing short of a work of art, but now there are merely a handful. Malick has preserved a purer integrity to that hope than virtually any other American filmmaker, ever since his first film in 1974. I can't recall when a film has united more immediately with my own existential memory and human sensitivity.In uncanny ways, the central events of this orchestral recollection of the intangible reflect a time and place in a way that had to have been lived and felt and remembered in order to be seen this way, and the boys in it are the boys in us all. His abstruse scenes render an upbringing in an American small town, where life pours in and out through open panes and glass. There's a father who upholds authority and a mother who radiates forgiveness, and lingering summer days of running and spontaneity and burning whispered questions about the worth of it all. The three boys of the O'Brien family are bronzed by the sun, scraped by play, troubled by hints of grown-up secrets, awash with an immense urgency to mature and realize who they are. Watching them grow from infants to adolescents is a recollection of the intangible, those early images upon which so much of our perception has since been built that to see that minutiae encapsulated on screen makes this odic film one of the most celestial experiences we're likely to have at the movies, if you're patient, and thankful for something so distinctive and superlative to be getting as much exposure in American cinemas as it is.Uncanny truly is the word for how acutely and lyrically Malick evokes our own common reminiscences of childhood, which he knows we somehow always remember with a wide-angle lens. Houses that are always unlocked. Mothers peering out windows to watch over their children. The summer heat and tedium of church services, the volatile drama of the dinner table, and the disconcerting resonance of a fight between parents, distantly heard through an open window. I grew up in a very urban environment, the doors locked and everything air-conditioned. Makes no difference. Most of us, unless very unfortunate, have something of the same childhood, because we're cosseted by gullibility and innocence.The parents are named Mr. O'Brien and Mrs. O'Brien. Of course. The parents of other kids were never conceived of by their first names, and the first names of your own folks were only said by others. They were Mom and Dad, or Mother and Father, and they delineated your reality, and you were defenseless against their emotions, both reassuring and upsetting. And young Jack O'Brien is maturing, and someday he'll be Mr. O'Brien, but will never feel to himself as palpable as his father did.Seldom is film more clearly an alliance of passion between director and production designer. Jack Fisk's design fixes like a dream into the characters' lives. What makes the film so rhapsodic is that Malick conceives the O'Brien parents and their sons without an observable plot: The movie seizes the unscheduled relating of summer days, and his matchless use of voice-over in his work, in the case in the guise of the eavesdropped questions and thoughts too afraid to be asked aloud, but are more important than anything that's ever said aloud.Some critics have said Mr. O'Brien, Brad Pitt having never before been so everyman, is too harsh as a tyrant. No, he's doing what he believes is proper, as he was raised. As kids we begrudge discipline, and certainly a kid would occasionally get hit at a 1950s dinner table. But pay attention to a finely tuned exchange between Jack and his father. "I was a little hard on you sometimes," Mr. O'Brien says, and Jack responds: "It's your house. You can do what you want to." Jack is backing his dad against himself. That's how you grow. And it all occurs in this flicker of a lifetime, encircled by the dominion of unthinkable time and space.In murmured words near the beginning, "nature" and "grace" are heard. We've seen the natural world as it reciprocates. One of the family's boys dies. We also see how it plies time, as Jack develops into a middle-aged man. The film's afterthought offers an imagination of a spirit world, an isolated terrain on which hushed people somberly recognize and reunite with each other, and all is accepted in the whole of time.This distinctive film's likeness of daily life is surrounded by vast enormity in space and time, as well as spirituality. The Tree of Life has overwhelming visuals evoking the origin and growth of the universe, the advent of life at a minuscule stage and the progression of species. This evolution sets the current moment, and us all, in motion. We came about in the Big Bang and over untold millions of years, molecules shaped themselves into, to cut a long story short, you and me, Jack and his father.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but definitely very interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not consider myself a fan of director Terrence Malick's, but with the exception of The New World, I liked his movies because they possess an intense sensibility which captures the prepared spectator and transports him/her to the universe the characters live, in order to share their experiences and speculate about their motivations. And besides of that, we have the visual quality Malick brings to those movies, which combined with their ethereal atmosphere, brings them a spiritual and dream-like tone which we do not see from any other filmmaker (maybe with the exception of David Lynch, even though I would not dare myself to compare them because their films possess a completely different tone). What brings me to The Tree of Life, Malick's most recent film, and maybe the densest one in ideas and most ambiguous one in narrative. The result is not great, but I definitely found it very interesting.If it had not been made with such a visual beauty and emotional honesty, I would have laughed at the huge ambition from The Tree of Life. And if I were more cynical, I would say that I would have found it a combination of naturalist documentary and pretentious art-house cinema with an excessively obtuse message in order to take it seriously. However, Malick's direction and his fine dramatic instincts make the substance to transcend the shape, becoming the slowness from the movie into methodical reflection, and the arbitrariness from its narrative into a puzzle which invites us to solve it, not necessarily for us to know the hidden shape in its fragments, but to discover the value from the process itself. On the other hand, I understand that not every person will accept the homework of deciphering the intentions from a film which does not seem interested in telling a coherent or conventional story. And The Tree of Life certainly suffers from some of the symptoms from the most pretentious independent cinema, like some whispering dialogs which in fact say nothing, and confusing manipulation of time without an apparent purpose.As any work of art worthy of being, The Tree of Life is deeply subject to the personal interpretation. So, some people will take this film as a cathartic and intensely personal religious epiphany; to other people, the film could confirm the power of the pitiless natural order over the spiritual fantasies from the egocentric human beings. In other words, the juxtaposition of prosaic domestic routines with views from the space might mean that the life, the memories and experiences from humans are as vast as the universe itself. Or it might mean that the big tragedies, moments of happiness and decisions from our lives are inconsequential into the big scheme of the universal existence. I honestly do not know, and I am not worried in defining it, because I think that the experience itself of watching The Tree of Life is more important than its message.The Tree of Life never bored me, because its mere combination of music and images made it a very interesting spectacle, with a beautiful visual style and a good level of emotional potency. So, I do not think it is a great film, but I think I can recommend it as an innovative experience (as strange as the comparison might sound, I would describe The Tree of Life as a combination of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and 2001: A Space Odyssey -even though I did not like it as much as those two films-).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The prerequisite of granting "The Tree of Life" a proper rating is the initial recognition of this as a movie. If I am to say this is a highly kaleidoscopic and sophisticated art piece, I bet most of you will nod. Nevertheless, not many will agree to this being a film to be shown in the cinema.I am in no position to judge nor to logically refute the different points of views of others, but I would ask this: Who are we to determine the definition of "movies"? This is certainly a movie out the ordinary "boundary" of movie making. The main concern is the long length which may make the movie a bit tedious for some. Another concern is the "unnecessary" inserted section of the Discovery Channel. But is it really unnecessary? Well, I honestly do not know. But I personally have no problem with that, though I have no idea what the purpose is and why it needs to last almost 15 minutes.If you view this as a film, the plot is quite good. It is about a young boy losing his innocence and it also discusses our attitudes towards life. Christian overtones are spread throughout, and at the very beginning of the film, it is stated that a man has two ways through life, which are the way of nature and the way of grace. Frankly speaking, I find this to be quite deep and I do not really fully understand the concept of this, let alone comprehend the whole point or the ultimate message of this picture.The plot alone is sufficient to make this an excellent movie. I certainly fail to understand it fully. I simply do not see the point of load of things in the movie, and I believe many of you feel the same way. I don't know if it is the director's intention to make us leave the cinema with all these never-to-be-answered mysteries or is it just me that fails to understand what the hidden message is. Or maybe there just isn't any. Maybe it wants us to think whatever we want to think and learn whatever we can learn. Either way, for now, I will see this film as a little combination of arts and a drama with a good story. Perhaps in time I will be able to understand more of it. I hope this review will help some people decide whether to watch "The Tree of Life" or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You get the pace of the movie the fist 5-10 minutes in: its gonna be a slow crawl of a film. But you bear the drudgery and hope it comes to a decisive climax and everything endured will makes sense and reward you at the end. Then you get blasted with national geographic footage, in slow motion lethargy, chalk full of cgi cell division (I'll say it again - CELL DIVISION) and dinosaurs... and this goes on for 20-30 excruciating minutes. And Im a sci-fi junkie but I seriously thought about leaving at that point. It was just way too excessive. The good news is, once people start showing up again, we finally get to see the film we actually came to see. I enjoyed the mechanics of the story telling; skipping from frame to frame like sorting through memories; recalling bits and pieces, some standing out more than others; from his father's hand on his shoulder to lager themes like crime and death. I also appreciated the way it was shot, as if from the point of view of an adolescent boy. You remember what it was like to be a child perceiving your parents, siblings, and the general awareness of the world around you. So it wasn't a total dud of a film, it just wasted a lot of time expressing simple concepts with abstract, long drawn out obscurities that come off vain and overdone. I also felt the ending was unsatisfying, so I understand how some might say it was a pointless movie. However, when it was on point, it was effectively brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My tastes in movies run to the unusual, so I gave this one a chance. Even convinced my family to come along on the strength of the over-the-top reviews and overall high IMDb score. Big Mistake. The beginning was boring and pretentious- a few snippets of dramatic scenes followed by an endless ripoff from 2001, a space odyssey. I stuck through to the end because I was hoping it would get better, and here and there were brief engaging scenes, but only long enough to tease, never long enough to tell a story. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the classical music well-chosen. But the movie did not get better, it just got worse. The ending is a rehash of the most trite and nonsensical 'ideas' of those who turn off their brains when they turn on their religion. In fact, this was probably the only real laugh in the movie, although it was not intentional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not for everyone, some of you will find this movie as pointless and and boring others will view this movie as a masterpiece. I will not spoil this film so let me just explain what you are to expect in this type of movie. It runs 134 minutes, the film interprets the story by visual affects and an amazing musical score that fits with it. The story is also told in narratives by main characters with some conversations between them as a family. This film does not have a lot of dialog but it is easy to understand what each character is going through. It is a slow movie, the first 30 minutes is very slow but it does pick up and the story starts to unfold in which you can have a sense of understanding for each character and what they go through. What I want to say for those who are going to rent this movie to watch it, watch it with an open mind and try to get the big picture. It is not a complex film the visuals and the music makes it easier to understand what is going on. This film basically explains the fragility of life we can come into this world in such a complex matter but we can disappear in a blink of an eye.RatingMusic - Beautiful score 10/10 Visuals - Gorgeous and breath taking visual affects 10/10 Story - Not original but the way it was done is very original 8/10 Cast - All star cast 10/10 Progression - Starts out really slow which could be a problem for some 7/10 Length - A little to long for this movie they could have made it shorter instead they added some stuff that didn't seem relevant to the story 7/10Overall 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A personal film that hit me personally</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sitting on the squeaky antediluvian chairs of my local art house theater, I restlessly waited for the opening scenes of Terrence Malick's Palm d'Or winning film The Tree of Life. I knew very little about its premise other than it involved a suburban family circa 1950 and it was a meditation on love, faith and our place in the universe. I figured an auteur with such ambition deserved a few miles detour from my usual Cineplex.Like many critics, I struggle to find the appropriate words to describe this film. It's inertia is based on conjecture and inhabits many places in my mind both sublime and maddening. It may be because the imagery on the screen (images in the first act notwithstanding) unlocked details and memories dormant in my mind. The exhilaration of jumping off my bike mid pedal, the bitterness of talking back to my father for perceived cruelties, the calmness of being embraced by my mother. The whole spectrum of emotions traveled back and forth between the film and myself that at points I wanted to walk out take a breather.Each segment starts with the same wisps of light, not unlike the first images a baby might see upon being born. The voice-over during these segments speaks of nature and grace; Nature can be selfish and self-gratifying while "Grace doesn't try to please itself. Accepts being slighted, forgotten, disliked. Accepts insults and injuries." Malick is part of a select few filmmakers who fully appreciates film both for its storytelling capabilities and its potential as a visual medium. He doesn't just capture images he captures their details, their textures; in short, their essence. Bookend before the family drama, there are vibrant images of the universe forming, microbes taking shape and creatures bravely venturing out from the primordial ooze. As we are introduced to the character of Jack, the eldest son (Hunter McCracken/Sean Penn), we understand that he is meant to present that duality. His story is then put into perspective as occupying a place in time.Existential quandaries aside, the film is not without its faults, not the least of which is its maddening dialogue. Its always serious in tone and at times joyless; in fact there's very little of it to begin with. In between voiceovers, people speak at one another but rarely respond. When they do the camera flickers through time where their words, actions and even dreams become responses to what was said hours or even days before. The film also draws comparisons to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Au Hasard Balthazar (1966) and the work of Andrei Tarkovsky which is certainly an asset for those who enjoy such fare. Yet for popular audiences, The Tree of Life will simply seem prosaic. I ended up watching this film twice and twice audience members walked out midway.Luckily unlike Kubrick's opus or Tarkovsky's milieu, Malick takes natural human impulses and paints a vibrant picture of hope. We as human beings have come to a point in time where we vaguely understand the nature of grace. We look up at the stars or down at the blades grass and try desperately to make connections, find meaning, and hope for salvation. The last scenes show a large group of people greeting each other familiarly on a plane of shallow water. Sean Penn walks through a doorway to join the rest of his family and friends. It's a beautiful image and one I will not soon forget.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this to be a beautiful and engaging film that explores the loss of a child, the memories of that life, and the aftermath of the loss. It also explores the complicated relationships between mother and son, father and son, and brothers while at the same time showing a grandiose vision of nature- making the human existence seem so small in comparison. A brilliant compilation of images and stories made me feel like I was in a dream, or heaven perhaps.I can't imagine the pain of losing a child and I don't even have one of my own yet. To have to go through the rest of your life with the weight of the loss on your shoulders and heart must be forever challenging. Yet at the same time, hopefully makes you realize that life is short and so very precious- as are children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'd be forgiven for thinking the first 40 minutes is in fact some long drawn out commercial for a fragrance by Davidoff, then while growing increasingly impatient as to hearing the sultrily whispered brand name which you've presupposed to be life, ocean or evolve, the whole thing morphs into BBC's walking with dinosaurs minus the interesting facts and warm Attenborough voice over of course. Out of this excruciating tangent of scenic imagery some semblance of a film is spawned albeit with limited dialogue, most of which amounts to semi audible existential questions. It soon becomes apparent that this is the extent of what we'll be offered in the way of non linear narrative, that being more or less a non existent one. And before one of the navel-gazing, pompous Canne based critics who astonishingly awarded this thing the Palme d'Or, objects citing the artistic symbolism, I get the symbolism but that said, symbolism without substance is merely a marketing ploy married more to the advertising industry than film. If I wanted beautiful imagery and nothing else I'd spend a few hours strolling around an art gallery and last I checked Malick is no painter, he's the filmmaker that brought us Badlands but on this form has lost his way.</fullReview>

I was already tired of the symbolism, epic scale and grand grandness of everything after 5 minutes in and the movie went on like that for over 2 hours - If anything at all is clear after watching this movie then that the director certainly doesn't believe in subtleties.

		<shortDescription>Lots of thorns on this particular Tree...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been compared to Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Although they share a few things in common - ultra-slow pace, long running times, symbolism, spirituality ? they're two completely different beasts. For one thing 2001 is a science fiction fable; this is ? for the most part ? a family drama. 2001 has - with the exception of that rather dubious jump-cut ending ? a simple and straightforward story that's easy to follow. While Tree of Life is a similar comfortable watch, putting the meanings together afterwards isn't exactly easy.Simply put, the film tells the story of Jack, a somewhat strict and overpowering husband (Brad Pitt) who with his saintly wife (Jessica Chastain) are shaken to their cores upon the sudden death of one of their three young boys. Friction starts to develop between the eldest boy 'Young Jack' (Hunter McCracken) and his father. From there we are shown the creation of the world and dinosaurs (seriously) in an almost twenty minute sequence before going back to the family again and seeing the rest of drama between father and son play out. What was once friction has now evidently become hatred for young Jack towards his tough father. This bit plays out very straightforwardly until things go 'far out' once again for a somewhat 'WTF' ending. So what exactly is this strange mix of a film trying to say? On one hand it could be classed as being religious. The movie is introduced with a biblical quote and has spiritual themes recurring all the way though it. There's even a colorful, undulating amorphous light that pops up at periodic intervals that seems to symbolize the presence of a divine deity. But it could also be classed as cynical. While the death of the child is sad, it figures almost trivially when fitted into the overall scheme of things. Among the many things the film seems to be saying is that death ? no matter how tragic ? is only a small cog in the universe. Things are born and they die. That's just the way it is. Even during the much lauded 'creation of the world' sequence, the film is at pains to point out that the earth and life was not created by the hands of God, but by the immense forces of nature . It's this 'open to multiple meanings' aspect of the film that will get people on the defensive.Of course it's not a perfect film by any standard. It's overlong and even if the Kubrickian 'creation of the world sequence' was removed, you would never even miss it. But for all the vitriol, there are connections to the rest of the film here during the aforementioned sequence. For example we see the much discussed/dismissed dinosaur bit: a beached Plesiosaur stares longingly at the ocean and knows it can't get back, while an injured herbivore is about to be pounced on by a carnivorous dinosaur, only for the carnivore to seemingly hesitate and have a change of mind.These portions have been classed as doing nothing beneficial for the movie but they are relevant: lack of water will kill the Plesiosaur whereas the family child dies due to too much of it, i.e., drowning. In another pivotal scene later on, young Jack watches hatefully as his father works underneath a car. He stops at the lift handle's release and we know he's considering letting the car fall down on his father. But like the scene with the carnivorous dinosaur and the helpless herbivore, he hesitates and doesn't follow through with it. Are we witnessing the birth of choice/conscience?Brad Pitt is excellent as the strict authoritarian but otherwise decent father. Likewise Jessica Chastain playing his long suffering wife adds a much needed gentleness to many tougher scenes. Hunter MacCracken, while effective as young Jack, was seemingly told to emit one facial expression for the whole running time.Terrence Malick has a lot in common with Stanley Kubrick: they both shun the limelight, both have a small back catalog and only make movies once every few years, and both have a deep interest in the human condition. Heck, even their names are similar. But if Terrence Malick is Stanley Kubrick's heir, one thing his movies have is heart, whereas Kubrick's output was more soulless and clinical. It's the same thing here: this movie has a lot of heart.Of course there are a lot of critics who are applauding this as a 'masterpiece' for the wrong reasons. Let's just say the gift of hindsight is great thing. Many of the critics who slated aforementioned 2001: A Space Odyssey upon release in 1969 were left with egg on their face years later when that film's initial reception was revised and it was hailed as a modern classic. Likewise modern critics seem to be only too aware of this fact and are clamoring to praise Tree of Life, just in case its reputation grows over time too.This is a movie that won't be to everyone's taste. In fact to the majority of people, it will come across as being boring, over reaching, ponderous and pretentious. The slow pace will feel like it's doubling the already hefty length, pushing the patience of most viewers to the limit. There are a lot of whispery voice-overs in this film. It plays out almost as if those lyrical poetic voice-overs from Malick's own 'Thin Red Line' were stretched to feature length. If you like the idea of that, then you may like this. But compared to the standard stuff that clogs up multiplexes on a weekly basis and the formulaic movies that roll down the Marvel 'production line', 'Tree of Life' has a heart, sincerity, and an intelligence that's rare in movies today and for that reason alone it must be applauded. Even if you only ever watch it once in your lifetime, it's still worth watching at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stunning Misfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was obviously a labour of love for Terrence Malick, but unfortunately the recurring theme of nature as a beautifully destructive, uncompromising, violent, and finally recursive force was an aspect I truly wished was addressed more in the film. 'The Tree of Life' could have played on its obvious strengths to accentuate the parallel between random change in nature and random changes in the lives of human beings.Regrettably, I feel that the the film failed to communicate the link between the personal struggle of the protagonist, Jack - played with conviction by Sean Penn - and the gorgeously shot formation of the world and it's subsequently interesting scenes; in a clever scene flashing back to a prehistoric period, there's a flare of empathy shown by a carnivorous dinosaur to a herbivorous dinosaur. On a philosophical and religious level there could have been more room left for interpretation; Malick leaves every allusion to existentialist self-assessment pretty much stark and bare (which I found jarring, especially when the narrative is so strikingly non-linear). Despite the "straightforward" content, the emotional core was all but lost in the blurry impressionistic scenes, almost showing two separate films in parallel.The relationships in the film are wonderfully acted, and scenes with the brothers really do stir a longing for childhood summers and brotherly bonds, I just feel that it could truly have been a brilliant film, possibly even a rival to '2001: A Space Odyssey', if Malick had ran a more straightforward, honest and real narrative journey for Sean Penn's character in juxtaposition with the weirdness and chaos of the more enigmatic/experimental scenes.For scale and ambition, you can look to '2001' or 'Synecdoche, New York' as contemporaries to 'The Tree of Life' (the latter film holding a truly breathtaking emotional grip on the viewer), but in my opinion the ultimate execution in 'The Tree of Life' was too dry and too flimsy. This review sounds very negative, but it's only because you can see what film 'The Tree of Life' COULD be as clearly as you can see what it is. I would still recommend the film to; a) people who aren't well accustomed to existentialist films - it could be a great starting point - and b) people who appreciate aesthetically pleasing films; the cinematography alone is worth the ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Philosophical and Abstract Art Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to catch this movie in the theaters because it won the Cannes Palm D'Or. While that should be a good endorsement, some really strange movies have also won the prize. This movie also comes with a director like Terrence Malick who is a philosopher as much as he is a film maker. I have seen "The Thin Red Line", and that was definitely not a typical war film. I do not really know what to expect with this one. The film is telling us about a man named Jack (Sean Penn) who seemed to be in the midst of a midlife depression. His thoughts bring us back to his childhood in the 1950s in a Texas town with his dad (Brad Pitt) and mom (Jessica Chastain) and his two younger brothers. Actually that is it. The episodes are random with no definite story to follow. I imagined the scenes appear as they would be seen in the mind of a middle-aged man. There was Jack's confusing interpretation of who and what his Dad really was. Was he a playful and affectionate father or a heartless authoritarian? As with most of us, the Mom is seen as angel, a quiet, and long-suffering woman who was always on his side. It is definitely stream of consciousness, as if Jack was confessing random memories to his priest or psychiatrist. In the beginning, Jack was also thinking about the death of one of his younger brothers (the second child in the family). In his flashbacks, Jack's memories about this younger brother also predominate, with some pretty tense scenes where Jack was seemingly trying to injure him. I guess there was sibling jealousy there as this second child had inherited their father's musical talents. Jack's youngest brother hardly figured in the memories, and we do not really know what happens to him. But we did see several disjointed memories about Jack's neighborhood, his friends, and boyhood pranks.While I may have understood, and was even touched, by these family scenes, the rest of this film was going way over my head. Before segueing into the family flashbacks, there were very lengthy but magnificently shot scenes depicting the Creation of the World, complete with dinosaurs! What those wordless scenes ultimately have to do with the family story -- I really do not know. Similarly, there were the scenes at the end when the adult Jack seemed to have reunited with his other family members looking as they did in the 50s while walking in what looked like a barren wasteland. These scenes were interspersed with several bizarre images, like the mom floating and the two body bags, the meanings of which escape me. I must admit these ending scenes looked indulgent, pointless and even cheesy, but what do I know?As you have read, this is definitely NOT a movie for everyone. In fact, if I had been watching this on a DVD, I might have just fast forwarded through the whole thing, if not turn it off altogether. Running for over two and half hours but hardly any dialog, it certainly gives you time to try to come up with some sensible interpretation of what the director was trying to say, if any. There were narrations but mostly barely whispered, which made some of them really tough to hear properly and comprehend. This is most definitely an art film -- abstract art. So for those thinking about watching this, I hope to have given you an idea of what to expect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm at a loss for words, which is a tough spot to be in when you're trying to write a review.Let me just warn anyone who might be considering dumping a few hours on this film to find out the point. THERE IS NO POINT! If you are a discriminating viewer like I am, you will no doubt laugh at this director's attempt at art creation. The techniques used here are those of amateurs and film students (except for the length). There is a list of problems so long that I'm just not even going to bother. For you Malick promoters, I understand that this is not a review but a WARNING to help real movie enthusiasts avoid this garbage.One thing I must note is the universe sequence, which many found spectacular, and I'm sure solicited most of the comments about the best cinematography. This was of absolutely no importance to film, and was more reminiscent of an episode of Nova than a relationship between father and son. Ah yes, and how could I forget a couple of dinosaurs just thrown into the mix. I can say something about how the CGI was on par with a boring Discovery Channel episode on dino extinction. However Malick was trying to do something more. Attempting to show the creation of the universe 13 billion years ago and then he somehow drifts over to the dinosaurs as if that is the only thing connecting humanity to this time "A Long Time Ago". He is treating his audience like children by simplifying to the point where we just don't care anymore.I was reeling, marveling at the train wreck that Malick had created. I pictured Terrence crying his eyes out in the editing room, filled with despair, trying to edit-in crap from other film footage to repair his sinking ship. During that time he called his friend Kevin Costner for advice on how to spin straw into gold. To no avail. But alas, he appears to have gotten away with it judging by the number of people comparing Mal-ick to Kubr-ick.The only thing that makes me feel better about this film is that I downloaded it for free.BOMB! 1/10 N.B. I rate a 1 simply because this film is trying to fool the viewer into thinking it has content. I rate Sharktopus higher because it is so bad that it's actually amusing without the pretension.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a load of self-indulgent, pretentious&nbsp;codswallop! Malick ought to be ashamed to take money for this tripe - 150 minutes for a story that should have lasted no more than twenty minutes. If you're into symphonic music, there's plenty of it, though why escapes me - totally incongruous.The first thirty minutes is nothing but a slow flow of images of cloud formations, volcanic magma, spermatozoa, and galaxies that you can find anywhere on the Internet. I spent HALF AN HOUR wondering 'WTF is this?'.Then there's a collection of disjointed clips of family life in no chronological order costing TOO MUCH THOUGHT trying to figure out what the hell's going on. Their story could have been and SHOULD HAVE BEEN told in maybe twenty or thirty minutes. Instead, Malick thinly spreads it out for ninety minutes and follows it with yet more images of STUFF&nbsp;- too artsy-fartsy.SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!! One of the most disappointing movies I can ever remember watching - ever. Why did I watch the whole thing? I kept thinking maybe it was me, maybe something will happen. It was like sitting in a traffic jam and waiting for the traffic to break and start moving and it just never does.P.S. This film has had walk outs and drawn boos at Cannes and elsewhere.

You do not need your hand to be held to explain the story to you at all. You have to let go and observe rather than be mindlessly entertained as what we are all simply used to.I really do hope that people will be able to grasp it for exactly what it is. A story of innocence, innocence lost, truth, will, life, death and made in a way that was incredibly blunt but in a truly beautiful way.***semi spoiler alert (content)***I am continually seeing comments ranting about "random" special effects. They are by no means "random". They each have a very (I thought) obvious intended purpose. Yes, they are beautiful but they are simply many mirrors to each facet of emotion, rawness, truth to the story and the characters experiencing life. The amazing cinematography alone (for the entire film) literally had life breathing into it, it was almost tangible just watching it. I was not only moved by the cinematography that people are referring to as lifted from "the universe" but also every single piece of facet of the family that was created into an absolute masterpiece of film. To me every single frame was special and I do not consider anything in there that was for "fluff" or exclusively for the "wow, check this out on blu ray factor" I suppose some people have trouble with juxtaposition or the fact that they have been conditioned into others reading them a story and not allowing their own mind/logic to actually take control for once.I find it really sad that people are missing out on the beauty of this movie, let alone the point of it. This conditioned restriction is a crying shame. This movie is the LEAST pretentious thing I have seen. I am not shocked that some people have given it 1 star ratings, considering box office hits are always movies that strikes a chord with prepubescents. I found it beautiful, magic and moving. I give it 10/10 Thank you for everyone who enjoyed it, understood it and appreciated it.I've only watched it the once but I will take your recommendations to re-watch.</fullReview>

Humans call out to God in grief and get a feeling like God isn't there. This film asks some of the simple question we all ask in grief. "Are you there God? Do you care about Me God? Do you hear Me God?" Terrence Malick and the entire cast, especially Hunter McCracken, do more than a wonderful job stringing together the thoughts, the actions and the history of everything in and attempt to answer some questions about faith, hope, &amp; love. Awesome film, just heartbreakingly awesome!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was simply the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I wasted 2.5h and $20 on a Friday night. I came out of the movie theater feeling car sick.It's not clear to me why this movie is rated so highly. The movie contains an hour of national geographics and an hour of nonsense and five minutes of dinosaurs (which was probably the best part about the movie). There were a few groups who just left the theater 10 minutes into the movie. They would have had to stay for another 20 minutes to figure out what they were watching was about the creation of earth (which was apparently essential to the understanding of the movie). In the end, I didn't even understand which kid in the family died, if he did.All in all, unless you're the type to enjoy watching computer screensavers and dysfunctional families, just skip this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie ever-- and not because I didn't "understand" it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The glowing reviews I have seen for this piece of drek from "professional" reviewers wreak of that thing that happens when they don't "get it" and then write something over the top positive to cover their embarrassment of the fact.A good deal of artists seem to believe that having their melon twisted in angst all the time is a symbol pointing people to the fact that they are great artists. I call this-- missing the boat. Anyone with any wisdom, spiritual maturity or some sense of what this ride is about... is usually generally happy or happily unattached.That Malick and Penn and company got to walk around with furrowed brows for however much time was wasted in the making of this thing... I am sure was a wetdream for them. But the self-obsessed, totally self-consumed, humorless, heavy-handed approach and perspective of this film (save for the last 3-minute payoff-- implementation of every bad film student art-film convention for showing us heaven and/or God's plan and/or the meaning of life-- was just indulgence-personified for the rest of us.Some might have considered this an exercise in combating the A.D.D. MTV style of faster and faster editing that has finally reached its critical mass and is imploding on itself. Even here this film confuses longer scenes with "interesting".If you want to see something that shows what it is to get hooked on the pain and maya/illusion of life and then pays off with what can be achieved as such is let go of, turn instead to Aronofsky's "The Fountain", or DeNiro in "The Mission", or I am happy to give you a long list.Please do not encourage these folks who are so very much missing the boat on all counts... in working out their unresolved shadow at the expense of our ten bucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't remember ever seeing a film as majestic as this. It is a true spectacle in the most profound sense of the word.At the beginning, right after the introduction to the story of the O'Briens, Malick presents an awe-inspiring montage of nature and time with all it's wonder and aggressive imperfections.Then, a montage of little Jack O'Brien, from the moment he is born, until his early teens. This is shot with the same respect and sense of amazement as the previous sequence of images. We see his day to day life with all it's qualities and flaws. But this is much more ambitious than an ordinary family story. It asks questions about life, death, grace, and meaning. Jack is constantly aware of everything that happens around him, and he can't help but wonder why it all happens. Why is his father the way he is? Why has God taken his little brother?The film shows the same grandiosity for the infinite universe and whatever lies beyond as it does for the most intimate of human feelings, because in the end, this is why we have these feelings, to question life, love, and what lies beyond. They are matched in their complexity only by the concepts of time and space.When it gets more into the family drama, I did feel it dragged on, but that probably says more about me then it does about the film. Because this is, without a doubt, as ambitious as a film can get, and it is shot with so much humility and gratitude, it's overwhelming.See it on the big screen, and more than once if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely one of my worst cinema experiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my humble view the only way this film survives is on others wanting to like something seemingly challenging and artistic. I can think of no redeeming feature of this film. There was almost no character development and no plot, and clumsy references to nature, fate and a spiritual world. It was incredibly fragmented and even some of the cinematography was completely undermined by being left swimming in a pile of self-indulgent pap.The most contrived thing I've ever seen. I don't mind no plot. I don't mind no character development. I don't mind some awkward editing. But usually with films of this genre they push the boundaries of cinema for some sort of purpose. They are groundbreaking in their use of prolonged silences to make a compelling point about life or art. This seemed to try to be like so many other better films and failed miserably. It's use of hammy voiceovers, laboured cut-scenes to 'otherworldy' footage. It took an inordinate amount of time to tell a very basic story very badly.The acting was probably OK, in that all anyone really had to do was stumble around looking angry or confused. Which they all did quite well.Exhausting. I read a cinema in Italy accidentally switched the reels and showed this back to front for the first week before anybody noticed. I don't think it would make an iota of difference.Exhausting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrence Malick's Crowning Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: This movie is NOT for everyone. For those of you who haven't seen one of auteur Terrence Malick's films, they tend to be... different. And "The Tree of Life" is no exception. This film is both difficult to describe and to take in. Forget about trying to unravel every mystery and find a clear theme, or even a specific narrative. This is a simple, beautiful story about childhood, emotions, relationships, the universe and even "God", although that is mostly left to interpretation. The family that serves as the emotional anchor and center of the film is portrayed by some amazing actors, many of them just kids. Really, every character comes across as astoundingly genuine. The cinematography also deserves many accolades, with footage seemingly spanning all time and space. I also found the pacing more bearable than other Terrence Malick films I've seen (New World, I'm looking at you) and overall the film left me with a general feeling of near-completeness. I say this because the plot towards the end felt just a bit loose to me. I guess I was looking for a bit more closure, a bit more of a clear theme/message/moral to the story. But for Mr. Malick's work here, I have little but praise and satisfaction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautifully photographed sentimental pseudo-spiritual baloney. The images of rocks, waves, sand were great, but mixing objects of microscopic and planetary size creates confusion posing as "profundity." The underwater photography was fair. The acting by everyone was excellent but the story, such as it was, was trite and obvious, hoping to create "challenge" by scrambling the time sequence for no reason -- an annoying cliché in contemporary films. The sentimental dinosaur scene was off-scale absurd. Everything about it is derivative, from 2001 to Koyaanisqatsi to Jurassic Park to Death of a Salesman. Why did the critics like it? Maybe if you are forced to watch explosions and car chases every day this would be a welcome relief, except for the screechy score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I'm a huge Terrance Malick fan. However, this film's final sequence is such a disaster it puts into question not just this film, but the entire oeuvre of Malick's work. It's that?lame.I was perhaps too eager to see "The Tree of Life," but that shouldn't account for the two times I dozed off (for me it's a first then second time that's ever happened watching a film?and I like "long and boring" more than any other film viewer I know).What stares out from the screen is the fact that Malick had all these ideas from a previous abandoned project that he tries to interject into a second film. That second film is clearly an excuse to use the ideas from "Q" (which resembles Kubrick's "2001" to the point of infringement) and it overwhelms the tacked on story of a family in 1950's Waco.I can see how a director could convince himself that putting these two projects together is valid, but as viewers, we're left out of the process of how that all came about. Something along the line of Winterbottom's "Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story" would have at least included us in what led to what we see on the screen in "The Tree of Life." But instead we get cloying footage of family members running through fields chasing butterflies (I grew up in Texas and know the consequence of that is similar to Job's boils: chiggers.) As an outline, I'm sure the script might have seemed weighty. And much of the footage is impressive (I had time to wonder how many takes it took to get infants and toddlers to do what they did for the camera.) But the characters' conflicts are exceedingly mundane, and to make them interesting information is left just outside our reach (in the opening sequence, for instance, the cause of a death is withheld from us). And I had to go to the credits to find out which of the children Sean Penn played as an adult (may have been my fault since I did doze off).All of what we see in the 1950's drama is clearly heartfelt and certainly well played, but it's never compelling enough to engage. While there's more than a hint of comparison between Brad Pitt's father and Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman," Arthur Miller leads us to the heart of the tragedy in his characters as does Eugene O'Neil in "Long Day's Journey Into Night." Malick objectifies?perhaps in an attempt to universalize?his characters right off the screen. They are cut-outs made translucent with gauzy photography and clichéd circumstance.While the conclusion of the film is welcome, the final sequence is not only unworthy of the audience's time; and it's extended to the point that I actually felt resentful for the actors. What were they told to do on that beach? Wander around and look?look?. What?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning portrait of life, death and everything in between.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's epic and expansive Tree of Life is surely one of the most divisive films of the past decade (you either really love it or you really hate it) but for me it was everything it aspired to be. Malick simultaneously crafts a study of the duality of man, an emotionally profound coming-of-age story, an exploration into the dynamics of fear, power and compassion that have been present before man came into being and will remain present long after man is gone, along with about a thousand other things. It's a wildly ambitious project and I don't think anyone other than Malick could have pulled it off so well. The family story is emotional and involving and the examination into life and death that surrounds this family is overwhelming and visually the most astonishing thing put on film in quite some time.The study of life and death was endlessly fascinating and will be sure to keep me thinking long from now, but what struck me the hardest during my viewing was the tale of this boy caught between the grace of his mother and the intimidation of his father. Jessica Chastain and Brad Pitt are both remarkable, perfectly embodying these opposing forces that keep young Jack in a constant state of turmoil. Hunter McCracken is excellent as well as the boy in question. I knew going in to expect the visual orgasms from the life and death sequences, but what I wasn't expecting was how vividly Malick was able to capture life as a young boy. I found myself entirely drawn back to my own childhood as he perfectly displayed the kind of freedom that comes with running around with your friends, the anarchy of being a boy with the world at your feet and the kind of palpable tension that can come from a dinner table when your father is in a bad mood. Malick caught me off my guard with how well he was able to display what it's like to be that age in that kind of home; I felt like I was 13 again in those scenes.But of course along with that does come this stunning sensory approach to detailing life and death, with Malick demonstrating once again his ability to elicit emotion without saying a word. The beginnings of the earth had me jaw-open in amazement just from the visuals he brought to the screen, the kind of thing that comes along once in a blue moon. Then came his display of crossing over, which brought me to tears from the shear beauty and emotion of it all. It's the kind of thing that is so hard to put words on in order to explain how hard it hits you; it just hits you and leaves you reeling. I haven't been able to stop thinking about the film since it finished and it's surely the kind of picture that demands multiple viewings; I feel as though it can only get more rewarding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You are standing in a glass lift. It's all silent. You take in the scenery as you go up. Then you close your eyes. Time passes by and you open your eyes once again. A different image fills your mind. This is how you will experience this film.It begins in 1950s America, expands its horizons and goes beyond that. Time becomes meaningless through an incoherent mass of visual beauty. Formation of the universe and origins of life are explored in Kubrick (think 2001: A Space Odyssey)/National Geographic style, and the life of an American family living in 1950s America is revealed through the memories of Jack, a member of the family living in modern times. There is no character with a tangible goal in mind. No chases, no action scenes. It can't even be described as a typical drama. A fairly unorthodox film that can be watched both in a passive state of mind, whereby you can allow yourself to get lost in the visual beauty and hypnotising cinematography offered, or in an active state of mind whereby you can engage yourself in decoding the complex imagery that appear at every instance of this film.A great visual experience...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Metaphysical exploration of memory and emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film designed to force people off the fence. Introducing a flashback to the main body of the film with a 20 minute, VFX-concoted montage of the beginning of the world is an act to polarise the acolytes and the sceptics. I am determined to keep my seat between the camps, although I have to say that I was absorbed by the film. I felt that its methods occasionally grate and its conclusion is muffed - yet the film is a deeply beautiful account of the worth of memory and emotion when held up against the grandest of schemes.Bad stuff. I like the use of voice-over per se, but the pretentious supernatural whispering of disparate single words put me on the back foot at the start. I also couldn't, hand on heart, digest the CGI dinosaurs, even in the small ration with which they are deployed. (This is partly because the film is so terribly beautifully photographed - in a long film with a huge number of edits over the proposed time span this is a marathon effort. Emmanuel Lubezki deserves awards delivered on palettes.) Finally, the cathartic closing tableau isn't brilliantly directed and, irrespective of its purpose, becomes distracting by its stiltedness. Oh, and I also wish that the just-OK Brad Pitt hadn't had to step in for Heath Ledger who would have been sensational.Good stuff. As mentioned, the photography - worth saying again though as it's awe-inspiring. As a necessary adjunct to this is the carefully curated soundtrack, Alexandre Desplat putting together a pointed collection of bits of music to work with the images and the manner in which they are edited. The editing is also pretty good - though for me, once the quicksilver image-vernacular is established, some sequences are over-stated; a breathtaking insert of Jessica Chastain levitating has one cut too many.I was also amazed at the contribution of the children. This is, technically, probably Malick's greatest achievement - and this is clearly a crowded market for technical laureates. Hunter McCracken as the boy (who will become Sean Penn's existentially drowning executive) is brilliant. Penn himself is actually ever-so-slightly lost, clearly uncomfortable as the puppet in the hands of an auteur. Indeed, many of the actors with more than just bit parts do feel rather un-anchored.But then this film is, without doubt, a clearly personal statement of the director (indeed, the subject is said to have autobiographical roots). For all its faults, it has a conviction, borne out in the meticulous curation of every frame, which demands not only respect but non-prejudicial viewing on its own terms. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new genre, or at least one very much its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's Tree of Life is certainly not what the trailer would have you believe. The film is more like a documentary of life, featuring human society as represented by a middle class American family and the world before it, the astronomical and geological beauty of all that surrounds our existence. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a narrative, but its exploration of life and the universe are so stunning and beautiful that the film relies much on its audience to fill in the plot. The emotions of the key characters are, however, laid bare in the faces of its actors.Brad Pitt, Hunter McCraken, and ESPECIALLY Jessica Chastain are left with little between their earnest expressions and the audience. The film favors scenes with no accompanying tracks but the audio of the moment. These long silences allow the audience to connect with these characters without the aid of instructive instrumentals. We are told what events befall our protagonists, but we feel as though these things happen to us. Such is the humbling genius of the film's focus, and its lasting beauty.There is a strong juxtaposition between opposing forces, between the fundamental questions of life and death, and life according to nature and grace. Despite what the trailer would have you believe, there is a heavy emphasis on Christian themes. The film opens with a quote from Job 38:4 and continues throughout with voice-overs questioning God, struggling with the suffering of the innocent.Though the film wasn't what I'd expected, I couldn't deny the accomplishments of its cast and the amount I felt during the entire film. It's a very stimulating and poignant piece, one whose vacancies must be filled in by our own experiences and reflections. If you search hard enough for Malick's intended purpose, you'll not only discover the director's aim but the questions and connections concerning the grandest matters in this life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk to men about their childhoods and you will see a lot of what was seen and experienced in this story. About parents, siblings, friends, the woods, the animals, BB guns, love, hate, ambivalence and.... questions, all those questions about what happened, and why, that were never fully answered by growing up. Terrence Malick's emotionally evocative film was about those many questions without answers, and so beautifully done even if a bit inaccessible at times, but purposefully done to emphasize that there are not clear answers to everything in life.Brad Pitt did a truly great job(his best work IMO) as the father of 3 boys in a small 1950's Texas town, a father discontented with his professional career instead of having an artistic one, a dominating husband and father in those harder days more than 50 years ago who always tried to be involved and instructive in his boy's lives by showing them his best way to behave, thus succeed in life, but always doing it in a harsh and destructive way that ended with him showing his own way of great and outspoken love to them as his form of apology that never seemed to work the way he wanted it to. He was a very involved father in their upbringing, which is usually a good thing, but he demanded total control over them in all behavioral things, and also total obedience or big trouble followed, ensuring that his sons either hated him or were wary and scared to death of him even as they knew without a doubt that he loved them dearly.As with a lot of fathers then, he couldn't understand that constantly causing roller-coaster ambivalent feelings in his boys was the worst way to raise kids to be free and open and loving, and happy. His wife, a very loving and sweet mother, tried her patient and non-confrontational best to offset his damaging influence, and was partially and occasionally effective in doing so, but the damage was done and it would last forever. One of the boys, the most artistically gifted, never got the chance to see his life unfold. The one most affected by his father's control was the oldest, Jack, played as an adult by Sean Penn. Jack was obviously a successful architect but was permanently damaged by ponderous and overwhelmingly sad memories of his early family life, his father, and what the loss of his brother did to the family unit so many years earlier. The young Jack was played hauntingly withdrawn as a child by newcomer Hunter McCracken in a heartbreaking and nearly smile-less and mute role that had to cause any good father true sadness and perhaps even anger. That basic underlying story was the largest part of the whole, with a celestial soundtrack and cosmic images connecting it time and again with the adult-Jack story, but always bringing one back to the filmmaker's primary intent.........the nearly unanswerable questions of life.......all the whys of mankind........the cosmos, the earth, early life forms, humans, our relationships, the value of our lives and family and loves, and most of all.....what those do to form our later lives. Emotions of regret and forgiveness we all feel....... regrets for what we did and didn't do that we only see clearly as we get older. Forgiveness to others that would finally free us but is seldom accomplished totally, so we are always partially held captive by that weakness we cannot fully overcome or even understand.This very contemplative story was as haunting as it was beautifully filmed, and was a story that we all could relate to as part of our own unique and life-determining childhood that we think about and appreciate so much more as we get further away from it in time.A beautiful, personal, stylish and artistic film story made for the filmmaker's own inner purpose, the one he so needed to tell us and did so well. But, to me, the very best thing about it was that this story can and will change some lives forever. The best ones always do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tremendous Film - A Scholar's Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Malick's creation is a meditation on life, but it digs deeper than the mere circumstance of it. Human nature itself is dissected in a most revealing way. How innocence dissolves into a knowledge of good and evil; more so, how we select on which side of that precipice we will be. On a scale far grander, the film examines the way our small human lives are not only a part of the immense tale of creation we find ourselves in, but are in fact a transposition of it. Human life, in its own way, is a microcosm of evolution's tale, exemplified, among other ways, in our birth, our growth, our transformation, our interaction and our eventual death.Throughout all this, Malick, of course, never forgets the God from which we all originate. The Tree of Life puts our relationship with Him under the microscope, holding up a mirror to the zeitgeist, that perhaps we may all one day say to ourselves, "When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have ordained; What is man that You take thought of him, And the son of man that You care for him?" (Psalm 8:3-4) Young Jack falls from grace, spiraling down into the "way of nature", but as an adult finds his way back to his Savior. Grace, after all, is a free gift from God.But seeing that this is the film's subject matter seems to be ? by some reviews I have read ? difficult for some to see. Anyone who hated this film likely lives in the modern soup of Michael Bay, MTV and the caveman's narrative, not that they should be faulted for this. But this is not a film for idiots or the uneducated. This is not popcorn porn. The Tree of Life is an impressionistic work of art that transcends contemporary filmmaking -- which has devolved into a paint-by-number format for the lowest common denominator -- and sets new ground for how films should be made; truly, hearkening back to the simple mise en scene of the form. Picture. Music. Emotion. Symbolism. Motif. Scene and Sequence. Malick's creation is a trinity of existential exploration -- the spiritual, the physical and the emotional -- except he's a leader who knows where he's going.Yet its beauty also lies in its simplicity, especially its symbolic simplicity. The sunflower as the "way of grace" (which Sean Penn finds himself eventually). Water representing innocence. The sky as symbolizing God, though never in a pantheistic way. This is a film to be WATCHED, not merely listened to the way current films have "trained" us to do. Anyone who did not understand the film was not watching it, they were merely looking at it. After all, Malick himself is a former Oxford Scholar and has the mind of one; and he understands that a key rule of poetry ? which this film most certainly is ? is that you must never let rhyme dictate the meaning of the poem. That is, in film, you must never let the expected form determine what you will say or how you will say it. Malick, therefore, creates something remarkable that breaks from standard-issue story beats and, rather, ebbs and flows through image and music, and does indeed follow a very specific EMOTIONAL and SPIRITUAL narrative through the use of these PHYSICAL elements.A complete trinity and masterpiece if there ever was one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unparalleled Grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A review I read before watching the film warned that in the cinema landscape, Terrence Malick is a bit like Haley's comet, only less regular. So when a new film pops by, you have to see it. You never know when you might get your next chance!The Thin Red Line is my favorite Malick film so far, so this should give you an idea of where I'm coming from. I have yet to find a more powerful symphony of images and inner turmoil on film. Since then I feel like the elusive Terrence Malick has taken his style to its breaking point, in every sense of the term: overlaid voice-overs, symbolic imagery, oblique meanings... to the point where Tree of Life could be both the apotheosis of his past work and a parody of his previous films at the same time, especially when characters are a bit harder to relate to, as they were in The New World.Tree of Life grounds its story more carefully: in the home of a 50s suburban family with several boys, rules by an angelic mother (Jessica Chastain, impossibly ethereal) and tyrannical father (Brad Pitt, mesmerizing). Years later, they lose a child, and one of the grown siblings (Sean Penn) looks back on his childhood, trying to make sense of it all, and as the protagonists ask themselves where God was then, the universe looks on with cold indifference.Nothing is simply normal here, and Tree of Life is without a doubt among the most powerful visions of memory and grace ever put to film, through a combination of heartbreaking performances, miraculous cinematography and fluid, train-of-thought editing. It is the kind of film where an aside about the birth of the universe feels not out of place but essential, and for that part alone, this is an essential experience.There are dangerous signs of impending implosion though: Malick continues his tendency of finding the film in post-production, and Sean Penn is, to a certain extent, wasted here. The layered voice-overs are just the right side of parody, but if the whole thing had missed this very fragile equilibrium, we might have had an overindulgent disaster on our hands, and, graceful as it is, this one as it stands has proved especially divisive among audiences. It will be interesting to see what Malick does next: whether he reins it in a bit, or descends into self-parody.What you will make of Tree of Life depends on your personal taste, and patience with this kind of meditation. If you've been yearning for a truly gorgeous ode to grace and the wonders of the universe, Tree of Life is as good as it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A journey for ANYONE who wants a ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The key here is to know that the movie is a ride Terrence Malick is going to take you on, be prepared with the right mindset. If you want a journey through life, then this is it. The main aim of the movie is not to show you an interesting plot, nor stun you with its incredible cinematography and music so that your lives would be changed by some profound philosophical ideas. Rather, it's a movie begging you to be linked with the characters, most crucially to be linked with Jack, to remember things that we must all experienced in the past and might be long forgotten, for example our childhood, our loss of innocent, our bad desires, our struggle when we were growing, or to sum it up, the most crucial times of our lives which shaped us to be who we are now. Hopefully like Jack, you could reconnect those moments with love in the end.Enjoy the ride, I doubt that you'll be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visual Symphony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's "The Tree of Life" is a profound and visionary celebration of life and the many moments we find ourselves in awe of it. Often in life, we witness the insurmountable beauty in the universe, we perceive the smallest of objects or tiniest of events as something much more deep and meaningful, and we question philosophical views of creation, existence and good and evil in hopes to make sense of the universe and ourselves. It is through these moments that "The Tree of Life" thrives, grows on us, and leaves us thinking and wanting more."The Tree of Life" is a visual masterpiece as the art direction and cinematography are absolutely breathtaking. Malick is possibly one of the best directors at getting the most, visually, out of every shot. The visual components are correlated beautifully with Alexandre Desplat's haunting and mesmerizing score that samples work from Bach and other composers. Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain excellently personify 1950's parents of an imperfect yet vehement family and young Hunter McCracken transcends self-confliction very well. While the film's story may appear simple at the exterior, its core branches out to anything but that.The film is not without its flaws, however; some parts are excessive while others are less effective, the ending is slightly prolonged, and Sean Penn's character is not used to his full potential (though Penn delivers given his small screen time).Creation, death, existence, good and evil, love, self-confliction and growth, and life; all are themes touched upon in "The Tree of Life." This film is not for everyone, and even those who appreciate it will be challenged. But isn't that what we as the audience deserve? Too many films today exchange passionate filmmaking for cheap tricks and quick, easy satisfaction. We have nothing to work for, nothing to think about. Malick's "The Tree of Life" demands more. While not perfect, it is a poetic journey that extends the visual boundaries of filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I watched the trailer of this film, I knew it would be something very extraordinary. It shows the life in all guises and forms but the most - under strong emotional content. It is a film you need to submerge and leave your reason and follow it by inner sentiment, the one of compassion and open heartiness, to understand that the life must be lived with grace and not by nature.The great amount of images of vast spaces in the universe, constellations and many more and their connection with life and its formation reveal something divine.The film depicts such a strong family bonds between father, mother and children - fundamentals for life. The children are presented in such a striking way, showing heir innocence in their early age, untouched by any vices. It shows how the father (Brad Pitt) wants to breed and educate them, to make them better men. What can be greater and more dignified than to be a wise and loving father for your children? Brad tries it best despite the influence coming from his job.Every feeling for life, every image and emotion, every dream and yearning to understand what life is and how it must be lived is represented so delicately - a true feast for senses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I watched this film with a friend and at the end of the movie she said "that was one of the worst movies I have seen in a while." I couldn't help but to just stare at her and wonder what she got from it. To me, it is a haunting portrayal of childhood and the beauty of life. We hardly appreciate the world around us and the way we live. This movie will make most people think about that. I was left stunned. The quote "The only way to be happy is to love. Unless you love, your life will flash by," worries me. I praise Malick for doing what other films do not do. He didn't care about commercial success, but instead put more effort into making art out of a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First words that come to my head after watching this movie - deep and fascinating. Simple and in other way complex story without unnecessary words and dialogues - views and music express everything, you just need to open your mind and enjoy the philosophical journey through LIFE. I may understand other negative reviews of this movie, because it is definitely not wide audience movie, it goes much further than nowadays Hollywood brings with its usual and boring plots. Do not expect the usual drama, long conversations and usual predictable plot, expect complex, multi-layered story, that flows slowly like river, expect impressionism, flow of thoughts and verbally unexpressed ideas and you won't get disappointed. It is a work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of two ways to live our life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start off by giving the brief details of the story. One of the first (and very few lines) of the movie is, "There are 2 ways through life, the way of nature and the way of grace." Brad Pitt lives the way of nature, that you have to be tough, aggressive, and as he says in the film "fierce will to get ahead in this world". Jessica Chastain who is the next big thing in acting (TRUST ME ON THIS)lives the way of nature. She is loving to her kids, and doesn't expect unrealistic things of her kids like Pitt does. Both parents do love their kids though and want them to succeed but they just show it in different ways.When I first saw this film, I left the theater feeling ripped off of $11. But then when I was at work the next day, I had 7 hours just to myself and all I could do was think about this film. When the movie is done you feel as if it covered nothing, and that it was just 2 hours of random shots. Which in a way it is and it isn't. What Tree of Life is, is a story of everything. Another thing is that this film is impossible to spoil, because after seeing it, it's almost impossible to comprehend. This film is truly a gem and unlike any other film i've seen. It definitely takes more than one viewing to comprehend the film. But what i do recommend is that after seeing it you just think over every little piece of the film. Because yes even the dinosaurs have a purpose in this film.</fullReview>

There is no telling you details on what it is about. It's about life. It's an experience. I can tell you that depending on where your faith lies, and how strong it is, will greatly determine the feeling the film will leave you with.

		<fullReview>if we ever meet an alien species and have to exchange notes, this is it. there are movies and then there are movies. the tree of life transcends movies and documentaries into the realm of movies that is an ambitious art project that tries to capture what is life within the constraints of its runtime of around 2 hours. i would have been disappointed if it dealt solely around the theme of loss (which movies like rabbit hole and blue valentine did pretty well lately) which it seemed set to be centered on when the movie dawned. there was a 20 minute interlude on evolution like the 20 minute prelude on 2001: a space odyssey. in 2001, it tried as much as possible to avoid the human aspect of life, probably because thats how insignificant kubrick thought it should be in his scheme of things in the movie. kubrick's went tangentially into space and life as we don't know it while mallick goes tangentially into life as we know it. the classical music soundtrack with a flurry of pieces by brahms, mahler and bach and a whole lot of others which i wasn't fit to recognize was a revelation as was the cinematography. it would be travesty if this film doesn't win the cinematography at the Oscars. terrence mallick is a director who doesn't seem to be comfortable with making movies which will be forgotten by the turn of the decade. he has made a film that will make experimental film makers like werner herzog proud. in tree of life, he has found a worthy successor to badlands and days of heaven. i would rate this even higher than those two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big smelly turd (spoiler alert...this movie stinks)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see the new film The Tree of Life this week. I was very excited since the film was just screened at Cannes and here I was seeing the same film here in Sacramento a few days later. Of course I also heard that the audience boo'd the film at the end which is very much not typical for the Cannes Film festival. The last time I remember hearing something like that was when they showed Marie Antoinette at the Venice Film Festival. In the case of Marie Antoinette the audience was right, yet a repeat was not making me turn back. I was seeing this movie and that was that.When i arrived at the theater there were only five other critics there and we were all looking forward to the film even though we all had heard about the screening at Cannes. The movie starts out very mysteriously with an out of focus shot that almost looks like a child's fort under a bed sheet with a mumbled whispering going on all around us. At this point the movie just lost me. The film is not linear so what appears to be a storyline just becomes random shots of this family on any given day. At one point the mother in the film gets a telegram telling her one of her sons in dead ? I don't know which one nor at this point do I care. Sean Penn comes on screen as one of the brothers grown up and he mumbles something about his brother being dead (which had to have happen 30 years prior) and then he does a lot of aimless staring. All of a sudden he's on a beach ? there is a door. He walks through it and at that point we see what had to have been at least 30 minutes of the creation. Planets and suns being born in a cosmic opera ? at this point I'm really fighting sleep. The music and the darkness in the theater mixed with my complete confusion made shut down. If it weren't for me thinking about getting lunch I probably would have had about a two hour nap.When we came back from the Hubble telescope free for all we got more boring moments in this families life for what felt like hours. I'm not really sure what this thing was about and i don't care. I've read other critics thoughts on this and many are glowing on what a master filmmaker Terrence Malik is but I don't see it. I'm not a fan of any of his previous work and after my torturous afternoon, I never will be. I can't come up with any BS about how he toys with our imagination and that's why he's a genesis ? I have to go the way of the Emperor's New Clothes. I can't fake praise for this film. I can't pull some clever comments out of my ass to make it sound like I felt his art. I have to call it for what it is ? a turd. A big smelly turd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Meditative Limrick: Mysteries of Vivacity"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Terrance Mallick ("The Thin Red Line") takes the audience on a journey through life and death with his latest cinematic feat, "The Tree of Life". For many this film may come off as boring and very odd, but if given the chance the dots are connected and the meaning within comes full circle. Within the two hour and fifteen minute prophetic poem about creation, the life of a man named Jack O'Brien (two time Academy Award Winner Sean Penn, "Milk") and his troubled and complicated childhood in the 1950s is explored. Academy Award Nominee Brad Pitt ("The Curious Case of Benjamin Button") stars as Jack's hard-ass father Mr. Obrien who strictly teaches his three boys how to become young men. On the other side of things is Jack's mother, Mrs. Obrien (Jessica Chastain, "The Help"), who nurtures her sons with a mother's caring grace. Newcomer, Hunter McCracken plays Young Jack revealing the pain that his childhood caused him with the conflicting actions of his mother and father and the unfortunate events the family experiences. The family is plagued by loss and sorrow as they are forced to cope with death and a fading belief in God. While the earthly, comprehendible part of the film is based around a family, the true meaning will warrant multiple viewings. An open creative mind is necessary to fathom the divine commencement and culmination of the film expressed through visual representations of a higher power and the gift of life."The Tree of Life" is an original meditative cinematic limerick with Oscar worthy direction, cinematography and editing coupled with celestial interpretive images. The acting talents of Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Hunter McCracken and Sean Penn's mild appearance support Mallack's visual artistry. Pitt has another Oscar worthy performance and newcomer Hunter McCracken is in the league of best performance of the year by a young actor. By centering the film around the family of five, each of the main characters is able to completely develop contributing to the acuity of the overall picture.Mallick proves that patience is a virtue with its peculiar dialogue-free visual story telling. Needless to say, a lot of waiting and persistence is key to extracting meaning from this film. Therefore, if you are not one keen to procuring depth within a film and don't want to wait two plus hours to do so, "The Tree of Life" is not a good movie to go see. Also, while the earthly sequences in the film revolve around Sean Penn's character, do not expect to see or hear much of him in the film.Shadows of Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" are vastly present in "The Tree of Life" as Mallack's creation requires contemplation of the cosmic aptitude of the mysteries of vivacity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caution: The Big Bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a film that takes its viewers from The Big Bang to the future, "The Tree of Life" achieves much of the poetry of Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey," awakens a sense of wonderment in the patient viewer, yet leaves us wondering about what it says of human interaction.Perhaps Malick has simply taken too large a bite for one film.It is certainly a bold effort. And that, in and of itself, is something to appreciate. Very few attempts at such universal themes as meaning, spirituality, our place in time, have been made in the last 25 years.The O'Brien family of Waco, Texas is the human focus of the film. Their home is in the shade of a magnificent, arching tree of amazing size. You may have never seen one like it.The tree serves as the frame of "The Tree..." Intercut between family dialog and children's play, Malick gives us reminding gazes at its trunk, its largest branches and the sky above it. It is as if the tree is a cosmic umbrella, an always present frame for the scurrying below.It is Malick's reminder that humans then and now are not the end-all of creation, not the reason, not even reason in the sense of Descartes. We are just a microscopically small part of the amazing Universe.If we're lucky, we'll find our own meaning along the way and have our memories to define the journey.Don't see "The Tree..." if you want plot or resolution. This will be a polarizing movie. I would say all but ten percent st the showing I attended didn't like it. As one other visitor to the Men's Room afterward said, "That stunk." He was not a thrill seeking, attention challenged man. He was older, of the type who has seen hundreds of good movies. Yet, he just didn't get it.I can't decide whether some of the negative reaction is isolated to just the family story. Malick might have done it differently. removed a disturbing sense of violence in the father, Brad Pitt. Perhaps made the mother more substantial, less intuitive. But isn't that what mother's are? He was certainly telling us that the details didn't matter, as if their sum, no matter what specifics, would always spell lives only important to their immediate memories.Not sure. Still thinking about it. And that is the aspect of the film I liked most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do so many people TRY to like this film !?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK first of all, I've seen my share of artistic (cult) movies, and i'm not a hater. But this whole movie just made me think; this director must be the most egocentric wannabe artist i've ever given my money to. They should definitely not be advertising this as a movie. The trailer should make it clear that for quite a while you will be watching the lsd-trip of an untalented National Geographic intern, mixed with the dinosaur-creating work of a hungover GI "specialist". Further more you should know that half the lines in the movie are whispered to you, asking half-ass open- ended and very cliché questions to the big man in the sky, while you are watching pictures of lava and underwater lightning.Then when you think it can't get any more "I want to make art and be so weird that everybody that says they understand this are just really trying to hard to understand it" and the script of about one page long has already been extended to a 120 minute-movie, the never ending ending begins. With the most corny "we are all in heaven and feel fantastic, forgive each other and all seem to give light"-scene you've ever come across. Seriously, I couldn't help but laughing out loud for a bit. I really tried to keep it in, but man......this movie is more of a (bad) joke than something to be taken seriously. Is there anything good to say about it? Well, yes. The camera-work is good. Not brilliant but just really good. So is the acting and the cinematography of the parts where you are not looking at the portfolio of a new age art school dropout. The so called NG-intern lsd-trip I talked about earlier. The (very) simple story about a difficult father-son relationship compels.The trailer, combined with the presence of Brad Pitt and Sean Penn really got me excited. But in the end I really had to agree with all the people that walked out on it. So if you are not a wannabe artist, or somebody that sees a blue square on a white linen and says "my god this really goes deep, let me think about it", this film is not for you. But if you think blue squares are the answer to all questions in the universe, be my guest. You'll love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie ruined my day. It was the absolute worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. Now, before you go thinking "She didn't understand it", well, I did. It is possible to understand something and still not like it. Take gravity for example: most people understand what it is, but do they love it? Anyone who has ever fallen would most likely say no. There was absolutely no storyline and zero character development in this "movie". For those of you who have not seen it, here's a tip: save your money and use that 2 hours of your life to go watch something that actually has a plot. However, if you want to see lots of pretty pictures and scenes that don't make a story, then by all means, go watch it. My friends and I joked about how it probably took one day to film and five days to google all the pretty pictures. Sincerely~dragonflytarah</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While visually I enjoyed the movie, I found myself, and my wife was too, asking more questions at the end of it than it answered. Perhaps that was the author's intent, and we should be satisfied with that. It's definitely not in the realm of the modern comic book stuff that Hollywood is turning out lately.I can't score it higher than 8/10 however, because of the wandering nature of the film and the fantastic idealized way in which it portrays the life of a deeply troubled man. Although he seems to have made peace with both himself, his dead brother, and his father by the end of the film, it's difficult to understand how or why he had to come to that place to begin with when he seems to have made peace with his father about 3/4 of the way through the film - while yet a child? Artistically, I think the film rates an A, possibly an A+. It's apparent from any angle the clash of ideas that fill this man's head, his thinking is fuddled and he cannot make sense of his own world, since he cannot come to grips with his beginnings.From a story-teller's standpoint, however, since I failed to discern the point (the "main" point as you would call it) of the story, I have to give the film a B, and thus the 8/10 rating. I can't say I really "enjoyed" it either, since it left me with so much confusion. Good movies do not necessarily have to be enjoyable, but they should always make you think, thinking in some particular philosophical direction would have been a good goal for this movie, rather I was simply questioning what it was I just saw, instead of the ideas themselves.A- for effort too though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Engaging Allegory of Existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tree of Life is the fifth feature for the legendary director Terrence Malick whose career is now into its fourth decade. His latest won over the prize committee at Cannes winning the prestigious Palme D'or but it is bound to divide the general audience.Malick does not leave it up to the audience to figure out the meaning of this film revealing it in the opening minutes of the film. It is in the trailer as well. Tree of Life is an allegory on existence. Malick explores the notion that everyone faces the choice between nature and grace as a path through life. Struggle or compromise. Cunning or tolerance.Tree of Life centers around the O'Brian family in Waco, Texas in the 1950s. The parents represent the principal theme of the film. The father played by an increasingly impressive Brad Pitt is a failed musician who runs a disciplined household and teaches his children that you just cannot be too good in this world. The mother who is played by Jessica Chastain has a graceful, almost childlike simplicity that the father considers naive.The couple have three boys, the oldest Jack is played by an impressive Hunter McCracken as a 11-year-old and Sean Penn in adulthood. The boys become torn between their loving mother and assertive father. Hence, nature versus grace. Tree of Life consists of what appears to be random childhood memories from Jack meant to ponder the meaning of existence. These scenes have an engaging subtlety that is the great strength of the film.The scenes that are bound to polarize the audience occur outside the O'Brian family home. Malick breaks from the family scenes on several occasions. We see what appears to be a recreation of the origin of the universe, numerous sea life and even dinosaurs. (Yes, dinosaurs). Malick presumably meant this to further the discussion on the existence of life on earth, as well as the role of God within it.The problem with the Tree of Life is that these scenes do not successfully tie together well with the family scenes or the central theme of the film. For example, the scenes with Jack in adulthood consist nothing but Sean Penn looking gloomy as he goes up the elevator of a tall Dallas skyscraper. It just does not complement the scenes of him in childhood very much.Malick deserves a lot of credit for trying to change the structure of filmmaking in a Hollywood increasingly running out of ideas. Perhaps in a decade Tree of Life will be considered ahead of its time. But for now it is bound to catch many people off guard particularly the opening thirty minutes. At least a half dozen people walked out of the theatre in the opening half hour.Despite this, Tree of Life is worth your time mainly because of the scenes of family life in the 1950s as the family experiences conflict, death and the loss of innocence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an unsatisfying melange on so many levels.The disjointed narrative, consisting of surreal flashbacks, flash-fowards, whispers to god, pretty but meaningless computer graphics, a potted visual history of the planet, and a dysfunctional family where the mean and unhappy father (who represents "the way of nature") is contrasted again a beatified mother (who walks "the way of grace") is simply tedious rather than inspiring, and the supposed spiritual message peppered throughout the film range from the questionable (everyone is redeemed by grace, not by their own efforts) to the blatant and unashamed, such as the preaching in the church.Even if you are willing to forgive the inclusion of the simply bizarre, such as the dinosaur scene where a Raptor seemingly experiences grace and chooses not to eat another wounded dinosaur that is clearly its dinner, even if you are willing to put up with the completely disjointed structure and are happy to have the characters revealed to you in tiny snippets, often without much dialogue (unless it is Brad Pitt being threatening and awful, which we already know he can do well), and even if you are happy to have an unashamedly Christian message rammed down your throat (peoples of other faiths will find this all unsatisfying and annoying), this film still struggles to make its point, and concludes with a scene with Sean Penn that almost made me laugh out loud it was so bad.I would have thought that film that deals with the spiritual dimensions of life should make one feel inspired, in awe of the divine, and touched by something greater yet I found The Tree of Life did precisely the opposite, I felt nagged and beaten by the directors very narrow view of spirituality, and a bit humiliated because I am a person of another faith.Spirituality in art can be universal, and can reach out to all peoples without dogma, and it can portray the things that bind us together in our common and magnificent humanity. This film does not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a perfect "dinner" movie....go to the movie "FIRST"...then have dinner where you can argue, complain, enjoy, smile and talk about the imagery, the story, the ending, the acting and the message. Beautiful visionary message....God is where?...how do we speak to God. Catholic Priest here...I would so love to take 20-30 adults to this movie and have a great theological discussion after-wards. Simply beautiful movie. growing up in the 50's and early 60's I identified with the boys ways of life... no X Boxes...no Wii, just playing outside with friends and imagining. The whole Creation story plus the mother's conversations with God as well as the brothers..speak on so many levels those everyday questions people ask. Why do bad tings happen to good people. Even Brad Pitt, the father, places that before God and asks these questions. Is there an answer...look to the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transcendaly beautiful &amp; ethereal profound; Malick's return to form &amp; Pitt is subliminally graceful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE TREE OF LIFE (2011) ***1/2 Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, Sean Penn, Hunter McCracken, Laramie Eppler, Tye Sheridan, Fiona Shaw. Filmmaker Terence Malick's return to form navel-gazing and decidedly meta focus on an American family during the 1950s is recalled in flashback by Penn, whose love/hate relationship with his contradictive, stern, and complex paterfamilias (deftly played with subliminal grace by Pitt). Fresh-faced newcomer McCracken (as Penn's childhood alter ego) uncannily resembles and expresses the innate sadness of his counterpart. While there are some artistic touches of whispered narration (which I normally HATE but it is lyrically well used here), Malich's tone poem of What Is It All About actually encompasses cosmic depths and prehistoric flashbacks (literally!) but the impressive visuals and gorgeous camera-work by Emmanuel Lubezki and the ethereal soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat transcends no matter the odds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually just made an IMDb account for the sole reason of putting up a bad and/or honest review of this film.The people who give this movie 10/10 are idiots, i'm sorry but this is not a classic, this movie will never see the light of day 10 years from now. Most people like this movie because it is different than most other movies, and it certainly is.The general vibe of this movie is most similar to 2001 a space odyssey; there are lots of visualizations with an "epic" soundtrack, and basically not much going on, so we are meant to assume there is a deeper meaning. Now, with 2001, there certainly is a deeper meaning, and that's why decades later there are still hundreds/thousands of people discussing it today.The deeper meaning to this movie??? Umm not only is there NO deeper meaning, if there was i am not motivated at all to find it, because this movie was SO boring.I have seen a lot of movies, and i always see a movie when someone tells me it is different than most movies. Typically when this happens, I either really like it, and I say to myself WOW this is underground and really powerful, it's no surprise the sheep masses do not like it.And then there's the other kind of movie...like this one...which is plain old mediocre, but people are so fixated on how "different" it is that they think its awesome because they are super cool artsy non-conformists.In summary, even to open minded people like me, who like experiencing something new as much as possible, I would not recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Existence, from alpha to omega</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's fifth film in about forty years aims to be nothing less than the greatest film ever made, the ultimate statement on life, death and humanity's place in the universe. And if one were to criticize it for having themes too big for its own scope, much of the film follows the intimate details of a very specific family in a very specific locale. The film depicts the birth of the universe, the death of the dinosaurs and the first, shameful ejaculation of a pre-teen boy. It so very much yearns to be the alpha and the omega of cinema, maybe of art. So with that huge aim, not to mention the most massive hype of any film released so far this decade, could it possibly work? In my opinion, it doesn't quite. That doesn't mean, however, that the results aren't something startling and vital. They absolutely are. It might bite off more than it can chew, but, man, is The Tree of Life a wonder to behold. The writing is not unlike Malick's most recent film, The New World, in that we often hear the poetic inner whispers of the characters as they wonder about the world and why... well, just why. The directorial style of the film reminds me of Gaspar Noe's recent Enter the Void. It's not quite as flighty as that film, but the camera follows the characters with smooth, steadicam glides, very closely. It feels both like an impartial observer and, somehow at the same time, an intimate companion to the characters, always set exactly to the heights of the children. Like Enter the Void, the film's scenes are just snippets of observed life. They eventually combine to form a very simple, though, by the end, very personal story of a small-town Texas family living their life. Sometimes it's wonderful, sometimes it's painful.The inclusion of the history of the entire universe will undoubtedly become the film's most memorable sequence, not because it's one of the all-time ballsiest sequences the cinema has ever seen (honestly, I'd like to think most directors would have decided it was too corny), but because, for the most part, it actually works. It may be a little over-earnest, and Malick certainly could have dialed back the loud choral music ("LACRIMOSA!", Latin for "tearful" (for God's sake), the women belt over and over and over again as the universe comes into being), but he grounds things nicely with a surprisingly moving sequence involving dinosaurs. That a film about the existence, life and death of a suburban Texan family should involve dinosaurs should have been ludicrous, but those dinosaurs are just as much a part of existence, life and death on this planet as the O'Briens are.The great bulk of the film is about the O'Brien family, partly set in the past (the 1950s), where Brad Pitt (whose outstanding performance will likely be dismissed, as people generally won't think of this as an acting movie) and Jessica Chastain (pretty much just a beautiful face, though she has her moments, too) raise their three boys. We get the present perspective, too, with Sean Penn as one of those three boys grown, gliding through enormous steel and glass structures (the way Malick and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men) film both cityscapes and verdant suburban neighborhoods make you feel like you've never really seen either in your life), reminiscing about his childhood.The problems I have are pretty minor, really. The music I've already mentioned. I generally like classical music, but I don't think Malick uses it particularly well much of the time. He uses very powerful choral music to underline the grandness of the creation of the universe, as well as the beauty of everyday existence. It is needed in neither of those places. It would have served the film much better to use subtler music, or no music at all. Many of the whispered appeals to God come off as corny. A lot of people criticized the narration in The New World, but I thought it worked there. Here, it works some of the time. But almost as often it comes off as over-earnest, especially when Chastain is doing it. She overacts quite a bit when she's reading those lines. While Brad Pitt finds his place beautifully, Sean Penn's presence is a bit distracting. It just feels unnecessary, as that character doesn't require much acting. Probably my biggest problem was the film's climactic act. I won't describe it in detail, but it comes off as too picturesque and maybe a little trite. I'd like to see it again before I dismiss it that harshly, but I don't think it entirely worked for me.As a whole, The Tree of Life is most certainly one of the most interesting and accomplished films to come along in a while. I can imagine it annoying a lot of regular filmgoers, but anyone with a passing interest in the art of cinema should be, at minimum, engaged with it. I can imagine very intelligent people disliking it, but I also imagine that it will become an all-time favorite for many.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overwhelming feeling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On one hand; the very attempt of addressing such profound issues like life and death; existence, God-if there is one-and our almost sad loneliness in this universe-for the time being-seems futile. On the other hand; it is exactly what art tries to do. And; in that sense; Tree of Life accomplishes a brave attempt.It is hard to summarize the film in conventional terms; it is hard to say whether it is about an adult man's looking back and his coming to terms with his brother's dead or about each one of us, sitting in this cinema in the dark, desperately trying to get familiar with that kind of feeling.This is not a film for people who do not like films without dialog, or those who expect to have a conventional narrative, a linear timeline in the films.It starts with a very personal statement; then it stretches out to the very beginning of our existence. It continues with spectacular images of the universe giving the impression that you are looking to some kind of a miracle-you name it God or science-supported with a perfect music which adds to the divine feeling. You look to the very heart of the characters; but also to the very heart of our universe; our lonely planet as they say;trees and nebula; earth without human beings and wind, seagulls and the water. Trust,love, anger, questioning authority-both in the figure of father and God. Ordinary days and problems, then bigger problems, experiencing death, bearing it and at the end, accepting it. Looking back when you hurt people and when people hurt you, forgiving them. Finding the courage to begin again...This film is about finding peace right at the heart of our seemingly absurd existence. It is not a story. It is a feeling. And such a great feeling it is...It almost leaves you breathless right in your seat.The last thing that should be mentioned is that it is a great courage to produce such a film. I haven't seen other films of the director, but this one is clearly not mainstream box office American. So producers-one of them was Brad Pitt-surely respect good cinema. That gives hope.Some people left during the film and I felt very sorry. Not because they did not like the movie but because they could not stand to several give minutes of their lives to our common story.Our individual stories; and stories of everyone of us added up together. This is what I felt about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle and Sublime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say that I'm a big fan of Terrance Malick, the director of Tree of Life. His 1973 film Badlands is my favorite, and I've seen it over fifty times. For me, that film achieves a perfect balance of beauty, humor, action, romance and suspense. It's also, for what it's worth, the most quintessentially American movie I've ever seen.I was moved by the trailer of Tree of Life. Smentana was one of my father's favorite composers, "The Moldau" his favorite piece of music, and the sound and images of the trailer immediately pulled me in. I was expecting a lot from Tree of Life, but I was in no way ready for the absolutely transcendent experience of seeing the film.This is no passive escapist fluff. If you're looking for Transformers or Fast and Furious this is not the film for you. Malick's background is in philosophy, and he's tackling the big questions here: what is God? Why are we here? What does forgiveness mean? It's a hugely ambitious but not an entirely successful film. Some of the "creation" scenes seem to go on a smidgen too long, especially upon a second viewing, and the whispered dialogue verges on redundant. However, it makes nearly all other Hollywood films from the last 20 years look like TV wrestling.Never has a film so successfully recreated the wonder and mystery of life from a child's point of view. I was transfixed by the unfolding beauty of the film: the wind over water, a hand raking through high grass, a cotton dress sliding over flesh. This is not a typical Aristotelian narrative. We are not asked to empathize with one protagonist, and there is not the same expected catharsis. We are, rather, witnessing the world objectively, through God's eyes if you will, indicated when one of the characters whispers, "I want to see what You see."The second time watching the film, I convinced 17 friends to join me, and afterward we spent hours talking about it. One looming question seemed to be whether or not Malick is in this film encouraging some sort of religious conversion. Does the line whispered toward the end, "Follow me," come from God, the director, or an enlightened character who finally, after years of inner torment, finds peace through letting go? Or is the director, by showing us the way of grace, suggesting that this world, in all its splendor, is enough? "There are two ways through life, the way of nature and the way of grace," deliberately obfuscates, because we the spectator ultimately discover that there is a third way, and that serenity comes as a result of acceptance, that we are made of both nature and grace. Tree of Life suggests that we find beauty when we open our senses, and that we discover a sublime world once we're able to heal our binary nature and let go of resentment, forgiving not only others but also ourselves. It's not a film for everyone, but it is a film that will be watched and written about for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The is EASILY the WORST movie I've ever seen. Some might call this art, and it's true this movie is more appropriate for a museum than for a movie theatre. I've never seen so many people walk out during a movie either, and regretfully I wasn't one of them. One of the more entertaining parts of the 2+ hours watching the movie was when I counted the number of seats in the theatre. To try and illustrate how much I disliked this film, I would've gladly seen Beiber's movie instead.From other reviews I gather there are people who really like Tree of Life. That's fine, but if you are an average moviegoer then you will probably strongly dislike it. Right now this movie is rated 8.0 on IMDb. I feel that this will drop drastically as more people see it. I will never see a Terrence Malick film again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious claptrap....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm afraid that I have to differ with the majority of reviewers. I found "Tree of Life " to be simple pretentious claptrap.Yes, I understood it. Yes, I appreciated the visual artifacts. However, many of those images of outer space and what they were trying to portray simply reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's "2001". The points they were trying to portray were pounded, and pounded, and pounded into the viewer with multiple simplistic obvious cues. I felt like I was at a sermon where the preacher preached the obvious and insulted the viewer's intelligence to boot! Universal connectivity, the ascent of mankind and personal grief have been done much better.It seemed like I was the only "sober" witness at an LSD party.

		<shortDescription>An Indescribable Meditation on Existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth?....When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" -Job 38:4,7.So begins a beautifully expansive symphony of life, love, family, death, time and the universe. We are infinitesimally small and yet, simultaneously, so important. Another paradox, the grandeur of "The Tree of Life" is equaled by its sincere humility.This film is majestically beautiful. The ethereal flow of the cinematography with thoughtfully selected classical music evokes memories, emotions, contemplation of where you are, who you are, and meaning in your life. There were moments when I felt my heart almost leap out of my chest. "The Tree of Life" is deeply spiritual without being overtly religious.The answers to the questions "Was it good?", "What was it about?", and even "Who is in it?" are almost as perplexing as the film itself. "The Tree of Life" asks the big questions that each of us should take the time to ask ourselves.I understand some may find the pace of this film difficult, a difficulty induced by a culture of fast food, "smart" phones and the Internet where few take the time to really appreciate the natural world around us. Allow yourself to be immersed in thought and do not let others answer the questions for you. This film is beautiful also in the fact that it allows you to interpret the imagery for yourself unlike so much in the world today that tells you what you "need" and what to think. "Tell us a story from before we can remember."Helen Keller said "the best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart." Please be patient with this film and you will be rewarded with a renewed appreciation for existence.Bravo! Thank you Terrence Malick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unique and very personal experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an unique and very personal experience. Not everyone will get it and that is just fine, we are not all the same and not everyone has the same life experience. I happen to be fortunate enough to be able to relate with the film and being touched by it. I could relate myself in thinking in my own childhood while at the same time thinking about my children. There is an immensely refreshing sense of continuity in the whole film, of how things start, end, to start again. This is a film about life, from a very personal point of view, about how other peoples lives touch ours to become part of us. It is a film about acceptance, even if we often feel that we could have done different and how things would be if we did so. It is a film about how, and who we are, with all our imperfections, of how we try to do our best.I do not care about the so criticized here artsy looks, the film is not about that, and it was not that I appreciated in the film. I also do not agree with comparisons to 2001: 2001 speaks about life from a detached point of view while this is very, very personal. The only film I can relate with this is Citizen Kane, which is also a personal experience, but while Kane speaks about the events of life and how they model us, The Tree of Life speaks about feelings about life it self in a broader range. The Tree of Life is by its own right one of the best films ever made and surely touched me.</fullReview>

This movie surpasses them all....to superb. Perhaps it is because my senses have always been "raw", and the life experiences that I have had that I perceive as I do. Go and see it. Judge for yourself.And, there are few, if any, I would ever consider in the realm of genius, but Terrence Malick deserves that label.This IS a movie, one I enjoyed from beginning to end....and just saw the second time. And, it was even better the second time.Go and enjoy this. Savor it like a fine meal, for it is assuredly a banquet for the senses.</fullReview>

It's the kind of movie you either highly like or highly dislike. I highly liked it, and I think it's worth watching even if you wind up not liking it. The film's title can be deciphered in part as a deep retrospective reflection by one of the main characters on where he stands on the "Tree of Life." It's not told in conventional narrative form, but as one of the reviewers says, "it's really more of an art piece than a movie." It's a very impressionistic-style film.

		<fullReview>Brad Pitt and up and coming actress Jessica Chastain (Take Shelter, The Debt) play a typical 1950's couple in Tree of Life. But don't let this fool you! About 45% of the movie is of something else. That being beautiful cinematography of the earth, in all it's forms. I believe the director is trying to evoke special feelings about the circle of life. This movie reminds me of something from Richard Kelly(Donnie Darko), or a Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan) film. There are also some timeless special effects that contribute to these feelings and take the movie to another level. I get a lot of feelings about being a kid, which is cool too. Within the story there are a lot of "bad" kids that remind me of my child hood. It's kind of cool, it was like watching my past. Hopefully you will be able to relate.To make Tree more complex hidden messages are prevalent- one reason this movie is good. You can get a lot from it if you're the kind of person analyzes things like myself. Viewers who want to be force fed sex and action will hate this movie with a passion!This movie is very slow, but also love making beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rather than go on a spiel about the artistic integrity of all those concerned with the film, I can sum in up in one phrase - Definitely a stoner's movie. I was actually quite stoned when I saw this and thought it was absolutely (bizarrly) amazing. It starts off as quite an intense story of parents going through the death of a child, then skips to he creation of the Earth. This was, to say the least, quite unexpected but hypnotic. To then have scenes of dinosaurs really blew my mind. As far as the artistic element of the film goes, the closest film I can liken it to would be Baraka. I can't believe there are so many bad reviews about this film. Obviously you can't please everybody but if I were to read these, I would probably have chosen not to see the film in the first place and therefore miss out on quite a memorable experience</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Personal by Malick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere I read that this is Malick's personal offering. It sure reflects in the movie. The movie is certainly very personal. I don't think Malick made this one to please his viewers or win any sort of awards. In this movie, we have got a director who just want to tell a story (maybe his own childhood's) in his own way by following his own mannerisms. When the director chooses this way of making a movie, it certainly demands a fair bit of compromise from the viewers' part. If that compromise is done the movie would seem astounding. Throughout the movie the protagonist constantly questions life and its creator or origin. Be that through the fantastic and mind-boggling visuals of creation of earth, volcanos, dinosaurs or through the dialogues by the characters; and along with that the viewers are compelled to do the same. The story is about three brothers and their relationship with each other and their parents. The story is quite simple; but the way it is shown is what the movie is all about. The protagonist, Jack, is the eldest brother and shares a frosty relationship with his Father (Brad Pitt). The story is shown through the eyes of young and also adult (Sean Penn) Jack. It was a certainly an accomplished performance from Pitt. He was fantastic with his emotional scenes with Hunter McCraken who made the young Jack so believable. Jessica Chastain excelled as the timid and caring mother. A little disappointed as Sean Penn had hardly any moments to show what he is capable of. This is a movie one shouldn't miss even though the impact of this movie can be of two extremes. 9/10</fullReview>

But if these negative reviews are on your mind, it may be helpful to you for me to point out that most of the criticism about this movie is based on people's frustration and inability to understand what it is about. While not entirely wrong, I imagine most of these critics just got up after the movie befuddled and simply left it at that. That is somewhat surprising to me, however, since it is fairly simple to find the missing piece of the puzzle to understanding this movie. I'll explain...First, let me assure you that this movie is not your typical Hollywood l'art pour l'art ("art for the sake of art") movie. On what basis do I say this? Well, it may indeed seem that way on first impression, but consider this: the writer and director of this movie is as much a bona fide PHILOSOPHER as he is a filmmaker (might I add, one that does not identify with the Hollywood crowd). In fact, Malik is a summa cum laude philosophy graduate of Harvard and a Rhodes Scholar. He studied analytic and continental philosophy under Stan Cavell at Harvard and he, himself, later went on to teach philosophy at MIT. This, in itself, may give deference to fact that this movie is NOT just "art" but, rather, has significant meaning.Second, for those intellectually open enough to watch this movie, I would strongly encourage you to subsequently watch Fr. Robert Barron's insightful commentary on the movie, which is available on YouTube and only about 10 minutes long.Herein lies the missing piece of the puzzle! Undoubtedly, this movie has biblical undertones but they are not easily recognizable. No matter what your creed, though, listening to a learned individual's explanation in this commentary will definitely put things into perspective and quickly at that. For me, the average movie-goer, this is what made all the difference from believing that this movie was a somewhat forced piece of filmmaking art to realizing that this movie is a truly superb philosophical work that has made me think it over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful to look at, but ultimately empty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was visually masterful, no doubt. And for those who claim it has no plot, they weren't paying close enough attention. However, the overall message of the story was simple to the point of being, dare I say, religious propaganda. After all, this was a movie about man's relationship with God, and it posed some challenging questions, i.e., "If God isn't good, why should I be good?" In the end, however, you feel cheated. Who are we to question God, Malick seems to lecture. The movie makes an appeal to faith, telling us that bad things may happen in this life, but that everything will be sorted out in the next. Until then, we just need to love one another. That's it. If you are a fairly straight-forward Bible-believing Christian, you will probably like this movie.That said, there is a lot to like about this movie, even if the overall message is lacking. The relationship between the father and his two oldest sons is particularly insightful. That is, Malick's portrayal of "worldliness", even in its most subtle forms, that we pass down from father to son--and it's destructive consequences--was eye opening. And if Malick was in fact trying to say anything about God, other than he is an unknowable mystery, it may be that he is quite playful, and that mother nature is in a constant state of play. I kept thinking of Matthew 6:28 "Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin." On the other hand, Brad Pitt's character, the father, with all his self-interested greed, was very serious. That aspect of the movie was very thought-provoking indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminded me of Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw this film last at the cinema with my wife whom I lived with and loved unconditionally for the last 25 years. As a Terence Malick fan for many years, and after hearing so much about the film, I attended, expecting an almost 'perfect' film. I was disappointed. The cinematography was awesome but the rest ( including the screenplay as well the obvious attempt to define the meaning of life ) was below average. My wife liked it slightly better.Throughout the whole film, we were reminded of the 'Apu Trilogy' written &amp; directed by the great Satyajit Ray approx over 50 years ago. It confirmed to me what great films they were and how Ray drew us closer to nature brilliantly. The whole basis of 'advaita' principles were there in those films and I found what Mr Malick was trying to convey to the audience were already covered masterfully by Ray and his films on Apu.Just see the 'Apu trilogy' and you'll see what I' saying. Trust me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gripping drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course Brad Pitt is excellent as the strict father but Jack, played by Hunter McCracken also stands out and you feel with his anguished soul. It is a beautiful and haunting movie which takes you across Universe, back to the early times of the Earth with absolutely magnificent sceneries. Jessica Chaston, as the mother is just perfect for this role with her inner beauty and grace. This is an unusual film and a must if you are interested in "real" life dramas, this could have been any of us in the 1950s and although the ending was a bit "unusual" I think it reflected Jack's anguish as a grown up man and unsure of his faith, if he had one. Go and see it and be glad you are alive. It is a wonder when you see all the beauty of earth and Universe and if you have time, sit down under a tree one day and look up, the leaves could be mistaken for the stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have mixed feelings about 'The Tree of Life.' Let me first tell you the things I liked about it: (1) the stunning cinematography, (2) the poetic images; and (3) the acting--especially Brad Pitt who was a revelation. (I didn't know he could act!) Another thing I liked about it was the story. I grew up with a father like Brad Pitt so I could relate to the Jack character. I didn't think the Brad Pitt character was a horrible father because that's the way most fathers were like back in the '50s. But, at the same time, I could understand why Jack resented his father for a very long time. Now me me tell you the things I didn't like about it. I realize this was an episodic film filled with poetic images like most of Malick's films. I have seen all of his films, and I have to say--I felt 'The Tree of Life' was his weakest. I found it unfocused and underdeveloped. When you really think about it, what as this film really about? Think about it. Strip away all the stunning cinematography and poetic images and what exactly are you left with? Essentially it's a story about the emotional scars a strict father left on his eldest son and as a result, how the son comes to grips with his life through his shaky faith. If you really think about it, 'The Tree of Life' could be a story about the tortured childhood of Job's son. To me, it just didn't seem like that big of a deal to make a movie about that. Another thing I didn't like about it was that I felt the characters were underdeveloped--especially the mother. She just didn't seem to make any kind of impact in the film and she should have. Back then when mothers stayed at home to raise the kids, she was the one who was around Jack more than the father. Yet I didn't see much of a relationship between the two of them. I got the feeling that Jack didn't respect his mother because he thought the father walked all over her. So that was it? That wasn't much of a relationship if you ask me. The whole story just seemed so typical and not very unique or original. That was the biggest problem I had with 'The Tree of Life.' I personally think it's very overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extremely deep movie, not what I was expecting but well done..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into to this movie thinking it would be something totally different. I knew it would be a sort of sad, artistic and intellectual film, but it turned out to be so much different. I thought it was well done, but it left me unsatisfied and discontent with a thousand questions and thoughts on metaphors. I noticed a lot of things in this movie, it was almost too many metaphors, visuals and themes. I've never seen a movie so deep and intense and visually stunning. I did tear up at several parts because they were just so moving, especially when everyone is together on the beach at the end and the powerful opera is playing. Wow. It was very difficult for me to watch the eldest son struggle like that and be so confused because of how he was raised so religiously. I still don't fully know who died, at the beginning when they get the call I assume it was sean penn who had passed and then we enter a world of his remorse and finding his brother? Who died in the pool? I thought it was one of the brothers, but then you see all three of them. I also noticed a lot of windows and bare walls in all the houses throughout the movie, i think there is a big thing with lights, doors and windows in this film. Water and fire and all the elements. The family dynamic and parenting style as well as influence are major themes. Oh, and one more thing, when jack steals the rich woman's nightgown, i thought he was going to give it to his mother, why toss it into the river? The best line is where she talks about the way of nature and the way of grace, clearly brad pitt loses his way and is a hypocrite, but the wife is such an accepting doormat which is no better. After seeing the dinosaurs and trippy visuals and voice overs erratically placed, i became confused. But what i think this film is really about is life and death and the cycle of it all. the beauty of the world and the passage of time. I've never seen movie like this before and you need a cup of coffee to stay awake if you go to a late show time, but i think its worth one viewing because it impacts you even if you don't know how or why. In my opinion they should have ended the movie on the final image of the sunflower field.All you hear is the breeze and all you see is a field of sunflowers swaying, bright and happy in one final group which could be one big metaphor for everybody being a sunflower, reborn and recreated in a different form and shape. The cycle of life. I still have so many questions and maybe that's okay with some people, but this film was so ridiculously deep that it almost made me feel stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrence's Best Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tree of Life Okay, right of the Bat here; the tree of life is not the average film. It was meant for a limited group of audience and only that group will appreciate and understand it. Others, who cannot comprehend the film, intend to abuse the whole process. With that in mind: The Movie starts off with a simple question for the audience: Are you a man of faith , or a man of science? But not practically with those words. It points it out that there 2 ways in this world: the way of grace and the way of natural. While watching the film, you will automatically answer this in your mind. Even if you don't wish too.Before watching the film, some might think that Brad Pitt and the Cast are the main part of the film. But to my opinion, the whole world is. it asks us the most well known , frequent questions. What is the purpose of an event? Such as passing away of the elder son of a family. If there is a God, why does he allow such a thing? After this is where the film takes off, and Terrence Malick tries to answer these questions In the way he knows best. Bear in mind that if you did not enjoy ( or understand) Terrence Malick's previous films, then you will not appreciate this film and might as well not bother with watching.Me personally have watched the film 5 times already, and there is still some gaps for me. But I am a kind of person who enjoys movies that let you decide exactly what it meant. That's the beauty of it. Because it has unlimited meanings. For that it could have a different meaning for every individual. So, once again, if you don't enjoy such films, don't bother. Because you will end up like hundreds of others who did not understand and their best response was to abuse the film.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The connection of the visible with the invisible world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts off with 2 verses from the Bible. It is God responding to Job, a righteous, rich man who went through great suffering and God is asking him why he is questioning God's authority, since He is the Creator of this world:Job 38:4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?... 7 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?Side note: The "morning stars" are a reference to God's angels. After man fell, the angels guarded the tree of life so sinful man would not become immortal.The mother speaks and says there are two paths to choose in life, nature or grace. She holds the view of grace, but the father, Brad Pitt's character, takes the path of nature.If you read more verses of God speaking to Job, you might see some of the symbolism in the movie and hear the words of the first great Poet, i.e. God: "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? ... Or who shut in the sea with doors, When it burst forth; ... When I made the clouds its garment, And thick darkness its swaddling band; When I fixed My limit for it, And set bars and doors; When I said, This far you may come, but no farther, And here your proud waves must stop!" Job 38:4-11. Then in verse 17 it reads: "Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?" This gives you an explanation of the doors in the movie. To explain the movie scenes of the sea, sky, the universe and all of the wonders in nature, the chapter goes on to speak more of the wonders of God and the marvelous creation in the earth and the universe, referencing Pleiades and the bands of Orion?In one scene Brad Pitt says to one of his on screen sons something to the effect of, "If I tell you to do something, will you do it without questioning my authority?" This is symbolic of God telling man to do something and since He is the Creator (our Father), we should not question His authority. We should not wonder why bad things happen to good people, because God has control of the world and He is constantly watching over things. We ask this question, but we should be asking, "why is God putting up with this world after it sinned?" Throughout the movie the question of "why?" is put forth by the characters when there is calamity and death.In another scene the mother tells the son if he doesn't love, life will pass by him. This describes another aspect of God and that is God is love. If we don't love, then we've missed the point of why we were created.At the birth of Jack it shows the mother in labor, but it has also shown a child swimming through a door of what looks like a room in the middle of a swimming pool. I think this is symbolic of man entering the door to life. Later on, you see Sean Penn aka grown Jack, pondering at another door that leads to vast fields of clay. These two symbolic things are spoken of in Job, too. I believe this is symbolic of the door to death.Job's example is given to us to show us that calamity does come to the righteous man so just because we are suffering, it doesn't mean God has forgotten us or that we are being punished for some grievous sin.Toward the end, the mother folds her hands toward heaven and says, "I give you my son," and I believe this is symbolic of how God gave His only begotten Son so we could be saved, so how foolish to question if God has forgotten us and if that's the reason bad things are happening. Bad things happen to good and bad people due to sin in the world. There is a lesson to be learned there.Some have questioned whether Terrence Malick is showing he is pantheistic, meaning he worships nature as God, but I believe he is showing the wonders of God and that he worships God as the marvelous Creator. You hear Jack saying something about when he knew of Him (God) but didn't know what to call him. I think this is another reference to the theme of the movie, i.e., God's and man's relationship and man's relationship to one another. In the scene with the two dinosaurs and also in the scene of young Jack's interaction with the burned boy, it shows glimpses of goodness coming forth where bad thoughts were at first ignited.I think the movie is showing us a view from Terrence Malick about our growth and movement back to the Creator. Toward the end of the movie Brad Pitt's character is saying how he was wrong all along about nature over grace. In other words, his wife had the right idea all along. This is another suggestion of moving back toward the Divine or grace, rather than nature or being harder and it being dangerous to be good. If you have no clue about the Bible, it might be difficult to understand this movie, but I hope I have perhaps cleared up a few questions. I think this movie is deep and you probably should do a little homework before seeing it, so you know what you are seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prophetic, symbolic and magnificent. An avant-garde masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tree of Life starts something like a fragmented family drama. It soon moves onto an incredible sequence which is almost like an abstract portrayal of the history of the universe, narrowing down to a history of the Earth. Malick takes all the many patterns of life and existence? from microbiotic organisms to interstellar structures ? and creates the most majestic collage. (I couldn't help being reminded of that sequence at the end of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.) The film evolves to focus on the story of Jack, son of a God-fearing American couple. It follows his journey from birth through childhood as he grows to makes sense of the world and struggles with his complicated adolescent emotions. The main plot follows Jack and his family, but the film remains universally relatable as it encompasses truly vast themes: life, death, love, hate, childhood, adulthood, parenthood, god, religion, nature, man, gender, sexuality, guilt, fear, shame, happiness, forgiveness, sacrifice?the list goes on.Nearer the end it becomes highly symbolic, most notably repeating representations of doorways, passageways, bridges, circles, planets, suns, stars, waves, water, trees, hands, the sky and other loaded imagery which will inspire a complex of interpretations.Ultimately, The Tree of Life is wholly philosophical and its messages are prophetic, discursive and intuitive. The juxtaposition of the greatest and smallest pieces of the universe gives the human drama a context that is humbling to say the least. Malick incredibly manages to underline the relative insignificance of man, whilst presenting an emotive human story. Malick has created an avant-garde masterpiece with mainstream appeal.http://ionlyaskedwhatyouthought.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie featuring Sean Penn and Brad Pitt, that should be interesting I said to myself. I read the storyline and again I thought, interesting, I wonder how this will play out. Then I started reading the user reviews and I was puzzled such comments would be for a movie rated 7.2 (at the time I wrote my review); I checked my usual sources for other ratings and the results were also surprisingly good for the reviews I had read. I even perused a few professional critics and that's when I started having my doubts. I have been burned by critic's praise many times in the past so I'd have to watch it for myself and make up my mind. The IMDb user reviews were quite emphatic about the movie being a waste of time; how could this be? Ouf! What an exhausting and boring experience. It had visually compelling imagery to be sure, but I like to watch movies with a story that speaks to me at some level. This movie failed to connect with me; I tried hard to find the ideas the critics raved about, but no, nothing clicking. Better to sit and look at paint dry while listening to Bach or Tchaikovsky; at least you can close your eyes and still enjoy a masterpiece. But this movie, as Vinnie would say "You gotta be kidding; what the f**k was that all about". I hope someone asks to borrow my movie; perhaps they'll do me service and keep the 'fricking' thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrence Mallick compares his childhood to the Book of Job and creation itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit that, as I watched this, I wasn't sure if I found it impressive or ridiculous. At first, I thought the scenes depicting the history of the universe through the Big Bang to the end of the era of the dinosaurs- yes- were thoroughly unnecessary and silly. But by the end, I came to realize that this sequence, and one towards the end depicting the death of the sun, are the heart and soul of the film. It begins with a quote from the Book of Job, and essentially this film is Terrence Mallick's attempt to recreate the tale of Job through what I take to be quasi-autobiographical childhood memories. Either one embraces the universe, God, which creates by destruction and vice-versa (Big Bang) or negates it. Complicating matters is that the mortal Father seems to suggest the path of negation. This God of the Flesh is impressively embodies by Brad Pitt, who finally convinces me he can truly act. The arc of the story is ultimately how humanity, embodies as one family, comes to affirm negation (loss) ("I give You my Son...") through the consciousness of one of its sons (the Mallick stand-in- no shortage of artistic self-regard here). The childhood scenes, which encompass most of the film, were what impressed me the most. This is true "stream-of-consciousness" filmmaking. The early scenes especially, which seek to depict the fractional fluidity of early childhood memories in the mind of the adult, struck me as being as accurate a description as anything found in the prose of Joyce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tree of Life (2011) - What a Family Tree!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's visionary masterpiece, "The Tree of Life" is not the type of movie you expect to munch on your popcorn to. It's a challenging journey like no other. "The Tree of Life" is a non-linear narrative about a middle-aged man's childhood memories of his family in 1950s Texas. Now, there some of many things I liked about this movie. Brad Pitt delivers one of the most powerful performances of his career, and I hope that he deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Jessica Chastain delivers a perfect performance in this movie as well. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is one of the most unique uses of cinematography I have ever seen in cinema. The music is so inspiring and beautiful. Terrence Malick's vision is like none I have ever seen, and it's really unique. Then, we have extended sequences of the evolution of existence involving volcanic eruptions, sea-life, dinosaurs, and human kind. Yes, it's presented in a depressing way, but that scene was made so beautifully. But there were so many problems with the movie as well. This movie was really slow, and Sean Penn's performance was disappointing because he does not get enough screen time, and he does not bring his voice into it. But he honestly didn't do anything at all. He never bothered to talk or react, and all he ever did was walk and look around like an idiot. Sometimes Terrence Malick brings a slow narrative to his movies, and it's a little silly. The ending wasn't really special, and there was nothing excellent about the ending. But besides that, all of these positive and negative thoughts make "The Tree of Life" one of the most talked about movies of the year. It's a powerful challenging journey that represents the true uniqueness of filmmaking that brought Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" to life. "The Tree of Life", in my review, "a challenging journey, but nothing remarkable".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie for about ten minutes, I decided its not going to be a narrative story and sort of agreed to suspend my judgement for a while. What emerges is an impressionistic movie. Its a creative, artistic voyage through a memory of childhood in Waco, Texas in the 1950s....but its also bigger than this, the movie is also an exploration of Creation and the meaning of Life. The acting is great. There is a scene in a church, with a sermon about Job in the background, while the Father (Brad Pitt) walks over to the candles to light one. This scene really stands out for me, because it shows the feeling of being Alone in the Universe on one hand, but we all share the same Life. Another series of scenes shows images of being a child, this was amazing to me...the ability to capture Childhood images. I didn't grow up in this era, but I have similar types of images in my memory, and similar emotional experiences as were shown.I think some people may hate this movie because its not a traditional form of story, some scene-montages of the Universe seem to go on a bit long, and its somewhat confusing. Its not a commercial movie. Some call it pretentious, but I don't know why. Its not pretending to be anything in my opinion, its a brave vision and i'm glad the director stuck with it.There are some elements of the movie that I am confused about: Did the Father kill someone? Is he a thief or crook? His character is mysterious and secretive. Is he the tall man in the attic? I suspect the dinosaur scene in the first part of the movie hints at the evolution of man, or even how son surpasses father...but I'm absolutely not sure about this!Also, I couldn't figure out which brother Sean Penn's character was, in the future, until more than half way through the movie. I would have liked to learn more about the modern Sean Penn character in relation to the earlier child version...I don't know how this could have been done in a movie though, that would require more narrative and dialogue than this movie was willing to commit to.I would say check this one out if you are open-minded and willing to see film as an art-form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Tree of life fails to get deep into the soul, oh! might have come close to making imprinting an impression after all, had it been neatly presented! I strongly believe this whole thing would have been a better book, as a movie it neither gets artistic nor appealing to the senses!The narrative style in itself is bizarre, and scenes of evolution and the flame does make it real dark. The narrator supposedly asks "The One" several questions when certain incidents happen in life, and to be honest posing questions and making insights leave me perplexed, was it all being sarcastic or is it the genuineness of creation and evolution that we are genned up to keep mum?To put it together,this was a real let down for me. True, many of them had their lousy childhood revisited. Not for me, albeit, I really did enjoy it in parts and wish had it been crispier in outlay! I would love to get the screenplay, it should be a heavenly readable and as for watching it, this is a sophisticated intellectual art which would be appreciated by super league critics, not for commoner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a very symbolic film, full of enchanted scenes. It has very few conversations. Emotions are very well treated and they are the key of the whole story. Religion and bible quotes, in some way conducts the idea of the film from the very beginning up to the end. Memories that leads to an expected or not end, helps you to understand the conflict. Symbols, as I have said before are terrible important, the house, birth, death, relationships among the members of the family, music, instruments for playing music, clothes, tree, grass, sun, sky, sea, beach, river, buildings. I really enjoy the movie, perhaps for all the sensations it moves inside me. I also recommend to see it twice in order to seize the real meaning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally like anything centering around pure cinematography - nature documentaries, Baraka, Koyaanisqatai etc... but this is really quite awful.First of all, it's not always clear what the visual being displayed is. You ask yourself - "are those dividing cells or bubbles from an underwater volcano?" Secondly, if you put dinosaurs in a film you cannot expect to have it taken seriously. This may change in the future if reconstructive nature programs become commonplace, but until then people think of JP, of 60s adventure movies with plastic closeups, and maybe even of Godzilla and Cloverfield .Lastly, to try and frame an actual human drama - told mostly by means of whispers (the same whispers that added so much to The Thin Red Line but which here are infuriating) within this vortex of visuals, is a terrible misjudgement on the part of the filmmakers.In smaller doses (a few minutes at a time) some of these visuals in this movie would be truly breathtaking and informative.Packaged as it is however, I expect to learn that this film broke records of people falling asleep in the cinemas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tree of Child Abuse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand the critics praise of this film. Roger Ebert gave it four stars and compared it to 2001, A Space Odyssey. That's not really a compliment but he meant it to be--he says Malick is taking on the whole question of what life is and what it means. He fails in my opinion.Throwing out all the creation images and molecular historical stuff, the film is about an abusive bully of a father. He bullies his sons and never lets them be happy or enjoy life. It's all about being tough. But they can't really be tough because he'll crush them if they stand up to him. They must obey. Mr. O'Brian, (Pitt's character) is obviously suffering under the effects of his own tyrannical father and I would love to have seen flashbacks of that dynamic. It might have explained the absolute joylessness and cruelty of Mr. O'Brian's adult existence. From his horrible beginnings he's left with a mission to mold successful tough sons but his methods lead to the exact opposite (which suggests that those weren't his goals at all). He was a narcissist and narcissists don't want any kid of theirs besting them at any endeavor. THEY have to be the best. I felt pain more and more as I witnessed the boys trying to find a way to co-exist . . . a place where they were loved and appreciated even a little. The mother was nearly useless in this respect. Her inaction was like approval of villain O'Brian's abuse. She could have tried to take her sons out of danger but she didn't--must have been too weak. She must have been pummeled as a little girl herself.So why keep watching this sickness on the screen? My reason was that I respect Ebert and wanted to see if the movie somehow turned out to be good in any respect. It didn't.A last thought. Many "Tree" haters described O'Brian as a "stern" father. His treatment of his kids was way beyond that. It was constant psychological abuse. Our society has no protection from this kind of cruelty to children. If there are no bruises or bones broken, parents are free to destroy their offspring at will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Museum quality is "The Tree of Life"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick has written and directed a true masterpiece of museum quality with his film, "The Tree of Life". The cinematography far outshines the importance of the dialog, and one is in awe of its beauty in a similar fashion to the much older film of the late 60's, "2001: A Space Odessey". The music is equally as mesmerizing and set perfectly to the photography in such a way that it captures the splendor of the times and places represented. Brad Pitt is cast well as the father, and Jessica Chastain is a perfect choice as the very understanding and loving wife. The child actors are as believable and natural in their roles. It is another "must see" film that is now available on Blu Ray DVD's, and it deserves the spectacular sound and picture that this medium provides. Put it on your list soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am contrary in that I will not go see a film just because it is critically acclaimed. But, I have enjoyed movies that Brad Pitt or Sean Penn have been in, in the past, so it was only a matter of time before I succumbed to the curiosity of seeing them work together.Did I like this movie? What an insipid word to use - "like" - in connection with this film. Instead, I will say I "felt" this movie. I got it. Like life, it was disquieting, disturbing, thought provoking, painful at times, joyous at others. Beautiful, confusing, glorious, tragic, scary, mesmerizing and drawing me in. I felt apprehension, fear, wonder, awe and I was spellbound.Trying to describe it to a friend: My red shoes at 5; the red buttons on my shirt on my first date at 15; the blood when I cut my finger at 11; my fingertip is not gone, the metal lid just came down and squeezed it painfully (26); the wooden piano lid makes a funny sound when dropped (3); dropping pebbles down the pipe well at 8; skating over the pipes in the dam jars my teeth (11); my knees and hands are all skinned up from trying to go into a spin while backward skating (24); accidentally winding up skiing downhill backwards and falling into the trees off the side on a run much too difficult for my skill level (19); snowflakes falling and melting on my face and tongue (9); sunlight sparkling through the rain drops on my eyelashes (14); ripples in the water as I try to catch tadpoles in the creek, in the woods, during a light, summer rain (11); watching my secret love, stand in the woods and look up at my bedroom window (16); staring out the kitchen window while washing dishes, wishing there were woods to look at (26); and so on.Seeing this movie was like lying in a hammock on a lazy summer day, eyes closed, watching the play of memories, that weren't even mine, flicker across my sunlit eyelids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree I could barely understand what the "whispering" was trying to convey? I found it to be at least pretentious and somewhat obnoxious. I will say that is not the worst movie, I've ever seen, not even the worse Brad Pitt movie for that matter (Babel holds that title.) Yes, I'm intelligent enough to get the point, yes I am a HUGE fan of Indie films, yes I am an above average movie goer, etc.etc.For one, I think Brad Pitt was miscasted here, I don't know why, but he was almost "too big" to play such a part. He never sold the loving-overbearing father figure, it's odd but I was really disconnected from his performance. I kept thinking how awesome Colin Firth (albeit to old for the part and has a horrible southern accent) would have been.Positive - I think the scenes of Nature and of Earth/Universe were exceptional. I think those were not CGI but actual footage of the cosmos, if so they were awe-inspiring. I kept hearing "How Great Thou Art" playing on repeat when watching those scenes.In some respect certain scenes in this film,those which should be a National Geographic documentary/NASA documentary, pretty much in their own right rebut any aspect of the asinine ideology of evolution or it's down syndrome cousin "big bang theory."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Malick continues with his perfect career. Many put him to one side and claim that he is simply a master of visuals. While this is most certainly true, no one should ignore his exceptional talent at creating such a deep and emotional film. It seems dull to some because of the lack of dialog. But how much do we really talk in our lives? Probably not as much as the movies would have us believe, and if you do, perhaps you should shut up and enjoy the world around you. Malick captures those beautiful moments that are such a part of life, we probably dismiss them. Sunsets, a red sky, the way the sun shines through the leaves. Malick really does utilise the sun, preferring natural light. Every shot is crisp and clean, presenting a world so real and full of life. The film is quite a simple story, though not told in a conventional narrative. A man named Jack looks back on his life as a child and how the conflicting personalities of his parents shaped his own life. In many ways this is a metaphor for God, and how he is both cruel and loving. On their own, Pitt's actions seem mean and sadistic, but when left alone with the mother, Jack engages in some really cruel activities such as smashing windows and blowing up frogs. These moments are cut with scenes of the universe coming into existence, with evolution and dinosaurs. These scenes emphasise how the world itself was formed, and really elevates the actions of the parents. Overall Malick has presented us with a most magnificent look at the world through a child. If Pitt and Chastain's characters seem simplified at times, it is because of how the son sees things. It isn't until the end he realises the complex decisions one must face in shaping another life. An absolute classic, but in saying that, you must appreciate Malick's work to like this. He isn't trying to convert anyone.</fullReview>

I was fighting with sleep after just few minutes. If there was any message to this movie, putting it in a bottle would have had a better chance at reaching the audience. A total waste of time.

		<fullReview>I've always enjoyed Terrence Malick's films mainly because of how bizarre they are, but this movie, is his masterpiece. Very reminiscent of a Bergman or Fellini film, centering on life and the meaning of existence. Critics will lose count looking for errors and holes in the story. Malick isn't one for following rules, but the scenes were captured with such elegant and grace, I can't really hold it against him. It's been so long since a movie has made me 'feel'. It reminded me of growing up, and the things I was taught, and how I became a man. It moved me deeply, and if you are looking to a view a film that will make you think weeks after watching it, this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lyrical ode to life, nature and family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tree of Life elicits many emotions from its audience - wonder, shock, horror, joy - but, at least for me, the overwhelming feeling was one of confusion. For an entire minute after the credits started to roll, my theater was completely silent. No one moved or spoke, I could tell that everyone was attempting to digest what they'd just witnessed; even now, I'm not sure whether this is good or bad. Such ambiguity surprised me. Given the rumors of fervent booing and mass walk-outs that provided the majority of the movie's publicity as well as the hasty decision by many a film aficionado to label it a "masterpiece", it was clear that Terrence Malick's latest visual poem was a love-or-hate-it affair. From the film's first shot ? a still of a flame surrounded by darkness ? Malick's influence is unmistakable. Alternating between a grand, mostly wordless montage of the creation of the universe and an intimate portrait of family life in suburban 1950's Texas, The Tree of Life displays a liberal use of imagery and parallelism to tell its story, which is less a fully formed narrative than a tapestry of ideas and metaphors. A significant portion of the dialogue is done in voice-over narration as the characters reflect on their lives, and in the end, it seems almost irrelevant, little more than a series of melodious asides, as the images alone are enough to convey the movie's central message. Here, pictures are really worth a thousand words. Captured and arranged with exquisite, painstaking deliberation, each scene is practically its own individual story, a rich medley of symbolism and meaning, seething with understated emotion, begging for a scholarly analysis. While it is theoretically possible to enjoy the movie on a more superficial level, to simply let the beauty wash over you, I'll confess that there is a strange delight in peeling back the myriad layers and searching for the various labyrinthine implications hidden behind them. Like all the best directors, Malick understands the power of images ? he knows that one perfectly positioned shot can affect the viewer more deeply than the most elaborate monologue ? and never has that been more evident than in The Tree of Life.That said, the movie is most engaging at its quietest. The shots of outer space are undeniably breathtaking ? if The Tree of Life does not score Oscar nominations, if not wins, for its visual effects and cinematography, it will be shocking, to say the least ? yet not until the half-hour mark, when the central narrative takes hold, did I become truly absorbed. This section plays out as a seemingly arbitrary compilation of memories (birth, learning to walk, playing with friends, first love, etc.), and, despite the meandering pace, it eventually develops a rhythm of its own that suggests a running train of thought; it's stream-of-consciousness expressed through images rather than sentences. Naturally, much of the story's power comes from the visuals as Malick transforms even the most mundane scenes, such as a woman strolling casually through a sprinkler or a group of boys frolicking on a suburban street on a calm summer night, into works of fine art. In addition to the purposeful camera-work, the spot-on period detail, gorgeous yet never garish or distracting, further immerses the audience in Malick's depiction of the 1950s suburbs, where the sun apparently always shines and nature coexists peacefully with man. The occasional bursts of brutality and ugliness amidst the unrelenting beauty and surrealism make the movie all the more potent.And that is really the biggest surprise of The Tree of Life. I, presumably like many people, went in hoping for little more than extravagant visuals and, perhaps, an eye-opening message about the meaning of life itself, but what I got was something different; indeed, it's spectacularly photographed, but what raises it above the pretentious superficiality that dogs many art films is its emphasis on contrasts: man v. nature, peace v. violence, life v. death, love v. hate. If anything, the film is about the gray areas in life, the way in which opposites can intertwine and blend with each other, not the big, all-encompassing Truth hinted at by the advertising campaign. Nowhere is this ambiguity more evident than in Malick's portrayal of family life, which is among the most honest and realistic I have seen in recent cinema. Neither dysfunctional nor enviable, the O'Brien clan consists of several relationships, from father-mother to brother-brother, each given equal thought and complexity, and for anyone who either belongs to such a family or knows one (which, I assume, is almost everyone), their love-hate dynamic is painfully familiar. This is a family in which most thoughts go unspoken and sincerity is a rare occurrence. In addition to the director and screenwriter, the actors deserve credit for their preference for subtlety over scenery-chewing and their remarkable ability to convey emotions as assorted as rage, resentment, jealousy, fear and affection through the blink of an eye or turn of the head.Of course, The Tree of Life isn't for everyone. I consider myself a patient viewer, but the first half-hour is almost unbearably slow, and at a certain point, endless shots of volcanoes and cosmological happenings, no matter how dazzling, become more self-indulgent than profound. Although some may insist that each second was somehow significant to Malick's overall intent, the movie still clocks in at a whopping two hours and twenty minutes, and I'm sure that a few montages of swirling planets could have been sacrificed in favor of a reasonable running time. In the end, The Tree of Life is like a classic novel: you admire its craft and you're glad you read it, but you don't feel the uncontrollable urge to experience it again. So, while I wouldn't recommend this movie lightly, if you're in the mood to contemplate themes about love, existence and time and analyze surreal visuals, these two-and-a-half hours are well worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Winner of the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival, Terence Malick's The Tree of Life was arguably the most anticipated film of this year's festival. Indeed, anything from the famously reclusive director is always cause for celebration, given that in a career spanning 40 years, The Tree of Life is only his fifth film, and his previous works (Badlands, Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line, The New World) are all regarded as fascinatingly original films. So, how does this new film fit into Malick's catalogue? It's difficult to write about The Tree of Life after only one viewing. Malick is often cited as the cinema's greatest example of a 'visual poet', and while anyone can appreciate the pretentiousness of such a claim, the label actually does seem to fit, and nowhere is it more appropriate than in a discussion of The Tree of Life. Analysing a poem can be a challenging task, with the finest examples perhaps meaning little when taken at face value, and only through line by line deconstruction can a poet's true meaning be made evident. And challenging is a great word for describing this film. If you've ever seen a Malick film, little has changed in his style. Minimalist dialogue, largely in the form of fractured narration, runs parallel with highly disjointed editing (interestingly, the credits list no less than five editors), and achingly beautiful shots of nature are juxtaposed with characters looking thoughtfully off camera, into the distance. The style is jarring, yet it allows Malick the freedom to be at his most conceptual and introspective, and the result is an incredibly ambitious and uncompromising manifestation of his vision.Many audience members may be put off by what seems to be a needlessly meandering story, the point of which is wrapped in so many layers that some may argue there is in fact no point. However, Malick's slow and deliberate pacing does in fact peel back these layers a little at a time, so that when the emotional climax does arrive, it is genuinely moving in a way that so few films are nowadays. The story itself takes second billing in favour of presenting a tone and a nostalgic mood that completely absorbs the viewer who is willing to let Malick take his time with his message. The Tree of Life is unlikely to make any new fans for Malick, but for those who appreciate his thoughtful style, the film is an all too rare treat, and may in fact be the finest display of his unique talent. Just like a great poem, the film demands repeated viewing to break it down and pore over the details, something which many will be looking forward to. There's no way to gauge who the audience for a film like this is, but regardless of whether you would agree that this is the best 2011 has offered so far, it is guaranteed you will have never seen a film quite like The Tree of Life before.tinribs27.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why dinosaur? Peace of mind in the Forest in your Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched twice. My first time writing and glad to see all those divergent views which give me even deeper reflection of the film. Isn't a good treat to see how different people are making sense out of life, searching for its meaning, just as the actors and Director? Be it a religious, scientific or artistic approach or just an Empty Mind. Yes, there is seemingly no major plot and may appear to be fragmented memories, but, isn't life just the same? Isn't it a good chance to reflect on one's coping style in face of the ambiguity of life? How many times you may have encountered something that happened on you/your surrounding which are out of your prediction/plan? Many needed ventilation, but for big man like Jack, they often prefer not to talk but to reorganize themselves in their own way, here, Jack returned to the forest in his mind where he found peace of mind, where he needed not explain anything, as the wise trees knew everything! A process of self-awareness and rebirth once he re-touched the grass with a smile at the end. Watching the film is like going through time tunnel, how you grow up, struggle, quest and redefine life at different stages of life. I was so delighted with the little stars. The differential way of parental love is enlightening for all parents. Their acting talent are wonderful in every sight. As audience, we are often tempted to await for an answer or a new perspective, but isn't the answer lies within ourselves, through the inner dialogue and opening up of sense? What's important is usually unspoken other than direct conversation (whisper, images, touch, etc) as in real life. Isn't all beautiful visual images and sound good exercise to our artistic brain? In this speedy world, are we too focus on our logical brain? Is life often the same where thing moves on whether you understand/accept/aware or not? Are we focused too much on seemingly big things but neglect those subtle (not trivial) or seemingly ordinary aspect? Let's your mind travel.In one's life, how far we can go is limited, but it's great that the mind can travel across time and space, only if we allow a chance. The beauty of life exists everywhere, as grand as the universe or as small as a butterfly dance. I was amazed with the dinosaur too, but I was surprised to recall that it did come to my mind before and warned me of the danger when I once questioned about over modernization! Some talked about Discovery Channel, views over its length and repetition varied (I did exclaim and try to figure out the meaning). However, isn't our modern societies evolve into a state where extreme specialization set up bar for full integration of mind, body, soul with interaction to the universe? Is it even more fragmented then? Isn't life just the same with those repetition or circular thinking at times? Two hours mean differently for all, maybe, one is rushing for life, maybe one happens not at the stage of question, maybe one happens to have already gone through it or maybe, you just use to sit back, think...for me, it inspires me to write a song when I develop the illusion that the pillars of the city turned into trees on the way home, starting with, 'The Tree of Life carries more than itself, passing through time and space, lines of sky-pointing trees, great pillars, in the stream of life...the love from the Mother Nature shines on your toes...(more to develop)' Maybe, one's view over those two hours is already a reflection of how one perceives life at that particular state of mind and maybe, some time later, one will view those tow hours differently, who knows?Last, 'tell me more before we can remember'. When we grow older, we will say, 'tell me more before we forget.' Then, when we grow old enough, we may say, 'it doesn't mater, remember or forget...' What's more, the film draws me back to my song, 'Forest in your Mind', the sharing is just a simple wish to recall the connection with nature like Jack, and hopefully, our next generation will benefit from it.Wonder for a big tree? Wander on your mind... They are there waiting for you, they are there where soul be healed. Going back, back, back to the forest in your mind, lying down, down, down to the soil for your tired soul. A little bit dark, dark, under the old big tree, fear not, they are there, they know you. A few more swinging air roots, fear not, they are there, they hug you. Lean on the familiar trunk, with its worldly old story. Yes, there are holes on the trunk, by its history, yet, they are there with the holes. Yes, there are broken branches, by the weather, yet, they are there with the breakage. You are the only person here, they are there, they hold you. It's alright to sit still, it's alright to shout, it's alright to think still, it's alright to hit... They are there looking after you, they are there, calmly and patiently. Good child, peace be with you, good child, peace be with you. Let you and let me be in peace, going deep to the forest in your mind. Waving sounds of moving leaves far above, waving air roots hugging the needy child... Waving your hands, leaving on your wish, waving your hands, coming back on your wish... Go, take your child to a forest when they are young. When they grow up, they may be back whenever they want. A Forest in Your Mind will never be gone by time. A Forest in Your Mind will never be gone by place. A Forest in Your Mind will never let you down...A Forest in Your Mind will never let you down...</fullReview>

One minute we're seeing a bereaved mother call out to God, and the next minute we're up flying around the universe with some stock Discovery-channel video clips of the wonder of universe. Later we see an embarrassingly pointless scene featuring two dinosaurs. If this evokes something profound in you, please explain it to me. Questions are asked about God, but nothing original. "Are you out there?" is about as far as this movie gets.I'm sure the movie will connect with male critics who grew up in similarly emotionally stunted circumstances in religious Texas. For the rest of us it's nothing more than sordid intellectual masturbation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing short of a cinematic aristotelian call-and-response dialog with the phenomena of existence. Malick has taken his fragmented memories of growing up in Texas in the '50's and placed them into the largest context humanly imaginable. A universe is born. Billions of years pass, countless stars ignite, trillions of silent worlds solidify, epochs roll across the fabric of time, life rises and falls and rises, all leading to a single, simple family drama. There is divinity in the rocks and in the waves and the microbial violence at the center of life and the explosive anger and beauty of the volcano that both destroys and builds... like the father. Everything is about everything. All metaphors are applicable. Every single life is a cosmic declaration. Every memory a vision as old as time and space. It is the achievement that Malick has been working towards for decades. All his films have been about struggle and violence in paradise. Once the paradise was the South Pacific of WWII, another time it was the new continent of America, another time the Texas Panhandle, another the Dakota Badlands. This time his paradise is the Universe, and the thematic struggle is the very act of being. It's not a flawless film. Some of the CGI is pretty glaringly bad and Sean Penn's bits as a man out place and time seem, to me, to hobble the lofty theme I personally perceive at the heart of the piece. Even when he passes through the metaphysical door of memory and grace into a new era at the end it failed to resonate with me to the degree that the rest of the film did. And yet, and yet there is so much artistic ambition here. So much truth. Around the half-way mark there is an extreme close up of a newborn child. Not an unusual image in a film. But the shot and the context that has come before it make this child seem so blank, so new. It is a helpless worm in a vast sprawling universe. Pure, but nothing... nothing yet. Truth is everywhere in this movie. Truth is everywhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see a film with a distinct beginning, middle and end, this one is not for you.If you want to enjoy lots of action or adolescent humor or gratuitous sex or endless waves of zombies chasing people down the street, this one is not for you.If you want to sit through a movie that makes you jump in your seat, this one is not for you.However, if your looking for an experience of visual and mental stimulation... go for it.Let's just award it "Best American-made Foreign Film."I don't recommend this film after a long, hard day at work or even when you're remotely fatigued. It is long and slowly moving. I would probably shorten the film, which is why I gave this a 9 instead of a 10, but in all, I have no complaints except for the people who call this utter rubbish or a complete bore. If you feel you've wasted two-and-a-half hours of your life on this film, then don't even attempt to fool us by shaving that patch of hair between your eyebrows.I love all kinds a movies. My pallet of favorites (and there are hundreds) include, in no particular order, American Pie, Cars, Blue Velvet, The Help, Titanic and Citizen Kane. I can enjoy a ridiculous movie as much as an action-packed chaser or an intelligently written story.Life is love and love is life. Without love you walk this earth pretty much as an empty shell. I know my place in life, and it was merely reinforced through viewing this movie. This film is not linear and it does not have to be. If you have feelings, have experienced love, loss, tranquility or pain, you'll get this movie, and it will get to you.I don't have to mention anything specific from this film. I don't have to share any spoilers. I don't have to quote any philosophers, reference any other historical films or filmmakers to make my point. Plenty of people have already done so, and most of them are on point. My take on this film is really quite simple.This film has a very easy to understand story. Most listings for this film completely sum up the plot, as does the menu on your cable box and even the description on IMDb (link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478304/). You can read any one of those and know what the film is about. IF that's all you want to know, select your next film. Otherwise, jump in, open your eyes and your mind and your soul and feel what's really coming at you.I fell asleep during Cars and Captain America, both movies I enjoyed after playing them again. The Tree of Life had me completely glued to the screen. although it is not my wife's kind a movie, she enjoyed it as well, following it with a quick critique of "weird" and "strange." She also said "It definitely makes people talk about it." EXACTLY!Hey, if you hated it, sorry for your loss. You can recoup your life time lost during the interview at your final gate when they ask what you learned in life. When they send you back to learn your lesson a second time, maybe you'll experience life a little fuller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorgeous Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As usual, Malick delivers another gorgeous film. It may start off quite slow, but before you know it, you're drawn into the world he has created. However, just like going into a David Lynch film and realizing you're going to get a fair dose of ambiguity, one must also know what they're in for when watching a Terrance Malick film. His films (which should always be seen on the big screen, if possible), are more of an "experience" than anything else. They're intensely honest, and almost entirely behavior driven, with very little dialogue. As for plot, well I defy anyone to come up with a halfway decent plot synopsis for this film. And nor should they. It's one of those films where all one really needs to say is, "well, you sort of have to see it."Nothing is explicitly spelled out for the audience member in this film, but unlike some filmmakers, I never got the feeling that he was being needlessly, and pretentiously, obtuse. Malick is one of the few filmmakers (the very few), who can get away with minimal plot because his images, characters, and music choices are so incredibly powerful; he puts you in a place that is very specific. When I left the movie theater, I felt as if I had just exited a time machine where I'd literally spent a couple of hours living with these characters in the 1950s American South. Everything's authentic, and nothing is forced. Does the film require some patience? Yes. Is everything explained? No. Is it a film that you would go back to watch again and again? Probably not. But it is one of those films that if you just it wash over you, it'll likely be an experience you won't soon forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I work at a movie theater, so I've seen a little bit of this movie and I thought it was very, very strange, but I didn't know much about it. I figured maybe somebody that knew more about it or watched the whole thing would get it. WRONG! In the past day there were five people that asked for refunds or to see a different movie! When I went to clean the theater, I asked the guests on their way out what they thought of it and I heard everything form laughter, to it sucked, it was confusing, to just plain rotten! I'm sure there's somebody who would like this movie, I just haven't met anybody who does yet. If you're questioning going to see it or not, I'd save my time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a tribute to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rushed to the screening somewhat on a rainy afternoon whim, fully prepared to return home confused or even bored (given warnings from my dad who had watched it in Hong Kong last month).To my pleasant surprise, I found myself enjoying it profoundly (while also understanding completely why it wouldn't work for most moviegoers in Hong Kong - in the fast-paced culture with little patience, it'd be hard to slow down or step back enough to stomach this type of work; but to be fair, even in the screening I attended in the US, the audience seemed split 50/50 between being unimpressed/bored and being transfixed/blown away). I loved the cast (though I did wonder if Sean Penn was cast partly because the adult Jack appeared so rarely that an easily recognizable face was necessary to serve as a quick anchor), and was especially amazed by how the director was able to capture such raw, authentic emotions in the young cast (including the infants!)"The Tree of Life" provides one of those film experiences in which there is no pressure to demystify the "point" of every action or every image, for the plot is enwrapped in the thematic context of "life itself as a mystery". Indeed, in real life, not everything happens with a clear explanation, and so much of it is impossible to capture in words and yet fully and equally real.To me, this film is part visual poem, part allegory, part prayer, and, overall, a tribute to life, a tribute that engages all the senses. Although a little bit of background knowledge about music and the Bible would enhance one's understanding of some of the nuances, I think it is accessible to anyone who goes prepared for something quite unusual. Then, simply allow the sights, sounds, and the story wash over you (not unlike waves on a sandy beach, a recurring image in the film) and then examine what treasures you find washed up on the shore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tree of "WHEN WILL IT END"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tree of Life is the most cataclysmically painful attempt at a film I have ever had the gross displeasure to experience. In the beginning of the film we see that there's been a death of one of the children, (I honestly don't know which one, nor could I muster the energy to care) This seems like the start of what could be a promising story as you presume the entire film is going to trace back to how this happened, or why - but it doesn't. Instead we see what seemed like about 4 days worth of unfinished scenes from the Discovery Channel, interspersed with Brad Pitt being a poor father, and occasionally Sean Penn wandering aimless around what is presumably his own workplace, looking like a confused constipated moron.In case a lot of the reviews on IMDb don't seem to make much sense to you, here's a description of a typical 60 seconds of the film.A wobbly camera shows a small boy on a swing close-up shot of the same boy crying under a tree20 seconds of underwater footage of a sea cucumber Brad pit mutters something about grass to a child A smartly dressed Sean Penn is in a lift, looking lost. 10 seconds of footage of Saturn presumably taken from CassiniA different boy has his hair ruffled whilst looking fairly unhappy (During this entire sequence, a woman whispers something like "I like ham" in the background)This process is then repeated for 2.5 hours. At the end of the film, Sean Penn (still looking wildly constipated) wanders through a door frame on a beach and all the various 'characters' are there with him too, which is presumably meant to be a visual metaphor for heaven, but again I could be wrong - it might be a visual metaphor for loft insulation for all I know.In the cinema I was tortured in, there was an audible sigh of relief when the film ended. So in summary - no story, no plot, no start, beginning or end, possibly edited by a schizophrenic brain damaged weasel. It was as enjoyable and interesting as watching Jedward trying to explain Cubism to a desk clock.Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overheard in the restroom afterward: "Two and a quarter hours of pretentious bullshit."Now I won't rate it that low - I'm tempted to call it Terrence Malick being self- indulgent. I was excited to see how highly IMDb viewers rated it, and insisted we go out and see it tout de suite. For once, I am betrayed by an IMDb rating.The lengthy origin-of-universe image montage at about 1/3 through was becoming annoying when I saw the "early life forms," let's put it like that, and I wondered if I wandered into the wrong theater? We've all seen special effects that were better done than here. It was a true relief when actors again became visible. Certain tropes were overused to the point of obviousness: door images, tunnels, tunnels with bright light at the end, rushing water, fire.Yet I'm not immune to the film's visual allure, and it is considerable. I absolutely loved the period feel of the sets and costume design. I grew up in that era and it just took me back to my own childhood, which I suppose is part of the film's magic. I was put into a place where I was receptive to any wisdom the movie might deliver. At one point I told myself, "Just sit back and let the director do his job." Malick's several sequences in which an argument, conflict, or other interaction is accomplished more through physical movement than dialog were especially noteworthy. The film was at these times balletic.I give top marks to Brad Pitt for a role that made him actually unattractive, and much more three-dimensional than he often is. Sean Penn, wasted, could have been replaced by dozens of actors, and I didn't think he looked similar enough to the other family members to work for this cast. If you're a Terrence Malick fan you will no doubt want to catch this film on the big screen, but don't make the mistake I did and go in with highest expectations - or a naive viewing partner. I won't be tempted to watch this one again - even on a home screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Haunting Tree of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malik's Tree of Life was thought provoking. A lot was about "mother"?idealized. Most was about grief and a family (the O'Briens) coping with the death of one of the kids?the youngest nineteen year old. Cause of death was not stated. Sadness permeated the movie. It was told in a dreamy, fluid way, like dance choreography, for the shots themselves reflected stream of consciousness, and in that fluid stream, the naturally disjointed images and thoughts of the mind. This parallelism between mind and imagery was captured through shots of tumbling water, soaring trees, landscapes, shards of family memories, and then, spirituality?this last in the form of an amorphous, diaphanous light glowing perpetually through organic tissue of an orange color that changed in hues as the skins and folds of organic mass moved, as if undulating in water or the womb. The immovable glow at the core represented God, or so I interpreted it. God for the narrator, the God we talk to within ourselves. Could the spirituality component of the movie remain as strong if the Creation story had been edited out??the universe, the Big Bang, the start of Planet Earth, first organisms, water creatures, dinosaurs, man, the family? The answer is yes. Using just the white light within the organic mass to symbolize one's personal God was an effective liet motif. For this viewer, including the rest of the spiritual material was not a huge flaw of the movie, particularly given the parents' religious adherence. But it seemed an unnecessary addition, stand-alone material that didn't impact the main content, and thus was superfluous. Brad Pitt's performance as Mr. O'Brien was excellent. Jessica Chastain's "mother" was too idealized and ethereal to be convincing as a flesh and blood human, but the actress amply fulfilled the role written for her. The film made us think on many levels. For one, how laughter fills life at first and then gets sucked away because of troubled relationships. And the message of: all families are more or less the same. Generally, mothers are idealized angels and fathers (even when "great") are tyrants. The innate meanness in many kids was shown through the protagonist Jack (Hunter McCracken) and neighborhood boys and their pranks. And yet, at the same time, an uncommon degree of sympathy, empathy was present in the O'Brien family characters, torturing them. An American childhood fifty years ago, in a pre-computer age, integrated with nature, and toys and games depended on imagination. Juxtaposed to this early freedom in nature with constant reference to trees reaching into the sky is Jack's later career amid high-end architecture?gleaming surfaces, soaring structures with sharp geometry, not a tree in sight. Notwithstanding the loss of physical nature, the tree of life remains firmly rooted within each of us, for it embodies family, our origins, and the origins of human existence in the universe. Film, a visual media, depends on sound for its full effect. Here, the muffled, whispered, murmured voices worked brilliantly, for that is how we dream and even remember. This is Jack's story about being his father's eldest son, so his despairing voice-over questions existence the most. His parents' voice-overs also come in with their perspective on things. Spiritually infused, choral-like music by Alexandre Desplat augments the film's overarching theme of family grief. It contributed to the haunting quality of the film, how individuals are always haunted by their pasts?why our natural laughter slowly becomes somber, even depressed. Towards the end the music was heavy-handed and risked creating sentimentality. As the audience, we were always objective, never pulled into the story and experiencing it firsthand, partly because it wasn't a story but more of a meditation, or multi-tiered reflection choreographed in film art. We watched and considered ideas and themes as we went along. The limited dialogue gave space for that medium. It was a visual treatise on family grief, a cinematic treatment of human emotional states bottled up inside that finally find an art-outlet. The end of the movie symbolized this outcome, for late middle-aged Jack (who has ruminated this film-treatise over the course of one day, perhaps the anniversary of this youngest brother's death) speaks to his father over the phone in one scene, and we catch only fragments of the words?Yes, I think of him every day?an admittance that opens the door for atonement, redemption, and inner peace, or at least a kind of acceptance. Older Jack (played by Sean Penn) imagines all the characters from his nature-infused childhood?family, boyhood friends?and love is shared among all on the landscape of an infinite beach or desert. In this last scene his father, in particular, has been freed to express his unfettered love. The strict rules that have governed his life dissolve. All is forgiven. The mother's message earlier on that life is only bearable if there is love, is demonstrated in this scene, this grand finale of love and forgiveness. It may have been that older Jack's mother was already dead by the time the movie takes place, for we see her in a shrouded, floral-decorated funeral bed several times. Earlier on, she and her husband light a blue candle after the death of their son, and on the day that the film takes place, with older Jack remembering the past, including his mother's funeral bed, the blue candle reappears several times, and his father phones him, eliciting the response: Yes, I think of him every day. These images and murmurings suggest the death-anniversary, and in the end what becomes Jack's day of reckoning, setting things right in the complex family relationships and history. This is not a mainstream film, it's a thinking film handled with artistic beauty and pathos. It may fall short of being a masterpiece, but its rank is high, its power long-lasting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary experience-- A "must see" work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am grateful to have seen this film. It is extraordinary. To call it a "movie" is to minimize its significance. It is a prayer, a poem, a meditation, a song, a dream, a gift of great love and craftsmanship. There is really not a moment that is false or fails. Every moment of every image, every word, every note of music, every bit of silent darkness contributes to the whole. It demands much from the viewer--an open mind, a tolerance for ambiguity, a readiness to see the world from several perspectives at once, a hunger for beauty, an awareness of interconnectedness over great distances of time and space and imagination. You have to be willing to take a journey. Not everyone is willing or able to answer such demands. I think this movie will be studied for many years to come. I think it will come to be recognized as a great work of art, a towering achievement in the history of film. The cinematography is breath-taking. The acting, down to every member of the cast, is outstanding. The music ravaging. The story... Some critics I think are mistaken to think the movie is about the father. I don't see it that way at all. It is one man's meditation on his relationship with his brother and how that relationship wove into the interplay of nature and grace, death and love. Extraordinary. I have been changed by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I strenuously object to the comments that basically state that one must either be a lover of art and thus love this film, or a fan of Hollywood formulaic films and thus "not get" the film.I detest Hollywood formula flicks and feel they're made by lazy filmmakers. I seek films I can't predict, don't tie everything up, thus forcing the viewer to think and interpret and greatly enjoy films most often characterized as "boring" or "slow" and "without action".I find most films out of Hollywood to be dreck (yiddish for crap), I've loved many movies and the art of great film making since early childhood, have avidly watched thousands of films, have worked in the film industry in a variety of capacities for nearly 20 years and it is still my profession.Although I found several aspects of this film to appreciate:* The cinematography.* The lack of dialog forcing the excellent directing and acting to express the myriad emotions.* The non-linear approach.* The unpredictability.* The immersion into the milieu of the era without being knocked over the head with it, as so many films and TV shows do, such as TV's "Mad Men" and other movies Todd Haynes has contributed to.I found much I didn't care for:* In order for me to truly appreciate a film, I need to be immersed in the experience. I kept being regularly distracted by rather unsubtle techniques of the film, reminding me I was watching a movie (such as the seemingly random visuals of nature - most egregiously, the dinosaurs) and felt that Malick tried too bloody hard.* Wrapping the movie up with a basic suggestion to "give it up to god" (my interpretation).* Sean Penn's character as older Jack not being developed enough to be of much purpose (I presume this was due to editing the film to a more marketable length).* Beginning the film with a tragedy, that because I hadn't had any backdrop to the characters or the subject matter, I wasn't invested in them enough for the incident to have any of the potentially powerful emotional impact it might have had.* The credit order giving Sean Penn (whom I greatly admire) higher billing than the other much more deserving actors in this film.All in all, I was greatly disappointed in a film that I felt had tremendous potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Malick's trademarks show up in spades: exquisite use of classical music; a soaring/roving camera; an obsession with trees and water and beautiful shots of nature; and a desire to return to an innocence lost.What makes this different from his other films is how personal it is. When not overwhelming us with ambitious imagery second only to Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" in their cosmic wonders, Malick tells a tale of childhood (probably not too far removed from his own) and of love and loss and growing up in 1950's Texas.Magical while always staying grounded, philosophical without being didactic, and drenched in melancholy and memory, Malick's latest is a film impossible to forget and demanding of multiple views to take it all in.Check out full reviews at theschleicherspin.com</fullReview>

The rotten plot of the stiff father and the frustrated son simply can't carry the weight of the story. You can only go that far with the perspective of a boy, especially who was born in the American suburb in 50's, because, nothing was really going on, and that's fatal to a movie with mighty ambition.while I admire the director's courage to wander away into the Universe for quite a while in middle of the film (that section actually is very well done if sans the overpowering orchestras). the remaining of the film dwells on many lavish close-up, which certainly didn't help the already dull story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very American indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>sorry guys, but reading what kind of enthusiasm this movie provokes, I am afraid many people will not like what I'm going to say. I think this film is hardly appreciable for non-Americans. American films are obsessed by father-son problems, I have not yet found out why that could be, but it is a fact that difficult relationships between father and son are much more often in the center or at least a part of us-American films than in those of other cultures. Malick treats this theme certainly with honesty and (like the whole film) with technical perfection, but without any new or astonishing insights. frankly, I am afraid it is just the same old soup of stereotypes about the severe father who cannot show his love, asks too much from his son for whom he just wants the best, wanting to make him achieve where he himself failed etc. the second big, very American concern is religion. honestly, if you are not a believer, what could you possibly care about believers problems with god!? a young man dies (you can suppose that it is in Vietnam, but that of cause is no issue of the movie), but how could HE have let it happen?! OK, in movies you got often problems that do not concern you personally, but the problem is, that the movie is ruminating this question and others of that kind without real development: you got a quotation of Job right at the beginning and all the movie is an exposition of this quotation. the mother, I should write MOTHER, cause she is the stereotype of the good mother as the father in the film is THE FATHER, exposes by her thoughts the Christian position of LOVE and grace, whereas the father represents the way of the WORLD. only at the end the father converts himself more to family-love instead of being the feared father who obliges his sons to call him "sir". these two conceptions are confronted to the problem of the death of a son, and in the end miraculously the mother can accept this loss and "give her son" to god. of cause the movie is set in the 50s, because you hardly find any father like that nowadays, fortunately. malick seems not to have confidence to a contemporary setting. the present (skycrapers of glass) is only a simple counter-position to the fifties (grass and nature). all I said would not really be a major point against the movie, if Malick would have trusted his own story (well filmed, very well cut). but he has pretensions to make us feel sublime by showing us endlessly scenes of waves, volcano eruptions, planets and stars etc. these pictures are nice to see, but they are pathetic and sentimental. they are calculated to make us feel small and big at the same time (the sublime) and in relation to the absolute. they are metaphysical kitsch. the movie failes completely at the end by showing us a kind of paradise where you meet again all your loved ones ... theologically it's on the level of the belief children have. I was touched by "The New World", in "The Tree of Life" Malick tries to violate us with his pathos and deep feelings and thoughts. it's a pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Tree of Life" has won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and many other awards. It's also been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar--but we'll have to wait a couple weeks to find out if it wins that. If the Academy is basing the award on how pretentious and dull a film is, then the movie is a shoe-in (and with some past Best Picture winners, such as "The Last Emperor" and "The English Patient", this might just be the case). My vote is for "Hugo" or perhaps "The Artist"....heck, ANY film other than "Tree of Life"! "Tree of Life" is 100% unconventional in its story telling. I could try to describe it, but you really have to see this indescribable film yourself--and then you STILL might not know what it is! The film bounces around stylistically. At times, it's an obvious art film with gorgeous graphics that seems to be making a statement about how insignificant we all are or about eternity. At other times, it's a story about a screwed up family--one where you really aren't given enough of the pieces to be 100% sure what is happening. To make it deep (i.e., more confusing and artsy), there is hardly any dialog for very long stretches, lots of internal monologues and the story about the family is completely non-linear--bouncing back and forth in time (further confusing the viewer). It also, believe it or not, has a sequence involving dinosaurs!! The bottom line is that although the film looks amazing at times (with some of the nicest scenes you'll ever see), it also often using a jerky handy-cam look. And, it has a story that the average viewer will be bored to tears to watch. All in all, an uneven and rather unpleasant viewing experience I don't wish to repeat.Wouldn't it be nice to see nominees that were actually enjoyable to watch and had more than a very, very narrow appeal?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life Under a Microscope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's existentialist experiment The Tree of Life triggered walkouts, exasperated sighs, and confused chatter. I loved every minute of it, but it's easy to sympathize with an unprepared audience. Imagine it: half an hour into an otherwise grounded '50s family drama, the universe is born. Their confusion was understandable, but their rudeness was less forgivable ? I had to tell two whispering women behind me to curb their incessant chatting. With the shuffle of shopping bags, they not only obliged, they left.Though not particularly fair, it's easy to defend Tree of Life and condemn their reaction in the greater context of Malick's body of work. I don't know what contingent of the crowd had had exposure to the filmmaker, or consequently arrived as preconditioned to his introspective narrative stylings as I had. I'd venture a guess that a few of the least satisfied patrons likely hadn't even seen the trailer. But if Tree of Life is only a great film if you've already seen Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line, then it isn't a great film.The Tree of Life is great, but it will bewilder and bore an audience unwilling to entertain Malick's bizarre tangents. I don't pretend to understand exactly what the filmmaker is suggesting with each visual cue, but at their most visceral level, the images are appreciable as pure visual poetry. And written in the firestorm of newborn planets, Malick finds awesome beauty in the smoldering foundations of Earth, and the burgeoning life of our progenitors.Opinion will doubtless hinge on this outstanding segment, but in truth Malick's trip to the planetarium isn't an especially significant aspect of the story. The birth of our world is an important prologue, but the director is more interested in comparably recent history. Sean Penn plays a modern man. Stuffed into a business suit and entombed in a monolithic glass office, he reflects on his upbringing with his parents and two brothers. With no conventional narrative to speak of, he's left grasping at an odd assortment of memories and feelings.First steps, family suppers, neglected chores. The genius of Malick's film is playing these little moments on a galactic scale. Consider it this way: we meet a family with all the requisite triumphs and tragedies. Been there, done that. By pausing their story to illuminate the incalculably vast and random series of events that made possible their microscopic lives, the filmmaker gives us a new perspective on the size of even their shortest shortcomings. Juxtaposed with the unending expanse of the universe, the infinitesimal experiences that chip away and eventually shape their characters are monumental.And then you've got the nuts and bolts of Malick's filmmaking. Gorgeously shot by Emmanuel Lubezki and backed by Alexander Desplat's emotive score, The Tree of Life deftly marries sight and sound with a Kubrickian flair that recalls the director in top form. It remains to be seen whether Malick's oeuvre will have the lasting impact Kubrick's did, but the two are alike foremost in their uncompromising commitment to their craft.Tree of Life, like 2001: A Space Odyssey, is a big film. Its ideas are expansive, provocative, and timeless. As was demonstrated at the Cannes premiere and in my theater Saturday, the price of that intellectual ammunition is accessibility. This is not a film for everyone. It's not a film that conventionally entertains. What Malick attempts to elicit from his viewers is infinitely more valuable than endorphins ? a reverie for life itself and empathy for mankind. It must have worked, I feel sorry for those walkouts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was heavy on imagery and short on story. The music was wonderful, but when we looked for the music credits at the end (and they were at the VERY end!)they were difficult to read and rolled too quickly. If a movie has won awards we tell ourselves that we're supposed to like it, but I had trouble with that. In fact, I almost walked out in the first half hour---and I haven't walked out of a movie since one of the goofy "Airplane" movies. Okay, I'll admit we like to have stories wrapped up, but we could have been told what happened to the younger brothers. Did the boy die in Viet Nam? The timing was right. and IF that were the case, how did the eldest not go there? Also, it was Sean Penn's memory as an adult, but even people in movies have more cohesive memories! I saw this film at an "art house" theater where people usually watch the credits. In this case, they were out of their seats and headed for the door. If I were a film critic, I'd have difficulty going against a Palme d'Or winner, but I'd have to be honest and say that the film is so-so.A recent movie called (I think) "Evening Sun." was far superior to this film.</fullReview>

Personally I couldn't tell if I had just seen a remake or bits and pieces of something like IN THE BEGINNING when God created the earth or cuts from JURRASIC PARK. It's too bad, I think it could have been such a good film if only there had been a real PLOT and come away with something more that all the cinematography which I think would have worked better in another venue. I really felt it was a shame to use such talented actors in such a film. I really thought, this must be what you experience if you try acid the 1st time, don't know and don't EVER want to know.

		<fullReview>A lot of people didn't really get this movie, and that's to be expected. It all made perfect sense to me. "The Tree Of Life". From our nebular beginnings as atoms in the universe, through our very inception on this earth. And the birth of mercy, compassion, love -- when the dinosaur, instead of eating its vulnerable prey, allows it to die with dignity. The movie basically tracks the birth of compassion, or the way grace is born out of "nature red in tooth and claw". The way of nature -- selfish, egotistic, unloving...or the way of grace, which makes all life possible. It's laid out very clearly, and acted out by the family's story.There are a lot of visuals that were hard to parse, of course. This is Malick we're talking about. Surely they have meaning to him, or maybe they don't. But there's so much poetry here, there's layers upon layers of meaning a sensitive and receptive viewer will pick up. It's all there. I can't imagine how any such viewer will fail to perceive the beauty that suffuses this film -- which is indeed the very theme of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the bravest films to come out since the 60's. I just avoided the comparison to Kubrick's "200l:A Space Odessey" since that's all you're gonna hear. There is a lot going on in this movie which centers on the Sean Penn character we see only in just a few minor scenes until it's conclusion. He is Jack(who Penn plays as an adult in present time) the eldest of the 3 young boys in the family. It begins with a visual with what I believe is the beginning of creation which it later bounces back to again around the 20 minute mark. That scene is simply amazing (yes Kubrick would've been proud) and bigger than even the film's subject matter. Now the story is basically about a family of 3 boys, mother, and tough-on-his kids father. That is the premise of the movie and Malick's gives you a portrait that is effective and amazing without hardly any dialog. What sets all these beautiful visuals in motion is when one of the young the 3 boys is killed. I know I didn't go into detail of the story-but you know what neither does the director. What you get instead is probably a movie with so much going on visually that it will be studied for years to come. Is it all memories, or is it all a dream? Doesn't matter it's amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most anticipated film of mine for this year. Undoubtedly gorgeous, hypnotic, and surreal, no question about it. Personally, I delved deep into this film as I have with The Thin Red Line and The New World. Malick, to me, is the type of a filmmaker that knows exactly how to appeal to a certain type of crowd. It is probably no surprise that he divides the audiences in such a radical manner. People either love him, or hate him, with what I believe to be little chance of a middle ground, although I do not dismiss its' existence. I find that Malick makes films for a certain type of personality, the kind that he himself possesses. Quiet, meditative, observant, highly sentimental. And he knows, knows how to get all the right emotions out of people who watch his films. Like a master psychologist, he pushes all the right buttons with the way he blends imagery with sound, and music.I personally do not feel the need to dissect or even talk about this film, as it is completely useless. Those who have seen the trailer, or know his past work need not to read others' thoughts on his films in order to go see them. If one feels repulsed or feels Malick is pretentious, you already know what to do. Just not watch it.[06-23-2011, 11:58 AM]</fullReview>

This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen because it makes you think about you, about life, about the world.When you watch this movie, it just takes you inside and you flow somewhere deep in your thoughts. I can't say one mistake or negative about this movie. It is just wonderful.To correctly get the point of this movie, you have to be prepared to think. To use your brain and to open your eyes and see the world around you as it is. It is not easy and not everybody can do it. But for those who can, must this movie be one of their TOP movies. There is just no other way. What I also like about this movie is, that it is not recorded in rush. It takes it's time and that is what makes it so unique. It's not just bunch of emotional scenes sticked together to make an impression of intellectual movie. This movie gives you hand, grabs you and take you into the plot.As i said, AMAZING</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful film, gorgeously shot and realized. The narrative is non-linear and you just have to go with its rhythms. If you do, it will fall into place. At heart it is a portrait of a family moving through what first appears to be a Utopian era - the 1950's. As the story progresses, the cracks begin to show. Even the family home seems to get smaller as the main characters grow older and the perspective of the young brothers changes. On other levels, the film questions our purpose here on earth and our relation to the universe and how tragedy challenges faith. There is religious imagery but in the end it is a spiritual film. I'm basically an atheist and at first was a bit put off by the Christian symbolism but as the film progressed, I was intensely moved by the big questions it raises. If you want your movies unchallenging, summed up and without ambiguity, this isn't for you. If you are intrigued by metaphysical themes, stunning imagery and the primal struggles of life and family, you will be moved by this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reflecting on Tree of Life somewhat reminded me of something I read about how Ingmar Bergman's wife at the time had stated that his film Winter Light, which Bergman considered to be some of his best work, was a masterpiece, but a dreary masterpiece. However I find "dreary masterpieces," of course only when in the hands of such masterful directors as Terrence Malick, to be amazing, although usually not their magnum opus. For example, while Winter Light was amazing I still did not like it as much as Wild Strawberries or Cries and Whispers, or even Through a Glass Darkly. The Tree of Life is "almost perfect." This movie offers some of the most visually stimulating and technically sound work that cinema has to offer. It takes on the task of tackling some eternal questions such as the power of nature versus grace. Terrence Malick brings out great ability from all of his actors, impressively even the young up and comers. He demonstrates extreme competence to evoke human emotion while also forcing the audience to take in this grandiose movie from an absolute subjective perception.So while The Tree of Life may come off as dreary for some, it is a good kind of dreary; one not of boredom or dullness, but of epicness. And yes, this movie may not be for everyone, but I still would recommend it to everyone. It is an opportunity to see a masterful director at the top of his craft and also a chance to feel an "experience." This is just that?A grand experience that you owe to yourself a chance to experience, whether you walk away scratching your head hating the movie, or go and reflect loving it until the day you inevitably re-watch it. 9.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, this is deeply religious and spiritual movie. Second, in order to understand it, first you need to read Biblical Book of Job, specially God end speech to ancient prophet (chapters 38-42). I don't understand FAQ negative answer on question is this movie based on a book. They say no, I say yes, and as mentioned, its a Book of Job (and Malick honestly pinpoint to that direction in opening scene quoting from Job). I was always mesmerized by that story and interestingly enough, with all screenings and countless Biblical movies no one ever attempted to screen this piece of world literature, till now. And Malick do this fantastically. Set it in modern time, this movie is eternal (as original old testament book) in their eternal quest for answer on one simple question: Why good people suffer? (Or why there is suffering in the world, or why evil exist, or what is meaning of life/existence, or is there a God/Creator, or is there comfort for injustice...) And finally, if you are a lover of speed big budget action movies then Don't look this film. I order to understanding you must be quiet, humiliate yourself and put your hart and mind at full throttle. Than you can enjoy this masterpiece. Otherwise, don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lecture from a tired and troubled old thinker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick has something to say about the nature of humanity in relation to the universe, and you're quite mistaken if you think you'll get to have your say. Rather than raising new questions, Malick's intention seems to be to answer questions and quarrels regarding the human condition. This quasai-anthropological venture into nature of our species (and I do argue that this is indeed what it was) left me feeling as though I had endured a Q and A with my grandfather. It is difficult in every sense to accurately rate or explain this film, since I am not entirely sure if it either completely lacks depth, or Malick simply failed to speak coherently. With long montages of cosmic screen-savers, and idyllic and stylised poetry written, I suppose, to relate to our core, idiosyncratic emotions, one might almost be convinced to consider The Tree of Life a work of modern contemporary 'art' - but is it really? There will be a very many people (indeed I have seen them myself) who, with every critique of the film, will claim that their peers simply "misunderstood" the message. You didn't understand it as I did. As we did. But if there is no interpretation, other than that of those who understood, and those who misunderstood, then by what criteria do you consider this art? Herein lies the problem with The Tree of Life. It relays information. It doesn't connote particularly complex messages within it's lavishly stylised imagery. In a similar vein, it makes no attempt at connoting at all. There is, quite contrary to art, nothing to denote. The symbolism is tantamount to labelled with post-it-notes, and the use of music runs through the film like a laughter track in a sit-com. "This is when you're supposed to laugh - this is where you're supposed to go: oh my, this is beautiful."Perhaps I'm being a little harsh - after-all, it asks a lot of you, so it must have some depth. Well, there are those who rate a novel 5 stars simply because they made it through to the end. I fear this film will suffer the same disingenuous fate. "I survived this - I'm cultured." An embittered and particularly snobby view, you might say - but without a direct digression into the reception of the film, it is vital in understanding the problems.Indeed, as with often the best art, the work is a catalyst for discussion - discussion with a view to interpret. Herein is my point about reception. Forum discussions and controversy about a films validity, are not the criteria by which a film -being- a discussion about it's subject, are considered true. In reality, A Tree of Life is drole pseudo-introspection through some idyllic and very familiar poetry; the vehicle by which to take us through the life of some 1950's family that in no way seemed to relate to myself, or any emotions (including the severity of the emotions) that I faced, or have ever faced. It paints the world as volatile - certainly, but it does this is such a tame, almost religiously idyllic way as to promote Malick humanism, rather than an actual depiction of the human condition.There is one stage of the film that I do hold in high regard. That is the seemingly inconsequential portrayal of pre-historic life. There was true beauty in the dinosaur shots. Malick, quite wonderfully, portrayed them as alienating, subsequently terrifying in their alienation. However, if you see humanity as some super-sensitive, text-book symbolic Madonna-mother, angry-son country-folk at odds with their own earthly transgressions, then maybe you'll think very highly of the film. I for one prefer my philosophy from a philosopher, and my science from a scientist. The Tree of Life didn't touch upon anything that many, if not most, films already had - the most considerable difference, noted by Sean Penn: Malick offered no narrative. Whether that is a good or bad thing, I suppose, is up to you - but make no mistake, there's no room for your opinion, or your thoughts, in this film. You either relate, or you don't. To put it more simply, and perhaps even allegorically: Malick is preaching to you - you either agree, or you don't. His eloquence is unmatched by his intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is supposed to be an art piece, based on the exceptional cinematography and musical score, as just that I would give it a 10 but then it doesn't say this is its main purpose, it claims to be a movie with a plot, with a story and as either I have scored it a 3, 31/2 at the most because of the acting (the little we did see). I understand the base plot of the movie, it is a movie about a man's relationship with his parents, his father in particular but to what end those this relationship show in his adult life? We are shown the child, Jack as a grown man, a successful man by the looks of his home and and his workplace as I believe an architect but that's all we are shown of his adult life, the rest is of him wandering around and looking rather lost about something or the other. The tough love and harsh upbringing he receives from his father is well documented in his childhood story and he does grow up to be successful and respected so it leaves me wondering, whats the point of this movie? I honestly fail to understand it and I warn anyone who wants to see it to appreciate it as what it should have been and stayed, a work of cinematographic exploration by a director who appears to have given us a glimpse into a rather personal interest of his in the cosmos. I don't even understand this movie enough to write a review that makes sense about it, I'm so glad I only spent $1 on it, thank you redbox.</fullReview>

Even you you can't understand it, just sit back and let Mr. Malick take you on a journey through the mind.For those of you who think this is boring. SLOW DOWN ON LIFE. You don't need to constantly watch people getting shot or blown up or kicked in the balls. It's good for you to take a step back and think about what is going on around you. It's good for you to think. Now let Terrence show you the beauty that he has discovered around the world and enjoy a relaxing and mind expanding 2 hours. What do you have to rush off to do?

		<fullReview>The Tree of life. Have you seen it? Well, I have. It's the years most talked about movie. People aren't quite sure what to think about it, and thats why I had to see it. And after seeing it, I see why people are so up in the air about it.I myself will not doubt that I found flaws in this film. But even with those flaws, I still consider The Tree of life to be the year's best film so far. Other films this year have been excellent and without flaws. But this film has flaws, and it's still the best movie of the year so far.You really don't know where its going for the first half an hour. It shows plant life, animal life, and how the planet got started and stuff. Beautiful cinematography and scenes shot there. That is Terrence Malick's gift.Then the film takes us to a family, named The O'Brians.When he's older, one of the sons(Sean Penn) reflects on his past. What led him to be the man that he is. It shows the relationship between him and his father(Brad Pitt), and how he gave him a rough time.I was not sure where director Terrence Malick was going with the "life" moments. But what he did with them was unique, and basically what he did with the whole film was unique, even though he takes more time than necessary to tell his tale.I will admit that The Tree of life is a bit slow, and that the end doesn't really add up. Was that really what happened, or was it just Sean Penn's interpretation of what happened? And whats up with the ending? I'm not sure.But The Tree of life is such a unique, well acted, trippy, bewitching, and beautiful film that you can really just ignore all of those flaws. The film definitely isn't for everyone, but it's still my favorite film of the year so far. Maybe after I see Midnight in Paris my opinion will change. But there is no doubt that The Tree of life is a great movie. I can't wait to watch it again.A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An odd but powerful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a carbon copy Hollywood flick, you are in the wrong place. However, if you can think of this film as an artistic expression, then you are on the right track. This film has a powerful and haunting tone throughout that leaves echos in the mind of the audience. The film consists of a man's childhood memories and also includes an interlude of the universes creation. It is a strange film, absolutely, and not all of it's concepts are original. However, it does in a very unique way prompt some very significant thoughts and questions in the mind of an intelligent audience member.What is man's place in the universe? Of what significance is a brief human life in the long history of time? Where is God and what does he ask of us? These and questions like these are what the film provokes. If you want to be entertained, go see the next movie Michael Bay pumps out. If you want to see a work of art that dives into the human condition, see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An extraordinary movie!Even though I didn't cry,I was definitely shaking.It has a really strong meaning,for us to care more about spiritual things,and relationships,and accept everybody as they are,not by trying to change them,but changing us.Absolutely stunning filming!It has wonderful scenes,and few lines.Maybe this is why everybody understands it differently.Nature,windows,light are combining our way through life.This is not a typical movie,as i have said,it has really few lines,and i strongly recommend it only for people who would like to feel strong emotions through images.Also,first 40-50 minutes are quite slow,and a bit static,but do not give up on it.The most important message is,in my opinion,the fact that we must accept our fate in order to leave in peace,and evolve in our thinking by approaching to others,actually just evolve,be superior to all sad emotions,and feel the connection between us,the universe,and The Creator of it,may you call it as you want.I call him God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that explores the meaning of existence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tree of Life is not a film for everyone the range of reviews has made this very clear. You will either love it or hate it. Most of the criticism from audiences has been that there is there is no clear narrative or story and the images are confusing and make no sense, and to a degree they are absolutely correct.However this is an experimental film that breaks free of the tradition Hollywood story telling and takes the audience to places and ideals some will appreciate and others will find themselves lost and confused.This is a deep and meaning full film that explores the meaning of life, nature versus grace and that every action has a consequence. The film cleverly composes images of lost youth to images of the creation of time and how we are all connected.There are elements that are very reminiscent of 2001 a Space Odyssey similarly to the famous scene where we see the ape turn a harmless bone into a deadly weapon we are taken to the age of dinosaurs to witness the moment were animals first shows mercy to one another.Don't go into this film with expectations you must lose yourself in the images and interpret the story for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth it unless you're an evolutionist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't want to sound harsh, but this film was draining, and unfortunately like other films I have watched (one I'm thinking of is There Will Be Blood), The Tree of Life is not an emotionally draining masterpiece. It is simply draining. Full stop.I will start with why I entered into this film. Why? First, the average on IMDb is very high (8.0 before I entered the cinema). Second, the reviews sound fantastic...I didn't read deeply into the movies because sometimes going too deep into the movie summary ruins the plot for me, but at a glance I read some comments about: "movie of the decade", "art", "poetry", "haunting masterpiece" and the like.I was impressed...I read the short synopsis about a child losing his innocence. It grabbed my attention! I entered the movie and was very happy with the first few scenes and the dialogue. Then all of a sudden a very long scene showing the evolution of life comes up. It may have taken up 1/3 of the film. Yeh OK good. But seriously, it serves no purpose in cinema. I would prefer to watch the documentary channel. I didn't walk into a film about a child losing his innocence to discover how the earth came about to creation (from the perspective of the director), I didn't walk in to watch dinosaurs and ripple effects on the Earth and the worlds after that exist.The movie is poetry? You got to be kidding me! The script for actual dialogue would have been 10 pages. Nothing is said in this film. Occasionally someone decides to do a voice over, a very short one and then back to evolution.Some of the scenes with the children growing up are good, but it dragged out too much and plus the evolution aspect completely distracted me from the child losing his "innocence." This movie doesn't show how a child loses his innocence, it shows how the world began and how it will end for all of us.I would have preferred a focus on Sean Penn and the actual consequences and affects his childhood had on him, not some last ditch effort where everyone is in heaven, happy, showing love.The concept of the movie from the beginning was good, but it was poorly executed. We all wonder the purpose of life, we all wonder why we're here, what's going to happen to us when we die, etc...but the sad fact I have to tell this director is that life goes on regardless of evolution, regardless of what or who we are and where we end up. We still have credit card debts, we still have children to look after, we still face moral choices everyday...our troubles don't disappear just because we're loving and because we (think) we've discovered where we came from and where we will end up. You still have to live your life don't you? Seriously not recommended unless you like watching the discovery channel and are an evolutionist.Another complaint I have, which I would not even have if I was happy with the movie is that Sean Penn and Brad Pitt (the "stars"), do nothing. Zilch. Especially Sean Penn. His "older" character should have been studied more instead of showing me how the universe evolved and some nice happy pictures of heaven and what not. The science (or lack of) behind the universe is something which cannot be proved or disproved. Arguments from all over the place are thrown around. Well, the director thinks he has it all figured out. He has nicely laid out the beginning, the middle and the end for us in the tree of life. What for? Live your life, pondering about these concepts is not going to help you live your life. It may even be argued that by my very rationale I am contradicting myself, but all I'm trying to do is a) give non viewers an insight into what the film is and who it is really for and b)show other viewers who disliked this film that people in agreement exist. The director seriously has issues with his life. He has no idea why he is living, where he came from and where he will end, ultimately leading him to a desperate effort to make a film and give himself some false comfort.By the way, I believe in God, I believe in fat, heaven and hell, and I believe in morals, love and being "good". But the concept in this movie is simply draining!I must also declare, this is on the rare occasion I have disliked an IMDb movie with a score of over 7.5 Usually over 7.5 and I'm really happy with the movie and I thought I started a trend. Unfortunately I'm brutally honest in this review, I did not like this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "hands opening towards an open sky" symbol again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any film that wins the "Palme d'Or" should have something special, so why the low score? It might just be me. If a movie tries to make me feel something profound, but fails, I'll get thoroughly annoyed. But then again, after the screening there where scattered applause mingled with nervous laughter. I agree with both.There is not much to say about the story. There is one, a quite simple one really which is not the main focus. It's the framework of the story that is the real movie. The fluff and details that you might call "life".One thing is clear. ANY movie depicting moving dinosaurs is quite taxing on the audience. If you are going to buy it, it demands a certain something from the director. A movie sporting both dinosaurs AND Sean Penn demands a touch of genius. Now, Terrence Malick have been accused of said "genius" before. Is it still there? Yes, partly. There are scenes of true beauty here, really, but they are dragged down by long low-ampere scenes. Oh, I'm no stranger to pretentious experiments. If it works I'm fine, but I do not believe in this. The ending was downright laughable, or at least cringe-inducing. How many "hands opening towards an open sky" can one take in a lifetime? I for once have had enough, thanks to Mr. Malick. I applaud your beautiful pictures but laugh nervously at your cliché-laden ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American suburban life in the 50s is since long mythologized. It's obviously a very good drama background.Here we meet another dysfunctional family where the father teaches the sons the rules of nature. "Good people are always used". The mother stands for grace; the grace that always forgives and remains grace even as a not-loved solitaire in a world of...nature.The wrestling still goes on in the oldest son as a grown-up. It could have stayed that way, but an almost 30 minutes long sequence of exploding sun, fish in the sea and small dinosaurs reduces the drama. Philosophy and sociology surrender to symbolism</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Tree of Life is broken up into three different halves. The first half is the first twenty to twenty-five minutes of the film where you have to get used to the way it's laid out. The second half is when you're beginning to get immersed in the characters' world. The final half is when you're fully immersed in their world, and are craving more imagery and more brilliance. That's what The Tree of Life is all about.Terrence Malick is one of the most interesting, yet subtle directors working today. Since 1973, he has only made five feature films, all of which garnering critical acclaim, yet divided audience reception. They are love it or hate it films. Because of Malick's ambition to change the way we see films, and since his films mainly follow the style of a non-linear piece, they can be quite a patience tester and for some just completely not interesting. So this is a hard one to recommend. I say - if you think the films the mainstream public are exposed to are not on par with your expectations, if you like to dig for films that are seldomly seen and don't get their own spotlight, or if just independent cinema fascinates you, The Tree of Life should be at the very top of your must see list.Because of the film's non-linear narrative, explaining the plot isn't an easy thing to do. The story is set in the 1950's with Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain living a middle-class life. We then get many quiet narrations, a whole ten minute long scene of the planets being formed and the galaxy expanding. Strange, yet intriguing scenes of a dinosaurs showing some of the first examples of true sympathy, and then it's back to the family.The family is the O'Briens, and over time they are bringing up three boys. Brad Pitt plays Jack who is loud, strict, and the disciplinarian of the boys and his wife. His wife believes that Jack is too hard on the boys, but keeps quiet most of the time to avoid confrontation.Scenes of the family continue to get mixed in with different shots of the world, collective imagery, sometimes shots spanning a single object for several moments, and more. We get it all. Not only is this a roller-coaster of a film, but it's one that is so different, so amazing, and so mindblowing and exciting it's almost too much to take in. Even only clocking in at almost two and a half hours it feels twice as long as that - which isn't necessarily a bad thing.I imagine with repeated viewings one will notice more and more things quietly thrown in. Just by writing this, and contemplating the events of those two and a half hours, I remember a quote from the Book of Job at the beginning of the film. Brad Pitt plays "Jack O'Brien" whose initials represent "JOB." It would not surprise me if that mentioning of Job is only one of many more throughout the course of the film.The Tree of Life can only get better with repeated viewings mainly because you'll never see the same movie twice. You'll keep seeing different things and different messages meaning that maybe this is one of the few films that can never truly be "seen." While I'm not sure if this could take home "Best Picture," "Best Cinematography" is easily in the bag for The Tree of Life. I've never seen a film with cinematography as well done as this most likely because I've never seen a film quite like this. Special effects wizard Emmanuel Lubezki works with Malick to create effective and incomprehensible realism that will leave you speechless. Lubezki also worked with Malick on his last project The New World. Two totally different films - two totally different series of effects.We are told in the beginning of the film that there are two ways of the world; of nature and grace. I believe our two leads are supposed to represent those two forces with Brad Pitt as nature and Jessica Chastain with angelic grace.The Tree of Life doesn't act pretentious because of the fact it doesn't boast itself to be bigger than everything out there. I didn't recall one commercial or one late night talk show interview with anyone from this film. Because it's a treasure you should decide if you want to uncover. After being tied up for many years, Malick is pretty much saying "if you want me, come find me." From research, I've learned that elements of a film Malick wanted to make tentatively titled Q were incorporated in this. No one really knows what that would've been like, but I doubt that it would've been the cinematic achievement that is The Tree of Life.I haven't even scratched the surface of this film, but I'm stopping here because I feel I've already said a bit too much. This should be a film you find, watch, form an opinion about, and then go and read others thoughts on the film if you choose. You shouldn't base your views off of someone else's with any film, but I feel that if you read too many subjective remarks about The Tree of Life you'll either be persuaded the wrong way, or have ruined your whole outlook on an amazing film. Let the film take you by the hand and lead you through its world. That's what it did for me.Starring: Brad Pitt, Sean Penn, and Jessica Chastain. Directed by: Terrence Malick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was genuinely mesmerised by the scenes where the family interacted.I liked the pseudo National Geographic segment in the beginning, but if the goal was to show the grandeur of the universe and the journey to the present then it probably could have been improved upon. I also don't think the over amplified opera music that accompanied it was necessary.There are people who think about the centre of the universe, and then there are people who think they are the centre of the universe. It is more likely that people from the first category will enjoy this movie than those from the latter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The holistic perspective of "The tree of life" simplifies complexity of life to its very natural &amp; simple being. It made me clearly witness and experience that I am a part of an essential universal process which has a beginning, a life span and a definite end. I just figured that with acceptance and love for self and all, life can be simple, joyful and purposeful. It does with much clarity and in just two hours, what most academic or spiritual books are unable to do.Terrence Malick's truthful, simple and beautiful approach to the film made it an experience which might have a everlasting impact on my life.Kudos to Malick and the entire cast and crew of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I m 35 years old and have been going to the cinema quite regularly since I can remember. I ve never seen so many people leave a cinema before as I did last night during The Tree of Life. I found it to be extremely draining and the people I was with had very few positives to mention about the movie. I guess one man's (the director) interpretation of mankinds complex relationship with the universe and his capacity to feel and behave in various ways is not going to strike a chord with everyone. Some reviewers are using words like masterpiece and miracle to describe this film. I would have to side with those using words like pretentious, boring, pseudo intellectual, pointless and awful. The Tree of Life is 139 mins long yet it could have ended after 80 minutes, 100 minutes or gone on for another 3 hours ..... it would have made no difference. You can usually count on Cannes to select pretty special movies which will stand the test of time. I don t think people will be watching this in a year or talking about it in 10 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film seems like a desperate attempt to create a beautiful film that stands out from others, however the result is a substance-less and confused mish-mash of semi religious, semi romantic ideas about the world, life and some memories of the main character's childhood.You also get about 40 minutes worth of computer generated images of galaxies, dinosaurs, caves, Windows Vista screen savers and a few other things, all gently faded together and narrated by a softly spoken voice citing phrases such as "o brother" and the like... . One would guess it is trying to tell the story of creation, but who knows!The other half of the film is depiction of a young boy's childhood, again delivering very little value to the audience.To give credit to the film, if you are watching on a good HD screen, some of the cgi scenes are beautiful and there are probably about 2-3 meaningful sentences spoken through the film. Brad Pitt's role is played well, however is somewhat similar to his other casting in 50-60s.In summary, if there is a film that will leave your head scratching and makes you want to ask for your money back, this is it!</fullReview>

Now, I don't consider myself a stupid illiterate person and I can appreciate some really wacky stuff but this movie was really just artsy nonsense. A pretentious voice over tries to lure you into some intricate existential problem that is not elaborated on. This whole argument with God is such 1950's bullshit. Maybe this is an issue for the elderly or Americans but posing insipid questions about "why does God let bad stuff happen" is really not something that tickles any intellectual interest. This film is not of this time and it has no story to tell. It just has pretty pictures and a lot of self-indulgent arrogance. What a waste of an evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the ambition and scale of this movie it was completely disappointing. Because there simply is no story to hang it off and woefully poor characterisation. It's laboured pace didn't help. And what's more the mother in this movie is an insipid 'non' character constructed to portray 'grace' above the darker forces of nature. Brad Pitt as the headstrong dad does add a little life to the movie but otherwise the family it follows is interminably dull from start to finish. Sean Penn wanders around 'inbetween' worlds as the older central character as an adult in a black city suit, like a confused extra who has wandered in from an aftershave ad. And there is not enough dialogue or fire in the belly of this movie (no matter how many volcanoes it depicts erupting in slow-mo) to keep the viewer empathetic to its protagonists. Some may say I just didn't get it, but in fact I'm a big fan of avant garde movies, and this Hollywood effort just left me cold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like A River of Memory-Malick's story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the excellent trailer to Malick's newest movie, I knew I had to see this movie in theater on the big screen. The name "Terrance Malick" is a polarizing one; some people love his style of cinema and some are bored to tears with it. I fall in the former camp, though I do acknowledge some weaknesses in some of Malick's later films. that being said, this film for me is the one of most personal, most encompassing, and most touching film I've seen in my life.Just to give a quick summary: After a family receives news of a death in the family, the film goes into a detailed look at the childhood of the eldest brother and his memories of his parents, brothers, and surroundings. Yet that is not all, as Malick tells the stories of the eldest son, he also ties in the story of the universe and the journey of life itself.To date this is Malick's most ambitious film, attempting to deal with everything from the relationships in the family to the relationship between God and humanity and between life and death. Yet this is a deeply intimate film, making it seem almost autobiographical in its storytelling. It is very unlike most films released today: tapping deep into both religion and philosophy, it is more of a visual look at the musing of an artist on the most central questions of humanity, a depth not seen since the likes of Tarkovsky and Kubrick. For me I get the impression of sharing a steam of consciousness with Malick, each moment of the film a communal experience in that I can relate to on every level. What those children and the adults feel, I felt that as well in my life. Never in the theater before have I seen a director so keenly, deeply probed the emotional world of childhood, and I feel more people would appreciate it too if they too tap into their childhood memories as well.The photography of this film is unparalleled in anything I've seen in the last few decades: in the creation sequence alone, I held my breath, gazing in awe at the screen. Indeed the cinematography done by Emmanuel Lubezki is phenomenal yet subtle and economical. Though Brad Pitt and Sean Penn are the headliners, make no mistake: the stars of the movie are the children. The acting done by the child playing Sean Penn's younger self steals the show. Only in the directing itself do I have a few criticisms, particularly about the sudden cuts that jar against the lyrical, slow storytelling style that Malick employs as well as the very end of the film: I feel it should have ended at the hands in the light.This film is simply a must-see, especially on the big screen. You will not see many films of this caliber and ambition in the theater, and if you can over the slow, very quiet narrative voice-over and the more surreal images, you will find at its core a very emotional, personable story that will leave you pondering about this film for days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "The Thin Red Line" Malick used a section of Ives "The Unanswered Question". In "The Tree of Life". There was a piece that I also recognized from the Jeff Bridges film "Fearless". It may have been a Kronos Quartet piece but it was familiar and I knew it after seeing the movie. I cannot find the title of the work, it's used in one of the collages with the mother in "Tree of Life". Any advice would be greatly appreciated and thank you in advance.

		<fullReview>If this film was simply about the struggle between a father and son, it might have been great. Instead, it badly attempts to include themes of God and creation as if they were intrinsic to the story. While those themes, according to certain people, are more than relevant, this movie's treatment of them is beyond horrible. The incredible shots of nature merely mask the writer's failure to truly include what is suggested. The threadbare plot turns out to be an excuse to be moody and cinematic. The weepy end-before-the-beginning-sappy-taking-the-audience- for-granted-and-stupid opening scenes infuriate a genuinely appreciative viewer. Which son dies? How does it happen? At nineteen? For the next two hours we wonder if there is a story here or if it is a montage of Mr. Malick's dream shot list. It turns out to be the latter. I admired young Jack's performance. He made Pitt look like an amateur. Brad Pitt cannot act, he is unnatural, he is self-conscious, and is obviously 'acting'. Credit to the line, "Why should I be good when you're aren't," or something to that effect, ostensibly referring to God. Don't waste your time. Then again, certain people liked this. The tree of life? Potentially riveting. It's relevance in the film? Non-existent. You're crazy if you try to rationalize this.. If you have to make the audience stretch that much, you're full of yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>90 minutes of sublime film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tree of Life is a sensational 90 minute movie wrapped up, to my mind, in a highly flawed 150 minute art installation.It's the film Mallick clearly wants to become his legacy and I so wish he'd really pulled it off. Apparently the critics at Cannes were booing and laughing at its finale and to a point I can understand why. I'll bet they were enraptured through the middle section.Mallick's idea is to create a movie about a man in his 50's looking back on the inconsequence (but to him monumental importance) of his tiny, but in many ways typical, life set against the greatness of the universe, its creation and God's role in all this.So we open with an hour or so of Kubrick's classic 2001; a space Odyssey mashed up with the Best of David Attenburgh and a tiny little bit of Jurrasic Park thrown in. It's about the birth of the universe and the creation of man.For some this has been the most stunning (and it is stunning visually) opening to a film ever made. To others it's pretentious twaddle. I have to say I fell into the latter camp. It's way too long and self indulgent. Mallick describes it as a companion piece to the main movie. If you've read the Life of Pi it's structurally very reminiscent of the first 100 pages which is essentially an essay on the role of religion in life today before the boy and the Tiger set to sea in an unbelievably good yarn.Incedentally, the Tree of Life ends with a coda recalling the opening hour. Mercifully shorter; it doesn't grate as much.And so, we have a movie embedded in and drawn from, thematically at least, this "meaning of life" wrapper.And it's quite, quite beautiful; it very roughly follows the lives of a family in 1950's Texas. Middle class I suppose and pretty much the typical Western family. Dad's frustrated because he is not an overachiever and at times this has consequences. But really it's not that important because it's not a story as such.The man in his 50's who we meet in the "creation sequence", Sean Penn, is reminiscing on this time, at first dewy eyed but later more critically as he follows his childhood and adolescence that culminates in the death of one of his brothers (not a spoiler as it is revealed in the first frames).This is Malick's genius because in this he essentially wraps a universal childhood into 90 minutes of relatively sequential vignettes that absolutely draw the breath at times. As a baby plays with bubbles, as a group of kids are ecstatically sprayed (innocently ) with a cloud of DDT from a passing lorry, as brothers bicker, as Mum and dad stroke their children's' hair and read them bedtime stories.It's wonderful.And then the plot, I say plot but that's a very loose term because this is not a plotted narrative, develops as we see that the father is actually a pretty heavy handed patriarch. This section reveals the excellence of Brad Pitt who plays the father movingly and with sufficient restraint to avoid the part lapsing into caricature.The mother though (a spellbinding performance by Jessica Chastain) is the real heart and soul of the movie because it is her that recites what amounts to a love poem for its first 10 minutes or so; espousing her love of her beautiful sons and her love of god. The scene is set when she says "there are two ways through life, the way of Nature and the way of Grace" she implores her boys to follow the path of grace (of God) and she maintains an air of grace throughout.Her eldest son, Jack, later to appear as Penn is the main protagonist and also performs bewitchingly; a first movie for Hunter McCracken - it will most certainly not be his last.What makes this film so wonderful is the way that Malick (and his cinematographer Emannuel Lubezki - phenomenal) capture the universal truths of family life without it at any time feeling like cliché. I felt myself strongly empathising with young Jack, most powerfully as his adolescent rage boils up towards his father and the unfairness of adulthood. "Don't do what I do, do what I say." It's visceral.The Tree of Life is a central and recurring visual metaphor but is handled with subtlety and conviction.So, with a far shorter art indulgence section this film would have been a 9/10. With it, it's a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Beautiful (Looking) Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is only Terrence Malick's 5th movie in the past 38 years. His most recent films, The Thin Red Line and The New World have been less than perfect, with aimless, wandering narration and thin plots. But they always looked pretty. His new film, The Tree of Life, exceeds all of Malick's films in beauty and story. Although there are times when the movie verges on pretentiousness, Malick's script always keeps the human factor, with it's main focus on the life of a family in 1950's Texas.Brad Pitt stars as Mr. O'Brien, the father of three, and married to a beautiful woman. The main character is O'Brien's first born son, Jack. The film focuses on the family's hardships and traumatizing experiences between the father and his three sons. The film also briefly focuses on the grown up Jack, who ponders existential questions about his father and God. The first 30 minutes of the film then focus on nothing less than the creation of the universe before coming back to the family. Young Jack and his brothers deal with their overly stern father, who only seems to get worse as time goes by. But Malick does a great job of conveying that O'Brien is a good man; he obviously loves his children deeply, but he does not have the slightest idea how to raise them.Brad Pitt is wonderful; completely convincing as the complex, sometimes sympathetic and often hated father. He encompasses the cliché of the conservative, shell shocked fathers of the 50's, and adds a level of depth and believability that has never been done with such a character. But the ones who really shine through are the kids, especially newcomer Hunter McCracken as young Jack, the main character. He does not seem to be acting, but to be heightening all of his confused and angsty feelings into a story. Never has this reviewer seen child acting so convincing. Jessica Chastain is beautiful as the mother, but she is more of a figure of bliss and comfort than a character. Sean Penn plays the grown up Jack, but his parts are nearly edited out of the film, making his scenes slightly less emotionally involved than intended.Some viewers may be enraged by Malick's non linear storyline, and following the creation of the universe does drag on at times, but the images are absolutely some of the most beautiful things ever photographed. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is unequaled in its breathtaking beauty. Much like Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain (an underrated masterpiece), The Tree of Life raises thought provoking questions about death and God. Malick follows in Aronofsky's footsteps by using as little computer animation as possible, thus making the film much more real.The music composed by Alexandre Despalt is also quite amazing. It is melancholy, sad, and beautiful? much like the film. The opera music that plays over images of the universe is remarkable.The Tree of Life is a beautiful film. Although there are problems with clarity in the plot, and at times it can get pretentious, the film is hypnotizing in the way it presents itself. Never was there an uninteresting moment on screen, and that's what makes a great movie.www.thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-evaluated. The soundtrack's main theme is controversial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title has been announced with all the fuzz one might think of, and it gained a wide support at Cannes. Still, it is a deception for it assembles sketches and fine images in the context of a movie lacking any plot. It is not an original artistic provocation, since attempts of this kind are far from new in twentieth century's European movie productions. It is not a purely pictorial movie, for it presumes to tell a story and not provide only images and sensations. And it describes the most obvious relation of conflict involving every human being on earth: the relationship between a son and a father. Their interaction is represented in the form of a patchwork of images and rather vague emotions (the kitsch music is sometimes tiring), and of course the atmosphere of 1950's mid-West US is a fine pictorial guarantee, but at the end it is largely deceptive. I was shocked to hear the soundtrack's main title, the one you can hear also in the movie trailer. Can somebody explain why they decided to put the Israeli national anthem (hatikvah) as the main title?? Although formally original, the main title is directly and integrally taken from the national anthem of Israel (try to compare them: they're just the same). That is surely a beautiful anthem, but still I don't see the connection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start. Well to explain this very complex film, I'll just start by explaining the story. The story is about a man (Sean Penn) who is unsure of himself, his faith, his existence in this world. This set-up is so easily done that right away, just by the way Penn moves and looks, you already know the central plot. But this wonder of his character brings up two major stories of the film. In the beginning, you hear voices such as "why are we here" (that's not exactly what is said, but something very similar explaining why...) So around 30-45 minutes is really images, with voice overs that make you think. Some critics and people complain that this part of the film, which includes evolution and dinosaurs, and nature's beginning is not needed in the film, and doesn't connect with Jack's childhood (the other part of the film). I strongly disagree. I think ultimately, Jack is trying to wonder "why" about everything. And the beginning of time sums this up in more of a big- picture way. But nevertheless, this part of the film is amazing. The visuals are stunning, and because of this, I recommend seeing the movie IN theaters.So the next half of the film is about Jack's childhood from the 50's. This is where the performances of Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain shine. This part of the film explores the O'Brien family. It shows the three boys (Sean Penn's character as a child is the oldest of the bunch) adventuring around in Texas. And it shows the parenting of Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien, which also explains why Jack wonders "why" about everything. Brad Pitt plays the strict and stern father. Very old-fashioned. But this character is not a monster at all. He's a loving father, but tries to show his boys right from wrong, but doesn't quite know how to express it without being aggressive. Brad Pitt gives a fantastic performance, and probably his best in his career. Jessica Chastain plays the graceful, protective mother. She's equally as loving as the father. But here she is much more passive. Not a bad parent at all, but always remains calm. There's a scene in which Jack throws a rock into a garage of someone's garage, then when Mrs. O'Brien finds out, she tells him not to ever do it again, while if it was Mr. O'Brien who found out, he may just lash out on Jack. Then even Jack asks if she will tell his father what happened. But Jessica Chastain really does a terrific job here. She doesn't have too many lines at all. And this is a film not relied on screenplay that much, so really no one has a ton of lines, so that shows how little she speaks. But that shows the difference between her and her Brad Pitt, who is always first to parent and teach the children. But Jessica is mostly heard in soft-spoken voices. But its her body language that speaks in volumes. In a memorable scene, Mr. O'Brien just got done punishing one of the children after they asked him to be quiet while the family was having dinner. In that scene, you immediately see her grab one of the children to protect him. But after, when her and him are in the kitchen, you can just tell she's mad at him. Then she turns around and shoves her face into his face and tries to show him what he's doing to their children. She really doesn't say any words here, but just the way she moves is so graceful, and effortless.Well either way, this a really a thought-provoking film. After seeing it, you will be a little confused on how to feel. But for days to come, you'll constantly be thinking about every moment, and what everything means. This is a film that is certainly not for everyone though. Its not totally for the casual independent film junkie. Its for people that want to think. Who will enjoy the film's artsy visual flare, and also want to be challenged with deep-thought while watching this film. Even if you're not sure about seeing it, I think you should just try it. Its very beneficial to watch. And this is a beautiful film anyway. Bottom line: this is a film that will be discussed for years to come, and should be appreciated in the history of American cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the tree of life is not about narrative but feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leaving aside whether T. Malick has been too pretentious or not, I have to admit that I really enjoyed the film. But just to be clear: this is not a film about a narrative where your brain just have to swallow and process the images it's getting...this is a film that tries to show something and provoke a feeling. At least that is the point I've got and I really liked the topics the film talk about (nature, parenthood, changing society, the beauty but unfairness of life...). I didn't understand very well the plot...in fact I had to discuss with my boyfriend some important issues at the end (which brother was Sean Penn?-don't worry, I already know - or I think I know) but I left the theater completely moved: the music, the images, the voices. Mr Malick did the trick: he just used the excuse of life and death to have people going to see video art to commercial theaters. I understand some people didn't like it (my boyfriend didn't either) but I can't but to take my hat off to T. Malick for cheating us all. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste your time and money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having never written a review of a film before, this one compelled me to do so like no other has before. It is truly one of the worst films I have seen in my entire life.This film flicks quickly between some promising moments which suggest there may be at least a hint of a plot on its way to suddenly showing dinosaurs roaming about with little (or nothing) to do with the rest of the film.Yes, admittedly, there is probably a link between the two, but not an obvious one and you would have to use a lot of imagination and 'symbolism' and 'escapism' and all that jazz to derive some sort of concept from the images you are shown. That's all a bit too fruity and sensitive for my liking (and yes, I am female).The lack of obvious plot, direction and any sense of audience engagement is rivalled only by the half an hour (yes, half an hour) of images of bridges, trees, stones, chairs and ugly fish that we are made to endure, all set to rather irritating music.The likening to '2001: A Space Odyssey' is completely understandable. I didn't like that either. I don't care what Hal does with the pod bay doors.I would have joined the 14 other people in leaving the cinema during this film, had my seat not been in the centre of the aisle and my popcorn not yet finished...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic...failure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What really makes me angry about this film is that behind the preposterous, pretentious, tediously slow, shockingly simplistic muddle of philosophical clichés, there was actually a good story waiting to be told by a potentially great director. Those scenes with the kids for example (whose acting was particularly graceful and natural) were indeed nicely handled and gave you a little hint of how much better the film could have been if only director Terence Malick had been a little bit less full of himself. Instead he decided to cram it all with heavy, pretentious, superfluous, confusing and rather conventional voice over, plastered all over the soundtrack, preventing his audience from any emotional response to the film. All that was enhanced even more by the constant choral musical score (including requiem from Bach, Mozart, Gorecki, Respighi, Holst and God knows how many others) which gave the film the same monotone feel throughout. It's as if there was only one gear controlling the pace of this film. The parallel with Kubrick's 2001: A space Odyssey comes quite natural: in a way this film has the same ideals and touches most of the same grounds as Kubrick's classic and because of that, dare-I-say, falls into the exact same faults: the sketchy narrative, overblown abstractions and the slow pace. By while in Kubrick's' case, those "faults" were also counterbalanced by the gripping relationship between man and machine and a strong sense of wonder towards heaven and earth, in the case of Malick's Tree of Life, there's a certain pompousness which makes it really annoying. Also it is both too inaccessible and too obvious. Finally Malick's detached style makes it really hard for anyone to care: in my very humble view the film should have been much more focused on the central story. There was absolutely no need to show us the beginning of the Universe, nor the end of the dinosaurs age (incidentally, the dinosaurs looked better back in 1993 when Spielberg made Jurassic Park!). In fact, there was probably not even need for Sean Penn to be there at all: everything the film wanted to tell us was right there within the central story of the American family in the 50s. And there was definitely no need for that terribly smultzy and contrived final sequence which was supposed to show the end of the world and give us a vision of "heaven" but actually ended up looking more like some outtakes from the actual film's wrap party, with all the actors re-uniting again and congratulating each other on how good they all were. Or was it just Malick's own version of the finale of the TV series LOST? Everything in the film is heavily soaked in symbolism and religion. I read somewhere that Brad Pitt's character was supposed to symbolise the "Old Testament" and his wife was the "New Testament". I did noticed that the two of them were never shown talking to each other, and if they were it was always through a glass or from far away or even off-camera, preventing us from hearing their dialogue or to see them interacting with each other. But does all this stylish trickery and heavy subtext really make the film any better? Certainly not for me. In fact it is all too disappointingly literal and frustratingly patchy that in the end it just comes out as cold and distant. So much so that I just couldn't really care about anyone in this film? and for a film that's about life and love that is a terrible fault. All these attempts to elevate the small-scale, intimate family drama by inter-cutting cosmic sequences of the beginning of the universe in order to give a deeper meaning to the soul- searching of the characters are finally not enough to compensate for a lack of dramatic involvement and in the end, they just overwhelm the actual story. Even the beautiful cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (where everything seems to be filmed at magic hour) becomes self-indulgent, repetitive and tedious. There's only a certain amount of trees, waterfalls and shots of glinting sun flaring at the lens you can take. It's hard to believe that this is only Terence Malick's 5th feature film as a director since 1973. The Tree of Life has all his distinct signature trademarks (the beautifully photographed shots of nature, the use voice over and music and the themes of the film themselves), but are they just trademarks or is he actually making the same sort of film over and over again? Whatever the answer is, apparently all this was enough for the judges in Cannes, where it won the Palme d'or back in May 2011. People in Cannes said that Malick is not really a real film-maker but more of an "artist". But as somebody once said "to make art is to fail" and he clearly does fail with this film, mainly because he just tries too hard. If only he hadn't aimed so high, he would have certainly made a better film, but as it stand "The Tree of Life" is an epic failure?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The meaning of life is beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me fist say that this isn't a film for everyone. Some will hate it, some will like/love it. I happen to love this film for many reasons.I went to go see this film with a friend of mine at a small theater. The average age group from what I saw was probably 60 and up. We were probably the youngest out of the group, but it was nice because I didn't want to deal with anyone my age (i'm 22) acting all annoying and wanting a hit blockbuster.If you asked me what my favorite types of films are, this is one of them. Terrence Malick seems to be one of those very underrated directors not a lot of people know about and he has so many things I could relate to. When I tell about him to someone, most of the time, it's a "who is he" response. But i respect him for who he is, as a filmmaker and as a person who could care less of the fame.this is a film for anyone who is a thinker or loves artistic/abstract films. While it's very slow, it takes you on a journey through the meaning of life. Why we are here? What is our purpose? So many questions come to mind when you watch this. Every shot has a purpose, it has so much symbolism. The creation of the universe is probably one of the best visuals i have ever seen (which is one of the strong reasons I went to go see this because of the trailer). It's like your in a wonderful dream you don't want to wake out of.This reason I give this movie a 9 out of 10, because I feel like i'm still young and I still have a lot more to look forward to. I still have so many questions to have answered. The older group who were there to watch this film probably added a lot more emotion and feeling to the film. It makes me wonder the many things they have seen in life compared to what i've seen and it just blows my mind away thinking about it. I feel like 20 or so years down the road when I watch this film, i'll probably get the same feeling they had. If this review didn't make much sense, I apologize. I'm in a lost for words and I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tree of Life Completes Malick's Trilogy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as Los Highway, Mulholland Drive, and Inland Empire represent a thematic, non-linear trilogy for David Lynch, I think the precise same thing can be said of The Thin Red Line, The New World, and The Tree of Life.The Thin Red Line, at its core, questions the role of violence in nature and, more importantly, whether MEN (human beings) are the only life forms in the world that are inherently violent.The New World touches on similar themes but is careful to depict that not ALL men are inherently violent. In The Thin Red Line there is a very brief scene at the beginning where Jim Caviezel and some other American GI are AWOL and living amongst a tribe of peaceful aborigines on some Pacific island. But in the New World, the girl's entire tribe, aka "The Naturals," are inherently peaceful and indigenous people. The arrival of Sir Christopher Newport and John Smith and the founding of Jamestown re- introduced us to the "malignant" aspect of man's being. The dark half. The girl (Pocahontas), philosophically, represents complete purity, or, at any rate, as pure as a human being can get. The fact that she unwittingly betrayed her people by falling in love with Smith, thus spoiling their collective "purity," as well as her own, is depicted rather brilliantly in that film. After Smith deserts her, she hesitatingly agrees to marry John Rolfe a few years later. Her visit to Europe to visit the King and Queen resulted in her contracting some European disease that quickly killed her. The wholeness of the "corruption of purity" allegory is magnificently captured in The New World. Of course, 90% of people who see it just think it's an odd, slow- moving period piece about Pocahontas.The Tree of Life almost combines all the elements of the first two films. In The Thin Red Line, Malick went back to World War II. In the New World he went back to the 17th century. In The Tree of Life he combines the post-war 1950s along with the Big Bang and the creation of the galaxy (and the Jurassic period which is probably about midway between the two points). I think the thesis of The Tree of Life was that line muttered early in the film: the way of grace vs the way of nature. The sum total, in my opinion, is that in life, we are all influenced by BOTH of these factors. The rough and tumbling father (Brad Pitt) obviously represented "nature," and Jessica Chastain clearly represented "grace." As he does in all of his films, these characters are PURELY analogous. As the boys are growing up in Waco, Texas, we see that the fight between nature and grace runs about 50/50 in terms of influencing their upbringing and the construction of their value system. But it's not until the middle child dies that the concept of "love" is genuinely introduced. The adult version of Jack (Sean Penn) is clearly lost and passionless in modern society. He drifts through the day looking like a lost soul who was claimed by NEITHER nature nor grace. But the dream sequence in which his whole family was walking through the water toward that tree seems to me that the concept of love (beyond parental rearing, which is also common in animals) is what separates people from apes.Like any great auteur, Malick certainly doesn't attempt to clearly answer any of these questions. If anything, he's merely posing them. And in the end, I don't think there is a clear answer. We are sometimes violent and angry (as shown by young Jack) and sometimes we are loving and caring (as seen by adult Jack during his daydream sequence). Our upbringing, and our childhood influences, will go a long way to determining what kind of people we grow up to be. In and of itself there's probably nothing particularly earth-shattering about that knowledge, but Malick really goes all out to dissect the world (universe, too) and our place in it. He doesn't argue in favor of God's existence, nor does he argue against it. If anything, he probably just wants people to examine their own existence a little more closely and where they fit in into the vastness of space and time. If people do that, maybe they'll be able to put things into perspective a little better and stop worrying about 4G smart phones and iPads, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tree could use a chainsaw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tree of Life is awash with the visual virtuosity that Terrence Malick is noted for; too much of it. With his flying through the air with the greatest of ease camera acrobatics Malick decides to take the long way home in this search for the meaning of life that on more than one occasion has you going in circles. Jack O'Brien (Sean Penn) walks about his gleaming corporate skyscraper world in a funk. Corner office and the picture of success the emptiness and confusion of childhood haunt him as he relives the epic as well as the trivial moments of his past in an attempt to reconcile life and the relationships we have in it. The cold stern but loving father, the saintly mother, the younger brothers all sweep past with an almost mute-less grace which only memories can form as the story locks in on lengthy flashback, the memory of the death of one of the brothers the linchpin to the family dynamic.Malick's first two feature lengths Badlands and Days of Heaven were mighty contributions to American Films last golden era and are generally recognized as classics today. Malick then went on a a twenty year hiatus before he made the visually arresting but muddled The Thin Red Line followed by The New World and now Tree of Life both of which possess Line's poetic but rambling characteristics.Malick once again eschews dialog in favor of imagery to tell the bulk of his story and while he does it seductively it is as if a breeze keeps blowing us back to previous pages of the storybook which begins to get frustrating ninety minutes into this painstakingly slow and deliberate process examining the sweet mystery of youth and life. Malick has no active equal when it comes to form and it is in evidence countlessly as he (with the assistance of lensman Emmanuel Lubzeckski) composes, cuts and tracks masterfully scenes of great power, beauty and ambiguity but the clock is running and Malik's hand starts to pack on the weight. His observation of pre-teen youth at work discovering the world unfolds beautifully but his stream of consciousness style dawdles and confuses, subversively implying but for the most part obfuscating and layering without consequence. As the remote household head Brad Pitt is adequately 50s uptight father figure while Brandy Chastain as his wife a vision of beatific motherhood. Hunter McCracken gives an excellent turn as the conflicted younger Jack with a blend of surliness and sensitivity conveyed through expression and Malik's movable mise en scene.Tree of Life is filled with moments of striking emotional impact heightened by flowing imagery and ambiguous cross cutting that forces the viewer to concentrate more and dig deeper but with less than satisfying results. It has a very seductive quality but it hangs around far too long to address a question we still don't have an answer to looking good but wasting time.</fullReview>

The disjointed nature of the revealing of the tale left us making up a plot line between the children, their parents, their neighbors and all the people who ended walking on the beach at the end. That metaphor is indicative of the film in general "Hit me right here, son, come on, hit me right here. Come on, boy, hit me" At the end we were just disappointed that the raptors were not all raptured up at the end of time so that when all those people were on the beach, we could have had real fun seeing the raptors chasing them down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Malick Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, where to begin? Well, I've been a big fan of Terrence Malick for a while now, and I've been following this movie for around a year now (I know of others that have been following it longer). Though I was very excited about it, I tried to keep my enthusiasm contained. I didn't want to over-hype it, lest I be let down in a bad way. It was hard, hearing, as I did, the very positive reviews from critics, as well as the fact that it won the top prize at Cannes. When I finally plopped myself down in the theater seat, I was hoping for the best, but half-expecting the worst. Thankfully, the other half was right."The Tree of Life" is a masterpiece, even by Malick's standards. Less a traditional narrative than a free-form, stream of consciousness vignette of childhood scenes and nature shots, the film manages to capture in a way few films do the essence of childhood, of family. Jack (played as an adult by Sean Penn) reflects on his relationship with his difficult and disciplinarian father (Brad Pitt) and loving mother (Jessica Chastain). The two parents represent the film's primary theme: love versus selfishness ("grace" and "nature", as the film calls them, respectively). Over the course of the film, Jack struggles to reconcile their philosophies. The film builds up to a conclusion that's abstract and rife with religious overtones; some people may be put off by how the film ends, but to me, it seemed a logical and satisfying conclusion. The acting is solid throughout. Brad Pitt, in particular, was convincing and charismatic, giving a performance that deserves at least a nomination from the Academy, I believe. Jessica Chastain was absolutely luminous, and I look forward to her future career, since I believe this film will definitely open doors for her. Sean Penn wasn't in the film a whole lot, and had very little dialogue, but he performed his role admirably. The child actors were especially great ? none of them are professional actors, and yet, they were incredibly natural. One of the film's most controversial sequences is one near the beginning of the film; a reel-long look at the birth of the Universe and early life on Earth. The images are often breathtakingly beautiful, and the special effects, overseen by Douglas Trumbull, impressed me deeply ? this isn't just assembly-line CGI, but real art. I found the whole sequences transfixing, but apparently some people struggled through it.The cinematography, by Emmanuel Lubezki, is glorious. Malick's always had a keen eye for beautiful and striking imagery, but I think he may well have outdone himself this time. Even if the film had no other positive attributes, it would still be a beautiful film to look at. Alexandre Desplat wrote the score, but most of the soundtrack consists of classical pieces.Now, it goes without saying that this film isn't for everyone. That goes for a lot of movies, but it especially applies to art films like the ones Malick makes. If:a.) You are a cynic who doesn't like "sentimental rubbish" b.) Spiritual undercurrents offend you c.) You a uncomfortable with films that experiment with the rules of film storytelling d.) You distrust films that aspire to be more than a cheap way to kill two hours e.) You have a short attention span?I'd recommend you spend your time elsewhere. But to those who are receptive and sensitive to it, this film is a real treat, a feast for the senses, for the mind, and for the heart, an experience the likes of which only come along once in a blue moon. Malick may well have given us his magnum opus with this one. It's a film that'll stick in your brain for some time and give you something to think about. Savor it. I know I did. And I will for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is all about fragments and incoherence. It is most suited to be an independent movie directed by a teenager who is still searching to find a footings in life. There were hardly any dialogues, and the combined dialogues of all the actors could be compiled into a two page A-4 paper with Times Roman 12 font. The movie began with some promise, then it digressed to a pre-historic Jurassic era, came back to modern era, and finally traveled to a pseudo-reality. Overall, the movie is all about traveling. It is a product of some erratic minds who are really confused about what life is and how best to see it.Initially one might be confused whether the movie strives to promote Catholicism, then one might wonder whether the movie is a prolonged recursive trailer of itself! Overall, I am saddened by a movie which is so worthless that it destroys the enthusiasm of going to the theater to watch movies of these genre.Truly a dismal work of some pathetic minds who are better suited to a mental asylum than to the film industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, it's easy to understand why this film gets such extreme reactions. You either love it to no end or hate it. It's seemingly either haunting or boring. It would be easy to say that smart people like this and dumb people don't, but that's not true.It has to do with attention span, willingness to accept difference and change, and an interest in life and the universe itself. If you're not into those things, this film will probably do little for you.But don't be fooled - it's not all artsy pretense and poetry. "The Tree Of Life" has the biggest explosions in cinema history (The Big Bang). It's also got dinosaurs, sharks, volcanoes and asteroids. It's the ultimate disaster movie in some respects.It's got pregnant chicks and clowns, burn-victims and drowning kids. Feral dogs and planets forming. Who could really ask for more?So perhaps the reason this movie gets such extreme reactions is because, well, this movie is extreme. In every sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tree of Life and its Philosophy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's true what people are saying: the Tree of Life is unlike almost any other movie that you will have ever seen. Its fragmentary structure, whispered philosophical reflections, and relentlessly stunning cinematography will leave some confused and disappointed at the ambition of the film, while other viewers will be moved by the movie's poignancy and the questions that it asks about living. These questions are not new as the epigraph from the Book of Job that begins the film signals. The movie is an extended meditation on Job and the fundamental question that he asks, why are the evil rewarded and the good punished? God's answer (and the epigraph), "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth... when the morning stars sang together?" reveals the problem for those seeking meaning in a seemingly chaotic and capricious universe: God's will is inscrutable. Humans cannot hope to fathom God's meaning since our frame of reference, our time in material existence, is so small and so short. God, who has walked the depths and "entered into the springs of the sea" surpasses and eludes with his vastness of knowledge and understanding. The now well-known sequences of cosmic creation in the film give a glimpse to movie-theater bound humans of the immensity of time, creation and destruction, and insight into the recurring patterns of nature and life (the flowing tap and the overflowing waterfall, the cellular creations that seem galaxy like, the increasingly notorious scene of the dinosaur dying by the river demonstrating the priority and regeneration of the species over the failing individual etc).The Tree of Life probes this question of meaning, Job's plaint of why some are rewarded while others destroyed, through a tragedy shown early in the film. The tragedy, like many other aspects of the film, is paralleled and given (in)significance by immense perspective. In this case, the destruction of the dinosaurs by the collision of an asteroid with the earth. How can we ponder God's will about the taking of a single life, when most life on earth was annihilated millennia ago in a single, catastrophic event? But Malick tries, and he uses the exploration of a boyhood in Waco Texas, remembered by an older Jack (played by Sean Pean), to think about God and living in the face of God's inscrutable will. Two ways through life exist, we are told: the way of nature (struggle, relentless will, domination) and the way of grace (acceptance, compassion and love). Jack's father and mother represent this polarity. Brad Pitt's "father" figure (and he can only be called "father" by his children, not "dad") is a man of the world, seeking to rise up through his own creation (patents and intellectual property), networking, and control (most obviously the control over his own family and their behaviors). Jessica Chastain on the other hand, is more unconditionally loving and celebrates the beauty of nature around her. The story of the war between humans and nature (the tying of the frog to the rocket) and human rebelliousness against God (Jack's rebelliousness against the authority of his "father"?) are played out in the narration of the boyhood and a number of arresting images that reminded this viewer of jumbled childhood memories. The underlying meaning of this section seems to be about the coming to knowledge through experience. The most obvious metaphor is the tree planted by the family in honor of Jack. Jack's watches his parents through his childhood, learning from their behaviors, seeking an understanding of how to live in the world. His own childhood is partly Edenic yet the threat of violence from the "worldly" father always impinges on the dreamy idyll that middle-class childhood is often portrayed. His own passage to the things of the world comes in a moment of transgression when he falls from innocence and commits a crime that produces guilt, shame, and fear. Yet it is the eventual realization of the father when faced with the capriciousness of the world that true meaning comes in family, love and community that is Malick's answer to Job's question. If we cannot understand the will of God yet we can understand God's act of creation. Meaning in life is found not through pretension to understand God's will ? for who really can ? but in the continuation of the species and the celebration of life, in procreation, play, in the love of one's partner and children (Jack is only able to pass a crucial boundary after an act of forgiveness). The movie seems to suggest that these are our own acts of creation and when united with faith, they give meaning to living. The older Jack, who admits that he has more of his father in him, finds himself an aged, unhappy adult. His condition is represented by a job similar to his father's and related to technology, design and the mastery of nature, and a seemingly unfulfilled marriage.If the figure of his father stands over the film and the growing character of Jack, his mother is set as his opposite. In many ways this dichotomy is conventional, but seems to contain subtle criticisms of her passivity to her husband's occasional violence as a stereotypical 50s wife.Tree of Life is not an easy film, nor is it one that any viewer should enter into unwarned. It contains some of the most beautiful moments of any film that I have ever seen (for example, the image of the creation with Zbigniew Preisner's "Lacrimosa" on background) alongside some cringe-worthy images. People who have complained about its pretension and its absence of "answers" may wish to reflect on the film further. This is a provocative film that you will probably either love or hate: it is a moving film for good or for bad.</fullReview>

It deals so much of what real people go thru Peer pressure and the rebellious stage in life young jack in his teens. If your expecting an full on story you will not find it because I feel the film tries to get people to look within themselves and use their imagination to figure what life is about and not letting it pass you by. It gets everyone thinking and some people nowadays can't handle that. reason to why there are mixed reviews.

		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's "The Tree of Life" is a beautifully shot film.Shot on 35mm film it renders the universe in ways that still (I think) defies the capabilities of digital camera technology.The film begins with the loss of a child (the news of which is delivered by letter). We don't know how he died but presumably in a war somewhere. A grieving mother asks God to give him back. God does so by creating the universe from scratch. We witness the evolution of life from it's inception in violent physical forces, through various forms: microbial to jellyfish to dinosaurs to a mother in the 1950s giving birth, and the ensuing childhood of that new life.In effect the child has been given back.But it's not necessarily a different story. Presumably he will be taken again. It's the facts of life. The forces of nature. But there is a difference. All the actors in the film have gathered on a beach. They appear to be an audience for some sort of art installation on the beach. The mother is there with her child.The mother kneels down and says to God "I give you my child".The relationship between son and father mirrors, to an extent, the relationship between the mother and God. The father who giveth (eg. the father plays beautiful piano music) and the father who taketh away (eg. the father loses his temper). The son chooses not to kill his father (under the car) - something he could have done, but doesn't. He decides to love his father instead. When the mother gives her son to god she is making a similar decision, grace over nature. She powerfully converts "the father who taketh" into "the mother who giveth". She becomes the equal of God. Outside the film Sean Penn is not so gracious. Where Malick giveth, Penn taketh away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Tree of Life is a beautiful piece of cinema that is going to fascinate certain viewers and alienate others. The film attempts to look at life through the eyes of a small, rural Texas family. Many will connect to the images we glimpse of the family from the overbearing father to the careless kids causing mischief in the local neighborhood. The film has a lot to say but I have a feeling that many won't or can't listen. It is unique and unconventional to say the least.The film experiments with shots of the cosmos and life throughout the years on Earth. We hear the whispers of the family in their most intimate and vulnerable moments. We experience their fear, pain, anger and joy. The Tree of Life has the ability to connect to the audience. Religion filters through. Themes from the biblical figure Job are present for instance.Many will regard this film as incoherent, excessively artsy and pretentious. For those who are willing to think, the film is clear as crystal. For those with an appreciation, the film is visually stunning. For those with an open mind, the film has much to tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gorgeous lesson in the question of human existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To give much credence to plot, or a lack thereof, is to do a vast disservice to The Tree of Life. In fact, plot is irrelevant. Character is, in part, also irrelevant. The crux of the film is simply to impart the lesson that existence is small, simple, non-magical, inevitable, yet also worthy of real moments, and worthy of love. Beyond that, life is unanswerable, and to even deign to ask the question of "why are we here?" is a futile hurling as time and space move about us without regard and impact from ourselves. Two questions are asked which bring focus to the entire piece: "Why was he born?", with regard to Brad Pitt's seemingly harsh and dispassionate father character. The other, non question rather statement, is "The only thing to do is to love." There is no point in asking why, what for, how come, to what ends, from what beginning? We just are, suck it up and face that fact. We do have the capacity to love, to do good, or ill, and this is the only gift and point that we are given. This sums up Malick's lesson in humanity. Otherwise, to not love, well, you pass through your human experience in swift uselessness. I found this a beautiful exercise in the letting go of ego, and accepting the chaotic nature of life, the universe, and everything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film because of the good reviews on IMDb -- this was a mistake, I can't see why this film is so highly rated. The topic is ambitious: life the universe and everything. The implementation is simplistic -- life: lots of out-takes from natural history films; the universe: lots of planets and Hubble pictures (didn't Stanely Kubrik do this 30 years ago?); and everything: this centred around clichéd rites of passage sequences of 1 of 3 brothers, 1 of whom dies at the start (demonstrating the circle of life). This film is torture to watch -- I kept expecting it to end, but it went on and on. I think most of the audience felt the same as me -- tell tale signs: people leaving before the end; chuckling at the particularly silly bits; and a spontaneous round of applause when it finally ended (applauding the endurance of the audience -- not the quality of the film). I love arty films, but this is like a 16 year old's film studies project (with a huge budget). Perhaps the other reviewer saw a different film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I shouldn't be writing this, as words will fail me and my irritation at the level of simple- mindedness of this film will make me sound harsher than I'd like. Nonetheless, this movie is getting many very good reviews, so it's only fair that the other viewpoint be represented.Let's make a crap sandwich: 1)Good points: excellent photography and some wonderful national geographic shots going on for ages and ages somewhere in the middle of the film; also the editing is brilliant. Overall an incredible production - if only this was enough to make a good film.2)Bad points: more or less everything else, including the above mentioned national- geographic-style shots of stars, nebulae, various geological masterpieces... Hours of irrelevant imagery, not to mention a whole section dedicated to a Jurassic park extract (who knows how much the animation must have cost for those 5 minutes of spurious rambling)... presumably to lecture us about the life/death dichotomy, cruelty and beauty of nature, bladibla, as if we were all 3-year olds and had not faced the realities of the human condition ever before. Also, the story is weaker than British beer, but that was probably not the point, so fair enough. The choice of music, pompous as it is, is painfully inadequate. Pretentious, much as the rest of the movie.3)Another good point: brilliant acting, from all parties, absolutely flawless! The only truly enjoyable aspect of the movie, almost makes it worthwhile, almost!Frankly, I have no idea how something like this could win any prize anywhere, let alone Cannes. Maybe an Oscar, just because they must have spent a fortune on it, and that's usually what's rewarded, but not a European festival... but well, I'm not the expert.My main point is this: what were they trying to say and why? If the answer concerns some sort of new-age divinity drivel, fine, that's just really not my thing. If, on the other hand, the answer is that they were trying to say nothing, but just convey some beautiful natural imagery, well thank you, but there are many brilliant documentaries out there to do the job.Still, all the actors, old and young, were AMAZING! It breaks my heart to see Sean Penn in this role, but man... still the best!</fullReview>

Some of the scenes wherein the children interact with one another are wonderfully delicate and warm. Also, the music accompanying the images is fantastic.However, as many negative reviewers have written, I did not appreciate the film as a whole.I go to the movies once every two years, if that. I am not a big fan of cinema. Movies seem "too easy" for me. The writing is never as good as a novel. The music is often borrowed from previously-created works, and the images are often tampered with (i.e., the pure image of the camera has been manipulated with technological skill). I thought that this movie would be worth the money, but it was not.Even if I ignore the "National Geographic" sequences and focus on the live-action human story, I cannot say that the story was fundamentally satisfying.Who among has not experienced abuse, dysfunction, alcoholism, ennui, etc.? Are we not beyond these themes? I thought this guy was some kind of philosopher. Perhaps the cosmic backdrop is to suggest that "all of that crap matters not", but I felt otherwise.I watched the film and got the sense that the film-maker has not resolved some kind of fundamental internal conflict. Patricide? That seems very puerile. Why would a grown man (much less, a wealthy filmmaker) even want to conjure such an image.The family story just did not seem worthy of retelling.Highly intelligent people should acknowledge that their life story may not necessarily be all that interesting, even if that high IQ wants to trick you into believing otherwise.</fullReview>

It is one of those movies that is brilliant and its brilliance is directed towards the small portion of the audience who go through the effort of trying to understand it. ! - It is not a movie for the people that wanted to go on a Saturday night and see a good Brad Pitt movie - it's so much more than that...I'm still in the process of understanding the movie; it's the kind of thing that sticks to you for a couple of days - brain exercise. The most crucial element of this viewing, for me, was the fact that the movie is incomplete - and can only gain completeness if you combine it with your experiences as a child, your cognitive process and your development as an infant as shaped by your parents; the way you interacted with the ones you love and the way these experiences influenced the formation of your personality to the present day. It is indeed this fear of abstraction that made such a negative response of the audience towards the movie. Throughout all our lives we have been taught to see the logic behind everything and try to find consistency and coherence in all things. Thanks to visionaries like Kubrick, Malick, Lynch and few others, we manage to recapture the beauty of a raw idea and comprehend the movie on a much deeper level - at a level that influences our way of being.</fullReview>

I felt like we were watching Sean Penn's character's childhood memories, and who's childhood memories aren't disjointed and confusing (like this film)? Because I took it as that (childhood memories) I almost enjoyed the confusion. If anything, it was definitely beautiful confusion.My only two complaints... 1) ditch the National Geographic part at the beginning that seems to go on foreeeevvvveeeer, and 2) give the garden hose the proper credit it deserves.

		<fullReview>Whilst watching this film I couldn't help but be reminded of a 'film within a film' being Willem Dafoe's self absorbed mock monologue in 'Mr Bean's Holiday', which involved stylistic moody shots of him walking through corridors, pondering continuously upon the unresolved pains of his life. The cinema audience to that deliberately ridiculous movie were predictably bored and restless, as it contained within it no movement, no suspense, rather an ongoing 'moment in time' which the director tried to make as undeniably cool as possible. The implication of the movie was 'everything I do is so fascinating, I can just walk through a corridor and people will be glued to the screen'. The divergence between that implication, and the reality (that the movie was boring as hell) was the source of the comedy.I have only seen the New World and the Thin Red Line. I loved the New World. I loved the way Malick invited you in to the living breathing story, the setting and the characters. As the camera caressed the face of Pocahontas you really started to adore her, and were captivated by her story.I think Malick was aiming for the same effect with Chastain's Mrs O'Brien. The ethereal face, the wistful far away looks, wind blowing over hair, grass, flowers, anything that blows really - wouldn't we love that film just as much as we did the New World?? No! It's as though Malick has determined that his tools are so wonderful that all he needs to do is display them and it will be enough, there's no actual need to 'write a screenplay' or 'direct a MOVIE'. Perhaps 'cool' is kind of like comedy - style and a sense of class is most apparent when it comes off as a by product of something greater. But that is what Malick is going for here. Perhaps the real statement of this film is the product of his experiment upon audiences, a cinematic version of the 'Emperor's New Clothes' phenomenon. To see just how many will say it is magnificent, without seeing that in essence, the reach has exceeded the grasp, the real 'transcendent' quality of this picture is that the director's desire to make a universal complete beautiful film has 'transcended' any of it's actual subject matter.I think the subject of this film is film itself - it's capacity to be beautiful and misleading, suggesting content when really there is none. Isn't that a deeper interpretation than that it hits on the essence of the universe?I confess I found myself enjoying the middle act. The actors were good. Dialogue was unimportant and frankly unnecessary. It was enough to watch them going about their lives. It wasn't gripping by any means, but it was interesting and involving.But the rest was only involving if you really wanted to be involved, or really wanted to pretend to be involved, or had never seen a real movie in your life. It was not a movie, let's establish that. Malick has abandoned the art form of film making in this 'piece'. Rather it is an artistic example of how the apparatus of cinema can be employed to create a product that in its essence bears no resemblance to film save in it's most superficial aspects. It is nothing like 2001 A Space Odyssey - that was a gripping movie, even though it moved slow. This doesn't move AT ALL. I lost interest in spite of myself (I came in expecting to enjoy the movie, whatever it might be) when after first 5 or 10 minutes we were left with the death of a son. The dialogue was simply 'my son is dead', 'I have lost my son', or something similar. And that was it. So the plot essentially is this:-1 There is a family that enjoys moving about together at the front of their house in the wind, the mother has a pretty face we see very close and she is always looking at something far away, pondering things deep and magical;2 One of the sons die, and both parents grieve in different ways;3 The parents think about how their son is dead4 The older son remembers what life was like when the son was alive5 Everyone meets on a beach At point 3 I thought 'what else can happen in this movie?' And that was the most interesting question. Nothing else happened, I knew nothing would happen, except that there would be some realisation. I guess that was what happened on the beach.And then there were the flowers...I suppose it all really came down to the flowers...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just doesn't hit the target!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is a film with genuine and sincere intent, and one that also has some quite beautiful passages and fine acting, it falls so far short of the director's apparent intent that it could not possibly be judged a success. It comes across instead as rather empty and self-indulgent - how else can one explain the excessively long light shows and the almost comic half-told story of a rather odd looking dinosaur? More discipline and tighter editing could have improved this film enormously, and perhaps brought it closer to delivering the philosophical message the director was aiming for. While the depiction of small-town life was quite well done, I have seen it done just as well before, and I was not impressed by much of the cinematography - I actually thought it had a rather flat (more like video than film) look. I also found the story rather less moving than it should have been - it was just too stylised and, at times just plain odd, to be as moving as I would have liked it to be. Malick is a great director, but the critical acclaim for this film is reminiscent of The Emperor's New Clothes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sermon on the Problem of Evil meets Koyaanisqatsi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Koyaanisqatsi, a film that has no plot and no characters, yet is able to build tension and reach a climax through strong imagery and music alone.There are scenes in The Tree of Life which are pure Koyaanisqatsi, absolutely breathtaking. But any tension is voided by the rest of the film, which present the actual plot of The Tree of Life.The film gives us the well-acted (but rather banal) story of an abusive father, and the grueling effects he has on his wife and kids. Pitt and McCracken provide shining performances, but the remaining characters are ciphers.The reason for the underdeveloped characters, one quickly discovers, is that the plot is merely a parable, to enable a two hour sermon on the Problem of Evil. With the Book of Job as the point of departure, the film asks that age-old question: If God is omniscient, omni-benevolent and omnipotent, why is there suffering? Christians philosophers have attempted to answer this question for millennia without luck, and indeed, Malick doesn't provide any answer either, instead drifting off on what appears to be a "Isn't God's creation magnificent?" tangent.More importantly, while the question is doubtlessly interesting to Christians, it is quite frivolous to an atheist, for which the answer is quite simply that the premise is false, and that suffering exists simply as an artefact of chaos, with no higher power in the universe to stop it. If you belong to the latter category, you're in for a very, very long evening with Terrence Malick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Pictures with a minimal plot line garnish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying after I had seen this film and was leaving the cinema there was a mixture of Happy, Sad and bemused looking people around me. Some wondering what had just happened to them and if they had just been mugged for five pound and three hours of their lives and others thinking back over the amazing images and sounds that had just been neatly arranged for them. I fell into the first group I love films and can appreciate the fact that the cinematography in this one was nothing short of brilliant however this is not enough for me I need a story that will keep my mind busy for the duration wondering what would happen next. Tree of life however fall so far short this, the story is not complex it is just unexplained you can fallow it if you really want to but would be forgiven for getting lost in the Images that are presented to you. It would appear to try and answer the questions surrounding life itself but it is so wrapped up in its own self importance that it finishes answering nothing it set out to. My final thought on this is that people will say "you didn't like it cause you didn't get it" so please don't get me wrong I love the study of life and existence through religion and science this film is nether the sites you will see during it are amazing but they are not an insight into life the universe and every just a classic case of the emperor's new clothes. Life is amazing do not waste yours with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long winded coming of story with some dazzling visuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an existentialistic movie plain and simple. I thought it started out strong and for the first hour was compelling. Overall, the acting was excellent as was the set design. Of course, the cinematography was riveting and some of the best I've seen. However, I sincerely disliked the operatic score. It felt hackneyed and pretentious and the director seemed to use it as a crutch to evoke emotion.The coming of age story was tender yet realistic as well as nostalgic. It dragged on far too long though. Alas, in the end, I thought the director went to the well one too many times with the earth, sea, fire, and sky motif. Thus draining the movie of any momentum.While I appreciated some of the technical aspects of the film, the story line was thin at best and the characters were completely undeveloped. It's one of those movies you are probably going to either love or hate. For me, I was more in the middle. I just wish it was 30 minutes shorter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Art Installation More than a Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is indeed a work of art worth viewing, However, I think not in a cinema where most film goers' expectations tend to more coherent narratives. As a film, it has inchoate narrative potential, and as a creative work, it has as much if not greater potential - perhaps as an abbreviated video installation. I rank it a five because it strides both forms to some degree successfully, and yet ultimately unsuccessfully; I imagine it will leave most film aficionados and art video buffs somewhat dissatisfied.And yet that might be a limited view based on the current state of both disciplines. Such work has potential to transform cinema (if not video art); it is clearly ahead of its time in the sense that anticipates both what is cinema of the future, and what is a future cinema space - in other words, what experience movie goers may one day expect and accept in a communal viewing space, thus perhaps redefining that space.Viewing this film currently with a open mind can have great value as an exercise in discrimination. What would one do to make it a better movie, and a better video installation? Or does it stand on its own as a harbinger of where film is ultimately headed? Will it therefore be one day widely recognized as a genre defining masterpiece?</fullReview>

I am sure! I went watching this movie based on two major elements: rating of others, and great actors! I still think the acting was great! Well I am a fan of both Sean and Brad and the little acting that Sean had was good. I think this movie can be nominated for the shortest script (considering the length of the movie) after the Silent Movie Era. There was not much talking in the 2h29m of the movie. I enjoyed the graphics. The cinematography was great! If you have seen other movies by the same director, you'll know that he's really good at depicting the story through view and beautiful scenes. Whatever words can't describe, he shows us! really brilliant! The problem was that I couldn't figure out what the story was. I watched the movie in Taiwan, and I thought perhaps some parts of the movie have been cut out. So I rushed home to make sure about the length, but there was no problem with that. All I am saying here is that if you are teaching or taking some kind of Movie Literature class, or you like to sit and interpret a piece of poetry or art for hours, then this movie is for you! For the rest of you, I am afraid you'll be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overwrought piece of filth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely do I so vehemently dislike a film that I want my $9 back but Terence Malick, you have made a piece crap here. I'd say you were washed up and irrelevant but that implies that you were once more relevant and I'm not sure I want to imply that. This movie can be nice to look at but despite all the gushing adoration from viewers talking about how "deep" and "powerful" it is, this movie is vacant and pointless.It's as if Terence Malick has managed to completely ignore the last 20 years of cinema. But from the other reviews here I guess a lot of people think that some swirling lights, disjointed narrative, and mumbled voice-over qualify as meaning. I could pluck as much meaning out of spliced-together breakfast cereal commercials with a breathy narration of the ingredient lists.Add to this the fact that the whole thing is so painfully forced and overwrought and you have what to me plays like a series of C+ film school projects slapped together in no particular order. So a caricature family drama with some psychedelic visuals and vague biblical references counts as brilliant movie making these days? I'm not surprised. The 'intellectual' side of the film-going public is probably so starved for anything meaningful that this feels like a cornucopia of spiritual truths but anything truly insightful here is likely to be an accident of the editing.And the music might as well have been two hours of Carmina Burana on a loop. Alright we get the point! There's dramatic stuff going on... But Sean Penn walking over rocks doesn't mean anything in this film no matter how poignant a climax the music attempts to make. The choral requiem was so over the top I was practically nauseous."Oh finally an American film that is 'experimental' and 'truly artistic'...!" Gag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two separate films do not create an effective whole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I put off seeing The Tree of Life for a few days because I was intimidated by it. Would I be one of the people to 'get' it? Could I see through the metaphors and metaphysical dialogue and truly experience the film? Now after seeing it, I feel a sense of incongruity. The first half hour of the film is a joy and a challenge. Through time shifts and very selective shots, the audience witnesses the birth of the universe, the formation of the Earth, dinosaurs, all the way to the 1950s and the family of Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, and their three sons. Here is where the film loses its sense of wonder. The domestic household scenes are mostly unpleasant to watch because Brad Pitt's paternal role is overbearing and employs a harsh discipline system compared to his more amiable and understanding wife.One of the sons grows up to be Sean Penn who spends the vast majority of his scenes in deep thought about the past, specifically back to this pre-teen childhood. If these moments from the '50s are his particular memories, then perhaps that is why most of the home scenes are distasteful, because we remember the bad times more clearly than the good times. I don't know if there is anything in the film which more perceptive movie goers will 'get' more than others, but the glaring separation between the childhood sequences and every other shot in the film doesn't work.Roger Ebert wrote that The Tree of Life is a prayer for life and a hymn to the universe. Parts of it are and do so very powerfully during its evolutionary sequences and at various times during the '50s scenes with beautiful classical music playing over sights of rare domestic tranquility. However, the tension between the father and his sons and their childhood games and pranks disrupt the harmony of the Tree of Life and makes it more of a nuisance than a challenge trying to connect Terrance Malick's dots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An impressionistic sensorial ode to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was certainly Malick's epic ode to the age old dissension of grace vs. nature. The historicity of our humanistic experiences projected through the trajectory of one mans personal crisis resulted in what seemed like a random pastiche of impressionistic sensorial memories capturing the very fleeting nature of his personal nostalgia, crisis of faith &amp; loss of identity. I found Malick's choices very interesting, almost like a visual symphony flowing like a river into the recesses of Jake's memories, into his desperation he felt for his mothers loss &amp; searching to understand everything about the deep emotions of life he shared with his family &amp; his confounding loneliness he felt at that point in his life with the infinite. Very original in his personal style, very emotive. I can see why in an attempt to answer such grandiose meanings can often confound the literalist in me but nonetheless, I was touched by his poetry despite at times being challenged by the fleetingness of it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film I've Seen In Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rather than offer a standard form review of auteur/poet/man-of-mystery Terrence Malick's fifth feature film, the Palme d'Or-winning The Tree of Life, I figured I'd offer some stray thoughts on the movie. This because Malick's film pays no mind to any definable variation of standard form in the realm of filmmaking or storytelling as a whole. The film is big and wide open, poking the brain to think and remember, question and ponder in ways it often skirts around - the hard memories of youth. That, and the meaning of the universe and our existence. Thoughts No. 1: I can't imagine how a theater full of females or non-Americans - or even African Americans - will respond to Tree; but, for me (a young white male raised by a protective mother and a no **** hard-as-nails father, circumstances similar to what we see on the screen), the movie was as poignant as any I've seen - ever. Malick somehow remembers the most profound seconds of his youth - a collection of single moments that made him the man he is today. He uses his memory of those moments to create a story about a Waco, Texas family going through some serious growing pains. Dad is nature and mom is nurture, or, in Malick's case, Mom is grace. The family's three young boys (led by the eldest, Jack), struggle to find the balance between the two often opposing lessons their parents teach them. My words on your paper or computer screen can't begin to express the poignancy Malick puts into his poetic movie - into this family. Many moments in the film prompted me to remember childhood moments that I hadn't thought about since they happened 20 or more years ago. Those moments of discovery - and the painful process of trying to figure out day- to-day life as a member of an intellectual society - deepen Malick's movie, which is basically an open-ended questioning of our existence. Poignancy defined. Thought No. 2: Supposedly there are people walking our Earth who booed The Tree of Life when it premiered at Cannes a few weeks ago. To those people, I say this: Iron Man 3 will probably be out before you know it; for now, you have Thor, The Green Lantern, Wal-Mart and "American Idol." Thought No. 3: I believe this film will go down as a deserved all-time classic, as well as one of the more cerebral and visually poetic movies ever made. I can't think of a better movie about youth and the adult act of pondering it all as we look back and figure out how we came to be the people we are. Malick brilliantly juxtaposes wide-eyed children discovering the small things in life against a perplexed adult looking back on simpler and better days - even if those "better days" were as complex as any he's seen as an adult. It's a moving and profound device that any movie-goer living a conscious existence should feel deeply, even if they came up under different circumstances than Malick's O'Brien family. Great movies leave you talking and thinking - usually about one big thing that happened, one topic. Something having to do with the human experience. This movie left me thinking about so many different things, and deeply. I could go on and on about the many details, visuals and style points that I just can't shake. But, chances are, you've not yet seen it. The movie is a an existential puzzle piece of a movie that frames up the broad topics of creation, existence and self-worth (and about 20 other things) in a challenging and abstract manner that will be interpreted differently by anyone lucky enough to feast their eyes. It's a not just a new classic, but the very rare piece of art that will be obsessed over and picked apart by thinkers for generations to come. If the intellectual depths of Terrence Malick's imagination were ever in question, Tree assures that they will never be again. The best movie I've seen at the theater in years. A new all-time masterpiece. Check out more of my music- and film-related writing at ZeCatalist.com.</fullReview>

Strange to say the least. The ending was super strange, well weird really describes it, and every time it seemed like it would finish, it switched to another equally weird scenes.

		<fullReview>"The Thin Red Line" is one of the films I watch at least once a year. I remember seeing "Days of Heaven" in a German 'art house' in the 80's and leaving in a state of introspection, a "mood". "The New World": it was tough to see Colin Farrell as "Captain John Smith", I kept seeing a tough Irish street punk instead of the pioneer/adventurer Smith....but like so many have said, Malick's worst is not even in the same league as most director's best. I took my 11 year old and my wife to a Sunday afternoon matinée in an old theater in Northern Italy to see "Tree of Life" realizing up front, that he wanted to see "Pirates of the Caribbean" and it was going to be a long 2 hours for him. I grew up in the unstructured streets, beaches and fields of America in the 40's, 50's &amp; 60's and hoped that maybe, the film would transmit things that conversation just doesn't have the words for. I told him later to let it settle, maybe something would register in time, when he asked me what it was about. Both my wife and son quoted some of the lines from the film in the days that followed (dubbed in atrocious Italian! shown on a washed out screen with a questionable projector) Well, yes, it was a 'religious' experience for me and now want to see it in English. Today, in late afternoon, played rough soccer with my son and a group of immigrants(Chad, Columbia, Morocco, Macedonia), an hour in an oasis of peace, I was a kid again, felt like I was out with "Jack's" brothers and the gang, looking for trouble...heaven. And no, I really can't explain what "Tree..." was about but just know it's about us.... and our why's and our wherefore's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the movie is religious. But if a bit of religiosity or spirituality is too much to endure for little more than two hours, replace God with whatever idea or principle you believe in and there you go!, you got yourself a film worth your time. The film has flaws, evidently. Some characters are not as developed as others, and you don't care necessarily about them. Ideas are often spit out during monologues, so the movie does little to disguise its message. And the cosmic scenes are not something you can't find on NASA website, but it's the way those are blend in with the other ideas and scenes in the film, that makes them special.If you don't believe what the movie believes, it's no problem, spoiler alert, we don't all have to believe the same things. But give Malick credit for being ambitious, and don't hate him for trying something Hollywood is afraid to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As enigmatic as Terrence Malick films usually are, The Tree of Life poses quite a problem for anyone trying to make sense out of it. It's arguable whether the film actually has a story, and there's very little spoken dialogue. But it takes a true auteur to make a great film without those necessary elements. Ladies and gentlemen, I present you with Terrence Malick, art- house provocateur and world-class director.The Tree of Life is, simply put, a masterpiece. It's pure art, a wonderfully ambitious mystery that runs just under two hours and a half. Malick has created cinema at its finest--it shocks, it causes awe, and it requires thought. While the entire cast's mostly silent performances are amazing, they're overshadowed by the visual poetry of Malick's creation.The creation of the universe is what this movie opens with, and its destruction is its finale. Immediately, the viewer knows what he's getting into. Reviewers have called this the "most ambitious film since 2001: A Space Odyssey," and they're totally right in saying that. It's a literal journey of a movie, one that stretches from prehistoric times to the future, but one that focuses primarily on a family living in the 1950s in Texas. The father is Brad Pitt. He's stern and believes that the matriarch, played by Jessica Chastain, is naive for fostering a relationship with the world that allows for innocence. Their three children age with them, only to learn life's true lessons.Most of the feeling of wonderment from in The Tree of Life arises from the fact that it is gorgeous. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who has worked with Malick previously on The New World, brings his visual prowess to the movie by putting so much care into every shot. The composition and camera angle of every single shot are not only beautiful but they're meaningful as well.And yet Malick's film is still cryptic. While Lubezki presents the viewer with colorful, almost sensuous shots of nature, Malick has chosen to keep the viewer interpreting. The creation sequence, easily the best part of the film, includes dinosaurs, hammerhead sharks, jellyfish, close-ups of mitosis, and cosmic nebulae over Mozart's "Lacrimosa." It's all beautiful, but why is it here? That's for you to mull over.The Tree of Life is an experience, not a movie. Movies present a story and portray a clear message to the viewer. Experiences are something more, and The Tree of Life is just this because it is something of a revelation. Riddled with biblical imagery, the movie's central themes are deeply religious and personal. The Tree of Life is cinematic heaven, a film that is so moving on a primordial level that it inspires fear and awe. There's simply nothing on earth like it.</fullReview>

For me it was the latter.Putting the evolution of life with a story of a married couple son dying, just didn't work. It was dragged out far too long. The only positive of the film was that the picture was very good and there were some interesting imagery, thus moving it up to 2 stars.Lucking I didn't pay for this film as I work in a cinema but if I was a paying customer I would of walked out after the first hour!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all this film is very unique and different so In a way I understand the views from both parties: those who hate it and those who love it. The positives of this film is the visual aspect of the film. Terrence Malick brings a sophistication to this film with style and visual effects. The images of the universe and it's growing state is amazing and pleasing to the eye. Also the acting was brilliant, from Brad Pitts part especially, and Jessica Chastain was brilliant as well. Even though they didn't have a lot of screen time their performances were imposing and heart felt. Sean Penn, however, has at least 10 minutes in the film which was disappointing. But the whole theme of Gods role in the universe and those big questions: why do bad things happen to good people? are interesting and dealt with care, meaning they do not attack God and criticise him. Terrence Malicks personal connection with the film is also to be appreciated and for that I do not slate this film for he felt it needed to be made and rightly so since it has performed well, especially to the critics delight. However, this film was much longer than it needed to be and at times you felt that it would have been the perfect time to end it....then there's another 10 minutes. I read in the August edition of 'TOTAL FILM' that the original run was 8 hours! How much more could they have filled this film with? This film is a reflective and thinking film, not a film for entertainment or just to pass the time. I understand why people love it because of it's message and feel but I understand why people hate it because it drags and has a non-linear narrative which isn't easy to follow or understand. I think the Oscars will be targeting the visual and art direction aspects and possible acting though. I cannot say I loved t but I can't say it's film of the year. Mixed response from me I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about the life of a couple plus their three young boys in a suburban environment.For a while, I thought the story was about how the dinosaurs evolved in millions of years to become Brad Pitt and Sean Penn. Then I found out the dinosaur scenes were unrelated to the plot. And then I could not work out what the plot was."The Tree of Life" may be beautifully shot and artistically composed, but it cannot hide the fact that it is a pointless collage of scenes. What the hell is the film about? Why does Sean Penn receive a higher credit than Jessica Chastain, when Sean Penn is only in the film for about ten minutes, while Jessica Chastain is in almost the whole film? And what exactly is Sean Penn's role in the story? Wait, what is the story exactly? I struggled so hard to stay awake, hoping that there would be some sense in the film finally. I was left disappointed as I still could not find any sense in the film, but I was thrilled that the film finally finished. For a film that has no story, stretching it to over two hours is quite an achievement.I am sure some people would hail this as the pinnacle of filmmaking, but I am not one of these people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The tree of life is like watching a 90 million dollar student film. Don't get me wrong it's stunning at points, particularly in the first half hour. After that initial burst you're left with dull, mostly silent, dreamlike scenes of mundane events in the life of a 50's family. If you're a baby boomer with a doctorate this movie will probably hit your sweet spot, if not zzzzzzzz.......Citizen Kane was a great work of film. Nuanced, subtle and timeless. The dialogue and the story working together to build something memorable.The tree of life has no plot, no real story. Lots of orchestral music over a family sitting around their living room or walking slowly on the beach. Like watching the dreams of a complete stranger.If you're a fan of movies that are mostly abstract that you can talk about using college words and feel smart. This is the film for you.If you like a plot, a narrative, characters with depth, or dialogue, save yourself $10 and wait until it's on Netflix.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Tree of Life was, for me, a dreadful film. Pompous, long winded and full of a pretentiousness that seems to have taken in almost the entire critical community. Talk about the King's New Clothes - Mallick is practically hypothermic in this - yet such is the reverence with which he is treated (Badlands, and The Thin Red Line were good enough films, but Fellini he ain't...look to the studio for all the pseudo art house hype),that it almost feels like you need to apologise if you don't want to join in. I didn't see truth here, or enquiry, or finesse, or challenge. This is a Director that Hollywood would have us see as some kind of Michelangelo...let loose on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel with a spray gun. My God, there are even CGI dinosaurs...and even THEY are doing 'symbolic' stuff. It just felt adolescent. No doubt Studio execs will all be booking their seats at the Academy Awards, the cinematography is tremendous and Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain handle themselves well enough, but for me - The Tree of Life was a big, flabby, overfunded mess. No wonder people were laughing as the credits rolled...Deeply disappointing...I'd been looking forward to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As many others have before, I'd like to point out that I actually am a fan of Malick's work. BADLANDS was captivating and THE THIN RED LINE had me on the edge of my seat. So, naturally I went to see THE TREE OF LIFE. The first ten minutes made me brace myself for a great movie. Beautiful cinematography, the portentous voice from the off, meaningful dialogues and great acting. But what happened then? I believe this happened: Malick found a chemistry set in the studio and accidentally dropped some of the bottles containing colourful liquids and all of a sudden ordered his cameraman to film the concoction being dispersed on the floor. Then he and the cameraman experimented with more fluids and thought it looked like the milky way or whatever. Then Malick said: "What a shame that these ink-blot like pictures don't fit the movie. Ah, nevermind, we'll work them in anyway!"And that's why I had to sit to twenty minutes with pictures of a Rorschach-Test gone awry. And when the dinosaurs showed up, I couldn't help chuckling. Dear Terrence, let me remind you: You are a director, not the messiah or the next Ron Hubbard. You know how to tell a story, but next time, please make sure you have a story. This was a load of I don't know what. When Malick finally, after seemingly endless twenty minutes, goes back to the Brad Pitt character and his family, you find yourself not giving a damn about them.After two hours I left the cinema, wondering what had made me stay till the end. Truth is I still don't know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, there's 2 1/2 hours of my life I'll never get back! But, it seemed a lot longer. I would gladly have left after 10 minutes, but my wife likes Brad Pitt and wanted to give it a chance. If they cut an hour, it might have been watchable - save all that self-indulgent nonsense for the blu- ray 'special' edition. Fortunately, I had my ipod with me, so was able to listen to a few podcasts. Although, the excessively loud music at times made it difficult to hear that. I go to the cinema most weeks and will see anything, but I consider this to be the worst film I've ever had the misfortune to sit through. Some nice imagery every now and then, but pointless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film puts the breathing back into the film dictionary. The visuals are superb, the cinematography is innovative and fresh while flowing with ease. The acting is just what scripts strive to be; heavy on visuals imagery and only poignant dialogue. Very, very ahead of its time just as all of Malick's other films were and will continue to be remembered as such. Light, Time and Space are all put under the lens of Life as the overarching theme that connects us all. I thought the CG work was used when appropriate and fitted very well into the mood and tone of the darker scenes.Truly fascinating. A treat to watch. Take anyone with you who you love to watch movies with and you all will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring delivery, overtly religious, bizarre editing. A mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Malick film ? in production for several years, leaving Malick fans desperate for information for just as long ? finally gets its release, six years after The New World. Allegedly working from a script that Malick first drew up a few decades ago it sounded very grand altogether, the most ambitious and explicitly existential of anything he's done so far. I think many waited in delight and confidence that Malick could pull off another cinematic masterpiece, maybe even his ultimate project. For a film maker who'd only made four features before this he had garnered a huge amount of critical and cult acclaim, not unwarranted. Days of Heaven is a cinematic masterstroke, a film so exquisite the plot is largely irrelevant. On the strength of his previous work I never feared that The Tree of Life could be a disaster. When it was subject to a hugely polarized reception at Cannes it was an indication that maybe not all was well; the films fans seemed to say nothing of import (either Malick sycophants or the waffly, pretentious bunch) and its detractors were fairly consistent in why they disliked it. That was a bad sign. The Tree of Life is a ridiculous splatter of simplistic and poorly executed drama. A painfully overreaching and shockingly unsatisfactory debacle.It's such a shame. The film manages to feature some majestic images ? some of the space imagery and much of the 1950s Americana environment ? but in trying to tie them together the films often visual beauty gets subsumed with a boring, self indulgent flop-around in sentimentality. What is most surprising about the failure of this film is that the editing is incredibly amateurish. Even for the films topic it is far too long and repetitive, but also it cuts-to-black on so many shots, which has a very jarring effect. I can only assume this was a conscious decision (a planned editing style) but it is totally wrong. Why Malick didn't realise this and take the whole film and spend more time editing it in a different way is beyond me. There is a bizarre amount of very brief scenes that seem to be just thrown in for the sake of it, as if the editor didn't want to spare them because they looked nice. The film's original score is unremarkable, but some of the other music featured is pleasant, like Henryk Gorecki's Symphony No. 3 II lento. The actors for the most part do a good job, except Pitt is fairly wooden and Penn probably shouldn't have bothered turning up, an unflattering gig for him. Chastain is lovely but has very little to do except look graceful and stay mute. The voice overs are stupid. McCracken is a good young actor and someone who probably has a decent future ahead of him.Now this is saying a lot: The best part of the film is a brief line near the start. The mother is being consoled by an undoubtedly Irish neighbour over the loss of one of her three sons; the neighbour is confirming to the mother that life goes on and says "Sure ya still have the other two". I had a great laugh, unlike the other cinema attendees. That's all I got from The Tree of Life in the end. Malick aimed very high, obviously even too high for him. A monumental let down. But I don't fear for Malick's future; if he takes on more subtle projects he can recapture his magic. He may do that with his next film, he may not. Regardless The Tree of Life is a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2011: A Malick Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No Terrence Malick film should be missed. Even when the narrative points are flimsy, his process is fascinating. He has an uncanny knack for capturing the feel of real life, of displaying the extraordinary within the ordinary. This film, about the childhood reminiscences of a middle-aged architect or engineer (I couldn't figure which) is by turns heart wrenchingly emotional and suspenseful as it captures a myriad of moments in the development of a boy under the stern yet warm guidance of his father back in the 1950s. The only misfire here (and it's minor) is the casting of Sean Penn as the grown up son of Brad Pitt. There is no resemblance whatsoever between them. The actors, especially the three boys who play the Penn character and his two brothers, are perfect miracles of well-directed child actors. Malick brilliantly captures the excitement, wildness, fear and awe of growing up as a boy in an average American neighborhood in the mid-20th century. He links this growth and nurturing process to the vast workings of the universe and the earth itself from the level of large creatures including dinosaurs to undersea life to the realm of micro-organisms. It's hard to pin down what it all means but you can't take your eyes off it. Its imagery, set to classical music, brings to mind Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey." Sometimes the underscoring drowns out the half-whispered bits of voice-over that one hopes are meant to clarify the characters' ideas or feelings. And sometimes the panoramic shots of galaxies or of Sean Penn wandering through wastelands in a business suit do pall, but not for too long. Kudos to Brad Pitt not only for a riveting performance (perhaps his best ever) but also for co- producing this exceptional work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of creative movies. I have immensely enjoyed all David Lynch, Kubrick, Fellini, lots of other directors' work that made heavy use of symbolism. But this movie, in spite of the symbolist premise, was incredibly bad. So bad that for the first time in ages, I walked out of the theater. I am only sad that I watched the first 90 minutes of the movie constantly hoping that it would get better.There is no plot. Nothing interesting happens in the movie at all. The characters don't capture you. It is an insensible sequence of boring scenes from a boring and most ordinary family in 1950's Texas. Also some stolen scenes from Planet Earth are squeezed here and there, with no meaningful voice over though. One minute you're watching home made movies showing boring family life, next minute you're in Jurassic Park. There is also a freakish religious subplot that keeps appearing. I think the movie thrives to bring in an over-arching theme of losing innocence, the purpose of life or something like that. It miserably fails to do so though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most useless films I have ever seen.We are told that one of the kids has died even before we get to know the members of the family. The consequence is that we don't give a damn about his death (which of the kids dies, by the way, and how?).Immediately after that we see a sort of Discovery Channel 45 minutes' documentary. Unfortunately the documentary is also a bad imitation of Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey". Please, we have had enough of NASA images with classical music soundtrack! When Kubrick did it, it was something new, astounding, full of genius...but now it is simply a copy.The only interesting part of the story, the one which would have deserved a deeper development, is the relationship between the eldest son and his hideous father. Here a good film could have been made, but the director is simply more interested in dinosaurs or New-Age/Coelho-style pseudo-philosophy.Just save your money, or spend it on renting a Kubrick "2001" DVD.</fullReview>

I project the over / under ultimately settles out at 4. Be warned I am not the alone in this assessment. Several others have walked out of the movie. When one who stayed for the entire film was confronted with such bad judgment, his explanation was that he "fell asleep!" The best way I could describe this movie would be to compare it to the piece that the crazy director made on "Entourage" a few years back that focused on the Columbian drug wars.

		<fullReview>This movie is an important contribution to a new age of film making. Time will show if it was just a single effort or if there will be other filmmakers to join in the revolution - if they can. It's the first film that is able to touch the soul of viewers without a conventional storyline or without even been understood properly - like abstract ideas of "God" or "Beauty" that we don't understand but are touched if we experience it. Mr Malick created a movie that mixed together visuals and music without a real storyline or dialog and still tell us his view about the meaning of life. It's a movie that touches our senses, our emotions, our mind and our soul and it keeps on living in us (like the recurrent light in the movie) long after the movie has ended. It's importance grows every day. I want to watch it again and again it's like an addiction. There are few thing in life that can do that trick, maybe love and art.

		<fullReview>Discussion bout a film is always good. Terrence Malick has a good reputation and expectations where high. Technically beautiful movie, with national geographic material, but...as for a story or message i think it failed his goal. It is supposed (i think) to be a tribute to life a it is with all its beauty and pain, and a rational being against the forces of nature. however if someone can explain to me what the purpose is of picture of the dinosaur ( OK nature has no pity, and you don't look for a reason why in his behavior) and a scene where living and dead meet, the story or message tends to go pathetic. Maybe OK for religious and spiritual America but "i give you my child" and "lets all try to do good" and we'll meet again, was a bridge to far for me. The whole movies tries to be a spiritual experience with choir music and ghost voices. To many times i had the feeling "o please don't go there". Courageous OK, But sorry, sometimes you have to have to guts to say: "sorry this is not what a call a good movie". The movie made me think of "prosperos books" (dont ask me why) which came to me as a delight, here it was more deception.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I went to this movie because of stellar blurbs and reviews, and because of the cast. Pitt does act and creditably but apart from that its almost all cardboard responses and facial expressions lovingly overdone by the camera. As to the storyline - was their one? Actually, there was but it is so predictable and slammed home within an inch of the viewer's ability to stand the obvious that only one thing - the only remaining question of the movie, and quite and important one - remained unresolved. Otherwise, you are certain to have the same emotional deeds worked, reworked, hashed and rehashed until you really wonder if you've fallen asleep and (hopefully) dreamed it all. The sole redeeming feature is the cinematography - and one suspects that is the real reason the movie was made, just to show that really good cinematography is possible (as if we were too silly to know that before seeing the film). One sequence drones on for what seemed like ten minutes repeating visuals from a David Attenborough documentary as if they were telling mind-blowing. My advice - never see this movie unless you are the sort of film snob who claims genius is being bored; or unless you wish to permanently cure a bad dose of insomnia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was by far the most confusing movie I've seen in a long time. There were parts of it that seemed totally disconnected from the rest, and some of the most important things were never explained. The movie contained more visual metaphors than it contained dialogue or plot, so in the end you might walk away from it feeling a little lost. From a visual standpoint, Tree of Life was beautiful. The special effects and art direction for the film were breathtaking -- in a sort of "Discovery: Life on Earth" kind of way. Unfortunately, the beauty of it is somewhat marred by the realization that it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the plot (if there even IS one). Ergo the visuals, despite their beauty, only serve to confuse the viewer. There were points in the film (especially toward the beginning) that I wondered if the employees had pointed me to the wrong theater. Although I found the imagery confusing and the story itself a bit lacking, I absolutely loved the acting. The film was brilliantly cast, and the single most disappointing part of (in my opinion) is that I didn't get to see more of them. Overall the movie was a confusing, disjointed, mess, and the only good part about it -- the acting -- was very scarce. In the end, you get a movie that's visually intriguing but still unsatisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is much in this film that is beautiful, but as a two-hour-plus experience, it's like watching a beautiful painting dry. I loved all of Malick's previous films and wanted to love this one, but it was one of the most boring, pretentious films I've ever seen. As it dragged on, I prayed ever more fervently that it would get better, but...Most of the first third of the film consists of random images, some lifted almost directly from "2001". Picture the Stargate sequence, only with no thematic context or introduction. This just drags on and on and on, with audible sighs of frustration from the small audience and several people walking out. I was begging Malick to make this end.The rest of the film is slightly more interesting, but Malick never connects the "real world" events effectively with the metaphysical junk that precedes them. When I read in the Trivia section that an Italian cinema mixed up the first two reels for a week and no one noticed, I had to laugh. There is no structure of any kind. This mad it impossible to relate to any of the characters, adding to the waste of time.Just awful - recommendation is to stay home and rent Badlands or Days of Heaven.</fullReview>

After a full hour and a half (yes, i was that committed), I gave up all hope and stomped right out of the theater. I therefore feel obligated as a citizen of the united states and a compassionate movie lover to warn everyone out there TO SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!!If you loved this film (and understood it).... well then you either want people to think you are smart or you should win Nobel prize for intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where are the good reviews coming from? - I usually agree with critics and like art movies, but not this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have ended at any time during the movie and it would have been the same to me. It is more of a portrait movie than one that tells a story. As a portrait movie it has two personalities, one shows a troubled childhood, the other the power of nature. As a nature movie it is a poor one, as you do not know where the editing and CGI come into play. Other than a couple of nice dinosaur sequences (yes, dinosaurs!), the rest has no value.The childhood story is the same as has been told in many other stories.The movie is very slow, switching from one personality to the other for seemingly endless periods.I am really puzzled that my view of this movie is so different than the critics and other viewers as I usually agree with the critics. My bet is that as more regular people see this movie its rating will go down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Main problem, it is so boring. Many people fell asleep, many left the Theatre. This is one of these pseudo artsy films that are supposed to win Oscars. Nice photography and a terrible movie. I don't want to waste much time commenting on this miserable film. It is not worth writing ten lines About Tree of life. The scenes drag on forever, the move does not flow well, is is just a collection of images. This movie needs major Work. The concept of showing the flow of life on earth is Done in such bombastic way that it is embarrassing. If you have spare ten bucks then spend it better in some other way than viewing this crap. Some people asked for their money back. They got none of course. Do not let yourself get shafted and do not ruin your evening. There are much better things to do with your time.</fullReview>

Or volcanic eruption and lava flow.....heaven, hell all over the place. As entertainment, it's an absolute stinker. Don't waste the money unless you are happen to be a religious zeolot looking for the meaning and relationship between the beginning of life and an absurdly over-aggressive father.

		<fullReview>This was the second worst film I have ever seen, beaten (just) by Wayne's World II.It was definitely a case of "If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bs" as the saying goes. It brought to mind a large canvas where members of a family, including the dog, all contributed splashes of colour in as haphazard as manner as possible ... and then tried to sell it as a valuable piece of modern art. We were not fooled! The acting was wooden, in particular the performance of Brad Pitt, while my favourite, Sean Penn, was seen more often from the rear than from the front. As my neighbour in the steadily emptying cinema remarked "At least they didn't have to learn any lines". Of dialogue, there was precious little. Emotions were clichéd and predictable. The young boys were fine and at least appeared natural, but seeing them throwing a ball around time after time, was a bit like watching old films taken in the back yard of one's father and uncles as kids. There were a few (slightly) redeeming features: the photography was great, especially the footage of volcanoes and the landscapes, although I must admit that I kept expecting David Attinborough to appear from behind a rock and provide a useful commentary. Strangely, considering I thought we were going to see a blockbuster with Brad and Sean, the best part was the dinosaurs, incongruous as their presence might have been. All in all, a shallow cop-out of a film that insulted the intelligence of viewers. I wish I had stayed home and watched, yet again, Planet Earth.</fullReview>

I do not like packages that tie up in bows at the end, so I did not find fault with this because it is an attempt at something unique or artful. It was awful because it did not translate. No one had any idea what the movie was trying to say. Isn't it seen by people not involved in it so there is a sense of confirming that the goal is being reached? Did no one understand that it does not view in a way that is clear or consistent with what the intention was?I went to see this because it had won at Cannes. I went with 3 highly intelligent people, and we ran into many other highly intelligent people who go to this particular theater to see things that are not in mainstream theaters. I was amazed no one walked out. When we left there was a consensus among all watching that they had no idea what they had seen, but all agreed they wished they had not.</fullReview>

Traditional dramatic structure and scene structure is abolished 2. Emotional Memory rules 3. Fragments are never resolved yet they become whole through their own 4. Dialogue becomes impressionistic and unimportant?again, fragmented 5. The tactile sensations are the key to the film and are conveyed with a heretofore unachieved power 6. Touch/Feel/Texture/Wet/Dry/Soft and so on? That what it's about: the memory of touch 7. The steady cam camera creates a hallucinogenic "pull of the tides" that takes you into the film and bathes you 8. No electronic media is present other than the LP record player 9. NO TELEVISION or RADIO?amazing! To ignore the arrival of these media is a significant choice?particularly in a world as seen through the eyes of a 7-10 year old. Where was Howdy Doody and Hoppalong Cassidy? Are they not universal? How come nobody has mentioned this? 10. That Jack kid was truly screwed up?a resentful little twisted sprig doomed to grow up into Sean Penn?and thank God, not a serial killer 11. Why did the middle kid have at times his head partly shaved in the back? 12. I could have done without the galaxies, the nebulae and the dinosaurs? but I'm glad Douglas Turnbull got a gig 13. I could have done without Sean Penn, futuristic Huston, glass curtains? 14. I could have done without the Fellini 8 ? cum Dolce Vita ending 15. I could have done without the "Persona" faces in the ending 16. It would be a masterpiece if it had been just the family 17. It should be called "Fractals" 18.

To some it does and is very profound, undoubtedly.While the film boasts stunning imagery of space, nature and the sea, the logical plot line is entirely missing.I would liken it to the vast majority of modern French films which seem to end when the camera ran out of film and are designed to be discussed at length over many a Gitane cigarette and glasses of cognac.I'd rather have a plot that I can understand.That being said, I felt that Malik's other work, the New World, which I would describe as a visual poem, was at the same time able to be understood with stunning imagery complimenting a profound plot centered around the inner human landscape.This film seems to have sacrificed plot in favor of ....a certain je ne sais quoi.</fullReview>

It provides absolutely NOTHING new either culturally, cinematically, or philosophically.I'm an ecologist and also an atheist, so generally I enjoy films that explore human life in the context of cosmology and evolution. But I couldn't help thinking that this film was either an attack on, or a warning against those of us who choose to believe in a purely rational meaning of life. Was it trying to demonstrate that only those who are faithful to god will find happiness?Sitting through this film felt like being preached at for 2.5 hours. If it wasn't Christian preaching I can still say that this film was mock-intellectual trash. Nothing is worse than whispered voice-overs that attempt to be deeply philosophical but really only serve to drown the film in its own melodramatically poetic slag.</fullReview>

Finally it showed a family with 3 boys growing up in 1950's Waco in a house I don't know how they could afford on a machinist's salary. So what? There's no conflict till near the end. Some of the visuals are OK, and they made sure the cars shown were from the 1950's, and no later inventions were shown. I nearly walked out several times, finally did after over 2 long hours.

		<shortDescription>Terrence Malick's most ambitious film, and one of his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wasn't until fairly recently, when I watched my first Malick film, which was The Thin Red Line, and since then I have watched this, Thin Red Line, The New World, Days of Heaven and Badlands. As films, I really like/love them all, and while I don't consider Malick a favourite of mine I do highly appreciate his style.I watched The Tree of Life with great anticipation and absolutely loved it. I can understand why people may find it ponderous and indulgent. I personally didn't think it is that indulgent, but while the pace is slow, I personally didn't find it boring having seen a lot of slow, deliberately paced movies. And I imagine The Tree of Life's slow meditative pace was also deliberate, and come to think having seen Thin Red Line and New World(both of which are meditative too) a characteristic of Terrence Malick.The best asset of The Tree of Life as is the case actually with Malick's movies are the visuals. From the scenery and photography, to the stunning "history of the universe" and Lacrimosa sequences, the visuals are astounding. The music is hypnotic and further adds to the haunting tone the film sometimes has. Malick's direction is superb as well being quite poetic.When there is dialogue, it provokes thought, while the metaphysical/ philosophical-in tone(hence what I mean by Tree of Life being Malick's most ambitious film to date, as well as his most personal) story is beautifully constructed and even long after the film was over haunted me a long while afterwards. The family and childhood sequences really hit me hard emotionally.The characters are compellingly real as well, particularly Hunter McCracken's, while the acting across the board is superb, as good as Brad Pitt, Sean Penn and Jessica Chastain(truly radiant she is) are, and they are, great even, Hunter McCracken was the one who impressed me most. All in all, one of Malick's best and one of the best so far of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not such a big deal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always think about films like this that they'd be great if their directors focused on what their films are really about. Forget the hokum about dinosaurs, the creation of the universe and cellular reproduction - this is a simple film about growing up in a rural Texas town (the majority of it was filmed in or near Austin, TX). It explores the experience of three children learning to cope with their emotionally abusive father (played excellently by Brad Pitt) and form identities for themselves. As a series of unapologetic snapshots, this film does very well and some of the shots are very honest. The performances from all actors involved are noteworthy, and reason enough to watch the film.The problem is, this film had to go and bite off more than it could chew. Terrence, you're just not making much of a statement here. Magical realism is nice, but it's not happening in this film. I am expected to accept the crude and sudden juxtaposition of primordial imagery with a slow-simmering family drama, and it just doesn't come together. No, quiet down all you art film aficionados, it doesn't come together. It just doesn't. You're going to have to try a lot harder to make a cohesive artistic statement when you're dealing with such sweeping material. A few shots at the beginning and end of the film that depict "the universe", some silly business at the beach and some shots of tall skyscrapers are the best you could offer to explain the context of human struggle within the unfathomable cosmos? Give me a break.Had this film just accepted itself as a family drama, it would have gotten a higher score from me. The Artsier-Than-Thou inclusion of random National Geographic images and the expectation that the audience will put his statement together for him really take Terrence Malick's film right out of the realm of greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is one of those strange pieces of "art" that polarizes people on one side or the other and perhaps there is some element in there that is positive as it at least encourages dialogue. As a movie however it had nothing really interesting or new to say. The message is some kind of new-age hooey resolving around a somewhat dysfunctional family., Not really dysfunctional at all for a 50's family. Hardly stuff to base a meaning of life kind of deal around. A lot of the "nature" footage that people were raving about was stock footage from the Hubble and various nature films. I would be surprised if anything new was created for the movie. I guess what I find most discouraging is not the disappointing movie, but the number of people who called this footage "breath taking" and "awe inspiring" and "left me trembling". For shits sake people get off your couch and out of your basement suite. Almost every day I can look up and see a sky that makes anything in this movie pale by comparison. I guess what I am saying is people should get out there and really see the world if they think this tarted up "nature" footage is some how genius in action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE TREE OF LIFE (Terrence Malick, 2011) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Terrence Malick has joined a select group of elite film-makers ? like David Lean, Stanley Kubrick and Sergio Leone ? who, after modest beginnings in the industry, turned into world-class artists by virtue of not only the time they allocated to each production but also the dead time which accumulated between projects. Therefore, after penning (sometimes in an uncredited capacity) the screenplays for DRIVE, HE SAID (1970), DEADHEAD MILES (1972), POCKET MONEY (1972) and THE GRAVY TRAIN aka THE DION BROTHERS (1974) ? all of which I happen to have currently lying in my unwatched pile and which collectively promise to be a whole lot more enjoyable than his latest directorial effort! ? he gave the world 5 movies in almost 40 years. Actually THE TREE OF LIFE was shot 4 years ago but I can see how it took the director all this time to edit the much-longer rough cut (of allegedly 6 hours) to almost 2?-hours but, astonishingly enough, Malick has already shot another one in the interim (reportedly starring Ben Affleck and this film's revelation Jessica Chastain that could be even more obscure than the film under review)! In fact, one of the stars here ? Sean Penn who had been excellent in Malick's THE THIN RED LINE (1998) ? was very critical of the film in its current shape and who could blame him since his role has been rendered to a few, far between and mostly silent appearances? In fact, there are literally thousands of cuts within the film that 5 editors were required to handle the arduous task!For the record, before Brad Pitt (the nominal star of the film) was appointed, the following actors had been considered for the lead role: Colin Farrell, Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger. Interestingly, the spectacular but quite incongruous "Origins of Life" segment here is a remnant of Malick's project "Q" which, when it fell through, had made him quit film-making for 20 years in the first place! Celebrated special effects designer Douglas Trumbull was coaxed out of his retirement by Malick to help polish these particular sequences; obviously, Trumbull was behind the groundbreaking effects in Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968) which also included its own "Dawn of Man" segment; indeed, as already intimated above, Malick's own reclusive personality most closely resembles Kubrick's, with every new film being treated as something of an event (though, if you ask me, Malick's filmography pales beside his, where even relatively lesser work ? say, BARRY LYNDON {1975} and FULL METAL JACKET {1987} ? would still prove compelling and, more importantly, essential viewing)!While red-headed Jessica Chastain's ethereal presence (I would not go so far as to call it a performance), Emmanuel Lubezki's tremendous cinematography and the impeccable sets created by Malick's ubiquitous production designer Jack Fisk (he is also the husband of the star of the director's debut BADLANDS {1973} i.e. Sissy Spacek, whose lily white, freckled complexion is very similar to that of Chastain) are the film's unqualified assets, conversely Brad Pitt (as the embittered father who sacrificed his dream of becoming a musician to raise a family and a career as an airplane engineer until the factory shuts down!) and Sean Penn (as the adult version of Pitt's eldest son who enjoy a love-hate relationship between them) are at their most glum and unsympathetic! Penn plays a character named Jack O'Brien and it is no coincidence that his initials read J.O.B. since a quotation from The Book of Job in The Holy Bible opens the film! Unsurprisingly, THE TREE OF LIFE reprises the regrettable Malick trademark of portentous narration but out of all the half-whispered ramblings (which almost caused me to emulate it by querying to myself, "Why am I still watching this?"!), I found only the following three to be of any real significance: "Where were You? You let a boy die. You let anything happen. Why should I be good? When You aren't."; "What I want to do, I can't do. I do what I hate"; and "The only way to be happy is to love. Unless you love, your life will flash by."It is all well and good that Americans from the Southern states (including eminent film critic Roger Ebert who gave this one his full **** rating!) recognize their own upbringing in the way of life meticulously depicted here but it is also telling that some U.S. theater owners felt the need to set up notices in the lobby warning of THE TREE OF LIFE's difficult nature following walkouts and protests from disgruntled patrons! For all of the film's technical (and specifically editorial) marvels, frankly there is so much repetition of scenes, incidents and actions that one could easily take a nap while watching this and feel like he has not lost anything significant! This extends even to the practically constant use of classical music pieces on the soundtrack which is an art-house cinema cliché if ever there was one. On top of it all, there are also baffling diversions into the supernatural (Chastain is seen levitating), mythical (Chastain is a sleeping beauty in the forest at one point) and spiritual (the heavenly coda in which Penn and Pitt meet)! On a personal note, this is the first Brad Pitt film I have watched since I worked as an extra on his upcoming zombie epic WORLD WAR Z that was partially shot over here in Malta some months ago!; besides, THE TREE OF LIFE won the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year where DRIVE snatched Best Direction and MELANCHOLIA nabbed Best Actress and, quite coincidentally, l ended up watching these three movies on successive nights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took an estimated 13 million years for life on this planet to evolve from primordial ooze to its present level. Terrence Malick outlines this biogenesic theorem in what feels like slightly less than real time, pausing occasionally to ask God if this is what he had in mind from the start. At least the interior design is heavenly. Think: Kahlil Gabran reimagined as a columnist for Architectural Digest. To Malick's credit, as dull as his movie is, it's hard to look away and the pacing gives you plenty of time to wrestle with life's weightier questions. Like, why cast Sean Penn to walk silently through desertscapes and ride up and down in elevators? Jessica Chastain is radiant though. She's a natural and the camera loves her. She is deserving of a breakout role, but this isn't it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sorry to disappoint all movie experts, but I hated every moment of this movie with only a few exceptions, in scenes in which there is some action developing, in which the relationships in the household are being formed. Other than that it seemed to me that the director hates his audience and is trying to bore them to death. Reading the outline in wikipedia, I was wondering where was I when a lot of this was happening, and I am asking this because nothing in this film is explicit: nobody tells the audience who died and why, it is not clear at all why Sean Penn's character has his flashbacks so long after the death of his brother, the connections with the beginning of the universe and the scenes with the dinosaurs are totally out of place. The only positive thing I can say about this movie was the acting. But the plot, the pace, the continuity, and some of the special effects were much beyond anything I can bear in an overly intellectual and overly ambitious movie. Even assuming that I am too insensitive to the spirituality (quasi-spirituality in my view) of the movie, there are still unanswered questions in the 'normal' scenes, such as: what happened with the family after moving from Wako, what happened to the kid brother, and so on. It was also impossible to understand from the movie that the father was going around trying to sell his invention, I only found this out from wikipedia. Some people in the audience were laughing at the end of the movie, and I don't think the director would like to know that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Tree of Life is a great example to me that a film could brilliant cinematography, visuals, music and acting and could still be a poor film. Terrence Malick is a great director but I feel if The Tree of Life was directed by an unknown director and featured an unknown cast then this film would have been seen for what it really is, pretentious twaddle.Starting in the 1950s, a couple (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain) receive news that their 19-year-old died and their adult son, Jack in the modern world (Sean Penn) looks back on his life. The Tree of Life examples the Big Bang and the age of the dinosaurs to the 50s when the dad takes his frustrations out of his sons (Hunter McCracken, Laramie Eppler and Tye Sheridan) as their father makes them do jobs and is tough on them. He forces his way of life on them and wants them to love them. The boys' mother is more loving, offering them unconditional love. Soon Jack becomes resentful against his father.I will praise Emmauel Lubezki and the special effects team for at least trying to make Tree of Life a visual treat and Pitt , Chastain and McCracken did offer great performances. But what else is there? Of course there are themes as expected from an Art-House film like this, the mains being that in the grand scheme of the universe humanity and all personal issues are minor and that in religion that good people suffer and need to go through trials. The other major theme is two different types of parenting and the idea of two courses of life, nature and grace. But I believe Tree of Life did this poorly and I think there was a more interesting film within Tree of Life about the dysfunctional relationship between a father and son, a son becoming bitter against father and becoming a juvenile delinquent. There are bits of the film which lead nowhere, for example looking at a young girl, hinting one of the boys fancy her and she not even in the film after that. The film lacks dialogue, lacks character inactions or even a coherent plot. Events just fly by and the film is quickly edited. Dialogue and conversations are useful.The film reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey, mainly because of the scenes of the birth of the universe and life and the surreal ending. But birth of mankind and its progression, urging for knowledge and evolution played a key part of the plot. Whilst the scenes with dinosaurs are very interesting, it had nothing to do with the rest of the film. But it would have been a lot more fun if it had more dinosaurs. I could also compare The Tree of Life to The Lovely Bones because of the narration and its look of the afterlife. That film was heavily criticised but I feel that The Lovely Bones' version of heaven is better then Tree of Life. Also Penn's role is pointless to the film.Overall I believe is pretentious and only praised by critics and won the Palme D'Or because of the reputation of its director. I was in a cinema known for showing art-house films and popular with cinephiles and I think most of them were board with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i felt asleep , but i didn't miss anything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i like blockbusters and action stuff, but i can as well accept good movies with different stuff. but this one here : it was not really a movie.sometimes it kept going on with shots of beautiful nature from oceans and space and jungle and animals , like you were watching a national geographic show. and then later again it showed pieces of a drama movie about a family and their problems.the whole thing kept going for a long 2 hours and finally i felt asleep towards the end , but i didn't miss anything. it is not a movie with a plot and a story , it is just some film with a little bit of everything and few nature shots. so if you want a real movie with a story and a plot , don't waist your time on this one, but if you are into art of new and different kind of film making , than you could try this. i would not see this movie again .i rather like to be entertained when watching a good story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations for this movie; thinking it would be something amazing. But this was simply a terrible movie when it comes to story, plot development, any sort of an attachment to it. It felt like Bing took the best videos and sewed them up and wasted about 2 hours showing various art works. I felt like I was watching Nova or National Geographic tribute. Don't get me wrong, they were beautiful random shots of random life events. But seriously they plagued about 70 percent of the movie. The other 30 percent was basically Brad Pitt being a law enforcer to his kids. The kids revolt and causing chaos while he is away. That's basically it.This seriously was not a movie and I hope this doesn't win any awards because it was not good. If I wanted to watch a bunch of pretty videos, I would turn on PBS. If I wanted to watch kids play around, I would look outside my window or go to a playground. Seriously!!!! what were these people thinking making this consider this a movie. I could have made this movie myself in a day. Let me take a bunch of random videos and watching kids play around for a day and release it and make millions of dollars. The best part of the movie which makes me give it 2 stars is because you don't tell Brad Pitt to be quiet, because he will lunge across the table and beat the smoking out of you. My other favorite part was when the movie was over when I shouted out in the theater "Thank god it's over" and stormed out of the place. Life felt so much better after the movie was over, even the horrible rap music which was blaring the car next to me sounded so good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slide show is not a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All that was left was the disappointment you get when someone shots in your mailbox several unsolicited megabytes of slide show containing beautiful pictures, flavored with Christian-reborn(?)-style gospel quotes and a bit of religious fanaticism. At least there's not a "send 10 of your friends to watch this movie" at the end.A sequence of fine images is a slide show, not a movie. No matter how beautiful the images are. There's not a well constructed story, just a sequence of loosely related (if not almost unrelated) scenes.There was stuff to create a good movie. There's no good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Tree of Life" is a moving and profound illustration of everything the movies can do ? thoughts, pictures, subliminal images that turn dreams into realities and vice-versa. This film's a clear declaration of everything director Terrence Malick chooses not to do (never ever) ? which would be telling linear stories, writing conventional scenes and explaining what's going on. This way of storytelling makes a flick not easy to understand but gets to represent a complex and beautiful experience. "The Tree of Life", not easy to explain, is greatly acted by Sean Penn and Brad Pitt in this unusual role of a stern parent. It also features excellent performances by newer talents but what works the most are the setting and the ambiance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Visually Impressive Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tree of Life, The (2011) **** (out of 4) You could ask a hundred different people what this film is about and you're guaranteed that each of them would tell you something different. The basic story deals with an over-demanding father (Brad Pitt) in the 1950s Texas who wants the best for his three sons but at times he pushes them too hard. In the present day, one of those sons (Sean Penn) looks back on his childhood. THE TREE OF LIFE is a rare type of film because it's director Terrance Malick shoots for greatness and this ambition is something that we don't see too much these days. Sure, directors and writers want to win an Oscar at the end of the year and they want people to tell them that their movie was great but this film here is something completely different. Malick is a director with very few films under his name but it seems each time he makes one he has one desire and that is to make something that we haven't seen before. We've seen countless coming of age films and we've seen countless movies where a director takes a look back at his childhood but I can't think of a single one where they reached so high and hoped to accomplish so much.I think the best way to describe this is the style of someone like Carl Theodor Dreyer and the ambition of something like Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. In the 139-minute running time we see the lives of these three boys and their parents but we also get some incredible footage dealing with nature and the Earth over wide range of periods. We start off being introduced to this family, their small house, their livelihood and the yards that they play in. We then quickly learn that one of their sons has died at the age of 19 and this is where most films would have kicked into the story but not this one. Instead we get a very long sequence where we see the Universe being basically born and then we go through various periods of time including a brief sequence with dinosaurs and in one of the most beautiful pieces we see a child being brought into the world from the first time its mother and father touched to when it's actually born. I'm sure many people might see these sequences as being nothing more than preachy, self indulgent and too artistic but to me they were some of the most visually striking moments I've seen from any movie. I think most filmmakers would have loved to pull something off like the Universe sequence but would have chickened out simply because the odds of it coming off campy would be nearly 99%. Thankfully Malick went for it and the one slim shot of it being executed for perfection is what he pulled off. The beautiful cinematography and the way these sequences come out is something truly ground-breaking and their passion is something that's hard to escape your mind.Once we get to the human story things aren't any less brilliant. I found the structure of the story being told to be perfect. It's not your standard way of telling a story but I thought Malick did a wonderful job at showing a man looking back over his childhood, his mistakes and perhaps things he wished would have been done in order for his life to be better. We don't get a complete story with a structure or narrative but instead we just see different bits and pieces. I think this works so well because whenever anyone thinks back over their life they are often to see things just like they're shown in this movie. Pieces here and there. Good times. Bad times. Moments that really stand out as they helped shape your life. Perhaps quiet moments spent with your family or perhaps you remember that violent fight your father and mother had. These type of moments build up the story here and it's not typical but it's done so well that you can't help but get caught up in it. Brad Pitt really nails his performance and even though this films really not about "acting," he does a marvelous job. There's a quiet nature to his performance, which works remarkably well. The same with Penn who only has about ten-minutes worth of scenes and very little to no dialogue. Jessica Chastain is terrific as the mother and Hunter McCracken does a wonderful job playing the younger version of the Penn character.THE TREE OF LIFE is a film that's going to frustrate many but those who get it are in for a real treat. Is the film flawless? No. Is the film a masterpiece? I would say no but I'd never criticize a film that shoots for brilliance and just comes up a little shy. This is certainly unlike any movie that I can think of and it's a reason why I'm sure it will be studied for years to come. Visually speaking this is one of the most striking and beautiful films ever made and its story is certainly one people will debate for as long as there is film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One big sloppy mess of a "film"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pitt gave a good, minimalistic performance. But that's about the only thing that was good about this film.The movie as a whole is not really a movie per se. Sure, there are moving pictures and some recognized actors (what did Sean Penn actually do there, anyway?). But what do they really present on screen? There's no narrative, at least not a cohesive one, and instead there's just a long stream of consciousness that jumps from one place to another. The dialogs are scarce and few, the characters all lacking of portrayal and thus alienating the audience from them. The jumpy editing that starts right at the beginning of the film makes it hard to follow what the hell is going on, and after a while you give up on trying to understand. And if you do manage to follow, you'll soon find out that it doesn't really matter. Its all just one big mess, and you have to deal with it (or fall asleep).At the end, it just feels like you've accidentally wandered into someone else's dream, with bits and pieces of information that mean little to none to you all jumping around at the same time. What starts as a semi-interesting and unique cinematic experiment at first, swiftly becomes this dragging and painfully long film that should have been a hour and a half shorter, and better presented on the nature channel (for the dinosaur sequence) or the religious channel (for all the preachy texts in between).Self indulged? Indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice small independent film sandwiched between National Geographic documentaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love many of Terrence Malick's movies, although I must say that I was quite disappointed by his previous film 'The New World'. I went to see 'The Tree of Life' purely based on his name. The presence of well known actors like Brad Pitt or Sean Penn is always a bonus but doesn't guarantee quality. I have been puzzled by this movie from the very start and I like to be surprised when watching a movie but when the film changed to a kind of National Geographic documentary, I just asked myself where Malick wanted to go with it. How has the world been created? Is there truly a God up there? Some essential questions of course but unfortunately illustrated with exquisite colours and images but definitely many clichés (yes I was expecting to see that image of a leaf falling off the tree, the Tree of Life of course....). Then comes the story of this couple and their three sons. This is the most interesting part of the film. A 50's ambiance like in 'Revolutionary Road', good actors (Brad Pitt in a very unfriendly character, the eldest son well played), not too many words or actions but a sort of latent stress and subdued pressure which suddenly explodes in their son's head. Not a terrific story but about the quality of a good independent movie. Von Trier could have filmed that way and maybe Gus Van Sant as well. But for the last 20 minutes of the movie we go back to the character (or so to speak) played by Sean Penn (well not a lot he had to actually play here) and the last scene on the beach is just the most terrible one of the whole movie. The problem with this movie is that some people say it's highly ambitious. I would say that it's highly pretentious and very often pretension equals ridicule which is often the case here at least at the beginning and at the end. Also it's taking itself very seriously and some might say that I'm made of stone but I have not felt any emotion of any kind watching it. A serious disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tree to See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE TREE OF LIFE is a film to see, absolutely.No doubt: its author, Terrence Malick, is an expert in philosophical questions. Let's remember that Malick himself, before becoming a filmmaker, was a lecturer on Martin Heidegger at the MIT. The basis of the film is a tree of life, which, in mythology, represents creation, knowledge and ability to distinguish good and evil.However, Malick's ontological enterprise sometimes reminds of Icarus' myth. I am sure you remember. In Crete, ferocious king Minos confined the architect Daedalus and his son Icarus within Minotaur's labyrinth. In serious danger, father and son tried to run away from that place. Together they built a pair of wings for each one using feathers and wax. The method worked out but Icarus, seized by the desire of cosmic knowledge, flew too near the sun. Thus, the wax melted and the young man fell into the dark sea. In a way, Malick escapes that labyrinth of questions, which life is, in order to reach the sun ? in his case, the roots of the tree of life. Nevertheless, the director, a common human being, wants to reach the sun by using wax wings and, like Icarus, falls. To be precise, the inserts about the cosmic motion and the Mesozoic are rather disappointing.The true Malick shows up on the earth. The familial interactions ? in the small Texan city of Waco, the director's native town ? are marvelous indeed. This marvel reaches its peak when the eldest son starts observing his young mother. The sort of perdition involving the adult eldest son is remarkable since wonderfully represented by that glass labyrinth of the contemporary metropolis. References to Malick's past filmography ? DAYS OF HEAVEN in pole position ? are at the right place. The "discovery" of Jessica Chastain ? to whom I wish a great career ? in the role of the mother, is astonishing. The soundtrack - spacing from Bach to Ligeti, passing through Brahms and Smetana - is magnificent. The wonderful editing style ? based on "jump cuts" and conceptual associations ? needs to be highlighted since, more than Godard, it reminds of Eisenstein. Perhaps, the cinematography is less beautiful but interesting anyway. The Mexican Emmanuel Lubezki seems to imitate Néstor Almendros without being really successful. Likewise, not truly convincing, Brad Pitt playing the role of the father: he sometimes calls to mind lieutenant Aldo Raine of INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS. Recently, Pitt turns out to be abler as a producer than as an actor.It is not because of his ability to ask ontological questions and to discuss philosophical matters, but Terrence Malick is one of the most serious contemporary filmmakers. Thus, his short escape from the labyrinth is forgivable. All this, hoping that the next time, in spite of all seriousness, all cinematographic culture and philosophical competence, he will not forget that the wings, which are available to us, are made of wax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent art direction - but story lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Tree of Life' is an ambitious movie, where Malick presents his view on the meaning of life. From Malick's point of view, since the ancient times of dinosaurs, love and goodness are what gives a reason to life.Aesthetically, this movie has a very high grade. There are magnificent shots of nebulae, of the depths of sea, or the sun protuberances. The actors are good-looking and they play well.Regarding the story-telling, I am much more concerned. The film is long, too long (138min), with many aesthetic but pointless sequences of rising suns, suns between the tree branches, sun rising behind planets, dancing woman, woman under the watering pipe, woman drinking at the pipe, and many speechless scenes scored with classical music.More troubling is the influence of religion and creationism in this movie. To me, Love and goodness can exist without any God. I was disturbed that Malick is placing (Christians') God at the center of this movie, with many references to the Bible (Noah, Job), to Creationism (dinosaurs, creation of Earth and stars), to imagery of Paradize.The largest caveat is the lack of constructed storyline. All the spasmodic references to religion can not replace a well-developed storyline. The characters are nearly identical after 2hours of film, their relations and their personality are congealed. Sean Penn's character is rather emblematic : from his appearance till the film end, we do not learn anything about him or his actions.As a conclusion, picture and music were very pleasant. But lack of scenario, duration and too many religious trinkets make this movie an anxiety test for the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>827 titles rated on IMDb. Never one review. This is my first.The Tree of Life wants to be a panorama of the infinite universe, of life, death. It ends up being a panorama of boredom.Its just plain awful. I was waiting for it for weeks after seeing the trailer. How disappointed I am. It's a bad documentary about the creation of the world, then followed by some Jurassic Park. No dialogs, no plot, no story - just plain boring. This movie is so bad I don't even know what to say. I can't believe some French journalist called it "the most beautiful movie ever". Some good acting from the kids and from Brad Pitt, but that's about it. The cinematography is OK. The editing is irritating.A waste of time.</fullReview>
