		<shortDescription>An absolute classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Curtiz has made some great films, yet the only one that tends to be well received among film fans is his contender for the best movie ever made - obviously Casablanca (and Robin Hood, to a lesser extent). However, the man has a wealth of other influential classics under his belt that don't tend to get the recognition that they deserve, and Angels With Dirty Faces is one of those films. To sum the film up easily, one would say that it is a crime drama. However; like the best crime dramas, this one has multiple themes that elevate it from being merely a film about crime, to being a character study, a portrait of what it is that makes a hero and a condemnation of criminals on the whole. The story follows Rocky Sullivan and Jerry Connolly; two young New York thugs, the former of which is caught by the police and sent to a reform school, where, ironically, he learns to be a criminal. The latter escapes punishment and goes on to become a priest. The story follows these two men as they meet up as adults and have an effect on the lives of the kids of their old neighbourhood.The focus of the film is always centred on the neighbourhood. This allows Curtiz to show us the effects that Rocky's criminal endeavours have on the kids of the neighbourhood more effectively. This sort of narrative would be employed in later films, such as the critically acclaimed 'City of God', and works well here too. The way the film shows how impressionable young kids can be influenced by adults works brilliantly, and Curtiz is able to continue this theme up until the powerful ending. James Cagney would later go on to achieve major fame in the incredible 'White Heat', but here he shows us what the quintessential New York gangster would be like. His performance, in short, is incredible and easily ranks among the best gangster roles of all time. The rest of the cast do well in their roles, with distinct New York accents helping to firmly place the audience in the city that the film is taking place in. Furthermore, the film is economic in the way it's plotted and it's also very exciting, and therefore guaranteed to delight it's audience.Angels With Dirty Faces is an absolute cinema classic and quite why it isn't more famous is anyone's guess. Although not quite as good as Casablanca, this is a major notch in Michael Curtiz's filmography and I wouldn't have any qualms with recommending this to film fans at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Golden-age film offers great gangster yarn and metaphysical struggle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Angels With Dirty Faces" has been called the gangster movie of the New Deal. Previously, with such early-30s films as "Little Caesar" and "Public Enemy," gangster films at their best were engrossing actioners with charismatic but undeniably evil central figures. "Angels With Dirty Faces," released in 1938, presents a more nuanced view of what makes the modern bad man tick. Is it a bad heart? Or is society to blame?Cagney is undeniably great in the role that made him a legend. His practiced patter never wears thin, and his screen presence is electric throughout. (Especially at the end, and I don't mean that as a pun.) But the screenwriters never let us forget the good in the man. We see him come up against more ruthless elements of the underworld, people like Bogart (a real baddie here) who have no compunction about killing a man if it means avoiding payment of a heavy debt. We see him interact with a group of starry-eyed juveniles (The Dead End Kids) whose nickel-and-dime antics fill him with a poignant but heartily-amusing nostalgia. And we see him try to do right by his former partner in crime, now a priest played by Hugh O'Brien.But Cagney is trapped by the circumstances of his life. He can't walk away from a life of crime, which has made him what he is and gives him the only life satisfaction he knows. He's correctly on guard for double-crossers at every turn. When cornered, his cheery face becomes bug-eyed and menacing. We know he's bad, but we like him, and that puts us in the company of the audience-surrougate figure, Father Connolly.Director Curtiz was an auteur before his time, filling his canvas with images of downtrodden street life. This isn't for mere effect, but to show us why Rocky is what he is and how come he finds little hope for his redemption. There are souls to be saved in this picture, but for Father Connolly, they are Laurie and the boys. He must take on his childhood chum, the same kid who saved Connolly from the perils of the Mean Streets and allowed him to become what he was.It is a choice between God and friendship, and while Connolly has little doubt which way to go, the audience may not be with him all the way. The ending points up this spiritual conflict in some of the most harrowing terms ever brought to screen at that time. When you really think about what's going on behind Connolly's face in that final scene, it's a real tear-inducer.Was Rocky's last scene a put-up job? I guess it can be argued back and forth, but the real question of value is whether, if it was faked, was it enough to perform a miracle even the good Father Connolly wouldn't have quite believed in, the salvation of Rocky. The last image of the boys, desolately accepting the news of their hero's fall, is at once triumphant and bittersweet. Nothing comes easy in this world of ours."Angels With Dirty Faces" may strike a falsely optimistic note to some, but it is optimism well-earned by the honesty of vision expressed. Add to that clever dialogue, great pacing, and one of cinema's keystone performances by Cagney, and you have a real keeper here.P.S. It also features one of the finest Cagney impersonations ever, by William Tracey as the young Rocky. Funny stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney Heads Impressive Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film certainly has an attractive cast with three Hall-Of-Fame actors and the very pretty Ann Sheridan.James Cagney, my favorite actor of classic films, once again steals most of the scenes. He just dominates the screen and gets you very involved with his character, especially at the end. Pat O'Brien plays his normal somewhat-liberal and likable priest role and Humphrey Bogart is convincing as the crooked lawyer. Bogart was the bad guy in most films until he became a big star a couple years after this film. The "Dead End Kids" are a pretty tough bunch. Seeing them play basketball is quite a sight - more like rugby. It must be one of the highlights of this entertaining film because I remember it so well....it was so different from any other basketball game I've ever seen!The shootout-and-chase scene near the end was well-done with some great film-noir photography and the ending of the movie is quite memorable. Frankly, the first time I saw this I thought it was overrated but after the second viewing - and then seeing a nice transfer on DVD - I changed my mind. It is anything but overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney's First Screen Award Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rise and fall of Rocky Sullivan, tough guy gangster but square fellow, was the subject of this excellent film by Warner Brothers in 1938. It has several things going for it that maintains it's high ratings among gangster films and Cagney movies.For one thing, Cagney's brilliant performance as Rocky won him his first major film award - the 1938 New York Film Critics Award for best actor. It is frequently forgotten that Cagney won this award four years before his Oscar winner in "Yankee Doodle Dandy", but in actuality the performance was the high point of the work he did (up to that time) as a gangster (his performances in "White Heat" and "Love Me Or Leave Me" were way in the future). It drives home how much of a struggle it was for Cagney to get out of the gangster mode, and why his George M. Cohan was such a striking change for his fans.Secondly it was the sequel (the first sequel) of the Bowery Boy feature films after their introduction in "Dead End". Oddly enough, in that film, Humphrey Bogart was the out and out gangster "Baby Face" Martin, who was the villain in the film. Baby Face enjoyed his following with the gang of boys in that film. Here, though, Bogart was playing a weaselly lawyer named Jim Frazier, who is cowardly - quite a different type from Baby Face, who is angry at the state of his world and how ugly it has become. But Baby Face, at least, had guts.The Bowery Boys are again a gang of street kids, who Father Jerry Connelly (Pat O'Brien) is trying to keep on the straight and narrow. Here, however, they worship Rocky, the local punk who did rise in the underworld and made a name for himself. But Rocky is Jerry's oldest friend, and he is also willing to help the priest with the boys.The story deals with how Bogart and his new boss, Mac Keefer (the unjustly forgotten George Bancroft) have gotten control of over 100,000 dollars (1930 style dollars - about twenty million in buying power today), that belongs to Cagney. Cagney wants it back, and when Bogart and Bancroft keep putting him off he uses strong arm methods to force them into line. Eventually things blow up, and Cagney ends up in a gun battle that leaves a dead cop. He is tried and found guilty for this murder, and goes to the death house. This leads to one of the most frightening moments in Cagney's film career - when we see his final moments when being taken to the electric chair to be strapped in. I guarantee once seen you will never forget it.There are one or two interesting points of a historical nature about Cagney's performance as Rocky. First, that massive gun battle that is shown (where he kills the cop and battles the police department from a building. It actually happened! In about 1931 there was an incident in Manhattan when a young hood, "Two Gun" Crowley, held off police after a homicide in a battle that lasted nearly an entire afternoon. Crowley (like Rocky) was defeated by tear gas. Like Rocky, he too died in the electric chair.It has been pointed out that Cagney based some of Rocky's mannerisms on a drug addict character he knew in his old Hell's Gate/Yorkville area when he was a kid. Cagney mentions this in his memoir CAGNEY. But there is a curious second source. In his youth, Jimmy Cagney came from a family that struggled but managed to have food on the table and clothes on their back. But some of his playmates were not so lucky. One was a fellow nicknamed "Bootah" (because of the oversize boots he was forced to wear) whose real name was Peter Heslin. Cagney always was friendly with Peter, but their lives drifted apart. On April 5, 1926, Heslin was engaged in an armed robbery when an off-duty police officer, Charles H. Reilly, tried to stop him and was shot and killed. But Heslin (who was also wounded in the encounter) was captured shortly afterward. He was tried and convicted, and finally executed on July 21, 1927. That same night, a star was born on Broadway where Jimmy Cagney made a name for himself as a singer and dancer in the show "Broadway". Cagney was aware of the tragedy playing out with his friend at Sing Sing that night. He mentions Bootah's execution in his memoirs. Newspaper accounts of Heslin's electrocution do not mention anything unusual, but one wonders if (when Cagney was doing the scene) he thought of his unfortunate friend and added a bit more power to those last moments of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Post Production Code Gangster Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Angels With Dirty Faces" was James Cagney's first film for Warner Bros. following his two year contract dispute. During that time he appeared in two films for the poverty row studio Grand National. With a few concessions to The Production Code (introduced in 1934) it is nonetheless one of the great all time gangster films. The touch of legendary director Michael Curtiz is evident throughout.The story begins in the 1920s with two boyhood pals "Rocky" Sullivan (Frankie Burke) and Jerry Connelly (William Tracy) in the Hell's Kitchen Neighborhood of New York. Rocky gets arrested by the police and is sent to the reformatory after a botched break in while Jerry escapes. While in prison, Rocky learns the evils of gangsterism from within and forges a life of crime and growing up to be James Cagney. Meanwhile Jerry has become a priest in the Pierson of Pat O'Brien.Rocky returns to the old neighborhood and becomes involved with a group of teenagers (The Dead End Kids) who are headed in the same direction as Rocky. Fr. Jerry prevails upon Rocky to help him straighten the boys out before its too late. Rocky also meets up with a girl from his childhood, Laury Ferguson (Ann Sheridan).Meanwhile we learn that Rocky has served three years in jail to protect his former partner and lawyer Jim Frazier (Humphrey Bogart). He has also entrusted Frazier with $100,000 from an earlier caper. Rocky goes to Frazier to demand his money and learns that Frazier is now involved with crime boss Mac Keefer (George Bancroft) and that they plan to cheat him out of his money. Hey, nobody double crosses Rocky.Cagney is typical Cagney, bold, brash and cocky as Rocky. O'Brien as the Irish priest was a role he was born to play. Sheridan looks lovely but has little to do. Bogart, who was still 3 years away from major stardom, does well as the yellow back stabbing lawyer. The Dead End Kids - Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan, Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Gabriel Dell, Bernard Punsley) would move to a "B" series (without Hallop) after their Warner contract expired in 1939. The performances of Frankie Burke in particular and William Tracy as the young Rocky and Jerry are excellent."Angels With Dirty Faces" is probably best remembered for its ending. don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Say A Prayer For A Kid Who Couldn't Run As Fast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angels With Dirty Faces is a milestone film for the careers of both James Cagney and Pat O'Brien. Up to now they had been successfully teamed by Warner Brothers in a whole series of buddy films. In fact it is my contention that they popularized that particular genre. Here they are childhood friends, but as adults, adversaries due to the course in life they took.Cagney came off suspension from Warner Brothers and agreed to do this film as his comeback of sorts. At first glance it seems just like another gangster flick, just what Cagney had been trying to get away from. But by force of personality and a superior script, Cagney turned the role of Rocky Sullivan into a classic and got his first Academy Award nomination.As for O'Brien, this was his first clerical role. Usually O'Brien is the fast talking manager, press agent,etc. When playing a priest Pat O'Brien slows the pace of the dialog down to a crawl and it works. He greatly expanded his range here and there were many other classic clerical roles to come.Cagney's a notorious gangster who's just been let out of prison after a three year stretch, taking a fall for his crooked attorney, Humphrey Bogart. Bogart was supposed to guard his $100,000.00 Cagney had squirreled away from illegal activities in the Twenties. Bogart's got a new partner now in George Bancroft and neither of them wants to cut Cagney in on anything.Let's just say that Cagney in the usual Cagney fashion makes both of them wish they'd played it on the square.Father O'Brien's concern is that notorious criminal Cagney is becoming a hero to some of the neighborhood kids in his parish. But he also can't forget that the two of them had been boyhood pals and that Cagney's first brush with the law was over a petty crime that O'Brien was equally guilty of. This is shown in a small prologue with three players portraying, Cagney, O'Brien, and neighborhood girl Ann Sheridan as kids.Young Frankie Burke is astounding in his portrayal of the young Cagney. He has him down perfectly, he becomes Cagney. Angels With Dirty Faces is worth watching for him alone.Those other juvenile actors with Warner Brothers at the time, The Dead End Kids, play the kids from the parish who come to idolize and idealize Cagney. O'Brien has one tough time trying to make them see that Cagney's life is not the way to go in life.Angels With Dirty Faces still has a powerful message for today and film aficionados should see it because of that and because it was a key turning point in the careers of James Cagney and Pat O'Brien.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic early crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout the 1930's, Warner Brothers delivered many quality crime and gangster dramas that usually featured the likes of the studio's distinguished contract star roster. This 1938 release is one of the prime examples. James Cagney and Pat O'Brien (who were frequently cast in films together and this is their best one together) portray boyhood buddies who reunite years later after Cagney is released from prison where he had served for many years for a petty crime that he committed while he was still a kid. Cagney has not learned his lesson that crime doesn't pay and so he returns to his old neighborhood to set up his criminal hideout. Meanwhile, his old friend, O'Brien has given up being a street hood and has since become a respected priest who naturally doesn't think highly of the life that his friend has chosen for himself. To make matters worse, six young boys (portrayed by the Dead End Kids) whom O'Brien is trying to lead down the right paths begin to idolize Cagney. Humphrey Bogart also appears in a pre big box office star part as a lawyer and screen veteran George Bancroft also costars as a dishonest crime boss. Michael Curtiz' direction and Max Steiner's musical score are also highlights. This film is one of the all time great ones of the 1930's and an excellent showcase for its legendary cast and crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A favorite Bogart film by default...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Angels With Dirty Faces" has become a favorite Bogart film by default; it has been shown so often and has served as the prime source of material for countless satirists and impressionists? It is the familiar tale of two young boys who grow up to be on opposing sides of the field?one a gangster (James Cagney) and the other a priest, (Pat O'Brien). The story was obviously sentimental? Its saving virtues were the performances by the leads, clever and suave, energetic direction by Michael Curtiz, and a good music score by Max Steiner? Bogart had little, and certainly nothing new, to do as he played Cagney's lawyer-turned-nightclub-owner who double-crosses him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney in great form ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(possible spoilers):James Cagney really struts his stuff in this one, and all his classic "caricature" type movements and traits are on vivid display here. I loved the interplay between Cagney and Humphrey Bogart (in a supporting role); also intriguing was the relationship between the now-grown Rocky Sullivan (that's Cagney's character) and the straight-laced Jerry (played by Pat O'Brien), who was the childhood friend of Rocky and partner in mischief who wound up spending his adulthood as a priest while his companion never was able to go completely straight.The Dead End Kids tended to get on my nerves at times, but I guess that's partly what they're supposed to do, as street punks who idolize the legendary Sullivan and want to follow in his infamous footsteps. Just want to mention that I thought the ending - with Cagney's change of demeanor in the electric chair and the resulting disappointment of the kids who worshipped him - was a great cinematic moment by director Michael Curtiz. People have debated whether or not Cagney is supposed to be genuinely afraid at the end or just putting on a show for the kids to learn something from. I'm of the opinion that he was acting cowardly, and that he did it primarily as a favor to his longtime friend, Father Pat O'Brien. In the process he was able to help the young gang of thugs re-think their futures as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WILL THE CIRCLE REMAIN UNBROKEN???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is included on my personal top 10 list. The old-time ethnic slums (?) of New York City in the 20's and 30's are a picaresque window to another time. One where gangsters were heroes (to some) and filled newspapers with their exploits. Tales of crime and riches are like candy to the gangs of kids living in poverty, while seeking their own escape to something better. They could only learn from experience, what Rocky Sullivan (Cagney) already knew, there is no honor among thieves. No honor, and no road back for Rocky. But, sometimes, for someone else, fate gets a push.A very interesting, fast-paced story, I recommend this highly. The transition from Rocky's childhood to his adult years is especially well done and cast. In 'spirited' discussions with friends, we STILL don't agree on Rocky's thoughts and motivations at the end of the film. WAS HE GIVEN AN 'OUT' ? WAS HE HERO OR COWARD? WAS IT WHAT HE WANTED? WAS IT IMPOSED ON HIM? WAS IT CALCULATED OR DID IT POUR OUT UNCONTROLLABLY? Judge for yourself. After a few viewings, it's not as simple as it appears......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angels or Evils?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite classics, with extraordinary acting of James Cagney, one of the best actors starring crime films, and his friend, Pat O'Brien, who once again played the role of a priest. In fact, O'Brien in his real life studied to become a priest, but later he quit for becoming an actor. The seed of criminality is here well shown, but not its causes. Why are these children finally criminals? It was not the intention of the director Michael Curtiz to go deeply into the problem, instead he treated it religiously. Men are products of the society where they live, obviously, some escape from bad examples while others continue to be spoiled for the whole life. Rocky Sullivan (Cagney) was the case, a spoiled child with some principles of friendship only, and hard with his enemies. His best friend (o'Brien) hopefully became a priest and took the life differently, trying to help and improve the behavior of the children in the community where he lives. Why one went in one way different to the other? this is not suggested in the film. We have only the facts and then you must figure out the reasons of such behaviors. Interesting film, anyway, with good acting of Humphrey Bogart too, who was a perfect actor for playing the roles of the villains, and always nice Ann Sheridan did it well too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Melodrama That's Not For Cynics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ever take a film class about gangster films you'll soon learn that it's a genre " Catholic " in outlook in much the same way as the western is " Protestant " . Once you analysis the gangster genre you'll find that there's almost a formulaic lay out of themes of a fatherless outsider trying to become part of the American dream via illegal means . ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES is slightly different in that the characters are Amercan born and it's the street gang of juvenile delinquents who are in need of the father figure and the film rests on whether Father Jerry Connolly or Rocky Sullivan becomes that father figure I'm feeling slightly ashamed of myself for saying this but I liked this movie a lot , and the reasons I liked it is down to the reasons that I shouldn't . There's hardly a single scene that rings of any type of realism . Cagney was a Hollywood star but he was never an actor . There is something compelling about his performances however and he dominates every scene he is in . I can certainly understand why some people don't like his acting style but it's a style that suits the film perfectly that lacks any type of verisimilitude . None of it rings true but there's something that keeps you watching even though there's a voice inside your head saying " What a load of melodramatic Hollywood tosh "Your opinion of the film lies with what you thought about the golden age of Hollywood . This was a period of American film making where producers were under heavy censure via The Hays Code where any type of immorality must be seen to be punished on screen and this suits a film like ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES wonderfully . Rocky is a bad man but a hero to the teenage street gang , he must not be allowed to be a hero to criminal youth and so must face death as a coward . On paper this appears to be the cheesiest ending ever seen in a movie but as it plays out on screen it's one the most beautiful and memorable endings Hollywood has ever produced . Michael Curtiz directs this scene via suggestion and is all the better for it If you're a fan of Old Hollywood then you'll enjoy this . Even a self confessed cynic like myself found this movie compelling . You have to be slightly forgiving for some of the more melodramatic aspects but in some ways that's part of the movie's appeal</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney vs. The Dead End Kids!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest films of Cagney's film career, and the film that unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your gag reflexes) introduced us to the Dead End Kids! James Cagney is a career criminal, who, immediately after getting out of the clink, meets up with his former partner in crime (Pat O'Brien!), who of course is a priest now and loathes the life Cagney leads. Cagney is also preoccupied with a bunch of no-good kids who of course idolize him. Seeing this, O'Brien thinks Cagney should lead the kids to good. But Cagney is too busy getting even with his old business cronies (Humphrey Bogart!).This film is a lot fun, most especially watching Bogey and Cagney on the screen together. For those rather uninitiated with the career of Bogart (eg, just seen Casablanca and the Sam Spade movies), this film may come as a revelation to you, as he plays a cretinous heel here. And Cagney? Ahhh, what's not to like? He's flawless here, (well, except his curious gun usage). As for the Dead End Kids, I liked them here, rather interesting that Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall almost are in the background here, with their leadership of the group not yet realized.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>«Keep the change, ya filthy animal!»</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies from the 1930 decade, yet it doesn't seem to be all that remembered, which is a shame.Practically the whole movie is deeply involving. The film is well- made, the plot is solid, the image quality is 5 stars (without the "scratches" typical of most movies from that generation) and the cast is brilliant. We have, for example, the fabulous Dead End Kids and the great Humphrey Bogart, but it's James Cagney who really shines as "Rocky" Sullivan. "Rocky" is a very intense character and even though he is a gangster, somehow he is likable. James Cagney shines in an absolutely peerless performance. His face was very memorable too, as were his facial expressions and his fiery voice. Unmistakenly one of the all-time great actors, with a talent and charisma comparable to Peter Lorre and Vincent Price, for example.This movie has many surprises as well. One of them is the fact that the actor who played "Rocky" as a boy looks exactly like James Cagney. When "Rocky" grew up, I thought it was the same actor playing him from the start, because adult "Rocky" looked exactly the same as himself as a kid. By the way, the kids who play "Rocky" and Jerry as kids have terrific performances either.My absolute favorite part of this gr8 gangster-movie is the sequence in which "Rocky" is stuck in a building surrounded by the police and attempting to resist the toxic gases which are asphyxiating him, and how, despite his pride and efforts to resist, he realizes he won't get away so easy this time. The funniest scene, whoever, is when Ann Sheridan finally gets even with "Rocky" after 15 years by yanking his hat down over his ears and slapping him and then he sits down on that old bed and it collapses! So hilarious!The ending is unexpected because the penalty for "Rocky" is to get cooked in the "Old Sparky". Whether his cries are genuine or only to fulfill Father Jerry's final wish is unspecific, although I'd believe that they are genuine. I do feel bad for "Rocky", though. That penalty was too terrible for him and over the top for his crimes. What made me discover this movie was 'Home Alone' because of the movie that Kevin watches, 'Angels with filthy souls'. Until very little time ago I thought that the movie he was watching was real, but I found out that it was fictional and that those scenes were only made for 'Home Alone'. What a pity, I always wanted to see that movie. But I also found out that it was a parody to a real movie called 'Angels with dirty faces'. That was what took me to this great movie. But, much to my disappointment, there aren't such lines as «Keep the change, ya filthy animal!». I was expecting some line like that in the whole movie and I was very disappointed that there isn't any. Having that said, I don't like the movie any less for that.Title in Portugal: 'Anjos de cara negra'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just short of perfect, and layered up with surprises in the usual gangster plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angels with Dirty Faces (1938)Just a couple years before Casablanca, this is another of director Michael Curtiz's startling, well filmed, intelligent action movies, this one also for Warner Brothers. And Bogart is a key secondary figure here, somewhat tame compared to the usual intensity of James Cagney, who again plays a gangster to perfection. The odd second layer here sometimes threatens to tilt to moralizing, even with the roughness of the church kids, as the priest weighs in on certain scenes. But the two elements--good and evil, basically--not only contrast, but they overlap, and the confusion of who is doing the most good and why is part of the bigger ethical fiber of the plot.Maybe it's because of these moments where Cagney's gangster role is softened by interacting with the priest that we see less direct, raw acting, the scary thing that he can pull of so well. But he's still utterly convincing, and the ending is chilling no matter how you read it. If you, like me, like a film to go beyond a simple do crime and get caught kind of scenario, this is a great one. The great Sol Polito is cinematographer, and it shows, in every single scene, whether the fascinating street shots (packed with activity) or the shadowing alley and basement shots (composed for drama and depth). And the music, relatively invisible, by Max Steiner is of course flawless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A memorable, amazing gangster film with a social message featuring a blistering performance by the one and only James Cagney. JC plays notorious gangster Rocky Sullivan who comes back to his old neighborhood and a reunion with his old pal Jerry Connelly. Time has a strange way of changing things, you see, Sullivan and Connelly were boyhood pals from the wrong side of the tracks. Sullivan spent time in a reformatory only to emerge the hardened criminal that he is. Connelly, spared time in the reformatory because he could run faster then Rocky and got away, is now a priest trying to keep the youth from his neighborhood out of trouble. Father Connelly is working hard on a group of youngsters, the Dead End Kids, who are already headed in the wrong direction. Things become complicated when Rocky arrives as the youngsters idolize the gangster and begin to really show signs of an impending criminal life. Rocky's own problems mount, including being ripped off by his lawyer James Frazier played by Humphrey Bogart. Rocky tries to remedy his situation but his cohorts are planning to rub out Father Connelly who's one man crusade to wipe out the criminal element is going too far. Rocky will have no part of it and resorts to murder to prevent his friend from being killed. Unfortunately, Rocky is caught and is sentenced to die in the electric chair setting up one of the most memorable conclusions in film history.This is a completely absorbing, emotional film with standout performances from everyone. Besides Cagney, Pat O'Brien as Father Connelly gives what is perhaps his finest performance. The support from Bogart, the Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan are all top notch. Many unforgettable scenes abound, namely Cagney's unorthodox "refereeing" at a basketball game and the aforementioned conclusion which still haunts me to this day. Director Michael Curtiz does an amazing job. His camera is almost in constant movement with fluid passes and turns and his brilliant use of light, darkness and shadow is amazing to watch. I just can't say enough about this film, one of the finest gangster epics to ever grace the big screen. It's very easy to see why Cagney was nominated for an Academy Award in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"All right, fellas... let's go and say a prayer for a boy who couldn't run as fast as I could."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Angels with Dirty Faces,' one of a string of gangster/crime pictures that frequented Hollywood throughout the 1930s {'Little Caesar (1931);' 'The Public Enemy (1931);' 'Scarface (1932);' 'The Petrified Forest (1936)'}, was a film that I really only watched to see Humphrey Bogart playing a bad guy, as happened often in the years before 'The Maltese Falcon (1941)' made him a star. However, it was the performance of Mr. James Cagney ? of whom I'd often heard, but never seen on screen ? that truly inspired my admiration, delivering surely one of the most memorable displays of acting I'd ever seen. I know that it's an old cliché in film criticism, but this wasn't simply an actor playing a role; Cagney completed inhabited the character of Rocky Sullivan, slipping so painlessly into the role that you'd think Sullivan was a real criminal merely playing himself. Cagney's defiantly-upright posture, dryly-amused facial expressions, his quirky mannerisms {including his character's trademark greeting of "Whaddya hear? Whaddya say?"} project a lifetime of power, corruption and frustration; Sullivan's wily toughness has been chiseled by years of crime and incarceration, of his constant exposure to men just as dangerous as himself. He is truly a formidable figure, and Cagney flawlessly captures the many layers of his fascinating character, in a role for which he earned the first of his three Oscar nominations.'Angels with Dirty Faces' was directed by Michael Curtiz, most famous nowadays for 'Casablanca (1942),' but his list of great films is extensive, as I'm now beginning to discover. The film is a thickly-layered crime film, slick and action-packed with a hint of social commentary. It deals with a popular theme of 1930s crime films, of two childhood friends who, in later life, ended up on opposite sides of the law. Rocky Sullivan (Frankie Burke as a youth, James Cagney as an adult) and Jerry Connolly (William Tracy as a youth, Pat O'Brien as an adult) were the best of friends, passing their adolescent years through dabbling in minor theft. After they are discovered raiding a railway car, Jerry manages to flee the policemen's grasp, but Rocky is apprehended; this seemingly trivial event {Rocky being unable to run quite as fast as Jerry} is the crucial moment when the two boys' paths violently diverged, and their lives would never be the same again. After spending years in a rehabilitation centre for juvenile delinquents, Rocky becomes immersed in a life of crime, while his old friend heads towards the Church, from which he tries to prevent the next generation from going astray.As I mentioned earlier, Cagney leads a dynamite cast of intriguing characters. Humphrey Bogart excels as James Frazier, a weaselly lawyer who decides to have Rocky whacked rather than pay him the $100,000 in misbegotten money that he owes him; George Bancroft plays his associate in crime. The "Dead End" Kids from William Wylers 'Dead End (1937)', headed by Soapy (Billy Halop), are a gang of youths who idolise Rocky's life of crime so reverentially that they are almost certain to follow in his pitiful footsteps. Pretty Laury Ferguson (Ann Sheridan), a girl from Rocky's childhood, isn't given particularly much to do in the film, but is rather the perfect embodiment of innocence, a stark contrast with our main character's dirty criminal past. Pat O'Brien {who starred in countless films alongside Cagney throughout the decade} is adequate as the good-willed anti-crime crusader, but his priest character just isn't really all that interesting, somewhat bland alongside a hot-heated dynamo like Rocky Sullivan. Praise must also go to young Frankie Burke, who plays Rocky as a child, and who imitated Cagney's tone and mannerisms so perfectly that I wondered for a second if that was Cagney himself somehow playing a teenager.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rocky Story for the Rocky Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angels with dirty face is a 1930's Warner Bros gangster film that stars James Cagney as Rocky Sullivan and Pat O'Brien as Jerry Connelly. As the film's opens, young teenager Rocky and Jerry are trouble makers?it wasn't until young Rocky is catch by the police that we see the two characters change. Rocky is sent to reform school. In a montage of images, Rocky graduates to prison as he pursues a life of crime including bootlegging, manslaughter, gambling, and violent gang rivalry. Mobster Rocky is sent to prison to serve another three years for a crime he has committed with crooked attorney James Frazier (Humphrey Bogart). He is promised by Frazier that when he is discharged after taking the rap, he will be paid $100,000 from the crooked heist the two had pulled. As adults, Rocky embraces a life of crime, whereas Jerry, who had witnessed Rocky's fate, becomes a priest assigned to his old home parish. When discharged, Rocky returns to his former neighborhood, and visits the church where Father Jerry serves as parish priest and where they had been altar boys together twenty years earlier. Jerry faces the challenges of teaching and working with tough, gutter-bred neighborhood boys call the "Dead End" kids, trying to make them decent citizens. Dead End Kids are based and a continue sage of the 1935 play and the film Dead End (1937)). It's become hard for Jerry, because of his criminal exploits, the boys idolize him and regard him with almost fanatical hero worship when he shares his criminal exploits and experiences. The priest is unsuccessful in retrieving the neighborhood kids from emulating their gangster hero. Jerry wants Rocky to behave in a way so that the neighborhood kids will not admire him and revere him as a role model or martyr, following in his misguided footsteps. Jerry asks that Rocky make a really heroic action and show a special kind of courage. George Bancroft (Mac Keefer) also comes in the story, playing an influential politician and rackets boss that Rocky works under his new job. In the course of the movie, we are left to ask if Rocky is willing to reform or continue with his criminal past life? this come in light with his relationship with the kids. Jerry and an old flame play by Ann Sheridan. In one of the most tautly directed, unforgettable, harrowing sequences of any film in the 1930s, Rocky is force to make a choice. The scene is bathed in dark suggestive, oppressive shadows, and the musical score (by Max Steiner) resembles a plodding, relentless march to what his life really means. It is unclear whether or not his true nature or motives are revealed - is he pretending or not. It's up to you as the viewer to decision. Cagney is great as the swaggering, pugnacious career criminal Rocky. Cagney is brilliant. The facial expression of James Cagney. His face is intense and penetrating! Pat O'Brien plays best as a mild-mannered, forceful, sincere and compassionate priest. This is perfect in every way, very finely executed. What a classic film this is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of Curtiz.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>t's a good film directed by Michael Curtiz, based on an original story. It earned three Oscar nominations and the award for Best Actor (James Cagney) of "New York Film Circle." It was produced by Samuel Bischoff.The action takes place on the East Side, Neva York in the 20's. After fifteen years away from the neighborhood, because of his incarceration in reformatories and prison, "William Sullivan", aka "Rocky", returns to find his best friend from childhood, "Jeremy Connolly," alias "Jerry" (Pat O O'Brien), become rector of the parish. For various reasons, Rocky is forced to continue his criminal career together, not without severe tensions with his former colleague "James Frazier" (H. Bogart), his boss "Mac Keefer" (George Bancroft) and his band. He also meets "Laury Martin" childhood neighbor, which is the support, understanding and friendship, which so badly needs. The disturbing influence of "Rocky" on the boys become so large in view of the weak and sweet father "Jerry", which he decides to launch a public campaign to denounce the crime in the city and, consequently, his former partner.The music of Max Steiner ("Gone with the Wind") is a delight for the ears and a source of emotions. It's overwhelming the support of the final scene: it begins with a passage that suggests a portent of death continues with a short sequence of "Gloria" and ends with a wonderful melody of salvation and triumph. The photograph features a superb game of contrasts of black and gray variety, which become oppressive to the end of the play, the hand of an inspired Sol Polito ("42nd Street"). The initial tracking shot is outstanding, divided into two parts, showing viewers the news of the day, the atmosphere of the neighborhood, the image of the facades of houses, organ music and a balcony where they are leaning "Rocky" and "Jerry". The script is rich in nuances and is characterized by the brevity of the interventions and the sincerity of the content. The characters are expressed with depth and consistency, especially the protagonist of "Rocky," a victim of a mistake of youth involved in criminal conversion while in prison and a reformatory. Ann Sheridan is dazzling sympathy, femininity and beauty in the character of "Laury" lover "Rocky". The role of Bogart, road to stardom is as short as excellent.This is one of the best gangster movie so successful that occurred in the decade of the 30 in the U.S.. Cagney delivers one of the best performances of his career. Curtiz gets it, it may be his best film after "Casablanca". The final scene has an extraordinary force.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic gangster film of Hollywood's Golden Age from Casablanca director Michael Curtiz, Angels with Dirty Faces is one of James Cagney's most well known films and had him nominated for his first Academy Award.Rocky Sullivan (Cagney) and Jerry Connelly (Pat O'Brien) are childhood friends who are caught robbing a train as kids. After Rocky takes the rap the two set on different paths, Jerry becomes a priest while Rocky can't escape the life of crime. Years later they reunite on friendly terms but each have a different influence on a group of street kids who resemble the lifestyle they once shared.The film for the most part may seem to be just a typical 1930s gangster quota quickie from Warner, with Rocky as a tough crook being screwed over by his former ally Humphrey Bogart. But the focus is instead on the relationship with Jerry who looks out for the best interests of the kids (to whom the title refers), and by the end Rocky must make a decision which, to a Depression era audience, would have been quite inspiring. Cagney also gives Rocky a moral grounding which has the audience sympathising with him from start to finish.Overall a decent crime story with a message about the kind of courage that is not "heroics and bravado", and you can clearly see its influence on modern characterisation, but perhaps this means the novelty is lost to today's audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Cagney Gives it Up for the "Dead End" Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best of its type, "Angels with Dirty Faces" epitomizes the "gangster" and "juvenile delinquent" pictures of the 1930s (and 1940s). These are the films showing how unfortunate circumstances turn young men into hardened criminals. It's the "Nature vs. Nurture" argument. And, don't waste any time wondering about this film's stance - the title says it all - if you rub that dirty criminal's face hard enough, you'll find a hidden Angel.This is the case with tough guy James Cagney (as Rocky Sullivan), who landed in reform school for stealing, and was seduced into a life of crime. It may be too late for Cagney, but not for the younger generation of dirty-faced angels known as "The Dead End Kids", who worship the charismatic gangster. At least, that's the way scarred priest Pat O'Brien (as Jerry Connolly) sees things. Father O'Brien, who escaped Cagney's fate, wants salvation for the little tough guys.Cagney's courageous, shoulder-rolling turn as "Rocky" is entrancing; absolutely, he deserved a "Best Actor" award - which the "on target" in the 1930s New York Film Critics delivered. Directed by Michael Curtiz, the classic line-up of "Dead End Kids" - Billy Halop as "Soapy", Bobby Jordan as "Swing", Leo Gorcey as "Bim", Gabriel Dell as "Pasty", Huntz Hall as "Crab", and Bernard Punsly as "Hunky" - are a symphony of spitting, smoking, and (mostly) smacked upside the head young punks.The memorable Warner Brothers supporting cast includes rheumy-eyed lawyer Humphrey Bogart (as James Frazier), sultry Ann Sheridan (as Laury Ferguson), and perfectly cast Frankie Burke (as a young James Cagney). "Social Consciousness"- raising films can often trip over themselves, so don't watch this one in the wrong frame of mind.********* Angels with Dirty Faces (11/24/38) Michael Curtiz ~ James Cagney, Pat O'Brien, Billy Halop, Humphrey Bogart</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd always heard about how great an actor James Cagney was, but had never seen any of his films. So I decided to rent this one from the local video store. After watching it I was astounded at how great an actor he is. This has to be his defining movie. Cagney plays a very believable gangster named Rocky Sullivan and I think his performance alone could have made this movie good. He had a screen presence that very few actors, other than say John Wayne or Clint Eastwood have had. His performance combined with an excellent script, superb direction and great supporting performances, make for a movie that defines excellence in film-making from the golden age of cinema. If you want to see a James Cagney movie or just want to watch an old black and white classic, then this is the one to get!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angels With Filthy Souls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things I love most about Angels with Dirty Faces is that proposes the age old idea of a person's entire destiny being defined by one single event. The fact that Jerry (Pat O'Brien) could run faster than his childhood friend Rocky (James Cagney) while being chased by the police for a petty crime, would determine the paths they would take in life. If only Rocky could climb over that fence, things would have been so much different.I'm a huge fan of the Warner Bros gangster movies of the 1930's, and Angels with Dirty Faces is probably the most classic of these movies In that it gets referenced and spoofed most in popular culture. These films deal with social issues, many of which are still relevant today. When I hear current news stories about crime and social issues, I often find myself thinking "They dealt with that in an old 30's crime/gangster film". Angels with Dirty Faces is no exception. Rocky Sullivan was never truly a criminal, but his stay at a reformatory for his petty crime turned him into one. However Pat O'Brien's role of Father Jerry Connolly presents an incredibly stark contrast with today's common place media reports of priests molesting boys. I find it fascinating to see a movie in which a member of clergy is presented as someone who is treated with the utmost respect and entirely trustworthy, of course this being an attempt to appease the Legion of Decency.The Dead End Kids give Cagney an element to his performance few other actors would rarely get the chance to express. Cagney delivers what I consider to be the third best performance of his career (after White Heat and Yankee Doodle Dandy). However for most other actors, this performance would rank as their best performance; Cagney is just that phenomenal here. Humphrey Bogart also appears in a pre stardom supporting role. Despite only appearing in several scenes he nearly upstages Cagney with his enigmatic screen presence. Michael Curtiz is undoubtedly one of the greatest craftsmen of Hollywood's golden age (after all, in this same year he directed one of the most perfect things ever created, The Adventures of Robin Hood). The final climatic scene of Angels with Dirty Faces alone is a masterpiece of cinematography. Here Curtiz creates a criminal underworld which is hard not to get sucked into. We might not want to emulate gangsters, but we can't help but be fascinated by them.</fullReview>

Although the movie was made in the 30s, the plot is something that could be of a movie that was just released in the 80s, 90s, or now. This is truly Cagney's movie, and he steals every scene that he's in. As a viewer, you can't help but cheer for him. I feel that his main love interest isn't really fleshed out. We learn that she comes from a troubled past, but not much more. A few scenes that stand out are the pharmacy assassination attempt, and obviously the well-known scene where the priest asks something of Rocky that he doesn't want to give.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my mind, there is no title more apt for this film than "Angels with Dirty Faces." Every person has a little bit of good in them; they just might not display it until the time arises. We also do a lot of fun and daring things growing up. We learn from them and move forward, and this movie beautifully depicts how people with similar childhoods can diverge to live such different lives. This movie truly demonstrates how important both our experiences and upbringing are in moulding our futures. Ruffians initially, people can become saintly priests or remain criminals. Despite their different paths, though, it is important to note people do not simply forget their pasts. The relationships we make throughout our lives do not simply diminish as time progresses; instead, we learn to value and cherish what we once had. The world needs good people. To help with the injustices happening today and to nurture the next generations. Throughout Angels with Dirty Faces, we see a priest working tirelessly and honestly to support local youths, trying to ensure they learn proper morals and respect the world they live in. This movie shows a man fighting the good fight despite the world turning against him, and when his troublesome friend arrives, plans take a turn.Watching this movie is a truly humbling experience. It's always nice to remember that there are good people out there who are willing to work and take the extra mile for humanity. Even the people you'd least expect can surprise you in the most dire situation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I imagine this was a ground-breaking film in 1938. It features some morally complex characters - Cagney as bad guy Rocky Sullivan who tries to get out of his life of crime and Laury Ferguson (Ann Sheridan) as a social worker whose feelings about Rocky soften over time. The fact that there is some ambiguity seems to me the progression of film becoming a means of showing moral complexity, a big shift from cinema's early days when the "nickelodeons" were forums for light entertainment.In any case in the film, Rocky and his friend Jerry (Pat O'Brien and William Tracy as a boy) grow up as toughs but Jerry changes his ways while Rocky goes to the penitentiary. When he gets out, he goes straight for a while but old ties drag him back in, courtesy of corrupt lawyer (Humphrey Bogart). The question is whether Rocky is really selfish or whether he cares about some of the rough street kids over whom he has developed a great influence because of his reputation.The script and story are great and the acting is great from all the primaries. Really well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For such a rousing gangster picture to have a core heartbeat of sense and reason is quite an achievement, that Angels With Dirty Faces also pumps the blood at an accelerated rate makes it essential viewing for the genre and 30s cinema as a whole. The main scenes are unforgettable, be it the tough ones as the character of Rocky Sullivan is fleshed out, or the humorous (almost touching) ones such as a basketball sequence where Rocky teaches the young ruffian gang the lay of the land. Many films from the golden era had a central theme of childhood friends choosing different career paths, but Angels With Dirty Faces (or should that read Doity Faces?) is awash with great performances (Bogart shady weasel always a welcome boost) that are thriving on a wonderful script. The eye direction from Michael Curtiz is easy on the eye, and the finale is to me good enough to rank with the best that cinema has to offer. So for those reasons I believe that Angels sits proudly at the top of the tree as one of the best genre pieces ever made. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, it's hard to separate James Cagney from the character he created as Rocky Sullivan, the street wise punk who becomes a master criminal in "Angels With Dirty Faces". It's one of his quintessential roles, and one that sears itself into memory from the classic heyday of Warner Brothers crime and gangster dramas. Watching it just once leaves you thinking "Whaddya hear, whaddya say?" for days following; would that a current film could leave such an impact.The story follows the exploits of young hood Rocky after he takes the rap for a stockyard train car break in, while buddy Jerry (Pat O'Brien) high tails it on a quicker pair of legs. A montage of scenes depicts his graduation into a life of crime, making a name for himself while the jail sentences get longer and longer. Finding himself back in the old Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, Rocky takes up with a local gang, the familiar wise cracking Dead End Kids. They come to idolize the man who makes a mockery of the law, even as he knocks a few of their heads under the watchful eye of Father Connelly, the young Jerry grown up as the local parish priest.With Cagney and O'Brien heading the cast, it's easy to forget that another Warner heavyweight is part of the action. Humphrey Bogart usually took a back seat to fellow actors Cagney and Edward G. Robinson in the films they appeared in together. Bogie worked with Cagney three times, also supporting him in "The Oklahoma Kid", and sharing equal footing in another crime film, "The Roaring Twenties". Here, Bogie's character is Jim Frazier, a former Sullivan ally and now a top shelf lawyer for crime boss Mac Keefer (George Bancroft). Both run afoul of Rocky's temper and allegiance to friend Father Jerry, even as the priest threatens to expose the whole lot of them for the corrupt criminals they are.Also turning in a fine but very brief performance is the lovely Ann Sheridan; her best bit comes early when she gets her revenge on Rocky for a childhood torment. She comes to grow fond of Rocky, but their relationship is not enough to keep him out of trouble.I get a kick out of studying the different styles of gun play in both Western and gangster films. Cowboy Wild Bill Elliott usually "threw" his six shooter in the direction he was firing, while characters like the Lone Ranger usually just aimed and fired. Cagney has perhaps the most manic style in film, with a wild pumping motion as he lets the opposition have it.As usually found in the Warner Brother movies of the era, civic and moral dilemmas are generally solved with right winning out in the end. As Rocky prepares to walk the last mile with Father Jerry by his side, he's challenged to find "the kind of courage born in heaven". The camera work and lighting is exemplary in those final minutes, as Jerry implores Rocky to take a final courageous stand. As Rocky's face sneeringly appears dead on into the camera for one last time, it's followed shortly after by his anguished cries for pardon and escape from death. Rocky dies a "yellow rat", his execution leaving a question mark for the viewer to provide your own interpretation. If you can suppress a tear for the condemned Rocky Sullivan at this point, the film hasn't worked it's magic on you."Angels With Dirty Faces" is one of my all time favorites, and a must see for Cagney and Dead End Kids fans. The young toughs usually found themselves in some fairly sappy adventures, and the films in which they starred generally fail to satisfy. Here however, they're great in a support role, and get their comeuppance more than once at the hands of a master. That's why they're more than willing in the end to accompany Father Jerry when he says - "OK fellas, let's go and say a prayer for a boy who couldn't run as fast as I could."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney's Iconic Gangster Role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cagney first portrayed a gangster in "Public Enemy" and began to create an indelible screen image as a tough guy, which endured despite occasional forays into lighter fare like "Footlight Parade" and "Yankee Doodle Dandy." In the late 1940's, he took his gangster image into middle age and to the edge of madness in "White Heat." But his portrayal of Rocky Sullivan in "Angels with Dirty Faces" is the perfect embodiment of James Cagney, the screen's peerless tough guy. Cocky, arrogant, remorseless, Cagney's Rocky is an iconic portrayal of the 1930's gangster. Despite great support from Pat O'Brien, Anne Sheridan, and Humphrey Bogart, the film is Cagney's show, although he is off the screen much of the time. As the boy who did not run fast enough from a crime, was caught by the police, sent to reform school, and learned to be a criminal, Cagney dominates the film. He is the corrupt reflection of the O'Brien character, who was Rocky's boyhood friend, outran the police, and eventually became a priest. The film pits the two friends against each other in adulthood for the minds and souls of a group of young boys, who are amusingly played by Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, and the rest of the Dead End kids. The film builds to a powerful climax that is a classic scene in cinema history. The final powerful images and dialog will haunt the viewer and leave him or her to ponder whether or not Rocky had honored his lifelong friend's final request or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different but wonderful addition to Warner's gangster films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a surprisingly emotional gangster film that shows Cagney at the top of his game. Made in 1938, when gangster movies became legit again, the movie features two legends of the genre (Cagney and Bogart) as well as Pat O'Brien and Ann Sheridan both playing their parts wonderfully. The film is unlike most of Cagney's gangster pictures, firstly because he's not the antagonist, but it also seems to have a more benevolent agenda. Instead of concentrating of Cagney's dealings with Humphrey Bogart, it centers on his relationship with the priest, his childhood friend (O'Brien) and his relationship with the "Dead End" Kids. Not as violent as some of the other Warner Brother pictures, Angels With Dirty Faces centers more on the human drama than the violence. It does however have the thrilling collision of Cagney and Bogart as well as the factory shoot out. the cinematography and lighting is very well done and the look of the film doesn't feel tired. What sells the film is of course the ending sequence with Cagney and the electric chair, one of the most powerful moments of the film. The sort of sick morality it lends to the ending of the film for the Dead End Kids is fascinating. In the end, Angels with Dirty Faces, is a very different but effective gangster film that dares to move a little bit out of the crime aspect and into human drama. A worthy addition to Warner's blockbuster Gangster films, and to cinema itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the 4 Great Gangster Pictures of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDb's all time best film is THE GODFATHER. I say "forgetaboutit." No pretentious over-sized latter day movie can lay a glove on the raw edge of Public Enemy and Little Caesar - still **** commercial movies after 75 years. The other two greats were High Sierra and this picture. Nobody my age who watches movies hasn't seen Angels with Dirty Faces at least 5 or 6 times; it played actively in theaters right up to the era of VHS tapes, and was one of the first VHS classics.This picture boasts a great story, great direction, and great acting... including the "angels" played by Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall and the other (alternately) Dead End Kids, East Side Kids, Bowery Boys (88 films in all).This fine movie is, in my opinion, a better picture today than when it opened to rave reviews in 1938. The added asset is it takes you right inside New York's infamous Lower East Side --- a place which was torn down decades ago.There isn't one movie made in 2006 with a shelf life that might take it into next year --- let alone 70 years. There were literally dozens of 4-star classics released in 1938 and 1939. The films made today are as throwaway as a fast food wrapper. No quality, no substance, no artistic merit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Always remember: Don't be a sucker" - Rocky Sullivan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This crime/drama concerns two childhood friends that both grew up in Hell's Kitchen back in 1920th. Jerry Connelly (O'Brien) became a parish priest and the other, Rocky Sullivan (Cagney) ? the career criminal. The Angels of the title are the neighborhood boys whom Father Jerry tries to save from lives of crime and who have come to idolize the tough, fast, furious and cool guy Rocky. Yes, Cagney's Rocky was a criminal but one could not help rooting for him in every scene of the movie which he stole from the rest of the cast. Cagney is riveting as Rocky. When he talks, you want to listen, when he walks, you want to follow. Who would blame the Dead End Kids for wanting to be like him? Father Jerry does not blame them but he tries his best not to let that happened... "Angels with Dirty Faces" is a great movie, a true classic that combines an excellent crime movie with the characters like crooked lawyer (Humphrey Bogard) and corrupt politician (George Bancroft) with whom Rocky formed a doomed business alliance and a very human and compelling drama of two best friends, the choices they made, the roads they took and where the roads brought them. Great directing, writing, acting from everyone and absolutely brilliant performance from James Cagney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney and O'Brien at their finest...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't miss with Michael Curtiz at the helm, Max Steiner doing the music, Ann Sheridan and Humphrey Bogart in supporting roles, the Dead End Kids for "the kids", Pat O'Brien as a priest fighting gangland crime, and James Cagney as Rocky Sullivan, doing one of his best gangster impersonations.It's a tough crime drama with a tug of war between O'Brien and Cagney, boyhood pals, who find themselves reunited twenty years later when Cagney's out of prison and O'Brien's a priest. It's O'Brien's mission to try to save the "angels with dirty faces" from being filled with hero worship for Cagney's pugnacious villainy.The climactic scene has Cagney headed for the electric chair with O'Brien requesting that he show some streak of cowardice so the boys will stop using him as a role model for a life of crime.Once again, poor Bogart ends up writhing around on the floor riddled with bullets after he and George Bancroft double-cross Cagney. It's the typical Warner crime melodrama done with their usual finesse and well worth seeing if you're a fan of Cagney, O'Brien and Bogart--or the young Ann Sheridan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something More Than Just a Gangster Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Warner Bros. gangster classic features James Cagney as Rock Sullivan and Pat O'Brien as Father Jerry. They play two small time hoodlums who are the best of friends. Eventually one day they decide to steal from a boxcar and are spotted by the police. The child character of Pat O'Brian gets away while James's child character, Rocky, is caught and put into reform school. As the years go by Rocky continues to go down the path of a gangster while his friend takes the other road and becomes the priest of the church in their neighborhood.Not only is this story extremely original, but the lovable gangster James Cagney makes this movie work. When I sat down to watch it I believed it was yet another gangster picture of a man who works his way to the top and is then losses it all overnight. I was pleasantly surprised when I found that it was more about bravery. This movie goes where most gangster films don't and uncovers the sentimental side of a gangster and what he'll do to help the ones he cares for. I recommend this film to the not only the lovers of 1940 gangster pictures but to people who are interested in something more than just being entertained. People want to learn about what it means to be truly good and what it means to sacrifice for the right thing. This is probably Cagney's best role next to White Heat because he does something he never did before, HE CRIES!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is very well made, especially that ending. They didn't monkey around here, they let you know exactly what happens w/ the electric chair, pretty strong stuff for a 1938 flick. I am of the opinion that he faked the terror for his old pal O'Brien's sake, but of course others think otherwise. No matter--it's a chilling scene.The kids-Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, etc-essentially are the Stooges just younger, but as believable a street gang as you will find for such an old flick. (I also enjoyed seeing the contrast of old style Hoop vs the way it's played today--they ever hear of dribbling??) Weaknesses-well not many. O'Brien is a block of wood, rarely impresses me unfortunately. I wasn't so sure that Ann Sheridan would fall for Cagney given their history, and it's true she isn't given that much to do after awhile.Bogie was fun as a sniveling 'shyster' while George Bancroft made for a Claude Akins like baddie, I always think of him as the sheriff in 'Stagecoach'.Michael Curtiz made many great films-Casablanca and Robin Hood amongst'em-this one ranks up there too.*** outta ****. Cagney is great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful example of the Warner Brothers gangster flick of the 1930s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very, very similar to MANHATTAN MELODRAMA (MGM--1934), though this film combined this earlier flick with the Dead End Kids (an earlier incarnation of the East Side Kids or the Bowery Boys). Both films featured a smart and street-wise hood who is very likable (Gable and Cagney), a close fried who believes in them (William Powell as the DA and Pat O'Brien as a priest) and an ending in which the thug "does the right thing". As I said, the big difference was the addition of the Dead End Kids--as young punks who idolize Jimmy Cagney. And while I usually HATED the Dead End Kids/Bowery Boys/East Side Kids, in this film they were a pretty welcome addition, as they were used less as comic relief and more as integral parts of the story. Because of this, Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall (stars in the later incarnations of "the kids") were less stupid, annoying and important to the gang--being secondary characters at best.The story and acting is pure 1930s Warner Brothers gangster fare. While some might find this very, very formulaic and even dull, I like the predictability because the production values are so high and the films are just plain fun. Sure it isn't Shakespeare or Masterpiece Theatre, but it does entertain.</fullReview>

I'm convinced they are important.But along comes something like this that is so simple and pure, it throws all my obsessions with complexity into a cocked hat.This is so exceedingly simple and sappy and dumb and ordinary and stupidly moralizing that all of us would discard it if it were not for one thing: Cagney's character. And not even the fact that he created a character in the usual whole sense. Instead, he created a character acting a character (so I suppose there is folding after all).Cagney was essentially a dancer and here he does some somewhat obvious posturing, especially the shoulder reset tick.Can one motion carry a movie, even carry it into permanence? Yes, it seems so. Yes.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the eyes of the world you can be anything. In the eyes of friends only one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES is a film that has the original socio - critical message. The script and story are very allowed. Curtiz is in the heart of the story, but between two fires, put a rag-tag group of young. Interestingly, such a state viewed from the perspective of young boys. Criminals are always a role model. The time and place do not matter. Perception is dictated by socio - economic aspects of society.In this film, the main character is not only criminal but also the anti-hero. He was polished, charming, charismatic, accomplished, and of course rich. Rocky Sullivan played by James Cagney, is a portrait of the life times of such 'Angels with Dirty Faces "as the title of the film says. Rocky is not a bad person.This is a gangster movie, fast action and great culmination. The story is a complete and well rounded. The friendship of the two protagonists of this film is very strongly played. Cagney and O'Brien (Fr. Jerry Connolly) are excellent in their roles. Perhaps it is the strongest, which comes as the icing on the cake after a whole and dismissed the scenario, just what constitutes the epilogue of the story about two friends. The relationship of good and evil set through the prism of truth and falsehood. Friends are separated at an early age, others are bound heart and soul, and yet each had their fight. I wonder what would have happened if the roles were replaced at the beginning of the film? In the eyes of the world you can be anything. In the eyes of friends only one. The film is a dramatic and action equally good. Acting with visible improvisation, is at a high level. Bogart, Sheridan and Bancroft are not especially imposed.</fullReview>

Jerry managed to escape but Rocky is detained leading to a life of crime. Jerry becomes a priest and Rocky becomes a notorious gangster. James Frazier (Humphrey Bogart) is Rocky's corrupt lawyer. After getting out of prison, Rocky moves into a boarding house run by former classmate Laury Martin (Ann Sheridan). He takes an interest in a crew of petty criminals, The 'Dead End' Kids. The kids see him as their hero while Jerry tries to reform the boys. Rocky wants his share from Frazier and Frazier is willing to kill Rocky to keep it.The 'Dead End' Kids was a concept back in the day and this may be the best movie with this idea. In this one, they try to out-Cagney Cagney, but there is only one. He does his usual act plus much, much, more. It's a nice pairing with O'Brien and Bogie is a heavy. It's a classic crime melodrama of the highest quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was that age, growing up in Brooklyn, it must have been tough on the people around me. Why? Because we were always looking for something to do, anything to do and trouble is the easy thing to get going anywhere. That's what these guys portray so well and Cagney sets the pace. Here we see a group of kids with no guidance and poor leadership that if someone doesn't intervene, they are all going to turn out like Rocky in the movie. Who better then a priest to try to get them to stop and consider what they are doing and why? The perfect balance takes hold. Good and evil go at it with evil looking, sounding and feeling better but ending on a bad note. Or, you can do good which will lead you toward the life intended. If anyone can keep themselves from bawling at the end, I'll ask you why? Give in and let the lesson of the movie have its way with you. A good lesson it is too because someone dies to make the point. Sound familiar? Hats off to every involved with this picture. Enjoy the scenes of life way back when, the way they talked and what was popular for music, cars and dress. Definitely a move to eat while watching, tasty drink and snack too. Oh, and have something to wipe that dirty face of yours, the one that cries in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar gangster story with a youthful twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES has something different to distinguish it from the other gangster flicks starring James Cagney: the emphasis of this film is on a gang of feral youths he befriends (played by the 'Dead End Kinds) rather than he himself. So we still get the meteoric rise to fame and eventual downfall, but the narrative is slightly skewed so that a gang of innocents are the central focus.Inevitably, this is a film that still belongs to Cagney, who invests it with his typical energy and dynamism. Humphrey Bogart takes a minor supporting role but it's left to Pat O'Brien to bag the film's most challenging role, that of a former criminal turned priest. ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES has plenty of drama, action, and suspense to recommend it, and the tragic climax hits all the right chords.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie, unjustly forgotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this fascinating movie for the first time, I picked up a book, in one of those coincidences that life gives to us that are completely unlikely, with the name Famous Quotes From Famous People. And in one of the various quotes that were printed in the pages of that little book, there was one that caught my attention, because it corresponded to the opinion I formed about this excellent work of art that my eyes had the pleasure to behold. The quote is from Robert Frost, one of the greatest authors of north-American poetry, and he says: "It is absurd to think that the only way to tell if a poem is lasting is to wait and see if it lasts. The right reader of a good poem can tell the moment it strikes him that he has taken an immortal wound ? that he will never get over it." And if we change the "Poem" mentioned by Frost for "Movie", the opinion of the writer perfectly suits to Angels with Dirty Faces... and to many other movies I love, I confess. I say this because I think this film, directed by Michael Curtiz (the filmmaker who would make, some years later, that unforgettable classic called Casablanca, with Humphrey Bogart too, but here in Angels he has a supporting - but terrific! - role), has always been in the shadow of other great movies, much more popular, and this one had just endured because it obtained, over the decades, a legion of numerous fans of the treasures of Cinema (the picture has now a score of 8.0 on IMDb, which is very good). But if it were only "time" causes, as Frost said, Angels with Dirty Faces would be lost in that decade (not so) far away that was the thirties. If we expected the film would endure over the years (having neither great acclaim from critics the following decades, or the recognition of major institutions such as the American Film Institute), it would be as if it never existed. I mean, watching the quality of the negative (and we do not know if it is "the" negative) that was converted for the DVD so-so special edition of this motion picture, it's noticeable that it never had appropriate conditions of conservation (there are various faults, very visible, in the reels and in many frames, throughout the film).But I said the movie was in the shadow. And then I talk again in Casablanca. That is, probably, the most popular title from Michael Curtiz's filmography. But it hid many other great movies of the director, such as this one. And I love Casablanca, it is one of my other favorite movies of all time. But it's sad when a motion picture almost "destroy" all the work of a filmmaker who, by the way, was one of the greatest professionals in his area at that time, because Curtiz has so much to explore (in quality and in quantity - in the year Angels was release, Curtiz made three other movies, almost simultaneously. And today, that's a big achievement, if we compare with the super- productions, many of them so uninteresting, that take too long to be made...), and this wonderful picture is the example of that quality, of the American classic Cinema that is impossible to remake today, because they are of a decade and of a period of Hollywood where the excellence of the production of the great directors were so inspiring, touching, and original. Angels with Dirty Faces is a movie of a genre that was fashionable at the time it debuted: the gangster movies, and when were made terrific and terrible and "standard" titles in that genre. It is like the westerns. Many of them were made in the "golden ages" of the cowboy movie stories, but very few of them stood out. Many of the gangster movies had just beatings, corruption and vulgar love stories...However, there are always isolated spots in the middle of the ocean, and Angels with Dirty Faces elevates the genre of the gangster film to a higher level, as can also give some touches of film noir and good drama that attach to this work a superlative quality. The story is told in a fluid way, very quickly but without losing any shred of credibility.The result of this variety of stories (which are all very simple, but with more depth than they appear) is a powerful and unparalleled work in the Classic Cinema. Michael Curtiz's achievement is intelligent and emotionally overwhelming, and I enjoyed the strong use of light in the scenarios, the photography of the scenes (which loses some of its glimmer because of the degraded copy of the DVD), the performances of the actors, the script, which has great quotes and is very well planned, executed and interpreted. The soundtrack is excellent and fits perfectly with the whole film, being well selected and organized. I emphasize also the camera angles, approaching us from the characters and the environments that surround them (and with that Curtiz showed one of its greatest strengths and talents), and that was the cause of my excitement with the last moments of the film ((such as the apotheosis of Cagney and O'Brien, showing that friendship and human dignity has no limits, regardless of the environment in which we were born). Angels with Dorty Faces is, for me, and I say this without fear, a masterpiece. This movie shows how certain classics, even if they can not withstand the time, the lists of critics and all those things, they can always, if they're good, get a cult of fans delighted with it, managing to increase interest in discovering this movie treasures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quintessential Gangster Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my top five movies of all time. I won't make any commentary on the movie itself(not sure if citing one line of a movie constitutes a 'spoiler' violation).I've seen a lot of movies from the silent Sennett comedies, Fairbanks athletics, Cheney's makeup transformations right up through today's films (thank you old first-generation UHF and now TCM), but this one is the one that by which every good gangster movie since must be judged.The story is as intense as Scarface (both Muni and Pachino), or most any Cagney role from Public Enemy on. If you like movies like Petrified Forest, Casablanca, High Sierra you're going to see Bogart do it to perfection in his role. Of course, the Dead End Kids present a version of young 1930's era street-wise kids that by today's standards are gentle souls.I find all of the older movies fascinating glimpses into the times from which the movies were created; the cinematography, dialogue, city scenes, day-to-day living, the roadways of the day all provide a spectacular look at the past, and this 75 year old movie delivers that by the bucket-load.The actors are all top-tier, the storyline takes off like an F-16 and doesn't stop.Cagney sets the bar in this 75 year old film, and I haven't yet seen anyone surpassing him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is there life past the dead end?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before they simply became public nuisances as the bumbling Bowery Boys, the Dead End Kids were a definite threat to New York City law enforcement. In their second film, they are further downtown and have taken over the territory once controlled by James Cagney, who has just gotten out of prison, and Pat O'Brien, who has become a priest. A sick hero worship grows towards Cagney, and his old pal O'Brien desperately tries to stop it before it is too late. But with Cagney becoming involved with two-timing crook Humphrey Bogart, it is only a matter of time before Cagney crosses the line and there is no return.An exciting and brilliantly acted expose on the dangers in society, still riddled with crime following the end of the depression, this is just as much of a classic as its predecessor. Cagney instills his misguided character with identifiable human frailties, subtle humor and the obvious revelation that he really had no other alternative to any other life but crime based upon his unfortunate circumstances. However, crime has no acceptable spot in our society, so those who engage in that life must pay for it. Anne Sheridan is excellent as an old acquaintance who is equally tough and loving, and O'Brien's priest extremely well defined. Bogart is secondary to the plot, just as he was to other gangsters during this era like George Raft and Edward G. Robinson. Ironically the same year, Spencer Tracy would win an Oscar for playing a real life, similar character to O'Brien's in "Boy's Town".</fullReview>

And other than that, if that is even a fair quibble, the actors and the people behind the camera give a master class in storytelling. The opening scene shows the protagonists as children, offering a meaningful glimpse into the characters' past. Other background information, like Rocky's rise to the top ranks of the criminal underworld, his multiple incarcerations, and the fact that a couple of other con-men owe him big money, is conveyed in shorthand because it doesn't require full narrative treatment. This leaves more screen time for the playing out of the main drama: Rocky's clever re- rise as a hardened hood with a heart of gold, his expert touch with both friends and enemies, and, most significantly and memorably, the style of his fall. The sight and sound of Cagney and Bogart on screen together is not a thing to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the Best Of Great Gangster Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched all of Cagney's gangster films , and this one is the best. It delivers the best message, has the best acting and also benefits from the best cast assembled in any of Cagney's depression-era crime flicks. Rocky Sullivan's character is one that reverberates with us all, even the most hardened of criminals ( who aren't psychopathic) can relate to the ideas of regret and wishing you could so something good and atone for your misbehavior before leaving a world that was always rotten to you. Similarly, even a person who has led a life free of crime almost always wishes there was some way to atone for something they ha done at a certain point in their life. Redemption is a concept that hits home with everyone. Bogart plays his part as the deceptive 'pal' perfectly and with his trademark style , but is out-shined in this movie by the sensitive Father Jerry Connolly( portrayed by Pat O'Brien) - Rocky's childhood friend, a man who is fighting for the hearts and minds of a group of teens; fighting with the allure of Rocky's tough, flashy, never-say-die lifestyle and image. Watch the brilliant camera work during the scene where Rocky is being led to his execution, the shadows, the grim, defiant expression on Cagney's face, and then, the most famous scene of all - a scene shown only in shadow. Its a fantastic end to a classic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend of Rocky Sullivan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES (Warner Brothers, 1938), directed by Michael Curtiz, is a classic in every sense of the word. Starring James Cagney in one of his most recognizable characters of his career, it also teams him once again opposite Pat O'Brien for the sixth time. Playing boyhood pals who grow on opposite sides, it's a familiar plot used numerous time before and since. What makes this one most successful is how an oft-told story be made to appear as original as if it were being told for the very first time.Whaddya hear, whaddya say about the story? Well, the plot goes like dis. It starts off with a prologue as the camera captures a glimpse the newspaper headline reading "Harding nominated president," before panning through the tenement section of New York where laundry is being put out to dry hanging on extended clotheslines connected from one building to the other. Also hanging around Dock Street are a couple of teen pals, William "Rocky" Sullivan (played by the remarkable Cagney look-a-like, Frankie Burke ) and Jerry Connolly (William Tracy, spelled Tracey in the credits). Rocky, a wise guy, spots three gals walking by, teasing Laury Ferguson (Marilyn Knowlden) to a point of her swearing vengeance on him some day. Later, Rocky and Jerry attempt on stealing supplies on a boxcar, only to be noticed and chased by the authorities. Jerry breaks away while Rocky is caught and sentenced to Warrington Reform School. During the prohibition era, the adult Rocky (James Cagney) continues making newspaper headlines with his life of crime. After serving time in the state penitentiary, Rocky returns to his old neighborhood where he takes up residence in a rundown rooming house on 24 Dowd Street where the now grown Laury (Ann Sheridan) also resides. After Laury gets even with Rocky, they call a truce and become friends. Rocky soon locates his pal, Jerry (Pat O'Brien), now a parish priest. Through the course of time, Rocky contacts his lawyer, James Frazier (Humphrey Bogart), who owes him $100,000. Frazier, a man not to be trusted, in partnership with crime boss, Mac Keefer (George Bancroft), manager of a gambling casino, makes ever effort to keep Rocky from wanting his share in the business, but with little success. As Rocky establishes a bonding with a group of tough neighborhood teenagers, Soapy (Billy Halop), Bim (Leo Gorcey), Patsy (Gabriel Dell), Crab (Huntz Hall), Swing (Bobby Jordan) and Hunky (Bernard Punsley) who soon idol worship him, Father Connolly tries to discourage the boys from following Rocky's life of crime. When all else fails, the priest risks his very own life by going public to expose Rocky and the mobster friends.ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES has very few flaws that they can easily be overlooked. Though the film could have been titled "Glorifying the American Gangster," in many ways it starts off that way, but becomes a glorification in a different way. That's one of the secrets to this film's success that make it one of the most recognizable movie titles in the Cagney filmography. The supporting players have an equal hand in this one, too. Bogart, the villain, and Sheridan, the street smart city girl, each not yet major star attractions, do what's required of them, and more. O'Brien should not go unnoticed with his excellent portrayal of a loyal friend and caring priest still handy with his fists whenever needed. Michael Curtiz's fine direction and attention to detail with visuals, lighting and realistic gun-play give this movie plenty of action and suspense to hold interest for 97 minutes. The Dead End Kids, as they are billed, resume their scene stealing tactics that's made them immensely popular in both the stage and screen adaptations of Sidney Kingsley's DEAD END. Having worked on screen with Bogart in both the classic DEAD END (1937) and the nearly forgotten CRIME SCHOOL (1938), this time the slap-happy, tough talking teens have to hold their own opposite Cagney. Their scenes together give the film that special flavor, but in the long run, it's Cagney, not the Dead End Kids, who gathers the best notices, especially after that now famous closing scene very much responsible for both Cagney's Academy Award nomination and keeping the legend of Rocky Sullivan very much alive throughout the course of time.Though Warners later released THE ANGELS WASH THEIR FACES (1939), with Ann Sheridan and the Dead End Kids, it's not a continuing saga but the use of same actors bearing different character roles in the same or at least similar New York poverty district. Aside from availability initially on home video in the 1980s and later DVD (with commentary by Dana Polan and several more extras), Rocky Sullivan and his ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES can be seen and entertained on Turner Classic Movies.

		<fullReview>James Cagney out-shined in his role, all of the other actors in the film. His charismatic charm, mixed with his solid acting and manic stance, made him one of Hollywoods most talented under the spotlight. As Rocky Sullivan, he epitomised the criminal fraternity, of that era. All in all, it's one of the best movies that I have had the pleasure of seeing in my lifetime as a movie fan. If as a child I role played these type of genre, I was always seen playing the Jimmy Cagney character, and would often be heard shouting that well-established "You dirty rat!" All in all, I have to give this movie a massive 10 out of 10, for both hard hitting action, as well as storyline plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most asked query is whether or not the lead character, gangster Rocky Sullivan (James Cagney) turns 'yellow' when he is sent to the electric chair. Of course, anyone knowing anything of gangsters, and watching the prior parts of the 97 minute film (not 78, as wrongly noted on the DVD cover), can find no evidence to support such a claim. But, that's precisely why so many ask such a superfluous question- that's what people tend to do when something is so obvious.The film was directed by Michael Curtiz, who later directed Casablanca and Mildred Pierce. He does the usual serviceable job here, but there's no spectacular camera work by cinematographer Sol Polito, nor any memorable scoring by Max Steiner. The screenplay rises above the usual melodrama, even though it has some simplistic moments, and moves very quickly (almost too quickly, at times), setting up the bulk of the film's characters' motivations in less than nine minutes. It was written by Rowland Brown, John Wexley, Warren Duff, Ben Hecht, and Charles MacArthur. But, the obvious weak links are with the characters of Laury and the Kids. Like most love tales, this one is wedged oddly into this tale, and is quite underdeveloped. And the scenes with the Kids seem forced and unreal, for they are never developed as characters, and exist merely as symbols. The film veers towards being a cheap comedy in those moments. Had both of those angles been dropped, and more development of the Rocky-Jerry relationship been pursued the film would have been better. Of course, the film works mainly because of Cagney's bravura performance. It's as good as in other films, and contrasts with O'Brien's portrayal of the priest. Cagney got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance- the first of his career (he would win a few years later with Yankee Doodle Dandy), and it was well deserved, and even won the New York Film Critics Award for best actor.Now, let me end where I began, on the debate over Rocky's being yellow or not. Regardless of how one views it, this is a fine film- not great cinema, and maybe not even near great, but entertaining, moving, and well made. Oddly, it's a much finer film than either of Curtiz's two more lauded films, mentioned above, even if it's not nearly as well recalled by fans and regarded by critics. It's clear that Rocky is faking his breakdown in the end. First, the film could not be what it is without such. Rocky needs to be redeemed, and having him truly be a coward make shim all the more reprehensible. Recall, the Hays Board wanted uplift, and the last scene of the film, where Jerry lies to the boys and they rise up cellar stairs in almost heavenly fingers of light, mirrors the scene, moments earlier, where Rocky ascends beyond prison bars in light. Rocky is clearly headed for salvation. But, aside from the diegetic necessity of the moment, Rocky clearly has only one weak spot- his care for others. It's why he, not Jerry, is caught and sent to reform school; it's why Jerry is alive, and Rocky on Death Row for killing a cop; and it's why he saves the life of Laury when he's first ambushed by Keefer's men. Rocky is neither a psychotic nor a psychopath. He has a clear set of ethics- right or wrong, and lives and dies by them, for he is willing to do so. And he clearly shows no fear in the face of death. In fact, it is Jerry who, in many ways, comes off as the more ethically alarming figure, for he follows no consistent ethic. He originally lets Rocky take the fall for the train robbery, then smugly declaims his virtue throughout the film, even as it's clear he has no real understanding of the younger generation. He also seems to miss many of the key motivations of human beings that Rocky instantly is aware of. Yet, through all of this, the man seems to have no real sense of loyalty to the man who saved his ass several times, takes no responsibility for his own actions, up to and including the lie to the Kids, who, if this film were truly a bit of social realism, not melodrama, would have easily called bullshit on the priest. Finally, he seems to have no real regard for Rocky, save as a means to his own end, whereas Rocky even tells Jerry, when caught by the train bulls, that his getting nabbed was just the breaks. Rocky is a criminal and killer, but he's a mature, responsible one. Jerry is an immature, irresponsible coward. One even wonders if, when Rocky caterwauls, Jerry is praying for Rocky's soul or thanking God for once again manipulating his friend for his own means, whose ends are justified because Jerry says so (lying- even for an ostensibly good cause- is still considered a sin, no?) Finally, there are only two choices re: the ending: Rocky is truly a sniveling coward (belied by his saving of Jerry's life at least twice) or Rocky is redeemed. Reality (diegetically or not) point conclusively to the latter choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crime and Punishment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing more modern movies (Scarface, Goodfellas) we see that they got a lot of their inspirations from Studio Era crime movies. More specifically, Angels with Dirty Faces sticks out.We are treated to Cagney playing a criminal in and out of jail. He seems almost born for this role which is probably which he plays it in many movies. The film moves very quickly and uses a lot of sliding camera shots to engage the audience. It almost looks as though it was filmed today with some of the sweeping shots through the city.The main message we get from the story is that crime does not pay. We follow Cagney and not the priest throughout the movie, so we empathize with him. This makes the blow at the end more harsh. The end of the movie does send a sparkle of possible good to come from the following generations, so we are somewhat at piece.Highly recommended for anyone with a taste in American cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good versus Evil?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happens when good and evil turn out to be childhood chums? This classic, with movie greats Cagney and Bogart, unknowingly address the question of nature versus nurture, with the two inevitably blending into one element of character development. The result is the manufacture of blind hope that oil and water, or more like elemental sodium and water, will somehow combine without calamitous result. The story was wonderfully infused with a moral fundament that is never stuffed down our throats, taking on the impetuous of the social evils of the day sans judgment. Our players are up for the job, turning in worthy performances on all accounts, not without a few bumps and bruises from the Dead End Kids. The direction and camera work are all on par for a flick of high caliber, with closeups and angles that punctuate all the right moments, all of this to be followed by a moral decision that most could not bear. "What do ya hear what do ya say?" Well, I say that this is a flick that should find as apt an audience today as any of yesteryear.Genruk of Evil Eye Reviews</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well, listening to the other reviews, they look at the acting and technical aspect of the film. I will not do that. I will give you an honest answer as to why this movie pops into my head whenever people are talking about the greatest films of all time. But first, i would like to point something out to you. I never would have seen or heard of this movie if it was not for TCM. So thanks TCM. But isn't it strange how, whenever critics talk about classic films, all they ever mention is Citizen Kane,Gone With the Wind,Rebel without a cause, or Casablanca. In fact, a Cagney film is not even mentioned. I could only watch Rebel for five minutes, literally five minutes, and then i had to change the channel, i did not care to go back to it. All i saw of Citizen Kane was, well, nothing, my mother said it was like tearing her hair out with her toes, i believe my mother. I don't trust those critics, so i didn't bother to see the other two. So why does this film pop into my head often? Well, heres the answer. films like Lord of the Rings and Toy Story both have three films in the trilogy. The endings of both films are as emotional as anything we've ever seen in a film, or is it? Angels With Dirty Faces is roughly 80 minutes long, and it manages to build up more emotion by the ending that you will ponder how it made you feel for the rest of your life. The only movie to beat Angels with its emotion would be The Passion Of the Christ. Mel's the Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, timeless and poignant film about friendship and redemption.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, "Angels With Dirty Faces" is one of the greatest films of all time.The story of two hoodlum kids; one who gets caught, one who doesn't. The kid who gets caught ends up going through the justice system and ends up being killed by it. The kid who doesn't ends up being a priest. Those of us who grew up around crime will see this at worst as slightly extreme and at best as utterly realistic. Either way, it works well as a plot.This is my favorite performance by James Cagney. Not for one second do we doubt him as the quintessential bad ass. As believable as Pacino in "Scarface," more rebellious than DeNiro in "Taxi Driver" and as likable as Slater in "True Romance." Up until the final scene, Cagney pulls it off perfectly. He is unphased and mean in the face of death.I love the ending, when we see his shadow before he goes to the electric chair. His phony breakdown and his hands grasping to save himself. What a powerful message to have in a movie that came out over 70 years ago.To say it was ahead of it's time would be a ridiculous understatement. It is STILL ahead of it's time. Try showing it to kids today and you'll see what I mean. Boy, how they have changed...I wonder if it's for the better.10 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director Michael Curtiz comes a brilliant Warner Bros. gangster picture, "Angels with Dirty Faces", featuring a superlative cast of thespians: James Cagney, Pat O'Brien, Ann Sheridan, Humphrey Bogart, George Bancroft, and the "Dead End" Kids. Cagney plays William "Rocky" Sullivan, a notorious gangster with a "kiss my ass" attitude, around whom trouble always swirls and over whose eyes the wool can never be pulled. In short, Rocky has the town in the palm of his corrupt hand, thus influencing probably hundreds of other younger thugs, six of whom are played by the Dead Ends. Amazingly, one of Rocky's best friends is Father Jerome "Jerry" Connelly (Pat O'Brien), who as a youngster fought &amp; stole with Rocky but has now taken the straight &amp; narrow path into priesthood. Realizing that Rocky hasn't changed over the years, Father Jerry strongly urges Rocky not to encourage the younger generation to admire him. Rocky's lawyer is James "Jim" Frazier (Humphrey Bogart), a severely dishonest man with a gang of his own, trying to delay as long as he can the exchanging of $100,000 to Rocky.My favorite scenes from this impressive feature film include the following. When showing Rocky to his room, Laury Martin (Ann Sheridan) slaps him and pulls down his hat, something she waited fifteen years to do, after which Rocky's bed collapses. I love the basketball sequence with the Dead End Kids, during which the cheating never stops, especially when Rocky takes over as the ref. I also like the poolroom sequence with its atmospheric piano music, as well as Father Connelly's act of slugging a patron (Dick Wessel). Rocky briefly shoots it out with some of Frazier's hoodlums on the rooftop of the El Toro, with great musical accompaniment by Max Steiner. In probably the most emotionally effective sequence in the picture, Father Connelly is in tears when Rocky feigns being scared stiff going to the electric chair (Jerry had persuaded Rocky to discourage the Dead End Kids by acting scared, so that the kids no longer worship Rocky in their memories; Rocky flatly refuses to perform this act until the very last few seconds of his life). And finally, I can recall once having a tear in my own eye upon listening to the St. Brendan's Church Boys Choir at the very end of the picture, when Father Jerry persuades the Dead End Kids to join him in a prayer for a boy who couldn't run as fast as Jerry could.The various urchins played by the Dead End Kids in "Angels with Dirty Faces" are completely unlikable thugs, devoid of any vestige of proper conduct. I'm not convinced that reformation is right around the corner for these youngsters at the closing of this film. One can only hope so after the end credits.</fullReview>

He's just not a face you hear much about these days, I suppose, unless you're a student of film history or if you have a crazy uncle who once dreamed of being a mafioso but now runs a dry cleaner (I'm in the latter category). The one thing I can say is Cagney is a dancer in his heart, and each scene featuring the actor comes alive with the kind of energy you expect from a cabaret performer. The guy just robs the screen.

		<fullReview>Angels with Dirty Faces is one of the best gangster movies of classic Hollywood because it is not only about a gangster. Rather, it is about his life, the rise and fall of his role as a criminal who still maintains a friendship with his boyhood pal who has gone the complete opposite route as a priest.Here James Cagney portrays Rocky Sullivan, a tough-guy all his life who still has a place in his heart for Jerry Connolly (Pat O'Brien), a soft-spoken parishioner who tries desperately to reform the young kids on the street. Both see this, and both have their own ideas about what these kids' futures should be. The film delves much further than just two boys on opposite sides of the law. Rather, here we see Rocky as his ambition turns to fruition but Jerry as he struggles to win over these wanna-be tough kids. These guys have opposing world-views but commonly care for these kids and each other. The way director Michael Curtiz works them together is one of the great treasures of this movie.We also get Humphrey Bogart in a supporting role as a weakling of a lawyer and Ann Sheridan as the woman who attempts to see through Rocky's hard shell. As I said before, this is a better gangster film than say Scarface or Little Caesar because it takes the criminal life seriously. Here, we see the roots and consequences of that ravishing lifestyle. We also get the message that there are common bonds that transcend our normal lifestyles. Truly one of the premiere films of the 1930s, this is a classic that must always be remembered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney: A True Craftsman At Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of James Cagney's most memorable roles sees him play gangster Rocky Sullivan who returns to his old slum neighbourhood after a spell in 'da big house'.We are first introduced to Rocky as a teenager with his pal Jerry Connolly whom roam the streets of the neighbourhood looking for ways to make a quick dollar. On one fateful occasion they rob a freight car full of fountain pens but are discovered by rail workers, in a desperate bid to escape, they make a run for it. Jerry gets away but Rocky is caught and sent to the reformatory. A montage sequence then shows the intervening years in Rocky's life and as his age increases so does the severity of his Crimes.When finally released from Prison, he returns to his old neighbourhood and it is here we find that Jerry's life has taken different turn altogether. He's now a priest, (played by Pat O'Brien), with every intention of keeping the street kids of the present, (played by the Dead End Kids), on the straight and Narrow.Rocky, in his sharp suit and with a billfold so thick it could choke a horse, becomes a figure of hero worship to these kids as he is a tangible example of what they see as a local kid making good and that crime DOES pay after all.Sadly, Rocky hasn't learnt any lessons as he's still very much involved with his old crooked Lawyer, Frazier, (Humphrey Bogart) and mob boss Keefer, (George Bancroft), but away from the rackets he finds romance with local girl and butt of his old childhood jokes, Laury Ferguson, (Ann Sheridan).With Rocky once again descending back into to a life of crime, and the kids ever further under his spell, Father Jerry goes public with a campaign to wipe organised crime from the streets and personally single's out his friend Rocky as a target. which ultimately ends with Rocky's last mile walk to the death house.Moments before Rocky is to executed in the Electric Chair, Father Jerry implores Rocky to die 'yella' to show the kids that there has been nothing honourable in either his life or his death. Rocky refuses and is led away to his death with a look of firm defiance etched on his face, until......Angels With Dirty Faces is a triumph in movie making and that's not surprising as it was a film that had the brilliant Michael Curtiz at the helm, who directed more movies now considered to be classics than any other director before or since.In my view, Angels With Dirty Faces is not really a crime movie, it's a film about three relationships. The relationship between Rocky and Father Jerry, the relationship between Father Jerry and the Kids and the relationship between the Kids and Rocky, with even the 'crime' subplot only really needed in order to get Rocky where he ultimately needs to be, in the death house.For years after, people always used to ask James Cagney as to whether Rocky really did die yella or was faking it for the sake of the kids. His answer was always the same. He played it with 'deliberate ambiguity' in order for the audience to arrive at such a decision for themselves as to what were the final motives of Rocky Sullivan. In that one scene and with that one action, the world was shown that James Cagney was a master at his craft, a genius in the art of screen acting.Enjoy!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A signature WB 'Gangster' film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warner's christened the 'Gangster' genre with "Little Ceaser" and Cagney's "Public Enemy" and suddenly re-lit the fire of the genre with "Angels.." not only great storyline but fine castings. Cagney and O'Brien had been cast in buddy films a few times prior and were excellent pals off the screen (though opposites just the same), and the film's fork in the road angle made for a great contrast. While Rocky's delinquent was crafted into cold machine, Jerry's escaped delinquent not only wishes to take the rap but turns over the new leaf as a result... "Don't be a sucker!" As many of the films of the time (see director 'Wild' Bill Wellman as a reference) preached of the system's failings, "Angels.." gave us the proof. Rocky's cold and heartless machine returns to the old home ghetto to churn the next generation of 'Rockys' without even knowing it, while Father Jerry not only prays for his pal's soul, but his downfall. Throw the rather sweet yet sensual Ann Sheridan into the mix and you have a movie. Warner's usual ploy of root for the gangster but cheer for his fall is in full swing as we see it through the eyes of the 'Dead End Kids' angels with dirty faces... their hero dies a coward. Or does he? Cagney, often asked about his performance in Rocky's final scene, always said he left ambiguous for a reason. You watch and you decide. A good film will always make you question or perhaps say 'That could happen', but a great film will often leave you saying "Hey...did that.. wha?" (but in a good way) A great classic film.. a popcorn movie all day long and no bathroom breaks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers. Going to the end. Cagney going to the chair. Becoming yellow. Screaming out in agony.When I was going for surgery, I was screaming out ala Cagney's lines. I thought surely I would die on the operating table. I actually thought of Cagney in this movie, beforehand. I did wake up, actually, but I still have a powerful memory of my fears pre-surgery.Well, Cagney showed those kids what would happen if they continued their lives of punkdom -- showing that crime does not pay.I did like the parts where he shows them he knows all their secrets, and how they find out he wrote the book while they were still in their baby carriages. He follows them to their hideout (his old hideout?), and forces them to give him back the money they stole, plus scares the living daylights out of them with the fake-gun (his hand) in his pocket. When they find out he is a famous gangster, they are suddenly all hero-worshipful.I did enjoy seeing the lovely Ann Sheridan, whom I saw in King's Row with Ronald Reagan and Robert Cummings. She is always a delight, and quite intelligent.I enjoyed seeing Pat O'Brien interact with Cagney. I know they were in other movies together, but I especially enjoyed seeing them in Ragtime, their final one. They were both elderly by that time, but the spark never left them.I certainly loved Cagney in Yankee Doodle Dandy. He was awesome in Midsummer Night's Dream. His gangster movies are an important stereotype, even though he qualified IRL as a Master Tap Dancer. In Angels with Dirty Faces, he softens up in order to show the delinquents some type of love and affection that maybe they were missing from their own families.This movie: 15/10. A fantastic classic. The personality portraits are just superb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly REAL homicides in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very well made movie,with good performances by all concerned.However, most people are unaware that one scene was much more "realistic" than they imagine. In his autobiography Pat O'Brien tells a typical story of Mike Curtiz's sadism.In the scene where the boy actors playing Cagney and O'Brien as boys are fleeing through the rail yard,it appears that they are nearly run down by a switch engine.Most people would figure that this was merely an illusion, trick photography. It was not;those boys came as close to being killed as it appears.Curtiz had carefully instructed the engineer as to exactly what speed he was to operate the locomotive in that scene,and the engineer was careful to follow instructions precisely.After the scene was over, and the engineer saw just how near he had come to killing the two boys, he was so shaken that he could barely climb down from the engine. When he recovered,he went over to Curtiz and demanded to know what was going on. Curtiz smiled with satisfaction and said"VERY GOOD.I deliberately did not tell those boys that you would be going so fast because I wanted it CLOSE!" O'Brien said that only quick work by the film crew prevented the engineer from killing Curtiz with his bare hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic movie which really surprised me. I watched it on the TCM day channel. What I liked especially was the last scene. "Did the priest lie to the boys when he told that the newspapers were true in the news reports about Rocky and how he ended as a coward?". What was the purpose of this lie, if it was a lie?! Would it make a difference?! The purpose of this lie, again ... if it was a lie; is clear. It's all about saving those boys from following their hero into big crime. But, would that be wrong? According to their hero it was not wrong. For him it was even the only thing to do. Otherwise he'd be just as gullible as many other people are. Still, living a life at any time being on the edge because other hooligans are trying to be in your shoes?! Anyway, what appealed to me too was a great friendship between to men that stayed friends, even when they'd grown totally apart.

		<shortDescription>Great 1939 Film Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have not seen this picture in a long time but it is always a great treat to view it again, because it shows just what New York City's Hell's Kitchen looked like on the East Side of Manhattan in the 30's. There were old tenement homes and people use their windows to hang out their laundry to dry in the Summer. This film starts out with two boys, Rocky Sullivan, (James Cagney) and Jerry Connolly, (Pat O'Brien) and they are typical poor boys who have fun fooling around and stealing things from people. As time goes bye, these two boys grow up and go their separate ways in life. Rocky Sullivan wound up in reform school, and then prison and took the rap for James Frazier who owed Rocky his share of the money which was $100,00.00. When Rocky gets out of the pen, he comes looking for Frazier who is now a lawyer and he does not want to part with this money and that is when the story becomes full of action and killing. The "Dead End Kids" gave a great supporting role and Pat O'Brien, (Jerry Connolly) was outstanding playing the role as a priest. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Setting the Bar higher in the Juvenile Delinquent sub-genre of the Gangster Film. The One they're all compared to.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Kingsley's socially conscious drama DEAD END played on Broadway from October 1935 until June of 1937 for a total of 687 performances. The powerful play didn't go unnoticed on the West Coast, so the screen rights were purchased post haste by Samuel Goldwyn and the screen adaptation of DEAD END (1937) was released for all the World to view.But it wasn't just the screen rights that were taken from Broadway to Tinsel Town, for the group of young toughs, who many thought were actual delinquents from the Slums got Movie Contracts from Mr.Goldwyn. So, Billy Hallop, Leo Gorcey, Hunyz Hall, Gabriel Dell, Bobby Jordan and Bernard Punsly headed west to fame and fortune on the Silver Screen. Also making the trek West was Marjorie Main in order that she might reprise her role as Mrs. Martin, mother of "Baby Face".Once DEAD END was completed, Mr. Goldwyn sold the contracts of the young guys to Jack Warner, Studio Chief of his namesake company. Once there, they were put to work on some rather serious socially conscious movies like THEY MADE ME A CRIMINAL, CRIME SCHOOL, HELL'S KITCHEN and with James Cagney, Pat O'Brien and Anne Sheridan, ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES.And so we have today's victim, which probably has some of the greatest single scenes and characters in film history. Surely it may well be the quintessential Gangster-Young Toughs movie from the Golden Era of the Sound Film (formerly called "Talkies".) I mean this ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES seemingly has just about anything you could want. We have an opening scene in the "old Neighborhood" where the principal characters of Rocky Sullivan (James Cagney) and Fr. Jerry Connelly (Pat O'Brien) had spent their youth as tough, street guys. The Juveniles playing the young men are Rocky (young Cagney look-alike, Frankie Burke) and Fr. Connelly (William Tracy).The pivotal incident occurs when the two young friends are walking (trespassing) through the Train Yards when they happen on some box car has cases of fountain pens, which they decide to pilfer. The Railroads Dicks come along, and in attempting to flee the scene, young Rocky gets caught and sent to Reform School; but refuses to implicate Jerry on anyone else.We're next treated to a montage of Rocky's headlines and hold-ups. Meanwhile, Jerry winds up going to the Seminary to study for the Priesthood.Well, years pass and we have a great reunion, back in the old 'hood" where one man is now the Parish Priest, the other an up and coming ex-con and racketeer. Oh, yeah I almost forgot to mention! Anne Sheridan is there; her character also was a child of the old stompin'grounds.We're not going to elaborate on the re-cap of the story any more. We all know the story, more or less. The two friends from the same old neighborhood, running together as kids and one becomes a Priest, the other a Hood. One ends up paying the price, but can do a great service to the other and the current kids in the area. Could this be just a trifle cliché ridden? It seems that way because this was the one movie that set the standards and invented the complex situations that were so widely imitated.And that friends adds up to a one of a kind, singular, masterpiece of the cinematic arts and a huge slice of what America and its people are really all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent early crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two childhood friends--Jerry Connolly (Pat O'Brien) and Rocky Sullivan (James Cagney) grow up on different sides of the law. Connolly becomes a priest running a church in the bad section of town and trying to steer a bunch of kids (the Dead End Kids) away from trouble. Sullivan becomes a gangster and the kids idolize him and start to turn bad.The story is familiar by now but this was the first of its kind and, as usually is the case, is the best of its kind. Quick-moving, beautifully acted and well-directed by Michael Curtiz. Ann Sheridan and Humphrey Bogart are surprisingly bad in small roles--but they're given little to do. O'Brien is good, if a little TOO nice, as the priest. The Dead End Kids convincingly play juvenile delinquents. But this is Cagney's picture all the way. He's just great and you can't take your eyes off him when he's on screen. The script is tight and well-written also. It all leads to a great gunfight and a powerful finale. Basically one of the best gangster pictures of all time. Don't miss this one! I only give it an 8 because the story IS overly predictable and the lousy acting from Sheridan and Bogart hurts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angels With Dirty Faces- Great film. I've always had this interest in gangsters with morals despite the fact that they do horrible things.Thats what Cagney is in this film. As a child he and his best friend were young street punks, one day robbing a train cart he gets busted while his friends gets away. This leads to Cagney growing up to become a known gangster while his friend becomes a priest.Back in his old town years later he talks to his friend for the first time in 15 years. They both wanted to contact each other but couldn't for one reason or another, mostly Cagney being on the run all the time. But they obviously still have a brotherly love for each other.The priest runs a program for young teens to keep them off the street but the kids are street kids and find Cagneys way of life more interesting. They look at him like a role model, a hero.The priest tells Cagney that the only way to show the kids the right way is to fight crime in the city head on and tells Cagney that that means taking even him down if he has to. And this is why I love the film so much, unlike most gangsters Cagney loves his friend and tells him to do what he as to do and that he understands.meanwhile Cagneys business "partner"(Bogart) Decides the priest needs to be killed in order to shut him up. Cagney instead kills Bogart and in the end faces a life sentence for protecting his friend.(he kills a cop or two in a shut out trying to escape, so again not a good guy but not without some morals)Cagney isn't afraid to die, he spits at the guards, laughs at death, etc. and the children love him and idolize him even more. Then at the end before heading off to the electric chair the priest asks Cagney to act scared before he dies, to die a coward begging for mercy so that the children will see it written in the paper, so that he will not die a hero to them and in return the priest will have a chance to get through to them.Cagney walks to the chair tough as can be but then at the last moment starts crying and begging for Mercy, all because his friend asked him to.On a side note Frankie Burke who played Cagney's character as a boy was spot on. I honestly thought it was Cagney made to look young for a while.And Ann Sheridan though not as known as other actresses of yesteryear once again remind that they don't make actresses like they used to.Anyway, a beautiful film, a beautiful gangster film....yep such a thing exists.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this for the first time in maybe twenty years the other day, and it was a little like coming face-to-face with a rarely seen uncle you used to worship as a child. Twenty years later, it still looks good, but somehow some of the charisma has worn away. Perhaps it's me that's changed and not the film, but whatever the reason, I've knocked a couple of stars off its rating.Cagney is one of my favourites, and he was at his peak here, despite his ongoing battles with Warners. He's his typically pugnacious self, strutting across the screen, nervously hitching his shoulders and stretching his neck as if his collar is too tight, delivering back-handers with a curled lip. Bogart is unrecognisable from his later persona, a weasely lawyer out to cheat Cagney's Rocky Sullivan out of the $100,000 he owes him. It's almost the same role he played in The Roaring Twenties, their other outing from the same period, and it's a shame that they never played against each other once Bogie's tough-guy persona had been perfected. Just imagine what sparks could have flown then.The main reasons the film didn't quite live up to my expectations/memories are two-fold. Firstly, the Dead End Kids are just downright annoying with their endless yelling and sniping. Out of them, for me, it's only Leo Gorcey who comes out with any credibility, the rest are just interchangeable yells with no depth or characterisation. The other problem is the pious saintliness of Pat O'Brien's Father Connelly. Cagney acts the socks off him, because he sounds like a Noo Yawk gangster, while O'Brien sounds like no one I've ever met ? priest or otherwise. It's not necessarily his fault ? it's the way those parts were played back then ? but there it is. He is also the most impotent of characters, unable to coax the kids away from the life of crime into which they're drifting, unable even to come up with any ideas of how to do so? Despite those ? admittedly small ? gripes, the film is still a great way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon. Cagney slips into his role with ease, and demands your attention in every scene. The story zips along, and the ending, of course, is a classic ? possibly the greatest open-ended finale in movie history. Did Rocky turn yellow? I don't think so, somehow. He acts too bravely throughout the rest of the movie to become a coward in the final scene, and that core of decency in Sullivan is always visible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-done gangster who'll always be a gangster movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 5/6/2007 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Michael Curtiz): Well-done gangster who'll always be a gangster movie with James Cagney playing a boy who gets caught trying to steal cases of ball point pens and ends up staying in jail for many years after(not for the same offense). He then learns how to better the system and never stays in for very long. His friend and partner in the original crime becomes a priest in their old neighborhood and tries to keep the current kids out of trouble so they won't turn out like he and his partner did. The gang in the neighborhood(played by the future Bowery boys) initially look at Cagney's character as a hero to them(always getting out of jail scot free), but his priest friend hopes that will end. His efforts aren't working very well, so he decides to go against him publicly after Cagney pulls the boys into his own problems by making them hide some of his "hot" money. This movie is really about their friendship and how it stays despite their issues against each other. Pat O'Brien, as the priest, sticks with Cagney all the way to the very end, trying to get him to change his ways. Cagney is charismatic and watchable and the rest of the cast play their characters well in this drama with a heart. It's a good watchable movie experience overall although it doesn't have the grit of more modern fare, but the story keeps you interested all the way thru.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The popularity of this film is evidenced obviously by the abundance of comments elicited. Considering the passage of time since it was first introduced to the public, this is a tribute to its durability through at least three generations. This octogenarian never ceases to be amazed at the whimsy of fate; the vagaries of chance which can play havoc with one's life or raise it to unbelievable heights. Maybe that is why the most memorable line from the film was from the advertising department. The billboard campaign mounted by Warner Bros. proclaimed to one and all, ' Last one over the fence goes to the electric chair !! 'As it did in "Manhattan Melodrama" some four years before, chums of boyhood remain friends for life despite the divergent paths decreed by fate. And the fact that the viewers comments are not overwhelmingly of one persuasion is a good indication that the final production is a work of art. The artist wants the viewer to form his own opinion of the final scene. Miss viewing this at your own loss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have not seen this film then you must go and get it immediately, if you like gangster films of any kind, then i guarantee that you will love this film. James Cagney gives another spectacular performance, though not as gritty as his other films, such as The Public Enemy. The character development is superb, showing the two main characters as children right through to adulthood. It is very easy to see that this film has influenced some of the finest gangster films since its release. Do not be put off by its age, it is by no means dated, it shows the true harshness of a gangsters nature while still depicting deep meaning in the friendship of 'Rockey' (Cagney) and 'Jerry' (Pat O'Brian) with an ending that will have you completely amazed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whattayahear? A Great Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a teacher of critical viewing, I've spent the last year trying to convince my jaded kids of several things, mainly that Black and white films don't necessarily stink and that films without overt violence can be great because of their stories. This film came along late in the school year, and I was determined to show it because I thought it introduced them to some elements that they needed to see, esp James Cagney.While there were a few carpers who said the shootings were "phony", a surprising number of kids really took to it. For the first time, kids were actually saying, 'I think this film worked better in black and white than it would have in color' and they loved the ending. A few actually felt it was daring to show such an intense ending in 1938. It sparked good discussions on the escalation of violence in today's movies and the use of shadow and light to get across a mood. In reading the opinions of the classes, there really wasn't a single negative opinion and I was pleasantly surprised to realize that they had come a long way in their estimation of films.Today's kids really see so much crap in the movies. Most movies today are really poorly made, they have no script or character development to speak of and the comedies are mindless and vulgar. When you can get kids to appreciate something of quality, you feel good--like you've struck a blow for cultural advancement.And for days after, some kids would walk into the room and "Whattya hear? Whattya say?" Can there be any better tribute?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angel's With Dirty Faces is a very 1930's take on the criminal underworld that existed during the prohibition era. It is a far cry from the Godfather or Goodfellas but there is a certain romance in that. The story surrounds a gangster named Rocky Sullivan (James Cagney) who is idolised by some young boys, much to the annoyance of his childhood friend priest Father Connelly (Pat O'Brien). As he pursues his life of crime, Sullivan is torn between his reputation as a hard man and the pleads from his friend to set a better example to the children. The film is filled with moments of action and suspense, but isn't that fast paced. However it has a good story with important ideals and is well executed by an early master of the genre in Cagney. It is well directed and features some wonderful early media techniques. It is interesting to watch today as its strong story makes it remain a very watchable film, but also to see how boundaries within the genre have changed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great gangster film starring Cagney that may well the best of it's type that Warner Bros produced in the 30's, definitely taking it's place alongside 'Scarface' and 'The Public Enemy'. It's a roaring, all-guns blazing ride that is magnificently directed by Michael Cutiz. A versatile director, who also made 'The Adventures Of Robin Hood' around the same times as this and the great 'Casablanca' just a few years later, he is sorely underrated. Cagney's performance as Rocky Sullivan makes the film what it is, though- a true CLASSIC.Growing up as a child in the tough Hell's Kitchen district of New York, Rocky and his chum Jerry Connolly look set for a life in crime. However, Jerry escapes the law and ends up in an honest profession as a priest. Rocky drifts further into crime as he ages, and when the pair meet up again in the old neighborhood, the differences in the way their lives have turned out are marked. Rocky is mixing in with the neighborhood kids that Connolly is trying to keep on the straight as he holes up before he can get into his old racketeering organization again, much to Connolly's distaste. The kids begin to idolize this 'heroic' figure of crime, taking more notice of him than the priest.As the tag line advertises, this is a 'sensational human drama'. Instead of providing us with a written prelude like 'Scarface' that condemns crime, here we are SHOWN exactly why 'romantic' figures like Sullivan are dangerous through the actions of the kids. The idolatry of gangster/crime figures during the tough days of the Depression was pronounced, with men like Rocky often getting more admiration from the kids of the slums than any straight man of the law. 'Angels' gives us an overall message that crime definitely does not pay, at least when it comes to your soul. There is something terribly disturbing about watching young boys of 14-15 in training to be gangsters. This one will shatter the idealized myths that 'Bonnie And Clyde' may give you about gangster figures, and send their portrayal down to reality. Cagney's own act of turning 'yellow' on O'Brien's pleadings just before death is enough to break their own mythical ideal, and yours, too. The only sympathy for Cagney's Sullivan that you will feel is that the man 'couldn't run fast enough' away from crime as a young kid, becoming embroiled further when he went to a 'reform' school.Cagney gives a brilliant performance in this one, and his interaction with the now-straight Pat O'Brien provide the highlight of the piece. Ann Sheridan is average in her role as Rocky's girlfriend, although she handles a couple of key emotional scenes with surprising depth. Bogart is in the background in one of his small gangster roles before he would hit the big time a few years later. This has the gritty feel of a true crime drama, with excellent photography and a grim, tough setting in New York adding to the mood of the picture.This has one of the great endings in film history, with a great closing line. A powerful film that will stay in your memory for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Cagney classic, dealing with all the morals and ambiguities of gangsterism and growing up on the wrong side of the tracks. James Cagney is Rocky Sullivan, a well known gangster who's relationship with childhood friend, and new-born Christian Jerry Connolly is jeopardised when Rocky takes on a young brood of would-be hoodlums. Jerry doesn't like them looking up to a gangster, Rocky just wants to earn a buck. Soon they find themselves in a war that could spell the end of their relationship.'Angels With Dirty Faces' deals with themes of lost childhood by contrasting two former friends who took very different paths after their young years. Sullivan took the easy route of petty crime, eventually becoming a gangster. Connolly, who could have fallen into the same trap, decides to enter the priesthood, with his street smarts intact, in order to try to and prevent young New Yorkers from following Sullivan's suit. The film also shows Cagney's character as a man of conflicting morals: he wants to help out Jerry at the church and aid his former friend's plight to protect the younger generation from succumbing to corruption, yet gets them to perform errands for him in exchange for big bucks. The "Dead End" kids look up to Rocky more than Jerry because they like who he is: A gangster, a man who came from nothing but made it to the top by stealing, gambling and fighting.The film has a fantastic cast: There is able support from Humphrey Bogart as a lawyer to George Bancroft's crime boss, playing slightly against type. The only role that is somewhat underused comes from the possible love interest for Rocky, Laury Ferguson (Ann Sheridan). Aside from one great scene in which she meets Sullivan for the first time in 15 years, her character is relegated to a back room observer. Pat O'Brien's turn as Jerry is wonderfully underplayed for it's time. But it is inevitably Cagney's show, as his screen presence is brimming with bravura and spirit.Sullivan is the epitome of an anti-hero. He's a man of principles and feels for his former neighbourhood, yet can't put his past behind him. There are obvious influences, a modern day one being The Sopranos, in particular the protagonist Tony Soprano, who borrows from the complexity of Cagney's character. One minute you route for him as the hero, the next you see him for the exploitative mobster he is. The final scene is one that could never be pulled off in today's cinemas. Of a man who chooses the selfless act over pride in order to aid his childhood friend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Practically Perfect In Every Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about this film is that it really feels like an ensemble piece. Each actor is in perfect balance with another and the chemistry is like magic.Nominated for an Academy Award, James Cagney gives one of the best performances of his career as the gangster-with-a-heart Rocky Sullivan. Like always, his work is flawless and natural, and even while playing a crook he can make you care for his character. Ann Sheridan makes an otherwise boring character into a girl you can really sympathize with. Then of course there's Bogart, the guy you're used to seeing as brave, fearless, and always ahead of the competition. In 'Angels' he plays a crooked lawyer, and while at times I wince to see him being afraid, I have to hand it to Bogart for really pulling through as an actor. Oh, and I almost forgot Pat O'Brien. As the wrong-turned-right priest in the movie, he brings a sensitive, kind element to the picture (and also reminds me of Karl Malden's Father Berry in 'On the Waterfront').The other players who cannot be ignored in this movie are the title characters themselves, the Dead End Kids. Their first film was 1937's Dead End, and I thought they owned that movie. Any scene without them seemed colorless and boring. In 'Angels,' they mesh perfectly with the other characters and do not overshadow anybody. Though technically it seems they play the same people as they did in 'Dead End' (e.g. Billy Halop their leader and Leo Gorcey the trouble-makers), the scene with their basketball game is one of the film's best moments.'Angels With Dirty Faces' comes highly recommended, to any fan of Cagney, Bogart, Sheridan, brilliant director Michael Curtiz, or the Dead End Kids. Or even if you just love movies and want to get to know the classics, this is a great place to start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angels With Dirty Faces had to be one of Jimmy Cagney's best movies, along with White Heat.In this one, he plays Rocky Sullivan, a gangster who has been in and out of prison for most of his life. After being released for the latest time, he is reunited with his childhood friend who is now a priest. It's not long before he's up to his old tricks again though and towards the end, he kills two men including his solicitor and after a shoot out, he gets the electric chair. He does find a woman as well.This has a great score by Max Steiner (King Kong) and some great location photography.Cagney is joined by Pat O'Brien, Humphery Bogart as his solicitor, Anne Sheridan as the love interest and George Bancroft. With The Dead End Kids. Excellent parts from all.Angels With Dirty Faces is a must for all classic movie fans. Great stuff.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A glimpse into gangster behavior and its causes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is a great example of another age in movie-making. It's an action movie, with plenty of violence, including gunfights, killings, explosions, and near slapstick fisticuffs, but there is also plenty of lingering moments to go with the wise-cracking and tough-guy posing, not to mention the moralizing that appears more than once. Cagney is at his best as a tough-guy gangster, and Pat O'Brien plays the stereotypical Irish priest with a heart of gold. You'll want to forget that Bogart plays a weasel of a lawyer who dies a coward.My favorites are the young men who play the gangster wanna-be's. Their voices, accents, and lines of dialog make them a memorable part of a film that most people remember for Cagney as Rocky Sullivan and O'Brien as Jerry Connelly. The physical humor too makes them stand out, slap-happy characters as much like the Little Rascals or the Three Stooges as they are hoodlums. Cagney too is excellent in his antics.It's in an early scene that Sullivan's and Connelly's lives diverge from the small-time crooks they appear on their way to be. The two are running from the cops and one leaps over the fence and gets away while the other is caught and sent to reform school. It's worth asking yourself what that moral in the film seems to be.It's a great old action film, but be sure to note the story as what Hollywood offered in 1938 as a look into the status of crime and the celebrity of criminals (Cagney was the same age as Al Capone, and Bonnie and Clyde had only recently been killed). The film attempts to explore the root causes of crime, poverty among them, and offers up some ideas about reformation.Later movies might glorify criminals. This one doesn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember the first time I seen this film, I was 13 and my Religious Education teacher in school made up watch it, well we ended up watching the first 40 minutes then he never mentioned it again. I still to this day do not have a single clue as to why he made us watch it, he was an odd fellow to say the least. After he never put it back on for us I decided to rent it to finally watch the whole thing this was when I was about 16/17, and it is safe to say this is one of the movies that made me fall in love with movies to this day! Gangster films flew to the top of the watch lists during the great depression era in America, there was so many released during the 1930's it was obvious that they would be the more favoured films. James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson paved the for gangsters on the big screen. Cagney was a perfect choice to play Rocky Sullivan, he had the swagger of a gangster, the fast talking of a con man, had unbelievable comic timing along with these great traits he was also an intense actor with real raw talent.In my honest opinion this is one of the greatest Gangster flicks of all time, and I genuinely think people will be saying that in another three quarters of a century! Rocky Sullivan and Jerry Connelly played by Frankie Burke and William Tracy respectively are a pair of New Yorker youths who grew up on the very poor Lower East Side end up caught up in the robbery on a railroad car (a railway carriage to us Brits ha). Jerry escapes without any difficulty I mean boom this kid is gone, Rocky on the other hand is not as lucky. Staying true to his tough upbringing Rocky upholds his "code of silence", refusing to snitch on the identity of his accomplice which leaves Rocky stuck in a reformatory before he will be bumped into a full prison.After realising how bad Rockys fate actually is, Jerry turns his life around and becomes a man of the cloth. After many years pass, Rocky returns to his old neighbourhood now being played by Cagney he looks up his old friend Jerry to find out he is no Father Jerry (Pat O'Brien) whom has taken in on himself to look after a rag tag bunch of boys played by Billy Halop, Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Gabriel Dell who would all go to become The Dead End Kids. The boys are overjoyed that they get to meet a big-time gangster like Rocky, they pretty much worship the ground he walks on, much to the disappointment of Father Jerry who is trying to guard the boys from a life of crime.Cagney pays a call to his Lawyer, played by Humphrey Bogart who has been keeping $100,000 (which according to DollarTimes is roughly $1.6 million today) stashed away for him. He meets racketeering boss Mac Keefer (George Bancroft), both of whom promise to cut Rocky in on a highly lucrative operations, however this is where we hit a twist they are plotting to have him whacked (MY WHOLE LIFE have I wanted to use that phrase and it too actually work, and now I think it fits! ha) Father Jerry runs a campaign over the radio and newspaper against Rocky and his partners, with Rockys blessing that is. Laury by now played by the beautiful Ann Sheridan has fallen in love with Rocky.When Rocky learns of the plot to kill Father Jerry due to his smear campaign, Rocky kills both men which results in him being caught in a shoot-out with the police in a warehouse. His trial is quick and he is sentenced to death, before Rocky is about to be executed Father Jerry turns up asking for possibly the BIGGEST favour in movie history. He wants Rocky to die like a coward so the boys will go on the straight and narrow, Rocky refuses, however as he is being put to death Rocky suddenly breaks down an loses it crying and pleading for his life! The paper the next runs the story "ROCKY DIES YELLOW!" to help the boys cement the belief that he well and truly is coward.So overall this movie is action filled, full of laughs, full of great performances all across the board giving us viewers an unbelievable movie experience! A little fact I learnt while writing this review is that during the warehouse scene, LIVE AMMO was used, how on earth did they get away with that ha. All these parts come together cultivating in what is one of the greatest movies of all time! This will be one of the easiest ratings that I will give to a film, if I could go any higher than 10 I would! "Whaddya hear, whaddya say?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fourth genre-defining gangster film ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The general consensus is that the seminal gangster films are "Little Caesar", "The Public Enemy" and "Scarface: the Shame of a Nation". Maybe I belong to a minority but I believe there was something missing even after these three films were released and it's only when Michael Curtiz directed the excellent "Angels with Dirty Faces" that the genre gained in maturity, featuring for the first time, a gangster with a possible redemption, the theme cherished by Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and to a certain extent Quentin Tarantino.But let's get back to the film, "Angels With Dirty Faces" focuses on the friendship between Rocky Sullivan, James Cagney in his most sublime role and Pat O'Brien as Jerry Connor, his best friend. Like in "The Public Enemy", they both started as young punks but the film immediately deviates after a botched pens' stealing. Rocky is arrested because he can't run as fast as Jerry, who is given the chance of redemption Rocky didn't have. Jerry wants to confess but Rocky takes the blame, and shows right from the beginning that being an outlaw doesn't deprive from a certain sense of honor. This altruistic gesture paid off since Jerry not only redeemed himself but also became a priest, eager to use his background to convince thugs not to end up like Rocky. Rocky's sacrifice is like Vito selling his soul to the devil so Michael can live a decent life. Too far fetched? I'm not so sure.Rocky becomes a successful criminal, and makes money through the complicity of his crooked lawyer, Frazier, played by Humphrey Bogart (you could tell it was still his earlier roles where he was either a second-hand or a coward but never mind, this is Cagney's film, and Bogey would get his break) The relationship between Rocky, Frazier and the local mobster played by George Bancroft illustrates the intricacies between politics, crime and even police. Maybe the film was too ambitious but at least it covered some of the themes that would be more developed by "The Godfather". However the core of the story is still the influence of Rocky Sullivan on a street gang played by the 'Dead End' kids, the bunch of uneducated, violent and streetwise kids from William Wyler's "Dead End" who see Rocky as a hero, an icon. In their own way, they illustrate the fascination of the public toward gangsters. Yet this time, no need to a political statement or a moral cop to patronize us, we're in 1938, and the viewers can't figure out for themselves and feel guilty about it or not. This is the essence of the anti-heroic figure."Angels with Dirty Faces" was ahead of its time because the 'antihero' concept would finally emerge through the brilliant "Bonnie and Clyde", the iconic line "We rob banks" was a reference to the same law that ruined farmers, it had a sort of romantic way to turn the bandits into some Robin Hood figures but it was at the same time embracing the rebellious spirit of the Vietnam war, and people felt there was a potential capital of sympathy within outlaw figures. This attitude pinnacles with "The Godfather" because it showed how even politicians can be as morally corrupted as gangsters and benefit from some criminal activities. "We're all part of the same hypocrisy". The disillusioned Nixon era and the rise of criminality in urban cities originated a new sub-genre of the cop thriller movie; the vigilante film, the gangster or criminal became a worthless villain that had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and the new hero of the 70's was the vigilante: Dirty Harry, Popeye Doyle or Shaft, those were the macho heroes, as charismatic, tough and ruthless as gangster except that they were at the right side of the law, and they gave us an excuse to cheer up when they got their hands 'dirty'. It had its sort of right-wing fascist taste but it had the merit to depict criminals as the true scumbags they were before "Scarface" would come back with an anti-heroic hero and Sergio Leone with "Once Upon a Time in America". And there are some parts that have probably inspired Leone's epic, starting with the 'Dead End' gang, and as soon as they get some money from Rocky, more than they ever had, they buy themselves nice suits and play the big shots in a pool bar. They remind us of the appeal of the gangster lifestyle, easy money, flash and good time. Realizing the bad influence of Sullivan, Father Obrien tries to reason them, but they are as indifferent as those who read the statements in the earlier films, they don't care, and even in the film, it's impossible not to be mesmerized by Cagney more than O'Brien. And that's the key of the film, 'you don't make up for your sins in church'. And if it weren't for the last ten minutes of the film, I wouldn't have even thought of putting the film among the best of the genre.Rocky's Christ-like sacrifice is probably the most generous ever committed, even more beautiful because some could still wonder if it was genuine. It's all about trading the most precious thing one man can have: honor and dignity. When Tony Camonte crawled like a rat, begged for his life, this was only Muni pretending to be another character because Hawks had pressure from the Code, no one would buy that the guy would act like this. When Rocky did the same thing, maybe he was pretending, or maybe not, but it was a heroic act, meant to show the true face of a criminal; a coward, so he wouldn't become a model. What "Scarface" did as a last-minute cheap propaganda, "Angels with Dirty Faces" did with a haunting panache, transcending the antihero to an ahead-of-its-time Scorsesian level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strangely Convoluted Moral Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangster Rocky Sullivan (James Cagney) has the world by the you-know-what. And then he takes a group of kids under his wing after they try to pickpocket him. But things get complicated when Father Jerry (Pat O'Brien) gets involved... he grew up with Rocky and tolerates his crimes, but cannot allow another generation to turn rotten.My editor, Jim, a former movie critic says, "Not a big fan of that one, largely because I don't like Pat O'Brien (even though he does star in my favorite newspaper movie, The Front Page, 1931... but that's great in spite of him). Cagney is great in it. Bogie had yet to break from the lower ranks at Warner Bros." In some regards, I agree, and not in others.I have no issue with O'Brien. I thought the character of Jerry was a bit odd... a priest who turns against his gangster friend (and mysteriously the gangster never gets upset about this). But that was the character, and O'Brien played him well. Cagney is "great", and perhaps too much so, as he can now really only be seen as a gangster.The moral message is strange. It's okay for Rocky to be a criminal, it's okay for him to rough up kids, but not okay to teach them about crime (which even the priest admits does pay). The final scene, which I cannot talk about, is especially odd. The motivation of the Rocky character is unclear. But all in all, a decent film, even if not on the level of Scorsese's gangster flicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Cagney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cagney once again epitomises the gangster of the United States in the inter-war years, here he plays Rocky Sullivan who's life took a turn for the worse when he got caught robbing in a railway yard and sent to reform school, from then on he was in and out of prison, each time for more and more serious offences. Meanwhile his friend who was with him at the time and could run a little faster so didn't get caught went on to become the parish priest.When Rocky gets out fifteen years later he goes to see his crooked lawyer who has been holding on to a hundred thousand dollars for him. The Lawyer, played by Humphrey Bogart, has other ideas and thinks it is better to have Rocky killed than give him that much money. He gives Rocky $500 saying he'll get the rest later, on his way home a group of street punks pick Rocky's pocket but he follows them and gets in back, he also ends up befriending them. When the killers move in to attack Rocky he spots them before they can strike and escapes leaving one of them dead. He then heads straight back to Bogart's and empties his safe, among the items he finds there are books giving details of various corrupt officials and their connections to the underworld. He then goes to Bogart's boss and demands the rest of his money.Not all his activities are criminal, he meets up with his old friend Father Connolly who is involved in youth work that involves teaching the street punks basketball. When they have a match Rocky takes over as referee and maintains discipline in a fairly unorthodox manner. Connolly sees that the kids idolise Rocky and his gangster lifestyle so vows that he will bring down the gangsters even if that means bringing down his friend too. The other gangsters plan to silence the priest... permanently but Rocky has other ideas which lead to one of the most memorable of film endings.This is clearly Cagney's film and he is great as Rocky, Pat O'Brien is good as his friend the priest and Bogart is good as the weaselly lawyer. The "Dead End Kids" are less good as the street punks, sometimes coming across as a bit too smart-alecky, this doesn't spoil the film though. If you haven't seen this yet and are a fan of gangster films then I strongly suggest putting near the top of your too see list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more than 70 years old and, with a couple of big exceptions, hasn't aged a day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Curtiz's Angels with Dirty Faces can be considered a full-blooded, no-holds-barred genre classic for a few reasons. One of it is how well he depicts the "hero" worship of street-tough kids who look up to the next generation of super street-tough and street-wise hoodlums. The Dead End Kids- an actual gang of sorts who acted in this and another movie- look to James Cagney's Rocky Sullivan since, first and foremost, he came out of the neighborhood and the very building that they hang out of (the initials, along with those of Sullivan's boyhood friend turned Priest Jerry, are carved on the wall). But also there's the persona of Rocky Sullivan, a guy who wont take no s*** off of cops OR the criminals, and will do things his way or a highway burned to a crisp.And, perhaps underneath this, for all of the ruthless things that Rocky Sullivan does, he's honest. There's a genuine quality to him while he occasionally lies, cheats, steals, whatever as a 1930s era gangster is want to do. This is what makes it extra powerful then when, right before he's sent to the electric chair, the Priest asks him to lie outright and act like he turned yellow for the Dead End Kids and others to see how he turned out. Apparently there's another version of this ending where this didn't happen, and oddly enough I prefer the version I saw with the turning yellow.This is not just because of Cagney's performance, which already up until now is just about legendary in proportion. There's an underlying message with it being the priest that asks this of him. Now, part of this has to do with them being friends and that there's this trust between them. But there's also the fact that it's a priest, a man of the cloth, using God and his will and life-after-death as a means to get some scaring back into the kids as opposed to the usual hero worship. It doesn't matter that the kids aren't told the truth, but that Jerry will know that it wasn't true, but puts up the front anyway. This is a classic ending that works on multiple levels.Speaking of Cagney, there's no way one can say they are a fan of the star without checking this out. Here is one of the quintessential performances of all time in ANY gangster or crime picture. This lends itself, of course, to the fact that Rocky Sullivan is such an interesting character as the dark half of the face that was Rocky and Jerry as kids (one could see a similar split take shape in an underlying or existential sense in Scorsese's movies of this ilk). But it's Cagney that imbues it with real guts and tenacity; he knows this guy so well that he doesn't have to break a sweat at doing a big dramatic scene, such as the big shoot-out at the end, or even in the smaller scenes where he doesn't take lip from Bogart (also in very fine form, seeing two giants face off is an added bonus) where little facial markers and moments make it so memorable. He's a natural at this because simply he sets the pacing just right for the scene and rolls with it to the logical end. One can see process being worked out right on the screen but with the seemingly effortless grace of a class act.It's also, I should also add, a very cool story, one that even as it's set in the late 1930s loses little of its resonance for today; a story like this could just as easily be shot in the same environment as say the City of God underworld in Rio, where one rises up through the ranks with some ferocity and also a little help from crooked cops or politicians, and then the next generation already lining up, and one or two good apples in the bunch. Oh, and it's got very fast and cutting action scenes, which never hurts when done right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gangster movie with a humane face.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's mostly a movie that is made great by its Oscar-nominated story. It's a typical '30's gangster movie only with a more humane and dramatic twist to it, in which two childhood friends find each other on the other side of the law, despite still having a strong friendship. It's not necessarily Michael Curtiz his best directed movie and it also doesn't feature Cagney or Bogart in their best or most memorable roles but it nevertheless is one great solid movie, that you'll not easily forget.The movie might sound like a really preachy and moralistic one that condemns violence and says that is's better to come to church. Even though this perhaps in a nutshell is still what this movie is all about, the movie itself luckily doesn't ever get preachy or moralistic like. This is not just due to the fine written of the movie but also thanks to the performances of the lead actors, that mostly make the movie and its story work out so effectively and realistic.Humphrey Bogart plays a sort of villainous gangster role in this one. He really wasn't an established actor yet back then and he's also third billed actor for this movie. It really wasn't until the '40's that he really finally had his big breakthrough and became an established actor and started playing leading roles in some big well known successful movies, such as of course "Casablanca" and "The Maltese Falcon". But of course the human face of the movie is being provided by James Cagney, who shows the realistic and human side of a tough hoodlum. Cagney is mostly known for his tough roles of course but he could also really play some more 'soft' characters and he actually starred in some musicals and romantic movies as well during his career. The other main part of the movie is being played by Pat O'Brien, a former tough guy from the neighborhood who used to hang out with the Cagney character but has now turned into a priest. Even though O'Brein isn't now days as well known as Cagney or Bogart, he still was a big and well known actor, especially during the '30's and '40's. He actually played in a total of 9 movies together with Cagney and 5 with Bogart, often in front of Bogart as the movie's main lead.Gangster movies was popular genre in the '30's, with other genre examples such as "Little Caesar", "The Public Enemy" and "Scarface, the Shame of the Nation" being released during the same decade. Especially Warner Bros. was leading with it. Nevertheless, "Angels with Dirty Faces" is still a movie that knows to be different and original within its genre. It's the story that makes this movie original as well as effective and memorable. Especially the ending is great and memorable. The movie constantly kept me waiting for the trademark Michael Curtiz use of shadows during its key moments but there it finally was at the ending. Lots of things come together at the end and it makes the movie as a whole an even better and more powerful one. Even more so than it already was before that point. Besides its writing, the movie also received Oscar nominations for its directing, by Michael Curtiz and James Cagney for his role of Rocky Sullivan. It was Cagney's first ever Oscar nomination and he actually won his only Oscar 4 years later for his role in "Yankee Doodle Dandy", which also got directed by Michael Curtiz."Angels with Dirty Faces" is more dramatic, more involving and therefor perhaps also more memorable than the usual '30's gangster movie.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated but watchable gangster film with another great turn from James Cagney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Angels with Dirty Faces", despite its popularity and classic status, is far from my favorite James Cagney role. The moralizing gets in the way and dates this significantly more than "The Public Enemy" (which came out before the code really started cracking down) and "White Heat" (which came later when the production code became increasingly lax and crime films more hard boiled). Still, its more than watchable, because even in a watered down film, Cagney could always be counted on for a terrific performance. He creates a truly multi-dimensional character, one who is capable of evoking audience sympathy despite his flaws. He's a much more compelling individual than Pat O'Brien's priest.The rest of the cast is uneven. O'Brien does a good job with a rather dull role. Its interesting to see Humphrey Bogart, who went on to playing stoic tough guys in his later parts, playing such a weasel-like coward. He isn't very good, but its still intriguing to see where he started out. Ann Sheridan isn't very good as the girl with the heart of gold who wants to help out Cagney, and the Bowery Boys can become rather annoying (even though not nearly as much as their later starring features). Still, Cagney completely upstages the rest of the cast with a fantastic performance. "Angels with Dirty Faces" is highly recommended simply because of him. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The hoodlum and the gangster are looked up to with the same respect as the successful businessman and the popular hero"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Towards the end of the 1930s something began to change in the crime genre. It was no longer acceptable merely to show the gangster getting killed at the end ? the protagonists of pictures such as Public Enemy, Little Caesar and Scarface (1932) were still getting viewed as heroes. Now, with the Hayes code in full swing, attempts were being made to make the gangster appear un-heroic. The most prominent of these efforts, Angels with Dirty Faces sees the ultimate crime actor of his era, James Gagney, in a gangster movie with a difference.Needless to say, with the agenda it has, Angels with Dirty Faces has its moralistic and preachy moments. Large parts of it however are more or less the same as any other crime flick of the era, with bootleg liquor, underhand deals with corrupt officials, a sleazy lawyer (Humphrey Bogart), a moll (Ann Sheridan) and plenty of storytelling via newspaper headlines. The problem here is that on the one hand none of these crime story elements are fully fleshed out, dull stock subplots reducing Bogart and Sheridan to little more than bit parts. And on the other hand, the Christian moralism and in particular the last minute twist seem tacked on and hard to swallow.The direction on Angels with Dirty Faces was handled by Michael Curtiz, and this is one of its saving graces. The picture opens with a typical Curtiz crowd shot. The way he moves the camera is absolutely unique, and there are a number of visual gags ? such as the "men at work" sign which opens the scene where the dead end kids are trying to jimmy open a fruit machine. And at least, it being Curtiz, you know the action sequences will be well done. It's all done in memorable shots and lightning-fast editing, so the audience gets a brief yet clear impression of the violence without ever dwelling on it.The other saving grace to this picture is of course James Cagney, one of the most talented stars of the classic Hollywood era. Of course, he was right to break out of type-casting and seek more diverse roles in the 1940s, but he plays the gangster so well. This is a great chance to see him at the top of his game.This would have to be my least favourite picture of Cagney's gangster-cycle that I have seen. It's very much a product of its time, and simply gets bogged down in its message. Still, there's just enough here to make it watchable. And at least it's better than that stupid Sham 69 song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iwatched this movie on DVD the other day,it brought back memories of watching old movies on a Sunday afternoon at my grandmothers.This film in many ways,is one of the finest gangster movies ever made, Cagney's performance as Rocky Sullivan is as fresh today as it ever was, the story starts when two young boys try to steal from a rail car, they are chased and the slower one becomes a gangster the quicker one a priest.Cagney's gangster is a free spirit, but he ends up working for the mob lead by George Bancroft and Humphrey Bogart, Cagney takes the rap and goes to jail for 4 years, on coming out he wants back in to the organisation which puts heat on the crime bosses.Cagney meets his old friend the priest and their friendship is renewed.The priest is concerned the the dead end kids will grow up into a life of crime as they admire Cagneys lifestyle and the easy way to get money.The priest starts a reform movement backed by the news-media.Bogart decides the priest must go but Rocky will not let his old friend be harmed, the situation ends in violence and Cagney is sentenced to death in the chair.Cagney is not scared about dying, however the priest asks him to feign cowardice on the way to the chair, Cagney refuses the old friends shake hands then make their way down the last mile, just as Cagney is been put in the chair he screams and dies yellow.The priest sees the dead end kids and informs them that he died a coward and says lets say a prayer for a boy who could not run as fast as me.The DVD is supberb I hope this film is discoverer by a new generation because this a supberb movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story seems to be well known, as well as the Warner Brothers "enveloping" their straight forward crime action into some moral commentary or some warm words of "Crime doesn't pay". However, it takes a relentless tongue-in-cheek actor like Pat O'Brien to carry this message thru. And turning a tough-as-hell criminal like James Cagney to a yellow coward in the last minute for the sake of saving others from following in his footsteps ? That forgiven, we get a nice little action packed movie, with H. Bogart in a secondary role, in which he couldn't outlive a bigger name of that time like Cagney. (They actually never made a movie later, when his improved status would have allowed for that). So, all in all, 1 out 10 taken out for the morale, it is 7 points still.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very good and it was definitely Cagney in one of his better roles. I gave this movie a 9/10 because I felt Rocky Sullivan seemed a little bit too soft compared to Cagney in "White Heat" which was his best role. It wouldn't have hurt to have wrote a better script but there were some flawless scenes that made up for this fact. Humphrey Bogart was good in a familiar sleazy role and other than the couple comments I had before, they were really the only negative things about it. It's still a very entertaining movie and I thoroughly enjoyed practically every minute of it. I'm glad I watched the original black and white version compared to the colorized one since they always come out so ugly. I'm definitely psyched to seeing some more classic Cagney flicks in the future.Final Dealing:Movies : This would be awesome to see in theaters.DVD Purchase : Possibly, if they ever release it.Rental : I would rent this again in a heartbeat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I came into this after seeing The Public Enemy and White Heat in a Gangster marathon. Now, considering the excellence of these two films, I thought myself in for a let down. I was wrong. Like all the films of the era, it starts with the cutscene of twenty years before. For once, this is essential, as it allows us to truly understand the relationships in the film. We race to Cagney and the Dead End Kids' relationship, culminating in humourous scenes such as the basketball match. We then rush to his execution. The crime preceding this is, unfortunately, not as memorable as it should be, but it is eclipsed by the execution. The defiance followed by cowardice is a brilliant interpolation of the defiance of the criminal, but with a moral ending. Cagney steals the show. His performance is perfect, and he commands every scene, as if he were god. Whilst the ending takes the moral highground, the relationship between Cagney and the dead end kids means that it works(for once).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! James Cagney and Pat O'Brien are great as childhood ruffians Rocky Sullivan and Jerry Connolly, who grow up very differently because Rocky lands in jail. When he gets out, he discovers that Jerry is now a priest, which could spoil the friendship between the guys. This could mean trouble, since the two friends have Irish tempers!I also like Humphrey Bogart in the role of Frazier, the slimy lawyer of Rocky. Since Bogie usually played a tough guy with a heart of gold, this was a nice change! Also, brilliant directing by Michael Curtiz, who worked with Bogart in "Casablanca" and "We're No Angels". "Angels with Dirty Faces" is a fantastic movie for anyone, whether you're a fan of "tough guy" movies or not. So I give it a 10 out of 10, because it's a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A brilliant, superb film about two friends: one grew up to be a priest; the other, a crook. James Cagney is in top criminal form in the powerful and gripping drama. Pat O'Brien gives a good performance as his childhood friend, a priest who wishes to save Cagney's soul. Humphrey Bogart is good as Cagney's partner in crime. I would definitely recommend this classic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING THE ENDING IS GIVEN AWAY BELOWA real typical film espousing the dangers of a life of crime, but at the same time showing that redemption is possible. James Cagney (Rocky Sullivan) is the real standout in this film, his co-star Pat O'Brien (The Rev. Jerry Connolly) is over shadowed by Cagneys acting. The film also has a good supporting cast, The Dead End Kids who worship Cagney, Humphrey Bogart (James Frazier) playing another of his early criminal sleazy roles who gets his come-uppance in the end, with Ann Sheridan (Laury Ferguson) playing Cagney's love interest. The most memorable moment comes at the end as Cagney, after rejecting O'Briens request to go to his death as a coward to make him seem a lesser man to the kids who admirered him, is lead off to his death. We watch as he goes from the tough as nails criminal laughing at death, to a weeping coward as they strap him in and let him fry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great film which has earned its place as a timeless classic, as it deals with one of the most timeless of subjects; the evolution of human character.Where it is all too easy to work with the black and white concept of good vs. evil, this movie intensely covers all the shades of gray in between. It also very successfully portrays how seemingly insignificant events can bring about radical changes in a person's life. The lead characters, Gangster Rocky Sullivan and The Rev. Jerry Connolly, were performed brilliantly. Not your typical sinner and saint, these were "every-man" type characters with subtle and complex personalities.

		<fullReview>This isn't the best of the Warner Brothers' 1930s gangster movies but it's the clearest statement of the formula. It's got everything. It's like a Romanesque mosaic. Here's Jimmy Cagney as Rocky Sullivan, the ex-choir boy gangster who hitches up his pants and greets people with, "Whaddaya hear, whaddaya say?" His childhood pal is Pat O'Brian, now a priest living in the same neighborhood and trying to save the new generation of kids from turning into hoodlums. We have the Dead End Kids (or whatever they're called here) who think Cagney is a swell guy. Humphrey Bogart is Cagney's lawyer who swindles him out of his stash, then tries to have him killed when Cagney is released from jail. The familiar girl with the pig tails grows up to be Anne Sheridan, who has big, pretty eyes but no New York accent. (Neither does Pat O'Brian, from Wisconsin, but I've given him absolution.) After the final shoot out, with Cagney's foes dead and himself trapped in a tenement with tear gas coming through the windows, O'Brian shows up and takes the speaker. "Rocky, you've got to come out!" "Go on back to da choitch where ya belong, Fodder!" (I just made that line up, but there are a couple of similar ones in the scene.) Rocky is convicted and sentenced to death. But he's a tough guy and won't break down. The Dead End Kids mope over the headlines and promise themselves that Rocky will never turn yellow at the end. O'Brian gets word of this and tells Rocky that he holds the fate of these innocent kids in his hands. If he doesn't turn yellow as he's marched to the chair, the kids will turn into miscreants. If he shows he's frightened, his myth will die with him and the kids will all become champion polo players overnight.Does Rocky develop a social conscience in his last moments and fake hysteria as he walks the last mile? Guess.The thing is, this isn't anybody's best performance and it is no one's idea of the tightest script, yet you can gain a rather full grasp of what these genre movies were all about by watching this single movie, and not having to sit through half a dozen others. If that's what you want. This is like reading an abstract in a professional journal, except that it's fun to see it all laid out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A step below The Roaring Twenties but Cagney is superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little disappointed with Angels with Dirty Faces having expected something to equal The Roaring Twenties. Unfortunately this is not in the same league as the Raoul Walsh classic. Despite its flaws, Cagney is magnificent as always, the quintessential tough but lovable gangster with an underlying heart of gold. Whilst Cagney's performance as Rocky Sullivan is faultless, The Dead End Kids appeared to me as overstated, hammy caricatures and their performances bordered on annoying with a manufactured script that convinced me that the writer may have heard of, but never experienced, the tough side of Hells Kitchen. Nevertheless, there are some great moments and the climax is indeed memorable as Cagney is led the "the chair". The Father makes a final request to Rocky to fake cowardice so that the kids might reconsider their hero worship of him. There is some ambiguity about whether Rocky really was "yellow" in his final moments but to me there was no doubt that he was acting for the sake of the kids. The scene certainly has great impact first with the chilling image of Cagney's face, and then in shadows the sounds of his feigned terror in his last moments. I would question the plausibility of the Father asking for such an act of cowardice as Rocky is led to his death and I also wonder whether such a grand gesture at the point of death would have had its desired result. Ultimately, without the brilliance of Cagney, Angels with Dirty Faces may well have been dismissed as another typical and unremarkable gangster film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly but fun 30s nonsense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As typical of crime dramas of the 30s and 40s as they get. A lot of mugging and animated acting from Cagney &amp; co. Dated, but still enjoyable, partly for its unintentionally amusing over-the-top acting. The plot gets occasionally silly, but the ending surpasses everything previous with its absurdity; O'Brien actually visits his old pal Cagney minutes before Cagney's execution to ask him for a favour! (Though I am sure he would have visited him anyway, but that's beside the point.) Cagney has minutes to live before he gets electrocuted and what does his brother the priest do? He asks Cagney for a favour! As if Cagney hasn't got enough on his mind as it is, what with his life coming to an end, that he should also be doing favours for other people. Minutes later, as the two walk slowly towards the chair, O'Brien asks him whether he changed his mind about the favour (Cagney didn't want to oblige at first) and Cagney say no; that scene is pure (unintentional) comedy. But Cagney does oblige at the end, and acts scared at execution time, just as the priest wanted; could it be that Cagney wasn't so noble after all and didn't change his mind, but instead acted like any sane person would when faced with the electric chair? Hmm. It seems throughout the movie that Cagney the crook was a far more loyal friend to O'Brien the priest than the other way around: a strange message to make. Cagney delivers his lines with his usual machine-gun-fire style. Bogey I like here better than in films where he played classical bad guys; his acting as a lawyer is more subtle, with none of the silliness that some other of his roles entailed. O'Brien only has one facial expression throughout the film: an angelic, puppy-dog, ultimate honest-person look, and with nothing but goodness and the best intentions. He is a caricature. Sheridan is cute but doesn't appear much. "Whatdoyouhear, whatdoyousay..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>" . . . give it to you slow and easy, wise guy," a sadistic prison guard tells James Cagney moments before he's "fried" in ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES. This film shows why all American executions MUST be televised live. If they're not, these violent incidents are no better than backwoods lynchings, subject to whatever lies and agendas the "witnesses" and "authorities" care to tell. (And just because they're on live TV doesn't mean that YOU or your kids HAVE to view every one; after the novelty wears off, many Americans may see only 10 or 20 a year, when there's nothing else on that's good.) The state of Oklahoma already has gone ANGELS one better, stretching death by lethal injection out pretty near two hours. Even the slowest electrocutions, such as Ethel Rosenberg's smoking head during her 1953 TRIPLE jolting or the very first, when Thomas Edison filmed himself ELECTROCUTING AN ELEPHANT (1903), as the beloved Topsy literally burned alive at the end of a chain, leave little room for ads. Snuffing, Oklahoma style, can accommodate BOTH the beer ads and new car campaigns, as well as local spots. Then we will be spared shenanigans like the plot hatched up by Cagney's priest, Father Jerry, to politicize American executions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reel Look: 'Angels with Dirty Faces'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Whadda ya hear! Whadda ya say!" 'Angels with Dirty Faces' (1938) could be seen as a great 30's crimefilm or an old-fashioned gangster flick. But the heart of its message is that it is about two roads and the two people that took the ones they chose, reaping and sowing from their travels in the end. The most powerful sermon directed by Michael Curtiz ('Casablanca', 'Yankee Doodle Dandy', 'Mildred Pierce'), 'Dirty Faces' centers on two youths growing up in one of New York's toughest neighborhoods: Hell's Kitchen. Jerry (Pat O'Brian) decides to wash the dirt of the sin-ridden district off of his hands and becomes a priest,as his buddy Rocky (James Cagney) gets caught up in racketeering in reform school. As a youth with Rocky, he too lead a life of crime,where his road to redemption began where he outran Rocky from the police and never looked back since. Years later, Rocky is released and returns to Hell's Kitchen, where he works and "mentors" at-risk children (The Dead End Kids) to eventually become tall and tough like himself one day. Though Rocky wants a temporary haven of safety with Jerry before resuming his life of crime, his old now-priest friend hesitates, testing their relationship, which is truly as rocky as the name of the man he hopes to lead in the way of the Lord. Which road does Cagney's character ultimately choose in the end? Let's take a look.To Father Jerry Connolly, the recreation center was a place that meant that there was a place of hope in the future for disgruntled boys that grew up in the hardship and poverty and could not be reformed for the greater good of mankind. It was a place where he faces the challenges of teaching these young boys like his misled friend Rocky once was the ways of becoming decent citizens in everyday society. It was a place where he knew the essence in the healthy reality and truth in which he spoke to the youths would be engrained and encouraged in their minds forever and that they could be redeemed of any future fatalities upon just listening within those very walls.Upon Rocky's return, I believe Father Connolly was right to turn against him, because after all the attempts to save him to keep his former friend from being corrupted, he just decided that it was no use in trying to change the mind of his gangster acquaintances. And being a priest, he also strongly believed in the imperial justice of criminal notoriety. If Connolly would have handled the situation and had been sticking his neck out for someone who just did not want to listen to reason but his own motives and intentions, he would have no choice but to count it all for loss and let the matter roll its terrible course of fate for itself. But that's just me.I believe that Rocky had a tiny glimpse of redemption just before his execution from what Connolly said to him. Nonetheless, he did not fully conform to redemption and was therefore still holding on to an empty void in his soul. He never actually tried to act or get better and ignored advice from his priest friend. This proves to Rocky and to the viewer that redemption is willing to be answered by anyone willing to accept it. Just before the execution of Rocky, Connolly comes in his cell and tells him to do him one last favor--to die pretending to be a screaming, sniveling coward, which would end the boys' idolization of him. However, Rocky refuses to crack and also the favor and insists that he will be "tough" to the end and not give up the one thing he has left: his pride. It is this last sustaining power before his doomed and chilling off-screen fall that he stubbornly clings to until he appears to change his mind and has to be dragged to the electric chair. The viewer is never told whether Rocky genuinely afraid, a "rotten sniveling coward", or if he truly does it for Connolly and the boys.Love, hate, redemption and loss all of roles to play as much as the characters do in this sobering picture and leaves one to thinking how minor changes in the beginning can lead to a slow fade of bleak despair if not careful. To the rapid-fire dialogue of Cagney, to the slow, wise words of O'Brian, and a bit part from a young Bogey, Angels with Dirty Faces still has the cinematic power today in saying to be wary of how we make our own personal choices in life, regardless whether if we are from one of the toughest neighborhoods in New York or a picket-fenced, green-grassed Suburbia. Each decision has its own benefit or consequence, where Jerry's road continued onward in providing hope and guidance to the orphaned youths, the one Rocky traveled had reached its needless end far too soon in the shocking (no pun intended) film's climax. Overall, a dynamic film that still carries with it after all these years a dynamic message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnetic Cagney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story here is that Cagney is the gangster 'star' of the East Side, with a group of young hoodlums looking up to him, the same as movie-going kids who'd come to see the film. His priest friend from the old days wants him to help him put the kids on the right track. We know that he's basically a stand-up guy, a good soul, partly corrupted by the 'system'. In the end he agrees to die 'yellow', tarnishing his reputation so the kids will renounce gangster heroism.That's it in a nutshell. It isn't a bad movie, it's just that the study is so screamingly obvious, full of catechism aimed at us and reducing us to childlike goofs who know no better. It's nice enough at the start, the East Side world it portrays is thick. But it becomes such a thin message movie in the second half. Just not worth the time.Cagney though is magnetic as usual, a terrific guy. He could sing, tap dance, seduce; later on he was a judo blackbelt. Watch him slap Bogart around, here playing the mousey lawyer villain. It's clear there's no comparing them. Cagney was the real deal and this is all about his presence. How on earth did they think they could pull off that message with Cagney?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 1930s, Warner Bros. released a series of gangster flicks, usually starring people like James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, and a not-yet-famous Humphrey Bogart. Michael Curtiz's "Angels with Dirty Faces" is a prime example. Rocky Sullivan (Cagney) and Jerry Connolly (Pat O'Brien) are boyhood pals grown up who have taken two vastly dissimilar paths in life: Connolly has become a priest, while Sullivan - just out of jail - is continuing on his life of crime.I should say that a lot of the movie comes across as mildly silly. Maybe it's the wisecracking by the Dead End Kids, or the fact that the street-smart wise-guy persona in WB movies inspired many of the studio's satirical cartoons during that era (just listen to Bugs Bunny's accent). It's just that if the people behind the camera intended the movie as a warning about delinquency, then I don't interpret it as such. Not to mention that the sight of the priest in the presence of the boys implies pedophilia.Still, the movie remains an important part of cinema history, and I certainly recommend it. It's important to understand that, far from simply being bad people, many of the gangsters during the '30s were forced into lives of crime due to the Depression. "AWDF" shows that Sullivan is clearly a product of his environment, however ignoble his actions are. Really good.PS: Michael Curtiz later directed "Casablanca".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"All right, fellas... let's go and say a prayer for a boy who couldn't run as fast as I could." Somepeople say that a persons destiny is made in one single event. That it not only shapes how they are going to end, but also who they become. It could be a job offer, a marriage. Or as it in this film, it could simply be one person being faster than the other.Rocky Sullivan ( James Cagney) and Jerry Connolly ( Pat O'Brien) were two street tough kids who grew up together in the toughest part of New York --- Hell's Kitchen. Early on, Rocky gets sent to prison, simply for the reason that he couldn't outrun the cops. Eventually, this makes him into a first class criminal.Meanwhile, Jerry, who had managed to escaped from the law, goes straight and becomes a priest. It is only, as adults, that they are able to reunite in their old neighborhood: but on different philosophies. Cagney's Sullivan is a charismatic ghetto tough guy whose underworld rise has made him a hero to a gang of slum punks called the ' Dead End" kids. In contrast, Connolly vows to end Rocky's influence on the boys, who, like he and Rocky, could end up on either side of the law.Absolutely irresistible stuff, with tons of prewar Brooklyn atmosphere, &amp; Humphrey Bogart in a supporting role as a weasel-like attorney named Frazier who attempts to double-cross Cagney. At this time, Bogart was a bit player for Warner Bros, but his scenes with Cagney are played out extremely well. Though, the role isn't much... Bogart is awesome. Ann Sheridan is also fantastic as Sullivan's sharp tough love interest.Ohh yeah, and the final question. Rocky. Yellow or Not?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an overrrated movie. Certainly one of Cagney's memorable roles. Certainly a great Cagney-O'Brian film. But I should think any major actor of that period, particularly the Warners contract actors, could have pulled this role off. Humphrey Bogart is the bad lawyer, but again, anyone could have played Frazier. He's not important to the story, except as a measuring stick for the Bogart that was to come later. That the actors did a good job is not important. The story was important. The message was important. The message was just obvious by the time the first third of the movie runs through the projector. I have heard the radio version of this movie, with Cagney and O'Brian reprising their roles. It was only an hour, and MUCH BETTER. The walk to the chair is classic. It moves one to tears. And is one of the few TRUE moments in the movie.Semi-related note: Ann Sheridan did a cameo role as a prostitute in Treasure of the Sierra Madre. almost 10 years later, and looks 10 years younger in THAT movie. Finished her career doing a spin-off of As The World Turns. The OOmph Girl. No Oomph here. She was probably sick of the title anyway. But she played mols many more times. Under studio rule I'm sure. Her association with Bogart movies goes way back to THIS movie. But even SHE is more or less wasted in this movie. Anyone could have played any of the characters in this movie, with the possible exception of the East Side Kids, who went through various names and members, acted in incredibly stupid pictures,( by 21st Century standards, Bela Lugosi? Come On!) but maintained their characterization as Bronx punks even when they were middle aged men!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performance by Cagney and the great twist at the end makes this one of the best 30's films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always get a kick out of watching these Warner Bros. movies starring all the great contractees like Bogie, Cagney or even Edward G. Robinson - with the possible exception of George Raft.Angels with Dirty Faces was a tour de force for James Cagney and many of the mannerisms that he is now famous for, although some misinterpreted, are present here. His great partner-in-crime, Pat O'Brien plays his best boyhood friend and would forever be associated with his character, the priest who is basically a street thug turned straight. It's especially funny to see the characters as boys because the actor who plays Rocky (the Cagney character) bares an incredible resemblance to Cagney himself.Through many films Cagney would be pigeonholed as the tough guy, starting with his performance in Public Enemy (a film that I didn't enjoy so much because of the lack of tongue-in-cheek humor which Angels has in spades). The cast is rounded out with Ann Sheridan as the kind of down-to-earth next-door girl she played to the hilt. For a totally different Sheridan see the movie "The man who came to Dinner". Last there are "The Dead End Kids" or later "The Bowery Boys" who are basically complete stereotypes of tough smart-alecky punks which these movies were full of in American movies throughout the 30's and 40's. They are a little bit hard to take and one can only wonder how they managed to have careers in showbiz for so long.A minor flaw in this film is the rather speedy treatment of Rocky Sullivan's fall but the ending is masterful and was discussed endlessly among movie buffs (Is Rocky doing the noble thing or is he truly yellow?). That is the beauty of the movies. Like works of art they are to be interpreted and not to be taken at face value.The director, Michael Curtiz, was of course one of the greats and would later make the classic "Casablanca" but his somewhat crass demeanor proved to be his downfall in the 50's where actors took more control of their careers instead of having the studio executives and directors controlling virtually every aspect of their lives. Had he lived today he would have been called every four-letter word imaginable but he did make a great impact which should not be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Cagney: American Archetype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I picked out this movie at Blockbuster tonight because it shares its title with an album by Tricky. (More accurately, the film lent its title to the album, but that's neither here nor there.) The image of James Cagney on the box cover was an immediate turn-on. The fact that it's a gangster flick, particularly a '30s gangster flick, sealed the deal.I believe this is the first James Cagney movie I've ever seen in full. Much of the film was like remembering a dream. The character of James Cagney (not Rocky Sullivan, his role, but James Cagney) is one that is embedded in our common American psyche. From his wide flat face and slightly exaggerated good posture to the nasal twang of his voice and dated vernacular like `whadaya see? whadaya hear?', and `in a pig's eye!', James Cagney, the man, has been caricatured countless times. He is an American archetype, a persona I know from the Muppet Show, and Sesame Street, from Saturday Night Live, and un-attributed, nudge-nudge-you-know-who-I'm-doing impersonations on late night talk shows.The film itself is a wonderful testament to the fame and allure of The Gangster. Rocky Sullivan, after being released from jail, returns home where he finds a boyhood brother-in-arms (now a priest), a girl he used to flirt with, and a group of teenage fledgling wise guys. He and the priest become fraternally, diametrically opposed. He gets the girl, Ann Sheridan. The pubescent gang falls in love with him. With his courage. With his money. With his power. With his gangsterdom. This idolatry is the most interesting point of the film coming down to a tantalizing, ambiguous finale.Only adding to the pleasure that this movie brings are Humphrey Bogart as one of Cagney's associates, a John Candy look-alike as one of Bogart's middlemen, and two child actors who are the spitting image of young James Cagney and young Ann Sheridan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think anyone can really determine, no matter how many times they watch and how carefully they scrutinize it, whether or not Rocky was faking his death scene. That's just how good an actor Cagney was (and it doesn't hurt that the camera wasn't on his face).It can be taken either way. He might have been faking because Connolly asked him to. Or it could be that he genuinely did panic when he saw the electric chair. This might have been a last-moment plea for redemption. Remember, he wouldn't ask for absolution when Connolly was in the cell with him; maybe he changed his mind and asked in his own way.Flash forward 60 years or so to Menace II Society, another film I recommend. I see some parallels. In Menace, Caine, the main character, starts out directionless and living from moment to moment. His grandfather is always lecturing and preaching at him (I love the shot with the shadow on the wall of grandpa's finger wagging at him), and at one point asks him, "Do you care if you live or die?" Caine says, "I dunno," in a tone that implies he is thinking about it, but can't come up with anything.Similarly, Connolly probably preached at Sullivan a zillion times, every time he visited the prison, but it didn't sink in to him either. It wasn't until Rocky got out of prison (didn't he get out and go back in multiple times? Or was it all those years for one offense?) and found out what it's like to have a girlfriend, and have those kids look up to him, and have a place in the community, that he started to get his act together. But he didn't change fast enough. He only had one skill, and when he tried to use it one last time to build a future, he was screwed.Same with Caine. He'd been shot non-fatally but still badly, then been to prison, and endured an interrogation by Bill Duke that would humble just about anyone. ("See, you done ----ed up. You know that, don't you? You know you done ----ed up." Brrr...) So when he got out, he started listening to people: his friend's girlfriend, his friend who was in prison for life, and Charles Dutton's character. (It might also have been a faith-restoring moment when the Latino crew opted to help out Caine and his friends, instead of starting a pointless turf war.) So he decided to make an enormous change by moving to Atlanta with the girlfriend and her kid. But he still had all these karmic debts outstanding. He'd always thought that the convenience store incident would call in his markers, but instead it was the girl he'd gotten pregnant, or rather, her brother and his crew.So Caine's last thought is, "My grandpa asked me once, do I care if I live or die. Yeah...I guess I do. Now it's too late." Rocky might have been thinking something very similar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cagney and Bogart made two gangster films together in 38 and 39. Both are legendary, but the other one, Raoul Walsh's Roaring Twenties, is the better of the two.Director Micheal Curitz had a pair of masterpeices in his future, Casablanca and Yankee Doodle Dandy. He manages some great moments here, and the best two are situated at the beginning and end, giving this film a reputation that it really doesn't deserve. Otherwise, it tends to get bogged down, particularly in the basketball scene. In fact, the scenes with the Dead End Kids that rather dominate this picture threaten to drown the whole enterprise in sentimental melodrama that seems out of place in a gritty gangster film. It's worth seeing on cable, to be sure, but it's not going to blow you away. Instead, check out the aforementioned Roaring Twenties or Walsh and Cagney's other masterpeice, 1949's White Heat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely one of Cagney's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film never ceases to amaze me. I watched it for the first time with my father years ago and was enthralled (I am not one of those GenXers that suffers from black-and-white-aphobia). This is still one of Cagney's best roles and really establishes the 'tough guy with a heart of gold' archetype that would become so important to filmmakers in the future. And Cagney does it without a hint of irony.Also, it is an interesting opportunity to see Bogey in his earlier, character actor years (not yet a leading man). Every performance is dead on and every line is said with a certain sincerity that it cannot be questioned. This was pre-film noir, but it still managed to capture that gritty urbanity of later pictures without the neat camera tricks. Cagney's execution still brings up emotions in me that are surprising. And Pat O'Brien's final scene is both painful and redeeming.While this film does have certain flaws (like the rather silly attempts to portray the corruption of those that Rocky touches), it is all pulled off with an amazing flair and a beautiful style. Definitely a film for all movie afficionados to study carefully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simplistic but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a throwback and yet in some ways fresh if one looks at todays society. Not much has really changed but the black and white cinematography certainly parallels the plot in many ways. Only the names and places ( well maybe just the names) have changed over the years. It is very simplistic and almost depressingly obvious in it's moral message to the audience. However, this glamorized tour of prewar American urban crime and punishment can be a fun filled way of simply being entertained without having to be subject to todays all to common pretentionist attitudes. This is definitely a beer and popcorn , stoke the fire, sit back and relax movie .... nothing more and certainly nothing less. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enduring celluloid guff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say I... at all... cared... about the b &amp; w quality of the film; but then I'm a film buff, a feller who's adored the monochrome of more recent pictures like "Raging Bull", "Pi", "The Elephant Man", "Eraserhead" and "The Man Who Wasn't There", in addition to scores of the more "classic" 30s/40s Era. This film is a fine concoction; should prove winning to near every pallette. We have James Cagney in fine form, O'Brien and Bogart in dependable support mode, Ann Sheridan as a diverting, dewy dame and a plot (and script) playing by the rules of good gangster socio-realist melodrama. Watch out for an amusing basketball game and a moving, apposite ending, folks...If you're in the right, feisty mood, this film'll provide an hour and a half's fine, enduring hokum...!Rating:- ****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney as a blubbering, gibbering mess!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find the portrayal of a yellow-belly coward by James Cagney to be very interesting. How a man can be reduced to a gibbering, blubbering mess in such circumstances is very believable. It is obvious that he was all talk and is really a great yellow-belly. To beg and scream like this is not dignified and proves that his yellow streak is formidable. I have never seen such cowardice on screen before and Cagney does it well. He was born to play these yellow type characters. He played yellowbellys in most of his films, no? Very good. As a child, I was haunted by a grown man in hysterical mode, screaming, crying and shaking like a shithouse.. Very shocking, indeed. I guess he got his just desserts but to display such a blubbering mess to his captors is very weak. For certain.I was relieved when they pulled the lever to silence him once and for all. His begging, blubbering and crying was embarrassing.Cowardice indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film-noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a pure treat for me. It starred two of my all-time favorite actors, James Cagney and the incomparable Humphrey Bogart. Bogart at this stage of his career was still playing the 'gangster' almost exclusively but he is still great in this film. Of course, Angels with Dirty Faces belongs to James Cagney's Rocky Sullivan. His conflict whether to reform at the behest of boyhood chum Father Connelly (O'Brien) for the benefit of the kids or to rake in the cash as a hoodlum in league with backstabbing thieves led by Frazier (Bogart) provides great dramatic tension. The ending where Sullivan must decide whether or not to give up the "one thing he has left" is rightly viewed as one of the most dramatic death row scenes ever filmed. Memorable film, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Gangster Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic James Cagney movie with added character support. In my opinion Bogart is the strongest of all supporting characters. He is himself, even as a lawyer. Classic BogieBest Scene: When Rockey realizes he's been betrayed and wastes Bogie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Corny End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, the boys Rocky Sullivan (James Cagney) and Jerry Connelly (Pat O'Brien) are best friends and small time thieves. After a robbery, Rocky is arrested and sent to a reformatory school, where he begins his criminal career. Jerry escapes and later becomes a priest. After three years in prison, Rocky is released and charges his former partner, the lawyer James Frazier (Humphrey Bogart), his US$ 100,000.00 and his share in the society, and is betrayed. Meanwhile, he becomes the idol of the street kids in the neighborhood. Although following opposite paths in life, Rocky and Jerry are still friends. When Jerry decides to fight against the corruption, Rocky is put against the wall between his friendship with the priest, and his society in dirty businesses with his criminal partners."Angels With Dirty Faces" is a great film-noir, with magnificent performance of James Cagney, who was nominated to the Oscar to Best Actor in a Leading Role for his excellent performance. The story of a charismatic criminal is engaging, but I did not like the final redemption of his character, and indeed I found the ending very disappointing and corny. With a more realistic and suitable conclusion, this movie would be an unforgettable classic of the genre. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Anjos de Cara Suja" ("Angels With Dirty Face")</fullReview>
