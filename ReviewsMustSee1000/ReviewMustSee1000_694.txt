		<shortDescription>You've already seen this movie, but better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally intended for release in September of 2012, Gangster Squad has belatedly hit theatres this week. The film follows the story of LA crime boss Mickey Cohen and a group of off-the-book beat cops to bring him down. "Based" on a true story (What movie isn't these days?) the film and its fantastic cast promise much but come across as bland and boring.Set in Los Angeles in the 50's, Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is a crime lord who has taken over and there seems to be nobody who can stop him. The few good cops are outnumbered by the cops Cohen has bought and it seems all hope is lost. But Police Chief Nick Nolte decides something needs to be done and assigns good, hard cop Josh Brolin to put together a team to go after Cohen. What follows is the assembling of a team of not-so- perfect cops and the war they wage on Cohen's empire.Sound familiar? That's because we've all already seen this movie, only done much better. You can tick the cliché's off as you watch. Good cop being grilled by his dirty cop superior? Check. Older tougher cop and his young protégé? Check. Evil henchman of the chief bad guy? Check. The list could go on but would approach spoiler territory. The climax of the film is somewhat predictable about half way through. You can foresee almost all of the events that will play out in the last 20 minutes and while it's enjoyable enough, it's nothing you haven't seen before.The cast is a who's who list of names. Which makes the film all the more disappointing. With names like Brolin, Gosling, Penn and Stone they should blow you away. But the characters are nothing more than caricatures and nobody gets the chance to portray any real depth, with the possible exception of Giovanni Ribsi. Sean Penn looks bizarre in a mountain of makeup, although it matches his completely over the top performance. Ryan Gosling turns in a nicely subtle performance, but most of the rest of the cast are stuck in cardboard cut out roles with individual stories set on railway tracks. We all know where they're going to go, we just have to wait for them to get there.Also worth mentioning in the reason for the delay in the film's release. Originally the film was to be released in September 2012, but then the Aurora shooting took place. At that time one of the key set pieces of the film was a scene in which the characters shoot at people from behind a movie screen in a theatre. Realising how disastrously that would be received in the wake of Aurora, the studio immediately suspended promotion for the film and set about reworking that scene. The cast re- assembled in August to reshoot the sequence, now taking place in Chinatown. Something I liked: Robert Patrick's performance as the grizzled older gunslinger. As a Terminator 2 fan it was great to see him still taking out people almost at will.Something I didn't like: The predictable climax. At the 60 minute mark I mentally made a list of things I thought would happen in the last 20 or so minutes of the film. Of my list of about 6 things, 5 of them happened exactly as I predicted.Something that bugged me: The scenes with Josh Brolin and Nick Nolte seemed to be shot out of focus. It was particularly noticeable in the shots of Nolte. For a film with a budget of $75M, this just shouldn't happen.Summary: Ultimately Gangster Squad is an enjoyable enough 100 minutes but isn't anything significant. There's no great performances, no spectacular set pieces nor any big moments that you'll go home talking about. For the ladies there's an ample amount of eye candy in the form of a suited and fedora-d Ryan Gosling, and for the gentlemen there's Emma Stone and a no-nonsense Robert Patrick. But the story fails to ever really leap off the page and become something. We're told Mickey Cohen is bad, but he's never anything more than "that bad guy". We don't hate him, we don't sympathise with him or desperately want him to be taken down. He's just "the bad guy". The same can be said for all of the characters, and the story as a whole. Which makes it on the whole, ultimately forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly Cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a screening of Gangster Squad last night and to say the least, I was unimpressed. I had decent expectations for the film with a stout cast the likes of Sean Penn, Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling along with a director whose last two films I enjoyed (Zombieland and 30 Mins or Less). So what went wrong? Like the summary says it was incredibly cliché of every gangster movie out there and tried so hard to be like LA Confidential and the Untouchables. While this movie would have done much better in the 90's I don't feel it fits in this generation of film.You have Sean Penn as Mickey Cohen who decides he wants to be the king of Los Angeles and he will take out whoever is in his way. Nick Nolte plays the police chief who is tired of the way LA is going and recruits hard nosed, do-as-I-please Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) to create a crack team to take Cohen down. From there you have the obligatory round-up-the team where he gets the bi-focal smart guy, the past-his-prime outlaw and side kick, the token black guy, and the cop who doesn't want to join at first but is thrust into the fray.You then have a typical hunt down the bad guy, have a couple of shoot outs where an incredible amount of bullets fly and no one gets touched, and a very flat romance where you wonder why these two are together for no other reason than they are really good looking. There were also moments in the climax of the movie where the audience burst out in laughter and I feel that it was incredibly unwarranted.The only real redeeming quality was Sean Penn who gave an intense, powerful performance as Mickey Cohen. All in all I was disappointed in Gangster Squad and feel like the entire movie brought nothing new to the table of the gangster genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilty Pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Admittedly, I am one of those who take movies very seriously. Good movies make me happy (even the sad ones), and bad movies make me sulk. Every now and then, one comes along that I find myself enjoying despite the warning buzzers blasting in my film snob brain. Such is the latest from director Ruben Fleisher (who also directed the entertaining Zombieland)."Inspired by true events" should always be interpreted as a disclaimer that the movie will play fast and loose with history and the details of the story. Sean Penn plays Mickey Cohen, a renowned Los Angeles gangster from the late 40's. Due to widespread police corruption, Police Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) authorized an "off the books" team to take down mob operations (gambling, prostitution, etc). This much was documented in Paul Lieberman's book. How this story is presented by Fleisher and screenwriter Will Beall (signed on for the Justice League movie) has more in common with a comic book than actual history.The movie is extremely beautiful to look at. It's slick and stylish with a glamorous color palette, and the production design is top notch - capturing the look and feel of a booming Los Angeles. If you are expecting the next "L.A. Confidential" or even "The Untouchables", you will be disappointed. It's more in line with "Dick Tracy", "Scarface", and "Hoffa". In other words ... it looks great and the action, characters and dialogue are all way over the top.The cast is superb, but most are underutilized. Josh Brolin is the tough leader of the squad that features Ryan Gosling (the token cool womanizer), Robert Patrick (the token dead-eye gunslinger), Anthony Mackie (the innercity, knife-wielding token black cop), Giovanni Ribisi (the token geeky electronics expert), and Michael Pena (the rookie and token Hispanic cop). Unfortunately, my crude descriptions are just about as in-depth as the movie goes with any of them. In fact, Yvette Tucker playing Carmen Miranda, gets almost as much screen time as any of these cops as she sings "Chica Chica Boom Chic".The violence is cartoonish in its fervor. The aim of these gangsters is among the worst in movie history, and that's quite an accomplishment. Using Tommy Guns and pistols, my estimate is that one in every 167 shots actually hits an intended target. Many elaborate set pieces are destroyed in the process. The exception is Robert Patrick's character, who is actually featured in a detective serial. He never misses ... even after being wounded. Penn plays Cohen as a ruthless mob boss, unwilling to accept any failure from his crew. And you know what that means. No pink slips here ... just ugly death via power drill, burning elevator or classic car tug-of-war.An interesting note is the presence of three actors from recent cult TV shows. Holt McCallany (Lights Out), Mireille Enos (The Killing) and Troy Garity (Boss) all have key roles in the film, as does Jon Polito, whose face and voice make him a must-cast in any gangster film.If you are able to turn off the logical and reasoning part of your brain ... just sit back and enjoy Emma Stone smoking a cig while wearing a red evening gown, an understated Ryan Gosling with an odd speech pattern, Sean Penn wearing a prosthetic nose and spewing hilarious bad guy lines, and the creepy feeling that Josh Brolin is just 25 years away from looking and sounding exactly like Nick Nolte ... then hopefully you can take this one for what it is - a guilty pleasure. www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Glossy, slick, bloody, violent, dumb, crowd-pleasing, and undeniably entertaining. Filled with every gangster genre cliché rolled into one, GANGSTER SQUAD ain't high art, nor is it aiming to be. It seemed as if director Fleischer was trying to tell this story in the most fun possible way, and he succeeds with flying colors. The film is at its best when its loud and dumb but falters when it tries to be anything more than that.The cast seems like they're having fun, especially Sean Penn who has a field day with his role as the villain Mickey Cohen. The lines he's given are pure gold. Josh Brolin does a great job as the lead and Ryan Gosling is charming and charismatic as usual. However, Emma Stone is underused with a thankless role, but it's nice that she's in the film anyway. Overall, GANGSTER SQUAD is fun entertainment. No judgments, little pretense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Penn wants to be De Niro and Pacino simultaneously, but instead emerges ridiculous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it stays light and adventurous, "Gangster Squad" has its minutes of spirited entertainment. But too often it attempts to mimic other films while pulling back the reigns of exuberance for a much darker approach. Zigzagging between callous seriousness one minute to comical zaniness the next, the film offers a mishmash of tones, styles, and gangster movie clichés. Consistency is not its strong point. By the third time slow-motion shootouts and glamorous dames awash in billowing cigarette smoke give way to tedious villains and brooding montages, any sense of direction vanishes - along with the fun.It's 1940's Los Angeles and power-hungry mob boss Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) begins a relentless quest to take over the entire city. In order to stop him, Police Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) tasks gung-ho Sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) with creating the "Gangster Squad," a secret group of unorthodox officers who will stop at nothing to bring Cohen down. Quickly becoming as ruthless as the very thugs they're assigned to apprehend, O'Mara, Wooters (Ryan Gosling), Harris (Anthony Mackie), Kennard (Robert Patrick), Ramirez (Michael Pena), and Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi) begin destroying Cohen's empire one operation at a time. But when Wooters falls for Cohen's girl Grace (Emma Stone) and the gangster discovers the identities of his adversaries, the battalion must prepare for a war that will determine the fate of the city."Gangster Squad" doesn't know what it wants to be. As eclectic as the colors are in the movie (though certainly not as extreme as "Dick Tracy"), so too are the continually shifting tones and styles. The end credits appear as pulpy vacation postcard illustrations (the last of the unexpected fluctuations in imagery) which sharply contrast with the initial scenes of ultra bloody violence (featuring a man being torn apart by vehicles, a la "The Hitcher," which seems like a goofy execution in the face of serious villainy), the later moments of romance, and the climactic showdown in the Plaza Hotel. It's all as hodgepodged as last year's "Lawless," continually trying to impart severity, attraction, adventure, and even comedy at different moments, but forcing the wrong emotions. Several scenes of action will likely garner eye rolls, while elements of brutality will evoke laughter? unintentionally (the incredibly high rate of gunfire is hilarious in comparison to stricken targets, especially as enemies unleash machineguns against pistols and still hit nearly nothing).Penn wants to be De Niro and Pacino simultaneously, but instead emerges ridiculous, forgetting his accent and tripping over his unnatural, obligatory mercilessness. The language, hats, coats, dresses, flasks, guns, cars, and cigarettes all bring momentary authenticity, but they're no match for the exceedingly contemporary camera angels (zooming through car windows during breakneck midnight chases), high definition slow motion, and overly apparent special effects, which take every opportunity to pluck audiences from their suspensions of disbelief to draw attention to the technical methods. There are junctures of fun, however, in the guerilla warfare tactics, battling crooked cops, assembling a dream team (not unlike "The Untouchables" or "Ocean's Eleven"), and the Wild West, loose cannon, one-liner gun show that is Robert Patrick. But O'Mara's confidence and "bull in a china shop" approach to law enforcement is frequently too generic and consummates in dead civilians, revenge attacks, and massive shootouts in which participants stand like stalwart statues in plain sight while bullets whiz around them, making contact with every prop in the background. Few viewers will be seeing these ideas for the first time.- The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't understand the hate....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year is 1949 and Los Angeles is being run by mob king Mickey Cohen. Now, a secret team of detectives and cops form together to bring him down and bring peace back to the streets.Gangster Squad was a nice romp back to the days where detectives said funny lines, smoked indoors and held tommy guns. Here is a film that looks slick with a nice polish, a great ensemble cast and a story that has enough meat to it for us to chew on. Yet, people seem to be hating on it. Did they all expect another Untouchables? Sure, Gangster Squad has moments where the inspirations from past films peep through, but not once did this film try to be more than the sum of its means. Gangster Squad is a fun film, has thrilling moments and will entertain you. Josh Brolin plays Sgt. John O'Mara, a tough as nails cop who is willing to put his life on the line for truth and justice. This annoys his very pregnant wife, who seems ready to pop at any moment. She takes it upon herself to help form the team he needs in order to protect him. The team involves: Anthony Mackie, an officer who is deadly with a knife, Giovanni Ribisi, a smart wire tapper, Robert Patrick, an ace with a pistol and his protégé Michael Pe?a whose eager to learn. The last addition to the team is the young, hot and dangerous Ryan Gosling, who seems to have found himself entangled with the mob king, Cohen's gal, played by Emma Stone. There are obvious moments in the film where it tips its hat to predecessors like L.A. Confidential and the more obvious, The Untouchables. There is even a sequences involving a stairwell, although not as tense and more by the numbers shoot em up, the sequence is still one of the exciting pieces in the film. Both those films are more intricate with plot, characters and structure, by a mile. Gangster Squad doesn't focus on stuff like that, it wants to thrill you. Which is why some sequences in which we are suppose to care whether our characters live or die don't really pan out.It has a graphic novel feel to it, very film noir and for those who've played L.A. Noir, will get the same sense of style. While the film looks great in a lot of sequences, that same style has some short comings, mainly the use of CGI as movement for the camera. It's the most noticeable, at least for me, in two scenes. With Josh Brolin in an elevator early on fighting two crooked guys and the second is when Ryan Gosling decides to pull his gun out in the middle of a club. The second scene in question is in slow motion and focuses mainly on his face, but the jarring background movement opposed to the steadiness of his face is just that, jarring and it takes you out of the film and makes you realize you are watching a film.Everyone plays their roles respectively well, even if the team seems one dimensional. Sean Penn hams it up in a role that demands him to overact. The make up may distract some, but it added to the character for me. He was the one who seemed to have the most fun with his role. A lot of people scream style over substance and this may be true in some cases. I for one never went into the film expecting writing of another calibre and thus I found myself enjoying it a tad more. There are some laughable scenes due to how cliché they are. One involves a character throwing their badge away into the water and another has the classic, character yelling another character's name as they walk away, when that person stops and turns, no one says a word. Moments like these that are played out in numerous films make me yawn and roll my eyes. So go into Gangster Squad with an open mind, don't expect greatness, just a fun ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serves no purpose other than showcasing a series of tiresome gunfights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1949 Los Angeles is a city ruled by the mob. At the top of the crime syndicates is Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), a ruthless mobster involved with murder, women and drugs. To combat Cohen, the police department look to construct a special squad of cops who will shut down his operations. Bill Parker (Nick Nolte) pitches the idea to honest cop John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), who is also a happily married war veteran. His wife gives him the idea of picking men that have little ambition and therefore less likely to be corrupted. One of the main men to join his squad is Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling), who has eyes for Cohen's etiquette teacher Grace (Emma Stone). The other members of the squad include Coleman (Anthony Mackie), Max (Robert Patrick), Conway (Giovanni Ribisi) and Navidad (Michael Pena), each of whom has their own specialties. The most depressing realisation about Gangster Squad is not simply that it is the lowest form of pulp trash, but that it leaves in its wake the question of "what if?" Director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, 30 Minutes or Less) has assembled a cast that the most seasoned director would salivate over, only to show complete ineptitude towards authenticity and controlled performance registers. The only positive to be drawn from the film is that it contains some momentarily appealing photography. The rest of the film is a shambles. It's badly directed, allowing for poor performances, glossy over-stylisation, and serves no purpose other than showcasing a series of tiresome gunfights. How did Warners Bros, who produced some of the most important gangster films ever made, let this happen? It's through no fault of the source material. The film is based on a seven day L.A. Times series by journalist Paul Lieberman, who in 2008 chronicled the real life formation of the Gangster Squad. Historical facts notwithstanding, the film is as it claims "inspired by a true story". It's the treatment of the material that fails. Discussing the film's cop-turned-writer Will Beall, Lieberman stated in an article for the Nieman Reports: "With 'The Gangster Squad,' he understood that the studio wanted to go big, with flying bullets and fists." Evidentially, someone at Warner Bros. felt this subgenre had to be modernised by removing the substance and racking up the violence. The classic gangster films of the past were more psychological than ostentatious. Filmmakers like Howard Hawks used them as public warnings against the real life threat of gangsters and to pressure governments to take stronger action against them. The films provided cautionary tales about the way that ordinary people could be seduced the allure of power and money, raising their social status but dispersing their friends, family and moral values. Actors like James Cagney transformed the gangster figure into tragic Shakespearean characters that were physically and mentally corroded by the failure of the American Dream. The heavy emphasis on the violence and the action in Gangster Squad lessens the opportunity for complex moral ambiguity. A character asks John late if there is a difference between the criminals and the gangster squad. It's hard to believe given the film's insistence of what a monster Cohen is, along with Penn's disappointingly monotone performance, which substitutes nuances for snarls and angry grimaces. After an opening scene where he orders someone to be drawn and quartered between two cars, there's little by way of sympathy or psychology. Similarly, if Fleischer is interested in blurring the lines between the criminals and the police, why does he frequently romanticise their battles with adolescent techniques like slow-motion, freeze framing and careless juxtaposition? In one sequence he contrasts a raid with the Carmen Miranda song 'Chica Chica Boom Chic', as the camera crabs sideways, scanning the crew as they beat up crims. Is there any reason besides including a superficial pop reference? This is true of Fleischer's overwrought visual style, one which desperately claws for your attention, only to remain vacuous. There are pretty moments in the film, like a sumptuous wide shot of L.A.'s neon glowing nightlife and Emma Stone's first appearance in a red dress, but they're designed solely to distract you from the film's emptiness and artificiality, as these colour techniques are divorced from a theme. The performances in this mess range between embarrassing and vapid, and in some cases, both. Brolin's character is a dull lead, the can-do officer with the beautiful home and concerned wife. I found her surprisingly more interesting but the exchanges between the pair gnaw at terrible clichés: "The war is over. Stop fighting," she tells him. When the rest of the cast is allowed to speak, and some of them aren't, they're embarrassed by laughably ornate dialogue, such as: "This is a war for the soul of Los Angeles!" and "The whole town is under water and you're using a bucket when you should be grabbing a bathing suit". Gosling is the only actor who seems aware of how silly the project is. But his performance is compromised of poses and jokey lines, so chilled that he could play Jerry in his sleep. Likewise, Emma Stone's reunion with her Zombieland director leaves her with only two things to do: smoke and look po-faced. The gangster squad itself is little more than a collection of action figurines, defined by quirks than personality, like the knife thrower, the fast shooter and the Hispanic guy. I liked this movie more when it was called The Untouchables (1987). A tremendous cast and glamorous production design is wasted hosting loosely connected action scenes, with little substance to support them. Warner Bros. decided to delay the film six months following the Aurora shooting. Or was it because they already knew how poor the film was? Now after the events in Connecticut, how will they sell a film that's only interested in gunfire?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stereotype-ridden Snorefest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though made for a plethora of reasons, a film need only achieve one goal to be successful: it needs to be entertaining. Engaging characters, good performances, and a story that is engrossing, even if a bit cardboard or cliché. When a film ultimately fails, it is because its characters are wooden or stereotypical, the storyline is boring, and the only question it might raise is, "was this intended to be sleep therapy for a study on insomnia?" Set that film in 1949 and make it about gangsters and cops, and you've got Gangster Squad, a film so inept that Ruben Fleischer should win an award for managing to make a violent action movie that could put an Olympic sprinter to sleep in mid-stride.Josh Brolin stars as Sgt. Something-or-other, a no-nonsense cop who is recruited by the grizzled police chief (Nick Nolte, who eats sandpaper, apparently) to stop a gangster from taking over Los Angeles. Brolin broods as the take-no-prisoners Sarge, his squad rarely referring to him by name because they probably can't remember his name either. Despite how stylized the trailers may seem, how action-packed and exciting it promises to be, this is little more than a stable of stereotypes loosed upon mid-twentieth-century Los Angeles and hoping not to bore it half to death. It becomes exhausting to try to care about what's going on in the film because the characters haven't got a shred of credibility between them; the only enjoyment comes from Robert Patrick, himself packed tightly into the stereotype of the sharpshooting old westerner.Sean Penn's utterly ham-fisted Mickey Cohen is taken down, but who cares? The film never makes you care about the struggle against him or the city under his rule; he's ruthless, he's tough as nails, and he's every other stereotype of the evil gangster that Sean Penn could look up the day after he got cast and decided to cram into the character. Every single actor in this film has been utterly fantastic in other films; how could the ensemble be so frightfully uninteresting? The utterly versatile and likable Ryan Gosling is so bland and watered-down that he seems confused as to why he is even in the film. Emma Stone is rendered to eye candy, a crime given her considerable talents.Yet, as contrived as the characters are, it doesn't come close to touching how terrible the script is. Penn mugs at the camera, his only character direction seemingly "sound more angry" or "be more gangster-y." The film does itself a disservice to not show Cohen's rise to power- it wants the audience to see how powerful Cohen is, but killing his own men for their ineptitude and eating a steak dinner at a fancy restaurant does nothing to imbue the fear that Mickey is supposed to represent into the script. He quite honestly seems rather harmless, and without a villain to care about, the gangster squad's mission to tackle said villain becomes even more pointless.The real tragedy here is the fact that for two hours, there are guns firing, flashy action sequences and big period set pieces, yet none of it seems all that interesting. It needed to be longer; it needed to go deeper. Having Sarge's wife tell the audience that he'll pick duty over family is supposed to be meaningful, but the scene is unnecessary- the opening sequence with Brolin's character tells everyone that. Too much time is spent between characters needlessly talking exposition at the audience. Time better spent developing a camaraderie between the squad members is instead spent on slow-motion sequences or on Brolin's chin-set, Mickey-Cohen-is-bad speeches. If Mickey Cohen is so terrible, why doesn't a film about his downfall just show the audience that? Not to say that Gangster Squad is completely bereft of enjoyment. The period setting was very well done, with some magnificent costume and set design. It may have been senseless and boring, but at least it felt like it was boring in 1949 and wasn't really out of place. A chase sequence early on with some vintage automobiles is excellently handled, filled with some great explosive tension, figuratively and literally. The film handles most of its gunplay and action sequences quite well, it's just a shame that all the bullets are coming from guns shot by gunmen and are flying at targets that are equally vapid and meaningless. These aren't characters, they're shells, into which an actor was poured and just told to act like a single-line description from an old pulp novel about gangsters.Despite a moment here or there of decent action, there's nothing redeemable about the entire experience that is Gangster Squad. It is empty, boring, and ultimately will leave the audience feeling... well, nothing. What should have been an excellent period film with gangsters and cops with some depth and character exploration is instead ripe with brevity, with everything thrown at the screen wrapped in a stereotype with so little substance, you can almost see through Mickey Cohen.Check out my profile for links to my other reviews!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic case of style over substance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is entertaining as hell. It's also a total mess. Seriously, it's like watching a live-action cartoon with an A-list cast trying so hard to make this dialogue credible, but there's nothing they can do. It's a cartoon. Over the top, hammy dialogue, crazy shootouts with no consequence. If you don't shut your brain off within the first 20 minutes of this movie then you're doing something wrong. It's a shame because the plot is based off of the real life gangster Mickey Cohen who was the ruler of LA for a time, and the source material has endless potential. But the faster you can accept that that's not the kind of movie this is, the quicker you can appreciate it for its camp value. Some things that stand out are Sean Penn's ridiculously over the top performance. Not that you can fault him for it. The part is written as a stereotypical gangster with temper issues and the script throws him these cheesy one-liners that wouldn't sound authentic coming from anyone's mouth. But to his credit, he's fun to watch. As is Brolin who plays the leader of the squad, and probably the most "human" character of them all. And there's Ryan Gosling is doing a really weird but oddly fitting voice for this time period with his natural charismatic charm. The supporting cast is good as well but they practically nothing to do. There's no pathos anywhere - it's all overblown bombast, and if you're okay with that, then I think you'll get a kick out of Gangster Squad.If you're expecting LA Confidential 2, stay the hell away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating and intense, but lacks some substance for those who can't "let it go and watch the movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has everything you could ask for, in an action-packed emotional thrill ride, provided that you are able to just let go, and let yourself to be engrossed. For those who prefer films that may have a little less predictability, or people that find themselves unable to maintain the "suspension of disbelief", this movie would be understandably less enjoyable.Right alongside moments that range from somewhat cringe-worthy, to positively grisly, there are enough instances of justice, and pleasant surprises to cause powerful feel-good moments just shortly after even the darkest of situations. I personally felt a constant paralyzing tension keeping me glued to my seat in the theater throughout the entire movie, and couldn't bring myself to leave and go to the bathroom.The cast and their acting is just about flawless, (though admittedly a bit cliché at times), and the sets and cinematography are superb. Sean Penn is positively frightening, and shines in his role as the villain, while Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling perfectly portray the face of their vigilante-style band of misfits; The Gangster Squad.If you are familiar with the story that this movie is loosely based from, you may be disappointed by the fact that it is QUITE loosely based indeed. I feel that this makes is a likable, albeit somewhat predictable movie, but others who expect it to stick with the "real story" may not find it as enjoyable, despite the overall positive tone that the new adaption allows.Though the reviews seem to be a horse-a-piece, I recommend seeing it and judging for yourself, because it truly is an interesting thrill ride that will have you rooting for the good guys, tearing up from time to time, and cringing at the evil that Sean Penn is able to embody in an absolutely brilliant and stylish movie about good guys doing wrong to take down bad guys doing worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Early Frontrunner for Most Inconsequential Movie of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's only the second release week of 2013 and already we have a strong contender for "most inconsequential film of the year." Shot and edited without any idea of how to make it exciting, written like what a 12- year-old might think a tough gangster movie would sound like, and looking surprisingly modern for a period piece that takes place in 1949 and is "inspired by true events," "Gangster Squad" is a perfect example of mediocrity hitting the big screen.In fact, the only interesting thing about this movie is how it came to be released in January and not in September like was originally planned. As many of you will note, the Aurora shooting spree took place, and was a tragedy. In "Gangster Squad"'s trailer, the titular squad shoots up a movie theater. Thinking that keeping that scene in would be rather tasteless, the studio pulled back the release date and re-shot portions of the film to have the big shootout take place somewhere else. They then scheduled a new release date of January 11, 2013, instead of September 7, 2012.Perhaps it's just the cynic in me thinking this, but if the film was any good, why would it get released in January, which is the dumping ground for bad films? If the studio had faith that it was great, surely holding it back another couple of months would have been the right thing to do. My theory is that they knew this wasn't going to be anything special, or even good, so it was dumped in January, even despite its cast of stars and surprisingly large budget of $75 million.The basic idea of "Gangster Squad" is that a group of LAPD Detectives got together and formed a team whose goal it was to stop the gangsters who threatened to take control of Los Angeles. The villain is a ruthless man named Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), a former boxer who pays off anyone who gets in the way of his "business dealings," which are illegal. Nobody can touch him, everyone thinks, but since we know the film is about the titular squad, we're pretty sure that he can, at the very least, be upset, if not fully removed from the equation.The gang: John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), a family man and our protagonist/narrator; Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling), a ladies' man and nothing more; Rocky Washington (Anthony Mackie), someone who really hates heroin; Max Kennard (Robert Patrick), the fastest draw in the Wild West -- seriously, he sounds like he's from the 1840s, not the 1940s; Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pe?a) a rookie cop nobody takes seriously because he's Mexican; and Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi), another family man and the one tasked with listening in to a bugged television set.Does that not seem like some sort of dream cast? Throw in Nick Nolte as the police chief who orders John to do this and Emma Stone as the love interest for one or possibly more of the characters, and you're talking quite a strong group of actors. It's just a shame they had to go and make this, such a lifeless, bland, uninspired movie. Did we really need a soft-remake of "The Untouchables"? That's really what "Gangster Squad" feels like.Much of the problem comes from the director, Ruben Fleischer, whose previous feature-length work is made up entirely of comedies. He did "Zombieland," which was a lot of fun, and "30 Minutes or Less," which was not. He does manage to inject "Gangster Squad" with some genuinely funny moments -- the best of which involved a knockout blow which failed in its target; you rarely see that in non-comedies at the cinema -- but most of the time he feels completely wrong for this material. He doesn't seem to "get" the feel of this type of movie.There is no depth to any of the characters. The dialogue is so cheesy and unfitting that it feels like it was written by someone who maybe watch a gangster film once in high school and is trying to remember what the characters sounded like, there's more slow motion than in a Zack Snyder movie, but used without any purpose. Seriously, there's a shootout late in the movie that is done entirely in slow motion and it accomplishes nothing -- especially when you know that none of the main characters will die.Despite the overuse of slow motion, the action scenes are still cut together in such a way so as to not allow you any idea of who's doing what to whom at any given moment. There's even a car fight, but since all of the characters look similar and the cars are the same models, you never know what's going on. The same is true of the fist fights -- the climax is one, which is to be expected, and is the only decent action in the entire film -- and many of the shootouts.There's nothing to "Gangster Squad." Under the gangster movie surface, it's an empty, hollow movie, and there's absolutely no reason to watch it. You trudge through it, hoping the payoff will be worth the almost two hours of your life that it takes to finish -- and it feels a lot longer than that -- and you won't get that. "The Untouchables" exists so this film doesn't have to. It has an attractive cast and some touches of humor, but "Gangster Squad" is a cheap knockoff of one of what used to be one of the most reliable genres around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Ryan Gosling. I love Zombieland. I think Micheal Pena is one of the most underrated actors working right now. I don't know what happened. No Wait Yeah I do this is one of the laziest most sterile scripts that I've witnessed in recent memory. This feels like a studio executive went up to a script generator and typed in "Undercover cop movie" and it printed out the Expendables but with cops . Then he read it and put in " Undercover Cover Cop movie set in classic Hollywood". To get the positives out of the way, the movie has a great aesthetic. It's beautiful, colors pop out nice and saturated. The actors here are all solid. Nobody is really embarrassing themselves, aside from being in this movie, from their performances and some of them even manage to deliver some pretty cheesy lines really well. The pacing here is pretty good almost too fast, but i'll come back to that. The action is nothing to speak of it's just there. The Direction leaves a lot to be desired, unlike the atmospheric classic hollywoods movies this rips off which have a slow focused camera work to them this is shot like any other action movie. Ruben Fleisher is definitely an actor's director he is able to get decent to good performances from actors, and I don't want to right him off just yet.The Ugly. This movie is so generic. Even worse it's predictable. I've noticed a slew of genre movies recently that take a traditional typical story and it's clichés and turn them into tropes and strive to make them better. Lincoln Lawyer, 21 Jump Street, End Of Watch, take traditional story and plot points and make them better and inventive . This movie relishes in it's clichés, but not enough to make fun of them. The first thing the villain does it kills somebody. No nuance or tension he just kills somebody. The next scene is the cop whose too dedicated to his job making an arrest he shouldn't as his partner advices him not to. The scene after that he goes into the chiefs office. Had it been more over the top, I was laughing hysterically at some parts not intended of course, I could've enjoyed it more, but it's not smart at all. It even could've been like Sherlock Holmes 2009 or Pirates, but no it's fine being a standard action movie.The Bad. This movie is written by Will Beall who is currently writing the Justice League movie that is set to come out in 2 years. Yeah, after the reviews for this movie come out and the box office take Justice League will find a new writer. I have nothing but contempt for this guy. This script has no meat it has stock characters with great actors. Once again if this was Edgar Wright or Joss Wheedon they'd get some dimension or have a lot of heart or be really funny, but no. The team consists of The Overdedicated cop, The guy who never misses, The guy who uses a knife, The tech guy, and the Newbie. There either needs to be Character development with a mediocre story, or Story Development with stock characters. This has neither. In every scene you get force feed exposition. If Tyler Perry directed an action movie it'd be like this. No subtly.****SPOILERS*** There was a line so corny I didn't realize how bad it was Until I left the theatre. Sean Penn is the bad guy, whose scene can't end without someone being killed or yelled at, and he says to his henchmen who execute some one " You know the drill". Then they pickup a drill and kill him with it.. I couldn't make that up **** SPOILERS OVEREThis movie is a bologna sandwich. It's the yellow starburst of movies. Although It is more enjoyable then the Expendables, I couldn't tell you why it's the same idea big cast no effort, This movie is something you watch at a friends house. This is the perfect movie for one night at Redbox. All the people who don't watch 2 movies a day will enjoy it and think it's a good movie. All the smart people can have some friends over with some beers and laugh and make jokes about it and play " Name what movie that scene was stolen from". Basically an alternative go watch Mad Men or L.A. Confidential or go play L.A. Noire much more rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fans of The Untouchables Will Certainly Enjoy this Gangster Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1949, in Los Angeles, the ambitious and ruthless kingpin Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) controls drugs, prostitution and gambling and has the local judge and police department in his pocket. When Sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) busts Mickey's brothel to rescue a naive newcomer in town, Police Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) summons him and offers to O'Mara to form an unofficial unit to destroy Mickey's facilities and shipments to take him down. O'Mara and his wife select four incorruptible cops to work with him. Then a fifth police officer joins the team in the beginning of a war against Mickey's empire of crime."Gangster Squad" is an entertaining movie based on the biography of the powerful and violent gangster Meyer Harris "Mickey" Cohen. This criminal indeed ended his days in Alcatraz but years later, sentenced twice for tax evasion and not for murder. Unfortunately the true story was not written this way.The cast is magnificent, with names such as Sean Penn, Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Robert Patrick, Giovanni Ribisi among many others and the art direction and costumes is also excellent. The plot has many clichés and works like a cartoon, with the bullets occasionally hitting the heroes, but all of that is part of the entertainment. Fans of "The Untouchables" will certainly enjoy this effective gangster movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Caça aos Gângsteres" ("Hunting Down the Gangsters")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoof or serious gangster drama?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨I always knew I'd die in Burbank¨Gangster Squad walks a really thin line between being a terrible film and an entertaining one. First of all it has a really great and talented cast; it also has a good production design and is very stylized reminding us of some epic gangster films. On the other hand the film only looks gangster-like on the surface; it is not really a serious neo- noir gangster film but more of a light comedic gangster movie. This is director Ruben Fleisher's follow up to his hit comedy Zombieland, and in a way it does feel like a satire of sorts of gangster films, but in some strange way it fails to find its own personality. You never know if you're supposed to take the movie seriously or not because something is missing in the mix between drama and comedy. One critic defined the film better than I could by claiming it is ¨LA Confidential without the script.¨ It has the look and the tone of a serious gangster film, but the script which was loosely adapted by Will Beall from Paul Lieberman's book just fails and the dialogues seem cartoonish at times. The violence is pretty heavy as there are plenty of glamorized gunfight scenes and a large body count. Sean Penn plays the villain a little over the top, but it works if you view the film as this sort of spoof of the gangster genre. And really in my opinion this approach is what works best because it is entertaining if taken lightly as a spoof. I feel sorry for those who went into this film with high expectations because they will mostly be disappointed, unless they can live with a mindless popcorn action flick with some good performances. The story takes place in 1949 Los Angeles where Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), a mob king from Chicago, has taken over the city and is planning on controlling all criminal activities there with the help of corrupt officers and judges. He will eliminate whoever stands in his path. Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) on the other hand is a WWII veteran who is determined to do what he can to clean up the city. When Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) hears about O'Mara's heroics he decides to assign him with a special underground task: to form an elite squad of police officers that will take down the mob King. Thus O'Mara begins his quest to find the right officers for his special team with the help of his wife Connie (Mireille Enos) who is worried about his wellbeing and wants him to be protected as best as possible. O'Mara chooses Officer Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie), Max Kennard (Robert Patrick) and his partner Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pe?a), Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi) who's the brains in the operation, and finally Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) who decides to accept O'Mara's proposal after a member of the mob kills a kid he knew from the streets. Together these officers begin to try to intercept and disrupt Cohen's operations working as an underground hit squad. Wooters also happens to be having an affair with Cohen's love interest, Grace (Emma Stone), which could or could not be a good thing. And so the action begins as the squad tries to disrupt Cohen's reign and clean up the city.As I mentioned before this is an entertaining film which sometimes borderlines on the bad side considering it does have some pretty bad writing and underdeveloped characters. But it did work for me as a sort of spoof and light hearted film with a very stylized look to it. It has some fun action sequences with some strong performances, especially from the always reliable Ryan Gosling who continues to reinvent himself in every movie. I absolutely loved him here once again. Josh Brolin gives a pretty solid performance when he is not asked to do the voice over bit (it was a bit annoying at the beginning giving it a sort of fake Sin City vibe to it). The rest of the cast is pretty good although not getting enough screen time or story lines to develop their characters. Sean Penn plays the stereotypical bad guy a little over the top, but I enjoyed his performance as well (it wouldn't have worked if you were expecting a serious gangster drama film). In the end Gangster Squad did work for me and I was entertained with this shoot-em up gangster film, but I know it isn't for everyone.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Here comes Santy Clause".............LOL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awful from start to finnish, what was Fleischer thinking, he makes comedies not thrillers, but he turned this into a comedy.For starters the script, it was as if it had been written by a bunch of teenagers, to be honest this is the movies biggest problem, because it makes everyone's performance sound and look rubbish, the camera they used to film the movie was also a big problem next to the script.The action was shown in all the trailers and it wasn't enjoyable, so if your desperate to see the movie then just watch the trailer, saves you having to sit through it.The cast were all wrong too, Emma Stone was no Kim Basinger, Ryan Gosling sounded like Bugs Bunny, Sean Penn looked like Big Boy from Dick Tracy and Michael Pe?a doesn't look like he comes from the 1940's, the rest of the cast were OK i suppose.A few scenes made me laugh, like Gosling's voice in some scenes , he sounded real funny when he was angry, but i don't think it was meant to make you laugh, i heard a guy in the cinema saying to his friend "He's very powerful, isn't he" sounded weird coming from a guy, but anyway.there's a scene at the end in the hotel where Penn shouts to Brolin "Here comes Santy clause" and comes out with a tommy gun, i couldn't stop myself from thinking is Fleischer trying to redo "Say hello to my little friend" and expecting it to become a famous quote, it sounded ridiculous and stupid.There is a near slapstick moment when Robert Patrick tries to break Anthony Mackie and Josh Brolin from jail, but i'll not ruin it for you as it is a funny scene, but was not called for in a meant be serious film.Fleischer said its like The Godfather and The Untouchables, its definitely like The Godfather (sarcasm), a guy coming out of the cinema said it was better than Goodfellas, i wish i had hit him a slap.I have to admit though the set decoration was 10/10, it couldn't have looked any better, it gave a very good noire impression, but the movie built round it didn't.So overall the movie is a ridiculous and silly chronicle of the LAPD's fight to keep the East Coast Mafia out of L.A.Fleischer, stick to making comedies or get a new job, because your obviously not cut out for this.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I got back last night after watching it. It was a last minute thing too. Love Gangster movies and thought this looked great. loving Boardwalk Empire and enjoyed public enemy number one (suprisingly) so I was a little dismayed by the total lack of empathy with this movie upon leaving the cinema. It was running good right up to Brolins wife (excellent acting btw) began to help him hire the team of misfits. From there it pretty much fell away. the crew were average at best. The acting was strained. Brolin wasn't too bad. But even he was below average. Never looked too comfortable. I couldn't really put a finger on it but it never really got my blood pumping. A few plot holes I cant be bothered to go into and I wonder if this was the outcome of a total script re-write by the director. Who knows. Penn tried his best to give the movie some depth. But even his performance lacked the Scorsese touch. Jimmy the Gent he wasn't. Despite the obvious attempt. Average movie that could have been good. Never great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best assembly of clichés I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>January movies are traditionally terrible. With this fact in mind, I generally try to avoid theaters for one month out of the year. Unfortunately for me, the top-notch cast and original September release date tricked me into buying the notion that this could be a good movie. The fact that my friends showed up unannounced to drag me out to see it didn't help either.This movie aims to be something lasting, but for any serious movie buff, it falls well short of it's target. At times, it felt to me like a legitimate comedy. Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is a mob connected ex-boxer who decides that L.A. is his for the taking. Sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) is a WWII vet who is tasked with creating a crew to take him down. The rest of the cast falls into the "good guys" category of cops, moles, and love interests. This includes (but is not limited to) Ryan Gosling, Robert Patrick, and Emma Stone.I was never bored during this film. Having seen many movies, even the terrible scenes kept me entertained by the sheer brilliance of over-used plot devices and clichéd character stories. Need a borderline cop who drinks, smokes, gambles, but has morals? Ryan Gosling has you covered. Old fashioned six-shooter cop with dead aim? Don't worry, Robert Patrick is there. Fear not, because the writer (Will Beall) has also included the 1940s tech guy, as well as a token black cop aggravated with heroin use in the community, and an apprentice to Patrick's character who just happens to be Hispanic.I blame the failure of this movie entirely on unimaginative writing, to the point of being almost insulting. It is not as if Brolin, Gosling, Patrick, or least of all, Penn, are bad actors. They certainly made bad choices signing onto this script, but I can't see the checks they are cashing. The entire plot is predictable. 15 minutes into the movie, anyone could accurately predict the next hour or more. The actors are given nothing to work with. Additionally, Emma Stone's character serves no purpose whatsoever other than to add an attractive female supporting. Though the film is well-shot (what isn't nowadays) and has beautiful set details, the writing is so laughable it is nearly impossible to enjoy much of this movie.I'm not one to give a movie anything less than 4-5 stars merely because I did not like it. Seems childish, but I couldn't give this more than three. The pace never slowed, good for a star. The setting was good, that's another. Finally, the cast did what they could with this script, that makes three. Can't find another strength to this movie. If you want to see the disowned child of L.A. Confidential be my guest. Re-watching something you actually like is probably a better option.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's predictable, in that it's exceedingly formulaic, and laden with plot devices that are way overused for any genre. Drawing and quartering (halving, in this case) a man with two cars (in the opening scene) certainly could be considered one way to set the tone, however, after the first five dark, and rather grueling minutes, it quickly devolves to a sentimental buddy/action romp, and becomes impossible to be taken seriously. Even the cool noir-speak is abandoned once the action sets in. Once the plot starts rolling along, characters stop saying neat things like: "Who's the tomato?" (In reference to Emma Stone). Thoroughly disappointing. Sadly, Penn's performance falls spectacularly flat. Too much makeup, not enough emotion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I couldn't take a second of this seriously.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw my first 2013 movie last night, and it was the star-studded gangster pic Gangster Squad. I had very low expectations going into it, so I'm glad I didn't leave disappointed. Gangster Squad is a movie that is trying to be something hip, edgy, and sleek, but honestly, the dialogue was so clunky I couldn't take a second of the damn thing seriously.Inspired on a true story (which, in some cases, means that the story is bull), in 1949, a cop(Josh Brolin) is told to hunt down mob boss Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) at any means necessary. So he forms a group of cops (Ryan Gosling, Michael Pena, Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Patrick, and Anthony Mackie) to go rogue and kill whoever gets in their way. In another story arc, Gosling's character is in the middle of a supposed "dangerous" romance with Cohen's woman Gracie (the always wonderful Emma Stone, who is a strange choice for the part).Gangster Squad has a cast almost too good to be true. But that's the thing: It isn't good. There isn't a boring second in this movie, but yet there aren't many good ones either. We have some of the best living actors in Hollywood involved, and none of them get to do anything special. Everyone involved delivers at least one outrageous line. Ryan Gosling even gives a bad performance, that's how sad it is. Gosling puts on a Mickey Mouse voice and basically reads off of a teleprompter for most of the time. Penn is having too much fun here, and he's way too over the top. But the moments with him are the most interesting.The dialogue is atrocious, the last fifteen minutes is way too loud, the romance between Gosling and Stone doesn't feel believable, and the movie itself feels longer than the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. And I don't mean Zero Dark Thirty, I mean the actual hunt for Bin Laden, which was ten years. Everyone involved is having a good time, but to me the whole thing felt like a farce. And that leads to the next problem: the director.Gangster movies belong to directors like Brian Depalma, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Cappola, and Michael Mann. The masters. They don't belong to someone like Ruben Fleisher. Fleisher's other credits are 2009's Zombieland and 2011's mediocre 30 Minutes or Less. Putting someone like him in the reigns of a movie like this is like letting Nancy Meyers direct Halloween.Gangster Squad isn't terrible. Only kind of terrible. But if this is the first movie I've seen in 2013, I truly hope that the year will get better. I'm looking forward to quite a bit, so hopefully they improve. I guess that this is the best movie of 2013 so far, and that really is not saying a whole lot.C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all-round great flick, one which I highly recommend you go see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - 'Gangster Squad' tells the story of a small team of Los Angeles cops who take on the task of waging war against the swiftly growing East Coast Mafia presence in their city. Set in 1949 LA, this war is fought with tommy guns, fedoras, and style.Sean Penn plays Mickey Cohen, a ruthless mob-boss with great ambitions. He has LA in his grasp. Hundreds of politicians, judges and cops are in his pocket. Still he wants more, and he is poised to take over all off- track betting revenue in the western part of the USA. Sgt. John O'Mara (played by Josh Brolin) receives permission to go after him, but he'll have to go outside the law. He gets together a ragtag team of honest cops, and starts a war.The acting is great in 'Gangster Squad'. Especially Sean Penn as Mickey Cohen is impressive; it is evident that he had fun playing such a dynamic and extremely volatile character. But Josh Brolin, Emma Stone and the supporting cast also truly hold their own here. It is not just the acting, but also the way the characters are written that really adds to the movie. As stated, the group of cops is pretty diverse, and each character has its own personality and quirks to play with. This in turn also allows for some good humour here and there. The only odd character one out in my opinion was Ryan Gosling's character, whom I didn't really 'get'.The film features some amazing directing; Interesting and stylistic, with some really great and creative camera shots. Dynamic camera-angle switches, indoor crane shots, long semi-complicated takes, and ? most memorable to me ? a close-up dolly zoom shot mid-punch in the middle of a fighting scene. A really cool effect.'Gangster Squad' features plenty of impressive action. There are good era-specific gun-and fist-fights, but there is also some more extreme dual tommygun-wielding, stick-grenade hot potato play action going on. Both really nicely done and just plain entertaining. There is a car chase which I would deem uncharacteristically over the top ridiculous, but this is addressed in the plot as well, so I'll let it slide. All the action (as well as the rest of the movie) is accompanied by good music, not great, but satisfactory.As always with a period movie, I have to take a moment to address the impressive way in which they managed to portray 1949 Los Angeles. The empty skyline in the background, streets filled with old-timer cars, and the classic sign when Hollywood was still Hollywoodland.All combined 'Gangster Squad' is just an all-round great flick, one which I highly recommend you go see. The acting, directing, action, and style of the film are all tremendous. It never bores, but constantly entertains. And if that doesn't convince you, it has Emma friggin' Stone in it, so what more do you want? Go watch this! - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All style and no heart in badly directed 40'ies gangster-western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I vote: 10 idea, 9 the cars, 8 shooting, 7 footage, 6 cast, 5 humor, 4 excitement, 3 believability, 2 execution, 1 Sean Penn.And this is from a film lover which loves most of what Sean Penn delivers on and behind the screen. The director really messed this film up, obviously wanting Penn to be a Caricature of some lame gangster here. I think he realized what an amateur the director was, and gave up, to start playing like it was a joke Because this film is that - a joke.I'll sum it up to a 4, for the wasted potential in a movie which promises I certainly will keep distance to next time Ruben Fleischer directs a movie, though I liked Zombieland, which was funny. Has he tried making this like Zombieland? I just wonder...Even the kids and the births in this movie are violent, and there's put quite a lot of nastiness and graphic violence into this flick, but the problem is that it's far from what it wants to be. It's colorful and quite beautifully shot, many of the scenes. It's almost like a comic book.It's probably the most boring gangster-flick I've seen, and the cast promises more. So far I'm glad I don't know what the budget of this is, though it's likely to be more than a handful of millions, because it's a waste of money and potential.If you love the Godfather, Tarantino, The Untouchables and LA Confidential, stay far away from this. If you love good films, stay away from this!The folks behind this don't deserve the money. Except Nolte, which actually gives a good role as head of police. The trailer gives it all. All style, nothing else, the film tries to be a bad ass movie, but falls on the ground as a flying turkey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was intrigued, as it reminded me of The Untouchables. Then I had the good fortune to actually sit down and watch the movie. All I can say is WOW ! 5 minutes in and you are already rooting for the hero in the form of Josh Brolin - it just gets better from there. Sean Penn as the extremely unlikable Mickey Cohen is his usual brilliant self as he wields power like a flaming sword in a wheat field after a dry spell.A character who really stood out was Mireille Enos who plays the part of Connie O'Mara - tough as nails, with evident weakness in the form of the love she has for her husband (played by Brolin) she seems to take everything they throw at her with consummate ease, you can't help wondering if they should've just sent her after Cohen..The cast has been assembled to perfection, the pace of the movie is breathtaking. This is a definite must for fans of The Untouchables.I almost wish that a unit like this existed in my country...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you can enjoy boring, tawdry, cliché, airless, pointless dialogue; if you can tolerate characters with no purpose, no dimension, no development; if you can put up with story arcs that jump through time, with no regard to cohesion or logic, much less flow; if you expect and/or desire any of these things in a film, then this is absolutely one-hundred percent the movie for you.If on the other hand, you, like most, are on the market for a film that makes sense (preferably on one or more levels), presents believable heroes and villains, and tells a story with more depth than a sheet of paper, stay as far away from this film as you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'GANGSTER SQUAD': Four Stars (Out of Five) Director Ruben Fleischer's (of 'ZOMBIELAND' and '30 MINUTES OR LESS' fame) take on a gangster film about the LAPD officers who waged war on Mickey Cohen and his gang in the 1940s and 1950s. The script was written by Will Beall (who's only previous writing experience is for the TV series 'CASTLE') and it was adapted from the book 'Tales from the Gangster Squad' by Paul Lieberman. It's highlighted by it's all-star cast including Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin, Sean Penn, Emma Stone, Nick Nolte, Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Patrick, Anthony Mackie and Michael Pena. If you don't take it too seriously and are just looking for a good time it's a lot of fun and packs some killer thrills and beautiful visuals.The film is set in 1949 Los Angeles when Mickey Cohen (Penn) was the most powerful gangster in the California criminal underworld. Chief Bill Parker (Nolte) makes it his mission to stop Cohen, with whatever means necessary, so he picks Sgt. John O'Mara (Brolin) to lead up a special task force, after O'Mara recently saved a young girl from one of Cohen's deranged thugs (James Hebert). This doesn't sit well with O'Mara's pregnant wife Connie (Mireille Enos) but she reluctantly gives him her support and helps him handpick his team. Famous gangster-killer Max Kennard (Patrick), his partner Navidad Ramirez (Pena), wire-tapper Conway Keeler (Ribisi) and Detective Coleman Harris (Mackie) all join the team. O'Mara asks his buddy Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Gosling), who's sleeping with Cohen's girl Grace Faraday (Stone), to join the team as well but Wooters turns him down. Then Jerry witnesses the viscous killing of a young boy, by Cohen's men, and has a change of heart.The movie is all style over substance but it's beautiful that way. The action is thrilling and the cast is dynamite (especially Gosling and Penn, who chew through the scenery). It's always pretty to look at and about as cool as a 40s gangster flick can be. It's completely over the top and not believable in any way but it's just a lot of fun like that. You of course can't compare it to classic gangster films like 'THE GODFATHER', 'GOODFELLAS' or 'THE DEPARTED' because it doesn't have the character depth or intriguing plot but it's still as cool as most B gangster/action flicks out there. It wants to be 'THE UNTOUCHABLES' and it doesn't quite live up to that either (which is classic as well). It lies somewhere more in between 'UNTOUCHABLES' and 1991's 'MOBSTERS' (starring Christian Slater).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5qSQfmiLqM</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is directed by Ruben Fleischer and written by Will Beal. It stars Josh Brolin, Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Nick Nolte, Anthony Mackie, Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Patrick and Michael Pena. Music is by Steve Jablonski and cinematography by Dion Beebee.Los Angeles is being brought to its knees by crime boss Mickey Cohen (Penn). In one of the darkened offices of the police department, a special squad of officers is being assembled. Given free licence to bring Cohen and his operations down by any means necessary, the Gangster Squad fight fir with fire.Loosely based on real life facts, Gangster Squad is a good old slice of machine gun etiquette. An all star cast get to play good guys and wise guys in The Untouchables tradition, even if that in itself can't quite lift the film to the higher echelons of gangster movies past and present.There's absolutely nothing new here, it plays out as expected. Brolin and Gosling are the main smooth operators in the good guys camp, the former given the family man in danger sub-plot, the latter given the dangerous dame to fall in love with in the shapely form of Emma Stone, who as it happens is also dating Cohen! Hmm... Over in the wise guys department is Penn on full tilt sweary and hammy overdrive. It's a very colourful portrayal, menacing and completely over the top. How the performance sits with you will greatly depend on how you find Penn as an actor when let loose on a cartoon characterisation.It's all very period pleasing, with a bustling late 40s L.A. hosting men with hats, trench coats and tommy-guns. Men who frequent the speakeasy bars as torch singers warble their stuff. There is nothing wrong with the production at all, except maybe when the dialogue veers to clunky. The action scenes are well crafted, loud, bloody and exciting, and the photography sparkles and the music soars.If only the makers had put some thought into it, a bit of brains to go with the brawn. As a comic book type gangster piece, it works well on entertainment terms, elsewhere its lightweight and formula compliant, with the Ribisi, Patrick and Pena characters telegraphed a mile away. So, quite some way away from the great The Untouchables then, but better than Mullholland Falls. Make of that what you will. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clichéd claptrap and that's being kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At what point did anyone think Gangster Squad would make a good film? Who, after reading the script, gave it the go-ahead? Who chose the director? Why did every producer involved apparently take days and weeks off, and, most crucially, take their eye off the ball? What on earth was going on? I must admit here that I could not watch this film until the end. I wanted to give up long before I did, but I carried on in the hope that I was, perhaps, missing something, that somehow it would redeem itself. But when I realised there was absolutely no chance of that happening I hit the 'off' button and didn't look back.The first shot, a gruesome one of Sean Penn supervising the death of someone or other by having the poor man's body pulled apart by two cars speeding off in opposite directions was, at least, intriguing. That was about it - intriguing - but so far there was, as yet, no reason, to give this whole shambles the thumbs down. The next shot was achieved much the same: at least you were inclined to carry on watching to see how it might pan out. After that it was all downhill. My first reaction was that Gangster Squad was some kind of recherche parody, that it was going to make some clever-clever post-modern point about gangster films. Wrong. It was simply very bad.Take away the respectable aspects - about two of them - and Gangster Squad, perhaps in monochrome (the posh word for black and white) or in a less garish garb would not have been out of place 40 years ago. But even then it would not have been notable: it was a story which has been told many times before, most notably in The Untouchables, and told far better. The plot is clichéd, the one-dimensional characters utterly predictable, the dialogue banal, the attitudes simplistic.Why on earth was Gangster Squad made. Give it a miss, because you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worst film I've seen for a long long time. Absolutely dumb plot ( if there is any ) and far away from the true M. Cohen story. A 12 year old could've written this. Despite Brolin, Gossling, Penn &amp; Co. the acting in some moments really is ridiculous ( especially Josh Brolin ) as well as the dialogues.In the end it's a lousy wannabe- movie with embarrassing " The Untouchables" hints. To overlay all this it's packed with explosions and gunfire to make it look thrilling and entertaining. Well it's not. I love gangster movies and was really looking forward to this but the film is nothing but disappointing. Best part of it are the end credits....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in 1949 Los Angeles, this Ruben Fleischer directed crime drama really lets you settle in your seat and gives you the feeling that you are back in the days of pinstripe suits, Fedora hats and tommy guns.Gangster Squad gives you a touch of film noir mixed with a hint of the melodrama of the old television show "The Untouchables". Sean Penn is top notch as Mickey Cohen, the mobster bent on owning Los Angeles and keeping it all to himself. Josh Brolin is perfect as the leader of the Gangster Suad and Ryan Gosling, Giovanni Ribisi and Robert Patrick are solid as the leading members of the squad. The always beautiful Emmas Stone plays the femme fatale girlfriend of Cohen who later falls for a member of the squad. The "Here comes Santa Claus" scene near the ending climax is classic Sean Penn all the way.Gangster Squad is a great movie! I have seen it twice and I will more than likely buy the DVD when it comes out. Gangster Squad is reportedly based on true events. If you enjoy crime drama, film noir or you' re looking for a movie that is just plain good then I would highly recommend that you see Gangster Squad.</fullReview>

They needn't have bothered.But I can help you, dear reader, to avoid the same mistake. If you're reading this after its theatre release and preparing for an evening viewing it on TV, don't, watch a programme about paint drying instead.It's awful.Shot throughout as if it's an Instagram it's very obvious that style is more important than substance, yet Zombieland, Ruben Fleisher's, 2009 movie debut was cracking and hilarious.This is neither.Why Sean Penn (who nearly pulls off the role of "ruthless mob king, Mickey Cohen" in 1949 LA) chose to take on this role is anyone's guess. It's certainly not a career high. and Ryan Gosling has finally blotted an almost pristine CV by camping it up as a very dodgy philanderer.Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliantly and stylishly recreated story set in Los Angeles, 1949: A secret crew of police officers led by a determined sergeant (Josh Brolin) pull off a hard fight against a local mobster . As sergeant John O'Mara happily married to pregnant Connie O'Mara (Mireille Enos , though Amy Adams and Kate Winslet were considered to play her) is assigned by Chief W.H. Parker (Nick Nolte, who portrays , previously played the leader of the gangster squad in Mulholland Falls) to enlist a brave group (Jamie Foxx and Bryan Cranston were considered for the roles but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts with their other movies) . As they work together in an effort to take down the ruthless mob king Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) who runs the city . O'Mara chooses 4 officers (Robert Patrick , Anthony McKee , Giovanni Rivisi , Michael Pe?a) and asks another cop and vet, Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling , though Adam Brody, Joel Edgerton, Luke Evans and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were on the short list for the part) to join him but he is not interested , but when he witnesses a killing , he joins them . Then , Wooters falls in love for Mickey Cohen's girlfriend called Grace Faraday (Emma Stone , though Teresa Palmer, Camilla Belle, Aly Michalka, Lily Collins, Emmy Rossum, Amanda Seyfried and Maggie Grace auditioned for this character) This is a violence-ridden story full of action, drama , thriller and being pretty entertaining . Intelligent and suspenseful script in ¨The Untouchables¨ style , being written by Will Beall based on the book "Gangster Squad" from Paul Lieberman . Spectacular as well as explosive shoot'em up on the streets , mansion , station and Chinatown . Josh Brolin is excellent as impulsive and obstinate enforcer fighting against the underworld crime . Robert Patrick plays to perfection a veteran, incorruptible police who takes under his experience and protection to Michael Pe?a . And Sean Penn overacting in a heinous role as the nasty Mickey Cohen , Penn went through 3 hours of makeup each morning . Flamboyant and rich photography by Dion Beebe . Thrilling as well as atmospheric musical score by Steve Jablonsky . The motion picture was beautifully directed by Ruben Fleischer . This superb recounting will appeal immensely to Josh Brolin , Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone fans.The flick was partially based on real events : In the movie, the Gangster Squad is assembled to go after Mickey Cohen. However, in real life Chief W.H. Parker set up the squad to prevent other gangsters from taking over Cohen's rackets after Cohen went to prison on income tax evasion. Whenever the squad learned that out-of-town gangsters were coming to Los Angeles to try to set up new operations, the Gangster Squad would kidnap them, beat them up and then send them back to wherever they came from with the warning that if they ever returned, they would be killed . Other films dealing with this famous gangster Mickey Cohen are the followings : Bugsy (1991) played by Harvey Keitel , Fallen Angels (1993) played by James Woods , The Rat Pack (1998) (TV) played by Alan Woolf , L.A. Confidential (1997) played by Paul Guilfoyle , and recent TV series Mob City (2013) played by Jeremy Luke , including similar characters to 'The gangster squad' being starred by Jon Bernthal , Milo Ventimiglia, Neal McDonough , Alexa Davalos , Jeffrey DeMunn and Robert Knepper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie first came out and I read about the storyline and then saw the excellent list of actors and actresses that were to star in this film, I for one could hardly wait to see it. Well guess what, the wait wasn't worth it, in fact maybe the wait should of been longer. I for one just don't get it, why would such quality actors and actresses sign onto this trite? Did I hate this movie? NO! Did I like this movie? NO! This is simply a waste of time, the movie lacks drama, authenticity, suspense, and realism. There is plenty of blood and guts, but no substance for the viewers. If you just want to watch a shoot-em up gangster movie this might be for you, if you want a story, drama, excitement, and something worthy of your time and money there are probably better options than this.</fullReview>

I don't regret buying the book as a result of seeing the movie, but became disappointed in how far the movie deviated from reality.The movie is a fun thrill ride. I did not feel cheap after watching it. I thoroughly enjoyed the laugh out loud moments. That is real life.You don't have to worry about sending a flawed moral message to impressionable viewers.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie today, although many people from this site recommended not to watch it. They were right. This movie is a such a cliché. It isn't a real action nor a romance, but something between. The dialogues seem so unreal and forced. The acting wasn't any special,not even Sean Penn. I think the director lost himself somewhere between action and a romantic story, which was not well composed into the movie.And one actor, Ryan Gosling, has a part as a model in this movie. There are many scenes where he stands at the bar, smokes a cigarette etc. It was a good story, but it is not so good on the screen. My advice is, don't watch it! Save your money!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mickey Cohen seems to have an iron grip of Los Angeles. And no one is willing or alive to testify against him.So Police Chief Parker decides to form a special unit whose mission is to take down Cohen. He chooses Sgt. O'Mara, to lead the unit. O'Mara chooses four cops and asks another, Jerry Wooters to join him, but Wooters is not interested. But when he witnesses the murder of a young boy by Cohen's people, he joins them, and they decide to take apart Cohen's organisation. Cohen wonders if a rival is going after him, but soon he realises otherwise....Oh the circle of life. Back in 1990, Madonnas was at her most famous, the Blonde Ambition tour, and her greatest performance in a movie, Dick Tracy.23 years later, her ex, Sean Penn is at his lowest playing someone who looks like they wandered in from the Dick Tracy set. It's some of the worst make up I've ever seen in a big release movie.And then there's the rest of the movie, playing like some sort of Micheal Bay/De Palma/L.A Confidential hybrid, and it's as messy as it sounds.Brolin looks embarrassed to be in this, Jonah Hex had at least that guilty pleasure thing going for it, and Gosling is just as bad, making Drive seem like a long time ago.The rest of the stellar cast stand around waiting for the next set piece to arrive, and Penn spends the movie gurning and shouting at people.It's early days, but this is already a contender for worst film of 2013 (released here in the UK in January).Awful, bile inducing stuff.</fullReview>

The movie is long, there isn't the slightest bit of comedy and it is just such a bad script. Again don't see it, or at least don't pay to see it.

		<fullReview>The plot may be similar to that of either Brian DePalma's 1987 Untouchables or that of Warren Beatty's 1990 film Dick Tracy . Both movies had a good storyline with lot's of action and colorful characters , and good acting too ! That's where Gangster Squad parts company with the others . Gangster Squad is just a mean &amp; ugly movie from start to finish . In 1949 a special band of Los Angeles detectives are brought together to form the Gangster Squad . Their orders are not to merely arrest and bring Sean Penn's terrible gambling &amp; prostitution empire to an end but kill most of during the process . This is one of the most reprehensible and senselessly violent movies of all time . Short on substance but not lacking in gun play , Gangster Squad should be able to fill everyone's thirst for blood for a long time to come . If you are obsessed with playing ultra violent video games that contain nothing but machine gunfire , car chases , fiery explosions , bloody beatings , and murder after murder , this is your movie ! Although the setting is post war 1949 L.A., Gangster Squad would have looked less out of place if it happened during the Roaring Twenties or maybe the Great Depression of the early 1930's . If you love classic cars as much as I do you may be dismayed to see them get shot up . I felt sorry for that shiny new Packard that got banged up and a few of it's windows shot out . Gangster Squad is a movie that should appeal to every obsessed gun lover and video gamer in America right now . I wouldn't be surprised if the N.R.A. completely funded this worthless piece of trash . As I said before , if all you crave from a movie is machine gunfire, car chases, beatings, murder, extreme violence and very little substance , Gangster Squad is your movie ( not mine ) . I gave it a generous 2 stars because of the classic cars and late 1940's era setting . ....... Not Hot ! ... PWH</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but both were infinitely superior.I saw this abomination last night and it was frustratingly, hilariously bad. The acting was atrocious. How did you get such appalling performances out of seemingly brilliant actors? Sean Penn is somehow angrily camp throughout, Ryan Gosling appears to be imitating Donald Duck and Emma Stone is only there to look pretty and smoke. And the other actors barely spoke anything more than products of the Cliché-o-Matic 1949TM.The casting was awful in the first place, but they were further hobbled by that script. THAT SCRIPT! Who let that through? Nearly every discourse was laughable. The sheer amount of cheese dripping from this parchment of pulp made viewing such accomplished actors stumble through it simply uncomfortable.The plot was so generic it felt synthetic ? that almost an achievement when you were trying to tell a 'true' story in the noir style. Almost. But then at once it was hyper-violent, full of swearing, and also camp, cartoonish and childish.So I have some questions that I know will remain unanswered. Who was this film targeted toward? It is too adult in content to be aimed at children, but the plot, dialogue, acting, style, and action was tongue- in-cheek, Bay-like and juvenile.Who edits these scripts? Could you not tell that each cringe-worthy line was either by-the-books 'gangster' movie (or any 'gather a team of misfits to take out the bad man' film) or filled with faux-insightful exposition?Was this a parody? I mean it must have been a deliberate decision to try and make the plot seem as manufactured as possible? The angry police chief. The no-nonsense vet cop (who also happened to be an expert brawler setting up the end boss fight so painfully obviously) with the pregnant wife. The bespectacled 'nerd' tech expert with the sweet family that may well have had 'dead man walking' tattooed on his head. The token black man that was the knife expert. The grisly sharp-shooter Wyatt Earp type. The reluctant one that only joined after a tragedy forced his hand. And the antagonist, Micky Cohen, was such a caricature of 'bad gangster boss' with so little depth and no genuine motivation that he was too unrealistic to even be a pantomime villain.God dammit your film is so bad you are forcing me to use hyperbole and cliché, but I shall continue.The events of the 'plot'. Did a machine write this? Is it aware of plot holes and the concept of the obvious and idiocy? The cheeky shoe-shine boy not only dying in front of the 'reluctant one' so Gosling's character could join the Squad, but also essentially being sent to his death by Gosling. Gosling actually directs the kid TOWARD the target of the shooters when he spots a hit was about to go down. The CGI car chase scene (and all other action) seemed to ignore physics and lacked any tension or intelligence. The many bad shootouts had so many bullets exchanged from infinite-ammo guns, but very few things other than scenery was hit.Why would a tech espionage expert not set up a simple trip-wire to protect his position when the bug forced him to be so close to danger? Why did he not hear or record the loud bleeping detection machine when the bad guys hunted for the bug? Why would Cohen leave a Hotel he controlled through the front entrance when he knew it was being heavily attacked? Why would the gangster's moll happily sleep around when her boyfriend was such a psycho? Why would Gosling then send her to the single most dangerous place possible when he wanted her to 'get out of town'? Is she incapable of catching a train? Or driving? Or getting a taxi? And why would an expert in guerrilla tactics go into fights balls- out and head-on with all guns blazing and no tactical planning beyond 'get the guns and go in through the front door'?Was this a comedy? The jailbreak scene, fake gloss and camp acting seemed to suggest so, but the hyper-violent scenes of people torn in half, drilled to death and burned alive seemed to suggest not.If this film replaced all the swearing with PG13 language and toned down the blood and violence, it could easily be an OK kid's movie. And that I would understand - kids don't need Oscar-worthy performances, realism or grit. They don't need motivations beyond 'I am evil and greedy' and 'I wanna clean up this town'. They don't need things to abide by the laws of physics. They like flashy colours and one-dimensional characters. They like slapstick and cheese. But it was not a kid's film. No kid's film has the word 'c*nt' in it.I don't know what I was expecting when I walked into this movie. A modern Untouchables? A 1949 Boardwalk Empire? LA Confidential without rules? What I do know is that I was not only deeply disappointed from start to finish, but also insulted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stylistically like Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller ripping off LA Confidential, this halfheartedly resembles one of those 'crack team' capers, except with cops. The chief of police enlists a brave detective (Josh Brolin) to assemble of secret team of officers and surreptitiously take down powerful Los Angeles crime Boss Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn). The simple plot formula seems almost non-existent in its execution. Apparently, we are supposed to to believe that Cohen is an indomitable, omnipresent power, but the film does little to portray that, making the heroic and unlikely task undertaken by the film's namesake 'squad' seem neither particular heroic nor unlikely. We get the reluctant wife, embarrassing camaraderie among men, and moments when characters overcome doubt with statements like "Let's finish this!" Predictably, people die, and there is no intrigue to the confrontation, nothing to expect and nothing to surprise us.</fullReview>

For me the cast all done an amazing job and suited their roles well, there were quite a few gruesome scenes but then also some funny one liners. It was just a great mix.The plot was simple but very effective and straight to the point. Overall I would highly recommend this film to anyone, it is one not to be missed.

If you like shoot-outs, especially asinine unrealistic shoot-outs where the "bad-guys" all have Thompsons and BARs and fire hundreds of rounds but don't manage hit anyone, this movie might be for you. If you like manipulation of plot and characterization for the purpose of political correctness, this movie might be for you. The "Gangster Squad" has a black member and a Hispanic member to demonstrate that the producers value inclusiveness. Why they did not add a Chinese detective to this motley crew is a mystery. After a lifetime of watching movies, it STILL remains a mystery to me how tens of millions of dollars can be raised for such a cinematic venture as this and how so much money can be entrusted to such untalented futile individuals. I'm referring to the writers, the director and the producers. The actors recited their lines, fired off their blanks and pocketed their paychecks. No actors in movies today could have made this stinker into a worthwhile movie. The Director, Ruben Fleischer, demonstrated ineptitude of such a magnitude that I suspect that relatives must have contributed money for the production to get him the job. There is NOTHING in this derivative movie that hasn't been done in other movies and done much better. The fact that Warner Brothers is the studio behind this garbage-fest is especially galling as this was the studio that eighty years ago blazed the gangster movie trail. I have come to the conclusion that studios back movies like this as a form of tax chicanery in which they write off exaggerated losses against the profits generated by successful movies.I cannot imagine any other reason for a movie like THIS to be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Entertainement. What's Up With The Critics?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, after seeing such low ratings in Rottentomatoes and Metacritic, I was thinking in missing this one out, but I'm glad I didn't. IMDb isn't usually the most reliable source, but at a 7 and with it's casting I decided to give it a go. I went with a low expectations, but it turned out to be a very entertaining flick. Great actors, good rhythm and a pretty good story. Sean Penn looked like it had born a gangster, and the action scenes where solid. Really can't understand why critic's wise, it's regarded as nothing worth, specially considering on how bad so many celluloid is coming out of Hollywood. IMDb is spot on this time, it's a straight 7, and a good one!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything you'd want from a good gangster movie is perfectly delivered here: action, machine guns, exploding cars and corrupt politicians. It reminded me either L.A. Cofidential or Brian De Palma's The Untouchables, only without that artistic pretense. Set just after World War II, director Ruben Fleischer frames effectively the film's violence and powerful sequences. A big-nosed Sean Penn is at his best, simply perfect, as fact-based Mafia bad guy Mickey Cohen. The film was shot on hi-definition video and is pretty similar, in terms of visual impact, to Michael Mann's epic Public Enemies (2009). For its most part it serves the film's noir style well and the format works, with its - very few - limitations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dull, rehashed disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read many damning reviews of 'Gangster Squad', however I was ready to accept it as mere pulp fiction, and during the opening 40 minutes or so, it seemed like I would be able to, but by the closing credits, I discovered it wasn't even good enough for that. The film tells the story, which is 'inspired by real events', of a covert group of tough police officers who endeavour to stop Mickey Cohen's criminal activity encroaching on Los Angeles. Strangely, the film boasts a popular cast with the likes of Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin and Nick Nolte.It establishes its characters and premise pleasingly enough, but ultimately it fails to deliver through a lack of humour, narrative baggage, clichés and a slew of boring stock characters. The film draws parallels with the infinitely superior 'LA Confidential', however there are more similarities with 'The Expendables', only without the laughs and nostalgia.When it attempts to create even a slight portion of pathos, it's baggy and dull; the film is bereft of any emotional weight whatsoever. The film operated more like a video game than a film, with its silly elaborate action scenes and Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) feeling like the 'boss' villain rather than a human character. Actually, that comparison isn't fair on the gaming industry, I have played and completed 'Mafia II', which has far more in the way of developed characters and narrative. The film's sole interest is period style; substance and veracity aren't its top priorities. What occurs on screen is pure fantasy - the extent of its historical accuracy doesn't go far beyond the fact that there was once indeed a man named 'Mickey Cohen' who wasn't particularly nice. The allure of 1940s Hollywood and its strong cast will bring 'Gangster Squad' to the attention of many people, however it is a formulaic, mediocre and superficial rehashing of films such as 'Chinatown' and 'L.A. Confidential'.www.hawkensian.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If this movie had been shown to audiences in the 30s, they probably would have only been dazzled by the fact that it was shot in color.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very onset, "Gangster Squad" has very little in the way of ambition, except to be a modern-day revamping of the Classic Hollywood Era mobster movies of the 1930s and 40s. It's the sort of film James Cagney or Humphrey Bogart would have done for Warner Bros. several decades back. However, if you took this modern-day movie?packed full of fedoras, cigars, exotic dancers in night clubs, and Tommy gun shootouts?and showed it to the audiences of 1940, they would have probably only been dazzled by the fact that it was filmed in fluorescent colors and that when somebody gets shot in the movie, they bleed. Other than that, I have a feeling the gangster movie audiences of yesteryear would have seen right through the movie's thin storytelling, its hurried way of rushing through the narrative, and its lackluster way of pulling up the classic conventions of this genre. And regardless if they wouldn't have been fooled, I wasn't.Now I have a deep affection for the gangster movies of Classic Hollywood. I personally prefer the old favorites with their deliberately exaggerated characters, smart-aleck dialogue, and familiar filmmaking styles. I also enjoy them better when they are not packed end-to-end with vulgar language, and by 'vulgar language,' I mean the universe where every person of every age in any city only knows one swear word, the one that begins with an F. There is swearing in this new picture, but it's much more restrained. So it understood its own goals. However, the problem with "Gangster Squad" is not that it was made too late in time, but that it takes the clichés and familiarities and does not enact them with a whole lot of development or style. The ingredients are all there; they're just not launching very effectively.The screenplay by cinema newcomer Will Beall is constantly on the move, jumping from one scenario to the next, but not giving each individual moment a chance to shine. Take for instance, the old-fashioned love story between Ryan Gosling as a Los Angeles cop and Emma Stone as a mobster's favorite moll. Once again, classic plot element just not enacted effectively. Their chemistry consists of this: they see each other in a nightclub, Mr. Gosling tells her flat out that he wants to take her to bed, two scenes later they're underneath the sheets of some flophouse, and after that, they are utterly smitten. Again, all fine given the genre, but not given enough time to flesh itself out. In fact, the scene between the two of them as they lie in bed after sex, with each of them uttering smart-aleck dialogue, gets off so strong that it really becomes infuriating that we leave the scene just when it starts to get going.The cast of "Gangster Squad" is packed with talent, and yet most of the performances still misfire. Good of an actor as he is, Mr. Gosling is too much of a 21st century actor for the hotshot, flirtatious cop-role and he is too open-eyed and baby-faced for us to really believe that he could last long at all in a crime-riddled city like this. There is also Giovanni Ribisi, who looks silly with his slicked-back hairdo and paper-thin mustache, and seems utterly bewildered by all the period detail around him. Even Sean Penn, playing none other than Mickey Cohen himself, is uncharacteristically out of his element. Mr. Penn's performance consists mostly of hammy outbursts and temper tantrums, both of which prompted some unwanted laughs from me. The key element to a great movie-gangster is to get the audience to be afraid of him and what he might do. And yet even though this guy presents himself as an experienced boxer-turned-killer and orders the deaths of several people (including one where a man is torn in half between two cars) I never felt particularly intimidated by him. There are three exceptional performances. One is Robert Patrick, playing the gunslinger cop. The second is Emma Stone, who is charming and sexy as usual, despite the underwritten role supplied to her and the random twist-of-faith she has to perform in the third act. And finally, there is Josh Brolin himself, who fits his tough-cop role to a tee. With his square jaw, smile-scare expression, and squinted stare, he really does seem to belong in those period clothes. And when he takes matters into his own hands, there is a feeling of unpredictability. This is the guy I would be intimidated by. I just wish his character's personal life was more like that of Philip Marlowe, not tied to the drippy subplot of a wife who's expecting.There is one more person who understands what he's supposed to be doing, and that is the cinematographer, Oscar-winner Dion Beebe. The art direction is exceptionally strong, but Mr. Beebe is the one who makes it look so great with all those fluorescent streaks of light. So he is not to blame when the director, Ruben Fleischer, loses focus of how he should be handling everything. This is set in one of those movie-worlds in which the sound of a black-powder gunshot cannot be heard by anybody. Not in the same building, not even through an open window. Ironically enough, these gangsters and cops are less sensible and observant than their 1940 counterparts. At least their ears were open enough to respond when a shotgun blast rang out down the hall. And therein lies the fatal flaw of "Gangster Squad." It captures the look of the old mob movie formula, but not the feel. No matter how much it wants to. But I do have the admit, I was pretty flattered to finally see an action movie where the heroes rig a truck to explode and when it goes off, they actually turn around to make sure they're not about to be pummeled by a chunk of debris. They don't ignore it like a bunch of brain-dead fools.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mobster Micky Cohen is taking over the Los Angeles underworld so Chief of Police Parker forms a squad to operate outside formal police guidelines to dismantle Cohen's operations using his own illegal tactics against him.This movie is essentially The Untouchables, only in LA. The cast is great (although I still simply do not get Ryan Gosling), and a lot goes on, most of it shooting. The baddies are equipped with guns and ammunition which mostly misses, and the goodies are equipped with guns and ammunition which mostly finds its target. Sean Penn plays Cohen as a pantomime villain.This movie is quite good fun if you want a retro action-packed gangster thriller with no depth - it is almost entirely predictable from the title alone. I quite enjoyed it, but it was a bit "Chinese meal" - 5 minutes later you've forgotten it and are ready for another one.</fullReview>

Unable to find someone to testify against him the chief of police puts together a special unit to take him down. Lead by Sgt. John O'Mara (Brolin) he hand picks his squad and the war for LA begins. I am a huge fan of mobster/gangster type movies and was really looking forward to seeing this. I was not disappointed. I knew nothing of the real story so the entire thing was new to me and that made it an entertaining experience. The cast is perfect in this and the action and story really move along very fast and the movie feels shorter then it was. There are some very graphic scenes in this (man gets ripped in half) so if that bothers you then I would maybe avoid this. If you are into fast moving, violent, mob/police driven movies with a great cast then this is one not to miss. Overall, an extremely entertaining gangster movie that grabs you from opening scene, I highly recommend this. I give it an A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First 2013 movie I've seen and one of the most disappointing ones.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although not being too familiar with gangster films, I was looking forward to seeing 'Gangster Squad' ever since this past year. But, when the tragedy struck at the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado while a midnight screening of 'The Dark Knight Rises' was being shown and when the studio had to push this movie back in order to do some re-editing, I was pretty upset. Hey, if the tragedy didn't happen, the studio wouldn't have pushed it back to this weekend. Of course, mostly everyone had to understand that it wouldn't be that big of a deal for waiting a movie for a few more months. Now, they can get over it and finally go to the theater and see what they wanted to see for a while.There have been a few times that made me had this feeling of disappointment after seeing some movies in theaters. Unfortunately, 'Gangster Squad' is one of those movies. I'm not too familiar with gangster films, and I'm not saying the movie was awful nor spectacular, only average, to say the least.'Gangster Squad' takes place in Los Angeles in the turn of the 1950s, and follows a group of officers from the LAPD led by Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) and Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling). They work together to keep the city safe and take down Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), a mob king who takes control of the city.'Gangster Squad' has a really terrific cast of really terrific actors. Most of them either did okay; like with Ryan Gosling and Josh Brolin, they both do their roles pretty well as the two police sergeants. A few actors didn't have a lot to do; like with Nick Nolte. Although he didn't deliver that bad of a performance as the head of the LAPD, but he just had a little screen-time. Emma Stone was a bit under-played and quite under-developed as the woman who Ryan Gosling meets at the restaurant and start having a rather gratuitous romance.There was only one who stole every scene he was in. Of course, the actor is Sean Penn as the vicious mob king who wants to take control of L.A. by expanding his police mob. He really is one mean person that you would not like to come face-to-face with at any place at any time.The movie did have its exciting moments with some action sequences; some of them could have been executed a lot better. Some of the violent images were a little too grotesque for my cup of tea. The dialogue was very funny (in a bad way) at times, and a few of them were rather decent. I did really like the sets and the look of L.A. in the late-1940s, but other than that, it wasn't good.4.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopelessly inept compared to the films it tries to imitate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right off the bat, Gangster Squad shows it's hand. The very opening scenes where a poorly cast Sean Penn condemns a failed peon to death by quartering and Josh Brolin raids a brothel, convey the entirety of the film: Poorly staged and overlong set pieces lacking thrills or purpose.Mr Fleischer lacks the vision needed to bring Gangster Squad to life, though equal blame rests on the shoulders of the writer who can never quite establish the grandiose scale that he aims for. The 30s jazz club sets are elaborate and beautiful, but are only seen for a flicker of a moment in the first act and go to waste thereafter. As an action film, one would expect a director to pour his resources into producing good action, but Gangster Squad flops at any attempt to recreate scenes from The Untouchables. That being said, the inspiration for the writer and director is plainly seen: the movie clearly wants to be Public Enemies or the Untouchables, but fails to come close to either, despite an ensemble cast. Sean Penn is hilariously miscast as the Italian-American mobster, wearing an obvious prosthetic nose and funny eyebrows. He is clearly unsuited to the role which was written for somebody like De Niro or Pacino, and fails to bring his character to life. Likewise, the rest of the cast are more or less interchangeable, as none of the protagonists do anything to establish themselves as unique and the writer makes little attempt at exposition, offering a single scene's worth of introduction and backstory for each of the gunslingers which is ultimately wasted as they turn into speechless extras for the majority of the film.The action is bland, poorly directed, and lacking special effects. Many such special effects are completely unnecessary CG shots that make the action feel dry and boring. Fleischer follows the habits of low-budget independent films by opting for CGI squibs instead of real ones, draining the entertainment value further. Either he was aiming for a lower rating or couldn't be bothered trying to create genuine thrills in Gangster Squad. Gangster Squad's potential is wasted by uninspired writing and lacklustre direction that results in a pointless and bland action film lacking in thrills, suspense or tension. Watch at own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this. Sean Penn is my favorite actor. All I can say is, Thank God I won passes and didn't have to pay. It was disappointing... mediocre at best. Just OK. There are 2 types of movies: Theater Movies &amp; Couch Movies. Both are great. This was neither. Sean Penn was like a character out of Dick Tracy. Perhaps the first time ever, that he was non believable in a role. And what was with Ryan Gosling's voice? It was like he sucked helium the whole time. This was perhaps the most lines that Josh Brolin has uttered throughout an entire movie, so he was clearly uncomfortable. As for the rest, well, Giovanni Ribisi was perhaps the best. He was the only + sign. Emma Stone, was thy typical damsel in distress and I couldn't help but compare her to Jessica Rabbit. And I'm not sure if there is a "no neck" clause in Nick Nolte's profile, but I wish he would get over it. This movie was nothing more than a comic book motion picture. The whole movie was just predictable, I could have acted it all out myself. Perhaps I'm spoiled by real gangster movies but this is not one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad was one of the biggest let downs I've experienced at the movie theaters. With the names: Sean Penn, Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Nick Nolte, Anthony Mackie, Michael Pe?a, and Giovanni Ribisi attached to this project I assumed that this film would be a huge hit. But do you know the saying about assumptions? The film is based on the story of Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), an east coast gangster who brought organized crime out west to LA, and John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), a cop hired to assemble a team to take down Cohen by any means possible. This included using violence without punishment from the law. This premise bodes well for a good gangster flick but doesn't deliver on any front.The acting was fairly bad, the plot was unoriginal, the dialogue poor, and the directing terrible. There were only a few scenes in the film that I actually enjoyed, but most of the time I was either cringing in my seat or stifling a laugh. Gangster Squad had its release pushed back because of the movie theater shootings at the Dark Knight Rises. They had to do extensive re-shoots because a scene in the movie depicted gunmen coming out blazing from behind a theater screen shooting into the crowd. Rumors stated that removing this scene was like pulling a thread from a sweater. But regardless of what the movie could of been it ultimately was a flop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Warning*: This is going to be my most biased review ever written. I am a cop movie junkie. Pretty much any movie or show that has to do with cops are my bread &amp; butter. It's my favorite genre and they are always most anticipated movies whenever I hear about them. Take a look at my favorite movies of all-time and you'll see a plethora of anything and everything involving cops. LA Confidential, The Departed, Training Day, Narc, Pride and Glory, Street Kings, Heat, etc. I can go on and on and on. It's as close to an obsession as it can possibly be. But I'm not ashamed... I'm proud of it dammit! Mickey Cohen finished off his takeover on the city of Chicago, but he's still not happy. He wants bigger and better things for himself, so he sets his sights on the "City of Angels" Los Angeles California. He's a tough as nails former boxer and he doesn't take any sh!t from anyone. And it isn't long before he's got almost the entire city in his pocket...even most of the higher-ups like judges and the majority of the police department. The Chief of Police is in danger of his city crumbling down around him, so he decides to appoint his toughest detective John O'Mara the head of a special unit to take down Cohen and his whole outfit. And that's where it all starts. The main attraction of this movie is likely to be its fantastic cast. Everyone in this is completely on point and they sell the sh!t out of it. Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Sean Penn, Emma Stone, Nick Nolte, Anthony Mackie, Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Patrick, Michael Pena, &amp; a bunch more recognizable faces that you can't quite put a name to but you know you've seen them in a lot of other stuff. Every actor takes on their roles with gusto and plays them to the fullest. Brolin, Gosling, &amp; Penn are the true stars of the movie, but the smaller supporting roles are quite good too. Some are really funny and add a lot of depth to their characters that could have easily been nonexistent. I'm going to make special mention of Sean Penn though because this is the first time in a long while that I've seen him actually look like he's having fun with a role. He chews up the scenery at every turn and spits it right back out. He goes for broke all the way and relishes every single moment. He's just so evil and such a butt-head that it's impossible to look away when he's on screen. Of course he's over-the-top, but that just makes it even better and all the more fun to watch. Another thing to mention is the fantastic attention to period detail. The cars, clothes, buildings, etc. all looked great and further helped to be immersed in LA circa 1949. Talk about beautiful places... 1940's Los Angeles at night was gorgeous. This is inspired by a true story, so its hard to really be truly invested in the outcome since you basically already know how it ends. It didn't matter to me though. I was 100% invested from the word go and I was completely immersed in this world, the characters, and everywhere they took me. As I said in the beginning I'm extremely biased. When it comes to cop movies my opinion should be taken with an enormous grain of salt. Not everyone is going to feel the same way about this movie as I did...in fact most people might downright hate it. It is your basic run-of-the- mill cops vs the mob movie. Every staple of this genre is present here and no cliché is left unturned. For my money though this is a movie that does it all the right way. It is very easy to f**k up a genre film without the right personnel behind it. Now, director Ruben Fleischer isn't a household name and the 2 movies he had under his belt before this(Zombieland &amp; 30 Minutes or Less) don't necessarily instill that much confidence when it comes to making a gangster movie. The sonuvabitch pulled it off though and god bless him for it. So bottom line is: See the movie. Don't listen to my rambling biased a$$...just see the movie and decide for yourself which side of the fence you're on. If you're a fan of the cast or the genre at all, then I'd say it's totally worth it. ... Oh, and another thing... The re-shot sequence is actually very good. The whole setting in Chinatown brings it all together and it is quite bad a$$. While I do hope to see the deleted Theater scene someday...I have no problem with the scene that replaced it and not having the old scene in there didn't hamper my overall enjoyment of the movie.</fullReview>

All the performances are perfectly fine (cheesy lines notwithstanding), with particular mention going to Ryan Gosling's cool-as-a- cucumber turn as the aforementioned Lothario. The usually reliable Sean Penn hams it up throughout as the crime lord they're chasing, Mickey Cohen, and Emma Stone has a largely pointless role as both the gangster's moll and Gosling's love interest.The narrative moves from set-piece to set-piece at a satisfactorily speedy pace towards its predictable conclusion. The violence is gory and often cartoon-like with explosions aplenty - expect many a slow-mo shootout..This film is glossy and slick, and will no doubt keep many entertained of a wet Sunday afternoon, but it's hard to tell whether its makers intended for it to be taken seriously, as it frequently comes across tongue-in-cheek and spoof-like.

The contrast between the movies however could not be greater, whereas one was unique, subtle, dark and surprising, Gangster Squad is obvious, cartoonish, and badly written. All the characters speak in clichés only, all the scenes are clichés and the whole premise was taken from The Untouchables with even some of the same characters- The main difference being that everyone is unlikable in this film. The acting, costumes, props, special effects, cinematography etc. are all perfectly fine, it's just the boringly cliché writing and direction that destroys this film. That's not quite true about the acting, Ryan Gosling's bland face shows almost no emotion and his poorly enunciated speech is horrible for delivering lines. His performance here reminds me a lot of the character played by Simon Baker in LA Confidential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful Writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was embarrassed for the scriptwriter of this movie and I hope he shares my sentiment. An awful attempt was made to recreate a stylized tough guy noir film where the character deliver sharp yet poetic lines, an attempt that falls flat, yet achieves a saccharin sentimentality that made me cringe on numerous occasions. It was mildly entertaining yet seemed to consist of never ending scenes where Brolin's gang assembles, walks up to the other gang and starts shooting. It's as if Fleischer managed to conjure the insipid dialogue of Wes Anderson mixed with the soulless action sequences of Zach Snyder. I would not recommend this film to anyone with an aesthetic sensibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland in every way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about two determined sergeants who lead a group of officers to crack down the most notorious mob in the city.To be honest, the plot of "Gangster Squad" confused me at first due to the number of characters. They are not so properly introduced, and everyone in the film seem indistinguishable because of their highly similar clothing. They all wear the same clothes: long coats, hats and trousers of wither brown or black. I didn't even know who was the good guy and who was the bad guy. When I finally figured out who was who, the film became better, but only marginally. The continuous waves of violence put me off as senseless sacrifice of human lives. The police officers seem too reckless. The plot does not captivate or thrill, and it did not make me interested in the film.Despite the strong stellar cast, everyone seem to have been wasted, and no one takes the limelight. "Gangster Squad" is bland in every way, which is a pity as there are not that many films of this genre anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty bad! Bad writing, unbelievable plot and bad acting equals a big disappointment. With such a cast you would expect better but you won't get it in this formula flick. Every plot turn is telegraphed 20 minutes in advance. Kind of a combination of the Untouchables and LA Confidential where all the predictable parts of each are combined into a poorly-written mess. The most disappointing performance was Sean Penn whose only acting seemed to consist of a sneer and a craggy voice.The story was ridiculous with the cops shooting straight with their pistols and the gangsters unable to hit anything with their machine guns and grenades.Just like the Untouchables, the nerd and the old guy die! Just skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hackneyed gangster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the first five minutes of "The Gangster Squad," one man is torn in half at the midsection, while another has his hand lopped off by an elevator. And that's just for starters.Set in 1949 Los Angeles, this low-rent version of "L.A. Confidential" mixed with "The Untouchables" is based on the true-life account of Mickey Cohen, a Chicago mobster who's using prostitution, drug running and gambling as a means of building his own empire on the west coast. Trouble is, in the process, he's managed to not only alienate his former partners back in the Midwest but to fire up law enforcement in L.A. (those not already in his back pocket, that is) who feel that he will soon take over the city if he isn't stopped.Enter homicide detective Sergeant John O'Mara, an upstanding Irish war hero who's been assigned the unenviable task of driving Cohen out of business by whatever means necessary. This involves gathering together a merry band of like-minded, trustworthy individuals (the "gangster squad") who'll help him do the job. But how far outside of the law are they willing to go to bring about their desired end?As directed by Ruben Fleischer, "The Gangster Squad" could not possibly feel more halfhearted, enervating and hackneyed at this stage in movie history. The screenplay by Will Beall is practically an encyclopedia of mob movie stereotypes and clichés, and the dialogue and voice-over narration are often jaw-dropping in their banality.Sean Penn scowls his way through the part of Cohen, while Josh Brolin, as O'Mara, sleepwalks through his. Ditto for Ryan Gosling, Nick Nolte, Emma Stone and "The Killing's" Mireille Enos, whose roles here are unworthy of their not inconsiderable talents. With so many fine crime dramas floating around, both in movies and on TV, there's really no reason to settle for so thoroughly generic an offering as "The Gangster Squad."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film got two stars only for the great set design and huge collection of period automobiles, which captured that era in LA.Ridiculous storyline. Predictable. Sean Penn looks nothing like Mickey Cohen, is wearing ludicrous prosthetics, and overacts ridiculously, playing the role like an imitation of his now roasting in hell hero Chavez. Nick Nolte is just as silly. Its too bad Ryan Gosling wasn't killed in the first five minutes.The screenplay reflects horrific plot line, unintentionally hilarious dialog, and has absolutely no feel for the history other than what little they gleamed to put this mess together.

		<fullReview>I saw the first 20 minutes in about 4 parts. I wasn't very excited about this movie. Those "wisdom words" and mob torture methods, typical to this kind of movie, simply seemed to be stuffed in the beginning; initially making me to lose my interest but luckily i had nothing else downloaded ( oups :D ) and i continued to watch it. Ryan Gosling (Jerry) showed up only because of his haircut. He tried to act properly but his face couldn't tell me nothing. Last time i saw him in "Drive" and i thought that his part was sad but... he really is sad. After i got used to what the hell was going on there i became more and more addicted to "what the f**k they are gonna do now :D". A couple of "oldschool" cops are taking the law in their hands and are struggling to win the war with the mob even that the world war just ended. Those stick hand grenades reminded me about the good old days when i used to play 10 hours each day Call Of Duty 1 :X Oh and if you want to watch a realistic gangster movie you better view again Godfather :P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad had a lot going for it with a fantastic cast of actors in the prime of their careers and great period setting for a film. LA Confidential's was only a year or two after the time line of this movie, it could've been a good followup noir style of film itself. But the direction and screenplay for the movie were only average.Sean Penn was good in the Mickey Cohen role but a tad bit over the top in his portrayal of him, I prefer Harvey Keitel as Cohen in Bugsy. Josh Brolin is pretty good as the lead. Ryan Gosling is on a roll lately and is very strong in the #2 role. Overall a very good cast with a lot of great actors filling out the cast.

		<fullReview>Despite having a great cast. "Gangster squad" seems to have failed to have found an audience. But as giant flops go, its not half bad.Flicks about a secret collection off cops that are thrown together to get rid off a powerful gangster (Sean Penn) and his gang. Its all based on a true story (Though probably loosely) so is surprising in that it has plenty off action, acting more like an action movie than a brutal drama. Though the gangster film violence you probably will be expecting, is firmly intact.So, "Gangster squad" does exactly what it says on the tin then, and then some. Not sure why its done as poorly as it has but maybe people were expecting more off a story than an action movie. Me though, I enjoyed the performances off the always great Penn, Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling and Giovanni Ribisi enough to get by.</fullReview>

All that happened in the first half of the movie before throwing everything they achieved down the drain!What could've ended as a great 60s mob movie ended up as a bad fairytale and an 80s action flick starring Rambo and Stallone with endless ammo, it felt like the director lost his interests at the end not knowing what he wants to do next or how the scene should end to the limit where it felt like the actors stopped doing their job while the camera still rolling!!Failing to establish any character growth as the movie reaches the end, Sean Penn build a physical appearance, a voice tune and a sadistic fetish without neither giving the character a proper background nor a satisfying downfall! Josh Brolin was there to look handsome, sexy and strong plus saying do this and that; and to remind us that cops have wives! Ryan Gosling was as charming as usual, witty dialogue but that's about it. Emma Stone beside the rest of the cast did what they were asked to do exactly wishing that eventually all of this will end up well but of course the opposite happened.It is really frustrating for such a movie with literally an awesome beginning to end up with such a low point.

		<shortDescription>Gangster Gimmicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The gangster genre is one of those genres that is usually transcendent when it comes to cinema but Gangster Squad doesn't sound like a film to be taken seriously. It's too focused on the action and how cool it looks in spite of fact it's inspired by a true story of Mickey Cohen's rule in Los Angeles. As an action film, it looks cool and it's kind of fun. Historically, it sadly wastes the potential for something compelling and degrades it into ordinary. Despite of its talents, direction, and production, it suffers with bland and generic storytelling. It could have been the best looking classic gangster cinema until it became a gangster gimmick that shows insane gangsters shooting and swaggering around. It may have the old fashioned swag but its historical portrayal has become very ridiculous.Turning a true story into a dumb blockbuster for enjoyment's sake is a strange idea. The film is fun at times but when it stops for the storytelling, it's difficult to not be interested to the actual history that we may wish it could have been less dumb. As both cheesy lines and emptiness collaborated together with some stylish slow-mos and dazzling cinematography, it feels like the film is directed by Zack Snyder. It almost has the same pros and cons of his recent films except this one is a little shorter and the use of slow motion is less excessive. But really this is a perfect akin of Watchmen and Sucker Punch. Tries too hard to add depth but ends up being silly. It also has some shallow drama in some parts. Aside the storytelling, it sure loves showing off the old Los Angeles and how cool the gangsters were. That seems like the only ambition of the film. Showing how fabulous the cities and their dresses back then. Even the end credits shows off its vintage stuff.The film is directed by a comedy director, Ruben Fleischer. His films are pretty decent comedies, but his other talent is making stylishly cool action sequences and yep, he still manages to make a film look awesome and somewhat exciting. But without the comedy, the characters are underdeveloped. O'Mara's league of avengers is nothing else but a group of random types of men fighting together. We can only distinguish them by knowing one of them should look or act nothing like the other. When it comes to the outside of the squad, the antagonists are exploding their insanity while the ordinary characters are just chilling around the fabulous setting. In the end, they are all bland.Sean Penn hams it up as Mickey Cohen. He's suppose to be menacing but instead he ends up being a Nicolas Cage who whines like a child. It's sometimes hilarious but redundantly it becomes a little annoying. Josh Brolin is probably too serious for this ridiculous alternate reality. Ryan Gosling serves some fun in his role. Maybe because of his fascinatingly manly face and his slick swagger. But to be serious, he's nothing more than a good looking sidekick. Nick Nolte is only here to speak those lines because his voice recalls gravitas. When he's talking, it should be interesting.Gangster Squad has its pleasures by putting every pretentiously cool gangster elements together, adding some badass action techniques, and finally glows like a snazzy noir film. Overall it's an awkward entertainment. It tells a great story but in a mediocre blockbuster way. Indeed, there is a potential for a much better film. It seems the film doesn't want to be serious or maybe it does but fails because it's too busy on being cool. Decent gangster movies doesn't necessarily targets the action and the coolness. It's really about the story, characters, danger, and depth but how this film portrays them are pretty silly like it should have been taken as a joke. The only satisfaction we get now are endless shootings, campy villains, Emma Stone, Gosling's face, Nolte growling, and Brolin brutally punches a guy's face in slow-mo. But there could have been a lot more interesting than these.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and Riddled With Bullet Holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flashy and full of camp, Gangster Squad borrows elements from The Untouchables and L.A. Confidential to poorly recreate what we've already seen before. Based on the book, Tales from the Gangster Squad, written by Paul Lieberman, director Ruben Fleischer has given audiences a generic, mediocre fun look into the mob genre by presenting a big picture told simply and leaving many questions unanswered.What Gangster Squad has going for it is the cast ? they couldn't have done a better job. Sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) is Batman while Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is the Joker. They are the epitome of good versus evil. Both actors work very well to balance out the narrative, while the rest of the characters fit wedged between their worlds. Everyone has great chemistry together, each with their own purpose and charisma. Even Nick Nolte, with not much to do, holds it together. (Can anyone even understand what he's saying anymore?) But let's get down to it. Gangster Squad is about two-thirds of a good film. Right before the big showdown, the movie begins to unravel at the seams. Plot holes pile up one after another and you're forced along for the ride. Everything begins to become fairly predictable in the end, but nothing ever seems justified.Don't get me wrong, Gangster Squad can be a fun ride if you go in looking for some shoot 'em up action with little substance. I was on board in the opening sequence with Josh Brolin going to town on some baddies. There's a lot to love about the cast (besides Sean Penn's nose and Ryan Gosling's accent), the interactions between characters, the music, and the semi-witty dialogue. But nothing feels fresh or inventive with The Untouchables or L.A. Confidential looking down on it.Gangster Squad puts a lot of great things on the table, but never successfully utilizes their full potential. Needless to say the film was stuffed to the brim with subplots. There's a baby on the way for O'Mara, but he's more dedicated to his job than to his family. Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) becomes infatuated with Cohen's mistress/etiquette tutor Grace (Emma Stone). And Officer Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi) has joined the Gangster Squad to create a better future for his kid to grow up in. All great things, but none of them fully fleshed out, which we could most likely fault the screenwriter, Will Beall.O'Mara's family life is introduced heavily in the beginning, but he is written so incompetently that his wife has to choose the members of his police force for him. She is a loving wife played by Mireille Enos, but the pressure of the squad on their marriage is seen vaguely throughout the course of the movie until the end. The Stone-Gosling relationship feels forced and we are never given a reason to root for these two to be together other than the fact that they are two attractive white people living in LA. These two actors have great chemistry, but there needs to be conviction that they belong together.Out of respect for the families who were affected by the the Aurora, CO massacre, everyone involved agreed to reshoot an integral scene that involved a movie theater ? this now takes place in Chinatown. But even with the replacement of this scene, Gangster Squad still feels incomplete.What really frustrated me was the action. To me it was difficult to follow. There were a lot of action scenes that were shot very close to the characters, which made it hard to get a handle on where everyone was, especially in one particular car chase scene. Ruben Flesicher did a superb job with the slow motion action in the opening sequence of Zombieland, but here it feels unnecessary, as if Zack Snyder was looking over his shoulder.Gangster Squad is not a perfect movie by far. For as fun as it is, the overall conclusion is a surprising disappointment. Don't go in expecting this to be the next brilliant crime drama, but there are decent character moments that are a credit to the cast. The same cannot be said about the plot, which tears itself apart from the inside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Squad that misses the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going to this movie seemed to be majestic opening of 2013. Till the day I actually saw it. I don't dislike this movie but there is explanation why I regret paying $8 to see it.Gangster genre was fading many years ago. R.Scott managed to somehow revive it with American Gangster and Public Enemies was venerable effort to show the cruel realities of gangsters vs. police battle. 2012's Lawless truly disappointed me with bootlegging theme. Sincerely,they should have just left us to see 3 seasons of Boardwalk Empire. And then Gangster Squad arrived...L.A. is great background for every kind of story and in this one,L.A. seemed to be the playground for die-hard police officers. They just had to derive more from The City of Angels. Cast seems like perfect squad which would fight all the critics. And now comes the most positive side. Sean Penn. I simply couldn't enjoy more in his lines and his cool and cruel look he would give to his thug,it was beyond the reaches of this movie. And that is what really saves the day. The rest was, more or less, opposite of flawless. Gosling doesn't really handle himself in this world and it was quite childish role he got. Josh Brolin just didn't fulfill the criteria of being true movie hero,although he did solid job. Emma Stone was perhaps the greatest victim of the plot. She is so gifted actress,but her role was ungrateful one. And now I'd like to justify my 6 stars. Although it seemed in my review that this was not "above 5/10 movie" I would like to mention a fact that occurred to me. If you simply love this genre of police chasing gangsters with robust gunshots and brutal eliminating methods,you won't hate the movie,because it is full of firing from all kinds of guns and Cohen's mercilessness is just everywhere.Towards the ending,movie is getting through the chaos and modern wild west days. The very ending is something like Transformers style ending. Josh Brolin vs. Sean Penn fight scene, with so many soul and such a high stakes in, this shouldn't be an epic ending of grand gangster. Now the point is what? These silent knights defended the realm of L.A.? Forget about it. I felt just like this squad was some CSI and that I'm gonna see the sequel. This routine doesn't fit the gangster movie,it needed to be something epic. Despite that, probably you would enjoy it as a casual Sunday night blockbuster. It is entertaining, it can lure you in for a moment, it is shiny and attractive but that's all just the surface. And when you scratch it you see all the flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Gangster Squad' tells the 'true' story about a small group of LA police officers who try to take down crime boss Mickey Cohen. It's full of action-packed gun fights and bar brawls and almost every movie cliché you can think of.There's a huge cast in this film which is probably why it has done so well at the box office. Most actors do the best they can; Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin, Emma Stone and Nick Nolte have all proved they are talented actors before this but the extraordinarily bland, predictable and cheesy dialogue prevents any of their talent from shining through. Sean Penn's performance is the most embarrassing, mainly because you can tell he is taking the role way too seriously and he clearly thinks he can make this film the next 'Goodfellas'. Instead, his performance makes the entire film seem like the next swashbuckling adventure with Peter Pan ? Penn being Captain Hook of course. He is so over the top here he changes the tone of the film with his terrible attempts at catchphrases ? 'Here comes Santy Claus'?.really? Aside from this disastrous performance, the rest are pretty basic and will probably be used as examples in acting 101 classes.Again, the script is mediocre at best. It's predictable and you can tell from the beginning who will die and who won't. Conversations are boring and basic, monologues have all been done before and there's nothing new here. The film is littered with plot holes and unexplained revelations which you think will be dealt with later at some point but don't. Someone described this film as being like every gangster film rolled into one but it wasn't even as interesting as that. The whole film is like a big smug pat on the back for director Ruben Fleischer and co. despite it being completely undeserved. Overall, this is your average gangster film. There's nothing new, nothing controversial, nothing ground-breaking here. It has been advertised to the wrong crowd; the all too frequent but sometimes funny scenes would appeal to a younger audience yet they have thrown in bizarre graphic scenes of violence which means only people over 15 can see it. A 12 year old is more likely to enjoy this film. The only reason you should go to see this is if you're a boy and you want to see Emma Stone or, if you're a girl, to see Ryan Gosling for a few hours. Instead of watching Gangster Squad, watch 'Goodfellas' or anything that doesn't make you wish you had just gone to see 'Les Miserables' for a second time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is a train wreck. It isn't bad because of plot holes or unlikable characters, it's bad because it's just a terribly edited mess full of forgettable characters, boring dialog and over the top violence.The editing in this movie is horrible, there are several scenes that, one, don't feel like they have a purpose, and then just last about a minute. We aren't given nearly enough time to care about any of these characters, each one of them blends in with another. And despite the fact that a lot of the character development is incredibly rushed, it still feels long and drawn out, especially near the last act of the film. The actors try but a lot of them just come off as wooden, I like this cast, but none of them have much to work with. And the action isn't that interesting, it's overly done and it uses way to much slow motion. And half the characters make the stupidest decisions, weather it be not shooting when they have a clear shot, or not leaving even though there is nothing stopping them.The film looks good, the director clearly wanted to make a pulp fiction style film and for what it is it looks pretty good. Ryan Gosling can sometimes get me to smile just because he's trying so hard. And the first half was kind of fun to watch just because it's so bizarrely bad.I do know that some scenes had to be re-shot because of the Aurora shootings, but I doubt the movie made much sense to begin with. The editing is horrendous, the characters are forgettable, and even the acting seems off most of the time. I'm sure it tried, but this movie just sucked.</fullReview>

The introduction to the villain of the movie is clever as they first show his power by having in box and then showing his ruthlessness in the manner in which he kills a person.The brutality of which the killing takes place alone signifies what type of person this man is.The main heroes of the story forms a team or "squad" and together they are given the task of bringing down this mobster. This is done off the books but the story line though has some similarities to that of movies from the past.The cast choice for this movie i feel was good and each character had their own different personality and owned their individual characters.All in all this a movie worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suffers from the Josh Brolin effect and Sean Penn's overacting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since No Country For Old Men came out (which is a really well-made, compelling film), casting agents have been way too nice to Josh Brolin causing what I term the Josh Brolin effect.While he is certainly a good actor, he has been given too many roles since NCFOM where he has been badly miscast and has watered down or hurt what may have been some pretty good movies Gangster Squad included (Let's see...also Oldboy, Jonah Hex, Sin City: A Dame To Kill For, AND AND some brilliant minds thought he would make a great Thanos, Whatttt???). He looks tired, he drags on and some might even say his acting in said movies is unconvincing of the characters he plays like he just reads the script and says "All right lets do this and get it over with so they can throw me in some other movie I probably don't belong in". Giovanni Ribisi, Michael Pena and most certainly Robert Patrick all outshine Brolin in Gangster Squad in significantly smaller roles. Then there's Sean Penn's overacting, how he didn't get a 3rd best actor academy award or even a nomination is beyond me. When this movie was released you see all the star power involved and you say to yourself "Damn, I gotta go see that!" then when it ends at least I was saying to myself "Thank god for trailers cause at least Josh Brolin and Sean Penn were not in any of them".</fullReview>

Set in 1940s LA, the attention to detail was meticulous, from the cars to the clothes and even the wallpaper and furniture.On the other hand, I thought it was dull and repetitive. There's nothing special about 'Gangster Squad' that makes it stand out from other gangster movies, it's too generic. That said, I thought the cast did a decent enough job at making it somewhat interesting, especially Sean Penn as Mickey Cohen.Overall, 'Gangster Squad' isn't a bad movie, but it's not a particularly good one either.

		<fullReview>GANGSTER SQUAD is a light, fast-paced gangster action movie set in Los Angeles, 1949. It offers something a little more superficial and action-packed than the heady delights of TV's BOARDWALK EMPIRE, and is of course the inferior piece in every respect, but nonetheless it still packs the punch thanks to a strong storyline and fun performances from the majority of the cast.The film is a walking cliché of course, and to describe it I would say that it's THE UNTOUCHABLES meets MUNICH with a touch of THE RAID sprinkled in at the end. The director is a bad choice - the goofy Ruben Fleischer also handled the comedy misfire ZOMBIELAND - but somehow the movie still works. Josh Brolin is a delight as the hard-assed cop and Ryan Gosling is effective as his more laidback younger sidekick. There are nice character parts for Robert Patrick (the best he's been in ages) and Giovanni Ribisi, and the only misfire is an overacting Sean Penn, virtually unrecognisable behind heavy prosthetics and chuckling away like a comic book villain.GANGSTER SQUAD has plenty of action to recommend it, and it's well shot throughout, although a little dark in places. The storyline has plenty of humour and even though the events and situations that arise are familiar, they somehow work thanks to the entertaining script. It's no masterpiece, and indeed is nothing more than a forgettable popcorn flick, but it's one that delivers the goods nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster Squad presents a great cast, but falls short on depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This mafia crime-drama set in the 1940s Los Angeles, Sean Penn plays Mickey Cohen, an infamous mob boss who terrorizes the city, along his crew. With the law enforcement out powered by the evil kingpin, the only man that stands in the way of him and his crew is John O'Hara (played by Josh Brolin), a devoted father and husband, and World War II veteran who ensembles a squad of detectives. This squad includes Sergeant Jerry Wooters (played by Ryan Gosling), a detective who is in relationship with a beautiful hot shot named Grace Farraday (played by Emma Stone), Coleman Harris (played by Anthony Mackie), Conwell Keeler (played by Giovanni Ribisi), Max Kennerd (played by Robert Patrick), and Navidad Ramirez (played by Michael Pena). Together, this group is determined to bring Mickey Cohen and his crew to justice and save their city from his tyranny. This film is directed by Ruben Fleischer who made the hit horror-comedy 'Zombieland' and the action comedy '30 Minutes Or Less'.For a crime drama dealing with a 1940s mafia tale, with a cast full of A-list actors, you would expect it be a powerful film with a groundbreaking story and a mesmerizing screenplay. Unfortunately, this is not that kind of film, nor does it come anywhere near this. While I wasn't expecting it to soar on the level of 'Goodfellas' or 'Casino', after all that would be an expectional achievement in cinema; I was hoping this is would something memorable. Sadly, this film fails to dig deep into its genre. With the story centered a Los Angeles crew set on taking down an infamous crime boss, the film suffers from characters that fall short of development, and a plot that lacks depth. The main antagonist Mickey Cohen is brilliantly written, and Sean Penn gives a strong performance in this role. The character is very well convincing as the sadistic criminal mastermind he is. The rest of the characters are a bit thin. Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, and the others do manage to treat their characters with solid performances, but they are not enough to fully support their characters. The plot is quite solid and consistent throughout most of the way. The problem with the plot is that it veers away from depth and realism, and instead, relies heavily on action more than development. There's a very little emotional resonance throughout the story that the plot doesn't feel much like a film-noir, but more of action packed flick, filled bloody gun shootouts; and there is plenty of them. Gangster Squad is not a complete cop-out, but it certainly is not the crime movie it needs to be. It feels more like action movie disguised in the gangster genre than an actual gangster flick. Ruben Fleischer is probably not the best director for this film, judging by his previous works. With the both of his previous films being comedies, it doesn't seem he quite knows how to nail the crime-drama genre properly. After all, from comedy to crime- drama is not an easy transition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So-so. Feels like a bad attempt at a James Cagney ripoff, with a bit of LA Confidential and The Untouchables thrown in. Yep, not at all original. Plus, it's more style than substance - flashy action scenes, over-the-top violence, clichéd dialogue and plot. Performances are varied in quality. Josh Brolin is decent in the lead role, though he probably gets the bulk of the clichéd lines. Sean Penn, for all his incredible acting talent, is quite unconvincing as the head gangster. Crime-drama is probably not his strongest suit. Ryan Gosling is quite weak in his role. Emma Stone and Nick Nolte give solid performances in reasonably minor roles.Despite all its obvious weaknesses, is reasonably entertaining, especially if you don't want to have to engage your brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a mob story that works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few days ago I have seen the brand new 'Black Mass' which is also a mob story made in Hollywood and enjoying the participation of a fine cast. I was not enthusiastic. 'Gangster Squad' directed by Ruben Fleischer has the few ingredients that I was missing in that film, which make the genre 'mob story inspired by real characters' much more enjoyable to me. It does start with 'inspired by a true story' (or 'true characters'), inserts the inevitable 'true crime' photos, and ends with the even more unavoidable text and pictures about the years spent in jail by the surviving bad guys, and the years happily spent fighting crime and raising kids by the good guys (those who survived, of course). In the middle it does better.The story of 'Gangster Squad' is set in the post-war LA, and this certainly helps as the place and the period seems to gather interests because of the classical 'noire' thrillers that it inspired followed by a number of successful movies (starting with The Maltese Falcon, of course, set and filmed in 1941). The despicable bad guy's name is Micky Cohen and his overtaking of the city could not (at least according to the script) be fought but by unconventional vigilante methods, because most of the police and judicial system was corrupted by hum. Find the right cops, motivated enough by having fought and survived WWII in order to build a world worth being lived by their kids, add the necessary dose of romantic, get a stunt master and a good choreographer for the fights and chases, and success is almost ensured.The story may be more remote from the truth than in 'Black Mass', the capabilities of the squad in fights and shooting may seem overrated, but at the end of the day the result was more enjoyable for me. It certainly helped to have on board such a fine team of actors, including Sean Penn as the ultimate bad guy, 'can't do wrong' Ryan Gosling, and beautiful Emma Stone who always seems to create around her a fascinating touch of mystery very appropriate in this movie. 'Gangster Squad' is a mob story that works and succeeds to be an entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Gangster Squad' lacks depth, character, and mild storytelling, but with its amazing cast of actors, over-the-top violence, and cartoony vibe, I left the theater highly entertained. Instead of playing out like a true noir gangster film from the 40s, director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) has gone the route of making this gangster film like and R rated 'Dick Tracy' mixed with a Saturday morning cartoon, which isn't necessarily bad, but instead of getting story and character, we get blood and guts.We focus on a group of guys who are all part of the police force in 1940's Los Angeles who go off the grid to take down the infamous Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) and his endeavors, before he and his minions take over LA. It's all about the glitz and glamour, rather than developing a cohesive plot. I'm also curious to how much was changed from the original cut of the film, since Warner Bros. decided to delay the film from it's release date last year due to the Aurora, Colorado theater shooting. There was one scene in the trailers that showcased a group of guys opening fire from behind a movie screening on the audience of Grauman's Chinese Theatre. That being said, there is still plenty of shoot-outs and blood and guts, but just not in a theater.Police chief William Parker (Nick Nolte) does not want to see his beloved city fall to Mickey Cohen, and since Cohen has half the state already in his back pocket, he never gets arrested or is asked to pay for his crimes. So Parker takes things into his own hands and recruits the honorable and straight-edged war hero Sgt. John o'Mara (Josh Brolin) to lead a team of guys to take out Cohen by any means necessary. And just like every character in the film, there is no depth or meaning to them, other than one different trait, so that you can tell them apart.O'Mara enlists the help of a quick-draw sharpshooter/cowboy Max Kennard (Robert Patrick), his rookie cop friend Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena), a black cop who is quick with a knife Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie), a smart technology wizard who can set up bugs in the enemies housing Conwell Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi), and O'Mara's young partner Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling), who uses his charm to win Cohen's new squeeze Grace Faraday (Emma Stone). That's one hell of a cast, but all of them besides Brolin and Gosling don't receive enough screen time to care or show their skills.Since Cohen has already made a name for himself in LA in the form of drug, prostitution, and extortion rings, he is ready to control the entire country by forming a company to control all of the wire bookmaking West of Chicago, thus making enough money to control and buy anybody out. It is up to this 'Wild Bunch' type of guys to take him out before his company is up and running. Most of the film is a series of half-assed planned strikes on Cohen's businesses, which don't always lead to a success. But as time goes on, Mickey is figuring out that it isn't a rival gang trying to take him down, and things must move swiftly to prevent Cohen from taking over the city.Everybody is over-the-top in the film, especially Sean Penn's Mickey Cohen. News reports on the actual Mickey Cohen showed him to be a very fun and charismatic guy who had all people with power wanting to be in his presence, and never showed his sadistic side in the public eye. That's not the case with this film. Penn plays Cohen as a complete and brutal psychopath who is not above setting people on fire, putting a drill through people's heads, and cutting people in half. There is not appeal to him whatsoever, other than just being or trying to be the ultimate bad guy.In addition to the cast being amazing, the production and set design is top notch as well. The filmmakers did an impeccable job of turning current Hollywood into 1940's Hollywoodland with all of the fun joints on the strip, costumes, and vehicles. On the other hand, there are plenty cheesy one-liners, montages of violence, and a lack of setup and character development. But, because this film is mostly about immediately fulfilling your action and violence appetite, thus making it a highly entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film doesn't have the most mentally challenging or gripping of plot lines ridden with action scenes similar to that taken directly out of a Michael Bay esque film. The main protagonists of the film, some with well regarded films to their name, play performances you would expect in a film that they probably did for the pay check as realistically actors with equal talent and lesser known names could've played the same parts equally as well. Whilst avoiding spoilers for the avid movie goer there is the obvious plot holes that you'll identify yourself as well cringe similarly to myself at some of the lines of dialogue within this film. All in all a film worth watching on a lazy Sunday afternoon or with a group of friends just round to have a meet up but don't watch this film expecting fantastic acting performances or a gripping story.Also, Emma Stone as always is stunning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad (2013): Dir: Ruben Fleischer / Cast: Sean Penn, Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling. Emma Stone, Nick Nolte: Well made yet totally over the top crime film that addresses violence with violence. It stars Sean Penn as the infamous Mickey Cohen, a gangster looking to take over Los Angeles. His crimes range from weapons to drugs and he pretty much bought much of the police force and judges to warrant his favour. Central plot regards a small undercover group of cops who are set to over throw Cohen and his empire. Directed by Ruben Fleischer as a step up from 30 Minutes Or Less but a big step down from Zombieland. The violence is repetitious and extremely over the top and sometimes graphic. Perhaps the film's biggest issue is a performance by Sean Penn as Cohen that is so bad that it nearly sabotages the whole film. Thankfully the plot solution has Cohen dealt a hand that he has so freely dished out and his shame and disgrace is a plus. Nick Nolte as the police Chief is another disappointing performance and that says something considering that he and Penn are usually bankable veteran actors. Other actors pull through with credible performances. Josh Brolin plays a cop assigned to lead this task and he wades through it even in the wake of major setbacks. Ryan Gosling plays a young cop who dares to romance Cohen's girlfriend Grace, played with sex appeal by Emma Stone who wants out of an otherwise destructive relationship. The visual effects and action are explosive but this pointless mayhem hardly compares to L.A. Confidential, which brings greater realism to the fight against crime. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent acting but lacking when compared to the number of stars in it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story provides a nice base for a deep and engaging crime action movie. It repeats the setting of so many good or better crime movies, the mafia. But focusing itself on the mafia's efforts in Los Angeles apparently has never been done in any other movie. Yet the movie loses it's grip in creating a good fusion between the action and crime elements. The action seems more dominating while the crime element only exists in the form of Sean Penn's character. The added drama and romance parts makes the movie more stretched and unfocused. The acting overall is just a decent work, especially when we compare it to the number of big names acting in this movie. Josh Brolin's lead character role is quite a good one here. He really uses his advantage on the action parts well. Ryan Gosling adds the needed element of 'chick magnet' both literally in his character and to the effect of attracting audiences. Emma Stone, Michael Pena, Giovanni Ribisi and Nick Nolte did just enough to have their characters not sink into the background.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost the whole time, through out watching this movie, I've felt as if I was watching a remake of De Palma's "The Untouchables". Sure, in this day and age, accurately appealing mob movies aren't in the norm, but really this was too clichéd. Gangster rules town, certain cop out of line in trying to put him behind bars, assembles trustworthy crew, looses a few good men, eventually ends up putting the gangster behind bars. It's all been done before. I mean, I admired the effort that was put into the making of the movie and understood what they were trying to achieve, but didn't really feel it.Sean Penn seemed to try so hard to be in character, I don't think he realized exactly how out of tune he really was. It was an okay choice of cast, but I could have thought of so many other actors to star in this film, especially in place of Anthony Mackie. The whole setting and costume set up was somewhat near authentic, but there were some scenes that seemed to be ahead of it's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I know my title might be stating the obvious, but hear me out...If you have either seen a gangster movie, or can possibly imagine what one is like then you have basically seen 'Gangster Squad.' It has every aspect (or if I'm being harsh I could say 'cliché') that a gangster movie could possible have. But does that make it bad? Yes and no. It's not that bad. The acting calibre of Josh Brolin, Sean Penn and Ryan Gosling does elevate it over the average sort of crime caper, plus it's stylishly shot and the production values are high. However, for all its gloss and glamour, it's still just a gangster movie.It tells the tale of a group of police men who are allowed by their boss to lay down their badges and take the law into their own hands (utilising bullets to the max). Naturally, the bad guys don't rake too kindly to this and fight back with everything they've got.So, if you're in the mood for (yet another) gangster movie then you'll probably enjoy this. It has action, shoot-outs, car chases and uncompromising good guys. Just don't expect anything particularly original.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre modern movie, that should have been a comic book...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rate: 6.5/10 Gangster Squad strikes in a Vigilante - on - Noir - ground manner. I guess this is just my way of seeing things, my attempt if you will, to speak of this badly reviewed movie with the most respect I can gather.It's no wonder that after The Godfather, Scarface, Goodfellas and Leone's Once Upon a Time in America the lover of the gangster movies has high expectations. You can say that he expects more than just a bold gangster movie, but in a case of this flick his expectations are in vein. We can speak of the flaws of this movie forever, giving special attention to the poor choice for Mickey Cohen. It looks like Sean Penn hadn't even read the script before the beginning of the shooting. It was just beneath him. Josh Brolin blended in well and he should be the leading name in these types of movies. He would be able to draw us to the movie and present it from the right point of view. If you are expecting to see something similar to the Untouchables (who were the main source of inspiration, not to say it was kind of a reap-off) you will be highly disappointed. You will be like: "What is wrong with the movies nowadays, they are all the same, just fishing for money". And you will be right, it's a typical money-maker. Just take a look to the actors playing: Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Nick Nolte. Everything should be crystal clear. If you are, by any chance, between the age of 15 and 18 and you can observe this movie comic like adding to that the great Production Design and Costume Design, you may actually get to enjoy the movie regardless the catastrophic character development (the greatest of all flaws). Oddly enough the best action scene comes right after the worst line in the movie, which is kind of funny really. You won't find here any influence from Tarantino or other old school action flicks. It completely blends in to the modern digital ways of creating an action movie. It looks more like Watchmen than like a gangster movie. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are two withstanding, good looking actors with great chemistry, which can be seen in the surprisingly good romantic comedy Crazy,Stupid,Love from 2011. The parts were simply inadequate. Ryan Gosling is still playing Driver and Emma Stone fails to make an impression regardless her natural charm. If you are, however, more of a comic book vigilantes fan, this movie will definitely suit you better than the people the title and the poster were intended for, the old gangsters fans.Personally I didn't like the movie, even though I'm a big comic book and noir fan. The 6.5 is a bit overrating, but I'm trying to be objective, enthusiastic and show respect to a fair shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Gangster Squad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is a big, shiny, mess of a movie. It's loud, violent, and very mean spirited. This January release (red flag there) harks back to the organized crime days of 1940's Los Angeles. The film is loosely based (I mean that sincerely) on the story of the LAPD (Los Angeles Police Department) forming a "Gangster Squad unit" to stop crime boss Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) from causing havoc and taking over the city. The unit is comprised of Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), detective Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie), and Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling). Also, you got a wire tapper named Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi) and Robert Patrick's character, Max Kennard. The unique thing about these guys is that they are deep undercover. They basically aren't cops anymore. They are vigilantes. That's the gist of the film and you kinda get the feeling that everyone involved was trying to remake the acclaimed motion picture The Untouchables (1987). Nice try."Squad's" biggest problem lies in the screenplay. The words the actors say don't justify anything that's on screen. The script feels like it was written in a half hour. And what we get for the entire running time (1 hr. 53 minutes) is sparse dialogue between the characters followed by violent shoot-em-up scenes that have virtually no set up and no payoff. Don't get me wrong, the action scenes are well done, but it's hard to care about anyone involved because we don't know much about the the villains or the good guys. And the little we do know, isn't enough leverage to embrace what happens to them. It's sad because the film was directed by Ruben Fleischer. His last two movies (Zombieland in 2009, 30 Minutes or Less in 2011) are ones that I would recommend. He brings a lot of energy to the proceedings. He misses the boat however, on this one because it lacks the character insight and juicy, playful banter between the actors in the two movies just mentioned. The other problem with "Squad," lies in the acting. Sean Penn is the only one in the cast that does any of it. His performance is over the top but it's decent. The bad part though, is that it also feels like it it's from another movie, a better movie. All the other actors in the film literally seem like they're going through the motions. Let's face it, they're being lazy. It's as if the director yelled cut and everyone went to their trailers for a nice long nap. These are actors that I like (Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin, Nick Nolte). Added to this disaster is the casting of Emma Stone as pretty much the only woman in the film. She is Grace Faraday, the so-called love interest. It's obvious that she looks out of place. When you see her all you think of is the other movies she's done. I'm talking teenage films like Superbad (2007) and Easy A (2010). And did anyone else find it creepy that she played Sean Penn's character's girlfriend? Yeah me too. Finally, there is the look of the film. You notice I said "shiny" earlier in this review. I'm serious. If this movie ever made it back to theatres for a reissue (it's probably not gonna happen), you'd find out that "Squad" is so slick and glossy that you could probably see your own reflection on the movie screen.You get the point. It's not necessarily that this film should have never been made, It's just that there was another film like this made earlier and with much better results. I tend to use the term "popcorn flick" a lot in my reviews. The definition of "popcorn flick" is a movie that's good or bad, but not monumental. A "popcorn flick" can actually be a good waste of time. Gangster Squad is a bad "popcorn" flick because as a moviegoer, it's more than a waste of your time, it's two hours out of your life you can't get back. Oh, it's a "popcorn flick" all right. It's of the stale, microwave, and burnt kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is often an entertaining and very stylish film and it's better than what people are making it out to be. It's a fun time and it's not as serious as people may expect. There are some clichés, but then again we see them with most all mobster films. This film has the adequate feel and look of a gangster film and perhaps the L.A setting contributes to that. The story itself is good enough, although you shouldn't expect a strong script.Ruben Fleischer, the director of the excellent Zombieland and 30 Minutes or Less, gets his first try at a semi-dramatic film and does a good job despite the fact it's obvious he was in a dilemma on whether to make this film a spoof or not. This film is about how an incorruptible police chief assembles a squad of officers to take down Mickey Cohen.It seems like the cast had a field day with this film as they all seem to have a great time. Sean Penn was just awesome as Mickey Cohen and he delivered all the goods. It was just a brilliant performance the entire way. Josh Brolin does a rather good job. Ryan Gosling just seemed to play his role off and same can be said for Emma Stone.Overall, Gangster Squad was very entertaining and an ideal escapist film, despite some flaws. It was a shame that this film needed reshoots because of the situation regarding the Dark Knight Rises, but nonetheless it turned out okay. It's violent, stylish, sensationally over-the-top, action-packed, and just a fun time. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are always movies about the L.A. mob in the 40's, 50's and 60's. Noir there called. Each one of them more useless than the next. In the cliché gangster film 'Gangster Squad' containing an excellent cast, we have yet another Mickey Cohen film that claims it is "based on a true story." The gangster squad is a group of five men in Los Angeles who's job was to kill Mickey Cohen and his gang. Yeah, that's true. Not a single actor does a good job, including Sean Penn who plays a terrible Mickey Cohen. This script was a total model of what not to do as a screenwriter. Will Beall adds horrendous dialog with uninteresting characters. He takes a time in history about corruption, greed and crime and instead turns it into a cliché, unoriginal mess. Every actor is terrible and you can tell are doing this film for a paycheck. Ruben Fleischer is a relatively new filmmaker who directs this film. He shoots this film in the weirdest way that almost feels like a video game. As stated earlier, this is a cliché. The costumes, characters, dialog, and guns are so unoriginal and have been seen many times in other films. 'Gangster Squad' even deserves an award for cheesiest film quote of all time. Josh Brolin is arresting some gangster who in a cheesy accent asks "so what are you doing this for?" meaning his arrest. He bends down, point to the L.A. skyline and says "for her." WTH! That has got to be the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard . That quote isn't the only thing you'll fined in this film that will make your hope for cinema decline, you have two hours of pure terrible cinema.</fullReview>

But as it turns out, all Fleisher manages is a shoddy caricature of some classic gangster flicks of yesteryears.The backdrop is 1949 Los Angeles, and Dion Beebe's cinematography is vivid with chrome trimmed vintage cars, jazzy nightlife obsessions and almost every other detail you would expect in a film noir setting. Ironically, in this post WWII era, the City of Angels is anything but angelic as Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) sets out to become the most notorious criminal mastermind in California. From gambling and narcotics to extortion and police bribery, Cohen is on a ruthless rise to power and there is not a damned thing anyone can do about it. Well almost. Played by Josh Brolin, LAPD Sargent John O'Mara is a hot-headed honest cop (think Russell Crowe in L.A. Confidential) who believes court order arrest warrants are useless when issued by judges on Cohen's payroll. Summoned by no-nonsense LAPD Chief Bill Parker (Nick Nolte), O'Mara is tasked with putting together the titular hit squad to wage war on Cohen and his criminal enterprise and reclaim the soul of Los Angeles. Like six rounds to a pea-shooter, the squad comprises of badge less detectives O'Mara, smooth talking playboy Wooters (Ryan Gosling), knife-throwing Harris (Anthony Mackie), recon expert Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi), sharp shooter Kennard (Robert Patrick) and his protégé Ramirez (Michael Pe?a).As an analogy, some viewers might even think this squad is one man short of what would have sounded like The Magnificent Seven; then again, that would be insignificant with everything else this film falls short of. Besides Beebe's stylized cinematography and a few well-framed car chase sequences, the only other aspect worth considering is the ensemble star cast. Normally this would be a good thing. Loosely adapting from Paul Liebermann's L. A. Times chronicle? Tales From the Gangster Squad?Will Beall is a questionable choice especially since this is his first cinema screenplay. To say the least, the effect of this fundamentally flawed screenplay is disastrous on many top actors in this movie and even embarrassing considering some of them are Oscar material from previous films. Double Oscar-winner Penn, for example, is hideous as a boxer-turned-criminal and even manages a faint flash of brilliance in a couple of scenes, but is then reduced to a comical villain easily comparable to Al Pacino's 'Big Boy' Caprice in Dick Tracy. But in also claiming the story to be based on actual events, Beall has carelessly overlooked vital plot aids like Cohen's real life association with Al Capone and Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel. Gosling's Jerry Wooters has some likability if you don't mind his jarring dialogues. The problem arises when his character becomes romantically involved with Cohen's moll and eye-candy Grace Faraday (Emma Stone). On her own, Stone does her part well when we first see her as the sumptuous 'lady in red' but together with Gosling you would expect some more of that on-screen chemistry last seen in Crazy, Stupid, Love. The rest are mere paperweights that could have benefited from a more experienced director. Almost every other character appears to have a story to tell, but is somehow suppressed in the narrative: the most annoying being Wooters and O'Mara's history together as war veterans.For a noir period saga, Gangster Squad is a crime-drama that tries to match up to the look and feel of L.A. Confidential or Mullholland Falls or other films of similar ilk. There is a lot of testosterone-fuelled action with focus given to tommy guns rattling in slow-motion and tooth extracting fistfights, but it all feels done before. In their inadvertent desperation to make a classic gangster movie, Beall and Fleischer have failed to place themselves in the viewer's seat first. The audience, however, has seen this movie before and it will be forever known as The Untouchables.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite 'The Hat Squad'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this movie, it sounded great, but despite some good things, the film confuses itself with too many distractions and is knocked off kilter by one over-the-top performance.Police Chief, Bill Parker (Nick Nolte), gives Sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) a secret assignment. He is to form a squad of detectives to wage guerrilla warfare against crime lord, Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) whose criminal organisation is slowly strangling Los Angeles. However, the chief will deny all knowledge of them if they get into trouble.With the help of his wife who understands that O'Mara is driven by his sense of duty, a group of misfit policemen are pulled together including the mercurial Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling). However, Cohen eventually realises that the squad is actually made up of policemen and attempts to turn the tables on them.It is fascinating to see Nick Nolte as the police chief. A couple of decades ago, he would have played Josh Brolin's role; in a way he did in the not dissimilar "Mulholland Falls" when he led 'The Hat Squad'. Interestingly Josh Brolin actually looks like a younger version of Nolte.Unfortunately, Sean Penn's portrayal of Mickey Cohen is almost on the level of a character out of Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy" or Tim Burton's "Batman" movies. Possibly newbie director, Ruben Fleischer, had a hard time guiding Penn. What he needed to say was something William Wyler once said to Dana Andrews when he thought the actor was overdoing it, "Just give me about 10 per cent of that." It's hard to get involved with the characters. The focus shifts too much and the story takes off in all directions. Too much is also attempted with Gosling's character. He goes through some major emotional shifts, and then ends up having an affair with Cohen's girlfriend. It detracts from his relationship with O'Mara; although they are not 'Butch and Sundance' type buddies, the story would have been stronger if they had been.The film does capture a feeling for the times. Many films set just after World War Two, which were actually made many decades later, often overlook the impact the war had on people back then. "Gangster Squad" is the opposite; the members of the squad have had experiences during the war that have influenced their lives, and Los Angeles is seen as a changed place because of the war.However, "Gangster Squad" certainly can't be charged with being overly cerebral. It ends in a fairly unbelievable battle with submachine guns, which seem to have an inexhaustible supply of ammunition. A calmer approach may have made this a better movie. "Mulholland Falls", which is based on the same real-life anti-gangster squad, is a more focused film even though it is far more fictionalised. It goes to show that no matter how convincing the setting and how great the effects, it's story and characters that count.</fullReview>

About that, if I ever see a movie showing the Hollywood letters again, I'm gonna burn it. I swear, lol! Is this a lack of creativity? Or fear to do something new that people may not follow?How come people who have soooooo much money to make a movie end up with the same scenes, the same actions, and the same actors? Indeed, casting : not good, not good, not good. It's not that the actors are not good, it's together that it's not good, and for the roles. Why Emma Stone for instance? You can't keep from thinking of "Crazy, stupid, love" while you're looking at her in a 40's movie. Aren't there enough actresses dying to play with Ryan Gosling? Or just to play? I bet the streets of Los Angeles are paved with aspiring actresses. If I had all that money they had, I'd love to make a movie with women as the leads and they wouldn't even be super pretty or thin! but the story would be worth it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining crime film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now for starters I do not believe that this film is perfect, however, I believe it deserves more appreciation then it gets in my opinion. This film is apparently based on a true story where a group of cops who decide to put down the badges to take out the crime and Mickey Cohen. Now all the actors do a good job in this film with Sean Penn being a great villain and Josh Brolin, Anthony Mackie and Robert Patrick being my favourite members of the Gangster Squad. However, there is a bit of overacting and I hate Ryan Gosling's voice in this film and his accent which just made me not like his character to much. This film is not a decent character study you see the squad do there thing and stylised action and it is very enjoyable to watch, but there is a lack of substance in the characters. Now I must admit I favour this film because it reminds me of one of my favourite Xbox 360 game ever La Noire and this film hits this to a key and why this film is incredibly solid. However, it is quite short, and the characters are quite thin and the plot repetitive but overall this is a good solid gangster film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gritty 1949 Los Angeles, hard men and even harder women. Snazzy suits, bright red lipstick, sex and death, two sides of a same coin. Whichever side it falls on, you lose badly. But not as badly as this cliché ridden, not just tired, but deathly exhausted flick. This uneasy mix of " The Untouchables" and " LA Confidential", insults both movies. There is absolutely nothing wrong in being inspired with the great movies of the past end even paying a homage to them. The trouble is when you lack inspiration and blindly steal ideas from your much more talented peers. No amount of flying punches and bullets will hide the fact that emperor is naked and without a clue what to do. And please, no more slow motion gunfights, this is not a MTV music video, and we are grown-ups.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster Squad is as Bland as its characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cliché, cliché, cliché and cliché. The director of Gangster Squad is Ruben Fleischer, whose primary grounding is in comedy, with films like Zombieland and 30 Minutes Or Less under his belt - I couldn't help but feel Gangster Squad was so close, inches, from becoming a complete parody of the genre. The look, the dialogue, the accents, the plot, the characters are all so over the top, so cliché to every gangster film that it feels so tired and recycled that you simply don't care.Sean Penn as the villain, Mickey Cohen, is atrocious, laughable in fact. He is the definition of over the top in all of his scenes, and yep, he does all the typical bad guy things, beats up a henchman - check, thinks he owns the city he lives in - check, talks in stereotypical accent - check and finally, he is as one dimensional as a brick wall. The makeup looks terrible too.The rest of the cast don't fair much better. Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling try their best with the material but end up as cheesy and clichéd (get use to that word by the way) as the rest. Emma Stone is drop dead gorgeous as Penns mistress and Goslings love interest, but thats about it as she doesn't even get any material to try and make decent. In fact the only character I actually liked was Robert Patricks Gunslinger (thats not his name or nickname I just call him that) and he's actually the most clichéd character in the whole film, every word he says I swear I heard in other gangster films before... But he's Robert Patrick and damn he may be clichéd but bad-ass doesn't even begin to describe him.The actions pretty good too, a little excessive, in that a lot of it doesn't need to be their - a slow motion shot of a guy getting shot is a key example, it doesn't look cool because its , everyone say it together, Cliché, thats right. Overall, Gangster Squad may have an all star cast and it may have the look of its era, but when there's nothing beneath the hood all you have is a crap car that does not go anywhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Movie about this secret "Gangster Squad" that's been organized by LAPD Chief "Wild Bill" Parker, Nick Nolte, to clean out the city of the scourge of organized crime headed by L.A mob boss Mickey Choen, Sean Penn, and his paid off members of the police department and D.A's office. With John O'Mara, Josh Brolin, in charge of this "Gangster Squad' it drives the Cohen mob almost into extinction until Cohen learns that there's a bug planted in his mansion and mob headquarters and then things start to turn in his favor.Overly violent and bloody movie with a number of grossed out shootouts that make you think you watching a war not police film. The actions of O'Mara and Parker's men are no better then those whom they are at war with in their disrespect for the law that they are sworn to uphold. It seems that no one of the bad guys with the exception of Mickey Choen are arrested or given their rights. As for Choen himself he gets beaten to within an inch of his life with both a dozen policemen and newspaper reporters who are on the scene doing nothing a all the stop the slaughter. As for O'Mara and his men, or those who are still alive by he time the movie ends, all they get is a slap on their wrists after all the crimes that they committed, including mass murder, in the name of the "Law".With the sorry record of the LAPD in doing things its way over the years since the end of the Mickey Choen crime Syndicate it shows that they did nothing to improve their methods in crime enforcement. Which makes them in many cases as bad as or even worse then the criminals that they deal with. Who, as it turns out, in many cases were totally innocent of the crimes that they were accused of and punished for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmm... the Mickey Cohen in this movie may be based on a real person, but something tells me his downfall was a little less... Hollywood-ised than is depicted here. In the group which is set up to take him to the cleaners, with have The Black Man, The Mexican, The Old Dude, The Egghead and of the course, The Rebel. They're all led by a Mr Straight Arrow played by Josh Brolin, whose character is established early when he saves a young lady from a life of prostitution by beating the heck out of a gang of thugs. He's a thorn in the side of Cohen's careful operation... he can't be bribed, and doesn't succumb to threats. The stage is set for a mass showdown...Bringing back memories of The Dirty Dozen and The Magnificent Seven, we have a bunch of vigilante cops who are working outside the law... yet may the best thing to happen to Los Angeles for a long time... They face off against the criminals, and do extremely well considering their small number by destroying Cohen's places of business and stopping his drug shipments from getting through. Everyone wears trenchcoats with hats, there's a sexy dame playing both sides and even though there are more bullets expelled than at the Alamo, no-one can shoot for toffee. Apart from the goodies, of course.Despite following a wholly formulaic pattern, even having a final battle where our two main protagonists lay down their weapons to duke it out man-to-man, this is an exceptionally engaging piece of work. The many conflicts that arise during the gangster squad's dangerous job are electrifying in their scattershot direction, and fortunately the individual members are given well-rounded personalities to make them easy to root for. It might not be the most realistic interpretation of historical events, but when you're this entranced by what's unfolding on screen, who gives a darn? 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never have so many big stars gotten together to make a movie we've seen before. Granted L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and MULHOLLAND FALLS weren't exactly the same movie as this one, but it sure seemed like GANGSTER SQUAD was covering the same story. And with way more bullets and way less payoff.The decent period re-creation and high production values kept me with it all the way to the end, but it was a struggle. And come on, I've never seen so much gunfire aimed at law enforcement in a movie with such poor results. Anthony Mackie's character got slightly wounded, and Robert Patrick's actually got killed, but not before he took care of Mickey Cohen's (Sean Penn) goon with his last gasp of breath. That's it! 1 dead cop and 1 wounded cop by gunfire, and what an endless sh**load of gunfire there was. It was way too much.And to think the producers of this were scared to release it in 2012 after the Colorado theater shooting, out of respect for the victims and their families. If any of them saw this final product, I can't imagined them feeling any "softened" by the this instantly forgettable, gunfire riddled movie.</fullReview>

Each character is defined in the first 5 minutes you meet them, there's Josh Brolin who's a family man who's split between his dedication to his job and wife. There's Ryan Gosling who's a smooth talking cop who's in love with the gangsters wife. There's the black guy who tosses knives. There's Sean Penn who plays a ruthless gangster because he tortures them without flinching. Every cliché is in here. It's a mix of old gangster cartoons, there are scenes with someone using 2 tommy guns (intentionally). There's 0 tension and 0 character build up. The dialogue is pretty bad and I guess most of the actors here was here for the pay day.Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY REVIEW: Funny Gangster Squad!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangster Squad. It's a slick action thriller in the fake body of gangster movie. A secret crew of police officers led by a determined sergeant hot headed Josh Brolin helped by charming Ryan Gosling works in an effort to take down the ruthless mob king Mickey Cohen played by strangely misfit Sean Penn. Movie starts like you are going to see another American Gangster but in no time you discover that director has no intention of keeping it subtle and chilling. Instead he wants to have you some fun like you are watching a run of the mill action thriller good VS evil drama. There are few cherished moments like where Ryan finds himself being ready to fight Mickey after he loses one of his loved ones or when Josh's wife played superbly by Mireille Enos handpicks the team for Josh despite never wanting him to be part of it at all. So once you have lowered down your expectations, you will start liking the fun of watching every gangster cliché in one single movie. Sean Penn disappoints. I am going with generous 7 out of 10 for Gangster Squad. It's the fun while it lasts, just don't expect too much.</fullReview>

Whether it is totally accurate or not, we have a group of secret police headed by chief Nick Nolte who attempt to destroy Mickey Cohen's strangle hold on the city of Los Angeles in 1949. The guys are tough cops as they have survived World War 11. They literally decide to fight fire with fire. No one is really safe from either side of the law.Sean Penn does well in the title role, playing the gangster Cohen to the hilt. He is well matched by Josh Brolin, the dedicated officer whose major goal is to take down Cohen at any cost.The picture well captures the mood of 1949 Los Angeles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over the last 20 years, more and more films have been made set in the late 40s early 50s and each one seems to give its own spin on the lifestyle and environments the characters live in. Gangster squad is visually a master piece, from the colourful vibrant market streets to the dark and dingy back alleys the film looks amazing. Plenty of beautiful old cars and scenery. Although what this film lacks is originality, all throughout I couldn't stop thinking how this film is only a slight variation from the 'untouchables' with a very similar story line and plot. Although saying this I think Sean Penn played and extraordinary role as Mickey Cohen capturing the psychotic violence, naive sense of immortality and over the top cruelty needed to be a growing mob boss. The acting I think was brilliant although I think some of the characters could be developed a bit more, for example 'officer Ramirez' is introduced as timid and inexperienced in combat in the early scenes. Thus giving the impression he would have to build confidence in the duration of the film. But in the first combat scene he is seen kicking ass like a professional. In conclusion I would recommend this film if you are with some friends and fancy a decent film that's easy to watch as it's a good laugh. Don't expect anything along the lines of 'the untouchables' or 'Goodfellas'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, if people are familiar with what really happened back then, this movie might be a disappointment. That in combination with some obvious clichés make this movie a been there, done that movie.However, the vibe of this movie is excellent. I love the 1949 setting of LA, as well as the way of living back then (the normal people, not the gangsters). The action sequences are okay, but nothing we haven't seen before. The cast is great, but I don't think they were able achieve their maximum potential in this movie. Josh Brolin, Ryan Gossling and Sean Penn are great actors, but it seems like they were really in a hurry to sell themselves to the audience, therefore ignoring the exceptional skills they showed in movies like No Country for Old Men, Driver, Half Nelson, Mystic River and Dead Man Walking. Emma Stone, there's nothing left to say about her. This woman is breathtaking, I love her. She did okay in this movie, albeit that she didn't have a lot of screen time compared to the rest. For the aficionados of organized crime in the late forties/early fifties of the 20th century, perhaps you might want to avoid this movie. Same goes for the people that think organized crime themed movies reached the point of saturation with the Godfather and Goodfellas, this might not be your cup of tea either. For those looking for a movie with great actors, a light story, fun action sequences and the usual clichés, this is a perfectly fine movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read Paul Lieberman's excellent book Gangster Squad long before I saw the movie. The story he tells is a dark twisted tale of Justice The law and Corruption and Mickey Cohen's time as Kingpin of Los Angles. I read the book wondering how could they possibly put this story on screen. Well they tried. I got to give them credit they tried. The Whole film is Josh Brolin's without him as Sgt. John O'Mera well it would fall apart. Ryan Gosling is miscast as Jerry Wooters. Gosling just isn't the way Wooters was described in the book. Well Neither is O'Mera who is described as looking like Spencer Tracy and was a devoted family man and was a quiet man. The Film O'Mera is a crusader. A White Knight struggling to save his city from Mickey Cohen. I love this Era and the Story of honest fearless cops battling dirty criminals. Well If done right gets a pass from me every time. The Film is damn near perfect except for Gosling. Even Sean Penn's overacting as Cohen can be overlooked. But Gosling waters it down. Josh Brolin saves it. As I said it's His show. The film was enjoyable. But don't get the idea it's based on fact or based on a true story. The film isn't true. The only true things are in 1949 Mickey Cohen ruled Los Angles. And their was a Gangster Squad headed up by Sgt. John O'Mera to use any and all means to keep organized crime out of L.A. The Book outlines the story which spans years 1949 until 1959. The movie compresses the time line and adds gunfights where there wasn't. And creates it's own facts. But still if you can overlook the truth. You will find a highly enjoyable Action film. This is the kind of Film Robert Mitchum would've made back in his heyday of the 40's It's not the bad film a lot of critics are trying to make it out to be. But it does take liberties with the truth. and that takes away from the enjoyment of the film.</fullReview>

Its not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion though. Good movies leave people wanting more and therefor its understandable that movies like gangster squad are made. Right away and all the through I was constantly reminded of "The Untouchables", its influence on this movie are undeniable. A group of cops go above the law to bring down the mob. Once I accepted that and moved on I was entertained thoroughly. This movie has loads of action and lots of big name actors who keep it interesting. Most notably is Sean Penn who has a great performance as the mob boss. It makes me wish he played more characters like this because he definitely stuck out as the best. In the end I would call this movie a cross between the plot of "the untouchables" and the characters from something more comical like "Dick Tracy". Although it isn't as incredible as lots of gangster movies its still a good worthwhile watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is an interesting throwback to mob films. If you haven't noticed the talented cast, you will. Which is what makes the film somewhat solid.Gangster Squad felt very generic and predictable. I've noticed a slew of genre movies recently that take a traditional typical story and it's clichés and turn them into tropes and strive to make them better. This movie relishes in it's clichés, but not enough to make fun of them, and the entire feel of the film felt rather cheesy. The first thing the villain does it kills somebody. No nuance or tension he just kills somebody. The next scene is the cop whose too dedicated to his job making an arrest he shouldn't as his partner advises him not to. The scene after that he goes into the chiefs office. Now the acting was very solid, Josh Brolin played the lead well, as did Ryan Gosling and the supporting cast. Like many I did feel Sean Penn to be miscast. He is a great actor but his role as villain Mickey Cohen came off forced and over the top. Very beautiful cinematography throughout and the wardrobe stands out.Towards the end of the film, I simply became bored of the story as it was becoming more predictable. I can barely remember much from it as I watched it a couple (11/25) days ago. It isn't too long yet drags on at certain parts. I would recommend simply to watch the film if you are a fan of the genre as it isn't anything new but has enough to keep some interested by its cast. Another note is that the film was originally cleared for a September 2012 released but got dumped to a January 2013 release. Studios took note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Pale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of bloody scenes in this film. Sean Penn plays so many bad person parts that one hates him even before one realizes that he is again acting a part of a sadist. In this film they made him look even uglier and downright repulsive. Ryan Gosling takes the cake....Just as Andy Garcia did in the Untouchables....but the difference is that in that one each member of the squad gave an "A 1" performance. Here the whole team is pale. Josh Brolin is good looking, acts OK but no comparison to police squad leaders in other films. Mireille Enos gave a good performance, and Emma Watson the gangster's darling just speckled the film in between killings. The movie is quite pale despite a lot of blood red scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get the Gangsters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last time I saw Mickey Cohen portrayed on-screen he was played by Harvey Keitel in Bugsy and Keitel was nominated for an Oscar as Best supporting actor.In Gangster Squad Cohen is played by a heavily made up Sean Penn who plays the bad guy gangster in broad strokes. I think its safe to say that Penn will not be getting his third Oscar for this role.Gangster Squad is a meat and potatoes type of film. Its plain, unpretentious good guys against bad guys. If they wished to target a LA Confidential or The Untouchables vibe then they missed their target by a mile. Gangster Squad lacks the aesthetic looks or the literary scope of these films.The film is set in 1949 Los Angeles. Mickey Cohen controls the city. He has judges and police in his pocket and no one is willing to cross him. Nick Nolte plays the Police Chief who recruits Sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), a World War II veteran who gathers a special unit of an ethnically diverse cops. He also later gets fellow cop and playboy detective, Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) to join them. However at first Gangster Squad give the impression that they are the spiritual successors to The Keystone Kops given their ineptitude.The film is easy entertainment but nothing else. They have a hiss-able villain, straight up good guys and each move is by the numbers. You can sort of predict which one of the squad members might be in grave trouble because it is so predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun, stylistic gangster movie with rich characters and great dialog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say, this movie made me eat my own words. With not being a massive fan of gangster movies anyway, then seeing a weak trailer, to say I went into this movie with low expectations would be a understatement. But I've got to say I was blown away straight from the fist action scene to the end credits. Josh Brolin and Sean Penn both nailed their roles perfectly and Robert Patrick (T-1000) His character was just simply awesome on screen, blasting his six shooter. In short this movie was shot beautifully, Had the odd sprinkle of humor, had great dialog through out, Had great slow mo shoot out scenes, had rich unique characters,also it had a message behind all the mayhem.You could say it was just another cliché ridden gangster movie, but to me it was presented in such a way that made it stand out far from any other gangster movie I've seen.Give this movie the chance it deserves to blow you away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not what I'd hoped for really</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched this again on DVD after seeing it in the theater. I'm a big fan of film noir and works of old detective fiction writers like Chandler, Hammett, as well as newer stuff by James Ellroy. I was hoping this film would actually delve into the moral ambiguities of cops breaking the law to protect it or whatever the tag line was. However, the nice sets, cars, homages, can't make up for what ends up being a complete lack of surprises. It is as most people claim, a reworking of the untouchables substituting LA in the late forties for Chicago in the 1920's. I enjoyed the movie in the theater because as usual, I was in need of some distraction. Still, this movie on second viewing really shows all its weaknesses. The love affair between Gosling and Stone is ludicrous. He goes after Cohen's moll (Stone) because A. shes's the most beautiful thing in the room and his hardon drives him B. he's suicidal and courting Cohen executing him C. this is just an excuse to add a damsel in distress who does next to nothing and is perhaps a "whore with a heart of gold." The rainbow coalition of cops during that era also seems strange at a time when nearly everyone was openly racist. No one really seems to state the obvious which is that the cops often instigate a shoot out where innocent civilians end up getting shot and killed. Perhaps the idea of collateral damage is one we've grown accustomed to in a world where "good" and "evil" must clash in uncompromising fashion. Sean Penn does well here despite coming dangerously close to Dick Tracy caricature. Brolin is believable enough while Gosling for whatever reason continues to bother me and seems woefully out of place. The rest of the squad is there just to add a few more guns to the mix although I really do like Michael Pena. He does very little here though. I really did not expect much though I really would like someday to see 40's, 50's LA treated with a little more authenticity and seriousness in a film. Ellroy does the best novels on this era but adaptations of his work range from good as in LA confidential to terrible in The black Dhalia. I guess I'll just have to wait.</fullReview>

So overall, gangster squad is a great crime action gangster thriller that's loaded with awesome action and truly a guy's flick all the way</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and entertaining film, style over substance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this period gangster thriller we are sent back to 1949 post WW2. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) returns from war and back to sunny Los Angeles where things have changed drastically. Mickey Cohen is a power hungry gangster who is willing to do anything in order to grow his empire. His ambitions to own the whole of the west coast drives him to countless murders in what he calls "progress". Before it's too late Chief Bill Parker (Nick Holte) contacts O'Mara and urges him to get a team together later known as "The Gangster Squad". They're mission is to take down all of Mickey Cohen's crime operations before they grow to big to take down.I expected this film to be loaded with plot twists, character development and periodical references. I suppose I thought it would be challenging LA Confidential or any other good gangster film. Instead it lacked in all those areas and it wasn't as serious as I thought it would be. This was a good and bad thing because it ticked all the boxes that I like in a fun cop film but with a cast that it boasted and the performances it had; the lack of substance was unsatisfying.The plot was simple which didn't really leave much room for an explosive film, which was disappointing especially when you have such an intense character like Mickey Cohen as the villain. That being said once you realize what direction the film is going in then you can just sit back and enjoy it. As soon as I heard the music during the opening scene with Josh Brolin, I could tell it was going to be more fun than dramatic.There's enough action to keep the average film viewer satisfied but on the second viewing you realize it's not as thrilling as it could have been. The shootout's are loud but there wasn't much to them making them seem generic. Maybe I'm being overly fussy but I felt there was a missed opportunity in that aspect of Gangster Squad. Nevertheless they were still fun to watch.The cast is amazing, I mean two of my favorite actors on screen? banging? again. So it was always going to be hard to hate this film when Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are acting together. Luckily they put in some pretty good performances. A lot of people didn't really like Goslings high pitched, slightly odd accent and I think the director must have caught on to it because it gradually subsided as the film progressed. I didn't mind it to be honest, it gave his character more of an identity. The rest of the cast were incredibly solid, it was the second time I've seen Josh Brolin play a lead role and he nailed it. Now I wish he was the new batman. Sean Penn as always was amazing as the power hungry Mickey Cohen, if there was more to the script that gave him more of a dynamic than just a short tempered gangster with a tolerance to killing then he would easily be one of the most menacing villains of 2012.Gangster Squad really is style over substance. It's glossy and pristine, despite it being shot in dark surroundings for most of it, you can catch the colors of neon signs and red lipstick very clearly. It's definitely nice to look at, which is one of the main positives of this film, it captures that time period pretty well in a unique fashion.Despite some disappointment over Gangster Squad, I actually quite enjoyed it. It seemed like the perfect film for me, I like gangsters, I like snappy one liners and I like shootouts. Was the film perfectly executed? No, but it's fun and entertaining enough to watch till the O'Mara-Cohen showdown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Was Supposed To Be Serious?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, something said to my perception that the purpose of this movie had something serious on it. Half an hour later I discovered that I was wrong. It is just an action-fun movie, and nothing more that this.I'm used to watch the gangsters' movies and series as they are: With typical violence and lots of bloodshed. Well, I'm not telling that this elements are not included, but they were, how can I say?, smoothed.Indeed, I liked the movie. As an entertainment it falls good. But, with the cast on it, I was expecting a super production, what unfortunately it is not.Well, changing the focus about what to expect, so we can turn this in a movie to a pastime and forget it some time later. I like a lot all the effort of Sean Penn, but Ryan Gosling is so terrible that I wonder how he manages so many good characters?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World war just ended and gangster war began.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a great cast the story was equally powerful, like the movie 'Public Enemy'. Sean Penn and Josh Brolin are the men of the movie, which is all about them and their clash. Ryan Gosling and other gangmens supported well, as expected Emma Stone was just a big name in the cast but not the role she played. Only opening few minutes, it was slow and later parts were very pacy and racy. Some shots were very stylish, men with guns like the movie 'Dick Tracy'. The costume designer and set designers brought the real atmosphere of 50 of Los Angeles including some fine graphics in parts. Well directed by the 'Zombieland' director and this movie should be his best till so far. You know movies always looks fine when the story had men with a gang who are in mission or seek a revenge or robbing banks etc. Definitely entertains us, at least most of them so this movie as well.The story follows after the second world war in LA, when a most powerful gangster, Mickey, wants all the western territory into his control but a cop stand against his will. The cop form a little gang to fight against his illegal activities, so the small fight turns a war between these two men. And who win and who lose is the end of the movie.I was not expecting, in fact I was not interested but my friend insisted so saw it. I liked it a lot and I also blamed myself not watching it till now. It was based on a novel and I don't know how much it justified for its book but it is a must see movie that belong to gangster theme. I think it is a little bit underrated everywhere.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple characters, violent, over the top style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is taking over L.A. in 1949 from the Chicago mob. Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) is leading a squad to destroy his organization by any means necessary. Grace Faraday (Emma Stone) is Mickey's girl, and she falls for the charming Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling).There is no subtlety in this movie. It's just style, violence, and 2-dimensional acting. The style is over the top. So it the violence. And the acting is as cartoonish as a comic book. The story is a straight forward shootout. This is not the 'The Untouchables'. It is more like a comic book version.That's part of its charm. It doesn't matter that the characters are simplistic. It just matters that they shoot a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this a remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Post Second World War Los Angeles has been hijacked by the mobster businesses, who have seamlessly weaved a web of influence, which connects the underworld with politics and law enforcement, making mob law the only rule of law. Mob boss Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) sees the potential for domination, given the overreach of power he now possesses, to take his business statewide and override the hierarchy of East Coast domination. In this ruthless world brash and uncouth Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) is a exception with an unsurmountable sense of right and wrong, where strict police guidelines or even the pleas of his pregnant wife (played by Mireille Enos) are unable to undermine his strive for justice.After a brush-up with Mickey Cohen, where he singlehandedly takes out an illegal whorehouse specialising in women trafficking, O'Mara becomes somewhat of a local legend, even if the corrupt police force fail to congratulate his raid and decide to let the perps loose. Fortunately one of the incorruptibles in chief of police Parker (Nick Nolte), who offers O'Mara to create his own special unit of crime busters, who will function on the outskirts of the law. Reluctantly agreeing out of a sense of obligation, with the help of his wife he assembles a team of incongruous, unruly and/or out-dated policemen, who despite the brash exterior are hell-bent on the rule of good in true Dirty Harry style. Amongst them knife-throwing street-cop Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackey), wild west emeritus Max Kennard (Robert Patrick) and his young protégée Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pe?a) as well as the geeky ex-special op Conwell Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi). The final addition is sergeant Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling), whose affair with Cohen's girl, Grace Faraday (Emma Stone), brings him a bit too close to the key target of the operation...With a plot so incessantly reminiscent of "The Untouchables", Rubin Fleischer's movie feels much like a remake of an outdated classic, even though the characters are somewhat different. Nonetheless everything feels generic, including the construct of the two main protagonists of Wooters and O'Mara, who play off each other in overly recognisable movie patterns. Due to the amount of the characters naturally most of the remaining characters are stylish cardboard cutouts with the most fleshed out portrayal offered by Sean Penn, who manages to instill a brutal despicable feel to Cohen, managing even to give him a peculiar boxer swagger to his walk as well as to his fighting. Much of the same features throughout leading the movie to a generic, if bombastic, finale. Ultimately however, despite the tick the box plotting, the movie moves effortlessly across the terrain, correcting mistakes made in similar such movies and capturing the action with swagger.Set in Los Angeles in the 50's, the movie does seem to capture the gist of the time, even if the somewhat comic gore does take away from the gritty reality set out in more dramatic sequences. Through its no-holds-barred endeavor and some confident performances "Gangster Squad" manages to exceed the ordinary and deliver a satisfying piece of action fodder, which will undoubtedly never become a classic or have a long shelf-life, but serves well to all those in need of short-lived gratification and some well-served brutish heroes whacking the baddies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>they remade the Untouchables</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a powerful cast but a pretty rickety screen play with stupid plot twists and a totally contrived, happy ending. Sean Penn shines when he's stewing about his territory, but most of what Brolin does is so worn out, it's empty; ditto to Ryan Gosling's character, though the shoe-shine boy scene is worth the admission. Watching Mireille Enos as Brolin's wife after seeing her in The Killing was frankly hard on my head, even if she did more than the average wife-character.But there's plenty to love here. The spectacular action scenes worked. The police corruption scenes were priceless. The dumb moves the squad unintentionally committed were great; but when Brolin put together his off-the-shelf gangster squad, it looked so much like the Costner Untouchables, I completely zoned out. In addition, setting up the killing of the squad's geek member(Giovanni Ribisi) was too much like the elevator assassination of Charles Martin Smith and the bookie in the Untouchables. Ugh. The penultimate shootout between the gangsters and the squad had its moments, but all the fireworks dulled compared to the Penn/Brolin fist fight that followed. It's a fun film, but forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Untouchables Revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Gangsters" seems to follow "The Untouchables" in many respects. The demure pregnant wife at home, the way the squad is picked, the poor kid dying, an unintended victim of the gang war. (it was a bomb and a little girl in the Untouchables) The practice on the improvised shooting range. The geeky guy who is an unlikely but invaluable member of the team. And so on. The opening scene promises to show Cohen as evil and violent. He is both but Sean Penn didn't seem to be convinced. Maybe he just doesn't see himself as a really bad guy. There are enough interesting historical references, car chases, good cop/bad cop, divided loyalties, intrigue and so on, to keep it engaging. It's inevitably violent but mostly in context. I particularly like the bomb maker. There's the occasional gratuitous 'I'll shoot you because i'm a policeman and I can' scene but that's par for the course. Apart from the 'Untouchables' similarities "The Gangster Squad" is engaging and entertaining, a little predictable. Just don't overthink it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A catalogue of clichés, and not fun enough to cover over them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1949, Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is the gangster holding Los Angeles in his grip, waging chaos and destruction on anyone who crosses him. Determined to drive him out of town, Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) enlists loose cannon cop, Sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) to head a crack team of law enforcement officers, including Sergeant Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling), Officer Conwell Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi), Officer Max Kennard (Robert Patrick) and Officer Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie) to not capture or kill Cohen, but simply drive him out of town so others won't follow him. While films made during that time were regarded as being of the 'golden age' of Hollywood, nowadays it's interesting to look back and see there was just as much of a dramatic adventure going on off the cameras as there was on it, with the exploits of real life cops and robbers being the inspiration for many modern day crime/gangster thrillers, including this latest addition to the genre. It clearly follows in the footsteps of all the films that went before it, and it's got essential stuff like the attention to period detail down to a tee. But there's very little actual inspiration to the film itself, very much a seen it all before affair that doesn't illicit much interest in the real life Cohen or his legacy.The film plays like a catalogue of gangster clichés, a predictable, connect the dots effort with a hot, modern cast, all in material that doesn't really benefit any of them. With such uninspired material to work from, the dramatic impetus seemingly slides to the older cast members, in particular Penn as the villain, injecting an intensity and dynamism in to the role that it really doesn't deserve. Other grizzled veterans Patrick and Nolte seem to serve little purpose other than to grunt and nod in the most supporting of supporting roles, knowing it's all been done before as much as the audience.Gangster Squad fits perfectly in to that mould of films you'd just watch to gently nod off to, a generic, by the numbers piece that fails to do justice to the legacy of Mickey Cohen and the gang who took him down. It wouldn't be such a big problem if it was just done knowingly and was a bit of fun, but it just isn't. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A glossy, if not over simplified vignette of post-war Los Angeles..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangster squad is Ruben Fleischer's follow-up to his 2009 debut Zombieland. Set in the late 1940s, it follows the rise and fall of gangster Mickey Cohen, and the group of soldiers-turned- cops-turned-soldiers who brought him down.Anyone who saw Fleischer's previous film would be expecting the same levels of visual stylization and gore from his latest offering. And they would be rewarded so. With more slow motion than a sports replay, and a man being torn in half barely sixty seconds in, the audience soon learns what they're getting themselves into. It is a glossy, if not over simplified vignette of post-war Los Angeles, a fact that we are seemingly never allowed to forget. With almost every character at one point quipping 'I thought the war was supposed to be over,' the film does not hesitate in using the past of characters to egg them on in their turf war against Sean Penn's aging boxer-turned-mob boss.The 'Gangster Squad' (whose name is presented to us in one of the film's more cheesy sequences) consists of all the stereotypical players: a veteran sharp shooter (Robert Patrick), the young eager sidekick with room for improvement (Michael Pe?a), the sensitive soul (Ryan Gosling) and, of course, the brains of the bunch (Giovanni Ribisi). Their outfit is fronted by Josh Brolin playing the hotheaded leader of the pack, whose sense of duty allows for the typical family threatening moments.Clearly, the film is full of clichés. The bad guys almost seem like farcical henchmen straight from Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Robert Zemeckis, 1988) and Sean Penn's Mickey Cohen, at times, seems like a shallow comic book villain, the likes of which we would expect to see fighting the Green Hornet, not a group of hardened LA cops. The plot points and twists are as predictable as possible, and if you still can't follow it, the dialogue spoon feeds you exposition to the point of being bloated, but there is still something within the film that pulls you along. It is a hugely fun experience, even if it doesn't tread new ground. The impressive ensemble, on the whole, keeps it afloat also. Penn and Brolin are on top form, with a great supporting cast, also including Nick Nolte and Anthony Mackie, but unfortunately some of the other key players flag slightly. As a Ryan Gosling fan, this is difficult to say, but it feels like just another easy role for him to slip into; the young emotional tough guy who is willing to do anything for the girl, and similarly for Emma Stone playing his lazily-written not-quite femme fatale Gracy.The fundamental issue with the film is one we see too often in the current movie climate: It is not sure of its target demographic. On the one hand, it feels like another Dick Tracy screen adaptation, made for children and filled with amusing caricature bad guys and a simplistic story structure, but it then fills itself with f-bombs (and worse) and ultra-violence, really pushing the boundaries of its 15 certificate. The result is a hugely enjoyable but all too simple to watch, and ultimately confused, action movie. Movie detectives beware: do as Brolin tells you to. Leave your badge at home and simply allow the gloss and violence to wash over you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little bit of a disappointment,,,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the cast of Gosling, Brolin, Nolte, Penn, Pena, &amp; Stone - I was hoping for a good movie. But then again, you can't expect movies to be good now a days by the actors it contains. This isn't a terrible movie as some suggest, but as you're watching it, it does seem like you are watching a flick that came out of the late 80's or early 90's. (Despite the picture quality of course). The story is a little overly dramatized, contains some cheesy quotes, and many un-realistic moments. However; it is a very fast-paced movie and doesn't spend too much time focusing on characters bonding and such. There are many shootouts and fist-fights, some of which are a little boring, and others which are a little intense and enjoyable. My biggest complaint with the characters is Sean Penn's Mickey Cohen. As many others have said, (and I reluctantly have to agree) Mickey Cohen has got to be one of the WORST villains I have ever seen. His script is not exactly creative, and he does not seem menacing at ALL, even when he starts yelling and breaking things in anger. Even after all the negative things I've said about the movie - there is still some redemption to come from it. I think people who don't usually watch movies of this genre will enjoy it, just get yourself into this movie expecting another Scarface or something. The film definitely tries a little-too hard to be epic. But I still enjoyed watching most of it, kind of like watching a cheesy, straight-up action flick. (This movie is a little bit more though, I don't want to underrate it). 6 / 10 stars Check out all of my reviews at TheRightReviews.Weebly.Com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is so clichéd and over the top with acting and characters, you'd expect a wink or two, but no! It is messy, but not so awful to become overall laughable. It is so pompously serious, it is not funny, but not deadpan serious to set you in a humorous mood. It is in a bad taste, but completely lacks audacity of a B-movie. It has some CGI and a bit of a comic book feel, but fails to exploit the theme, so it just looks fake and bombastic. It has a promising Jewish villain, but is so meek, it is not even anti-Semitic.So what is it? I would compare it to a heap of rat droppings you discover once in a while in your own basement.

		<fullReview>I feel as though I was a bit generous with my 6 star rating, and at the same time I feel that in some aspects it worked to get my 6 stars. The movie is entertaining, and during the few first opening scenes, the movie hooks you, and you begin thirsting for more, but after the first fifteen minutes the movie gets extremely off track. Which honestly disappointed me, because as star studded as the movie was, it should have been MILES better. As far as the acting goes, Sean Penn, is good, most of the time. Josh Brolin, I felt had the wrong role. Ryan Gosling has the same role that he does in nearly every movie (extremely depressing after seeing his skills in action during Drive). The one that actually did impress me, was Giovanni Ribisi. Which surprised me because I figured either Gosling or Penn would steal the screen. I feel like Ribisi took his role and put his own stamp on it. The rest of the roles are the actors same Ole' roles, rolled up into one overly long, terrible CGI, beautifully shot, 1940's gangster flick. And that's a shame, this had so much potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is, for the most part, good fun. Don't expect a dark, twist-filled plot that movies like Goodfellas and The Departed managed to deliver. This is an action movie, plain and simple. It's like a mob movie for teenagers.First, the pros. Gangster Squad is loaded with Hollywood's most familiar faces, even Terminator 2's Robert Patrick. It's always good to see people that you recognize from other films, especially if you tend to like their work. Secondly, I always like when there's a team of heroes in a movie. Something about watching different characters interact and form strategies with each other is a thrill on its own. There are also some very impressive moments from Sean Penn.The cons. The script is pretty dry. No one ever says anything particularly interesting; every line is used to simply move the plot along, not to add to it. Sean Penn is convincing enough and has good moments, but he is for the most part poorly used. He is a pure caricature of evil. I can't quite explain it, but he's not terrifying to watch. He isn't a memorable villain. This leads to my next complaint: it doesn't feel like there is anything at stake. We are told what's at stake, but we know better than that, as seasoned moviegoers. I found the final showdown to be boring and anti-climactic.In short, rent it. It's worth seeing once if you like action movies.**1/2 / *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much pulp, not enough spice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more you realize how aesthetically pleasing Gangster Squad is, the more revealing its narrative emptiness is. Never did I anticipate calling a film centered on the gangster life boring, especially one taking place in the late 1940's. The look of the film is pristine, the sets are a sight to behold, and the actors involved are always a pleasure to see, but those three combined things can only make a film so good before you realize it's relying on those characteristics to get by. This makes Gangster Squad even more of a grade-A disappointment seeing as so much good is wasted because it is overwhelmed by so much mediocre and so much bad.The story concerns Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), the notorious mobster who controlled the post-World War II Los Angeles area, effectively manipulating other crime bosses and essentially "buying" the pride and respect of many of L.A.'s police officers. However, he didn't fool everyone; a selected number of L.A. officers who refused to buy into Cohen's garbage decided to form what the media called "The Gangster Squad" in order to stop his acts and bring the L.A. streets back to safety, or whatever preceded Cohen's time.Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie), Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi), and Max Kennard (Robert Patrick) make up this daring, elite squad, while Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) and Grace Faraday (Emma Stone) serve as additional background characters who operate closely with the squad but are not necessarily part of it. Wooters and Faraday have probably the weakest romantic relationship I've seen all year. Gosling and Stone provide spark in their attire and deliver their dialog with marginal delight, but the characters are too broadly drawn and never do we see past Wooters' handsome uniform or Faraday's bold lipstick and soul-penetrating eyes.With the recent wave of gangster/mobster films being very light and sporadic, the two that have managed to come through the small holes of the filter, Gangster Squad and Killing Them Softly, have been underwhelming, both for similar reasons. Both feature a heavy emphasis on style and atmosphere and a very slim devotion to dialog that is fluent and functional. Killing Them Softly showed what overvaluing a concept to the point of filling much of the project with loquacious, needless monologues can do to a film, and Gangster Squad shows the vapidity of a project that lacks even a notable monologue. Sean Penn's Cohen speaks almost entirely in one-liners and ridiculous jokes, appearing more like a clown than a mobster. No insight is given into the underworld, and every actor, even the ones giving quality performances such as Gosling and Nolte, seem to be simply chewing scenery and collecting a check.What a shame too, considering classic, neo-noir gangster films are very hard to come by today. It's a shame the one we get in a number of years comes in a pulpy, comic-book form rather than the serious and competent route we know a film like this could take. The film was directed by Ruben Fleischer, whose Zombieland I very much enjoyed and whose 30 Minutes or Less I quietly tolerated. In both those films, Fleischer gave vibes that he wasn't being entirely serious, yet he wasn't copping out and making a completely goofy film. His work was well-managed and his films were smartly edited and written to say the least. With Gangster Squad, he's out of his comfort zone, unsure if he wants to make a picture that is more silly and featherweight than serious or vice-versa. What we get is an odd hybrid that unintentionally (or maybe intentionally, I don't know anymore) feels like it's within arm's reach of being a parody film.Gangster Squad was originally due out in theaters in the early fall of 2012, but due to the tragic shooting at the midnight premiere of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado, and the coincidence of there being a graphic scene of gunfire being exchanged in front of a multiplex, the date was pushed back to 2013 so reshoots can be performed and cohesion maintained. I can't say for certain what was altered or changed, but if the film is minus a shootout, it's probably in its better form.Starring: Sean Penn, Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Nick Nolte, Emma Stone, Anthony Mackie, Giovanni Ribisi, Michael Pe?a, and Robert Patrick. Directed by: Ruben Fleischer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish with plenty of shootout but a forgettable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is basically a remake of "The Untouchables" but just not as good. It has all the same flaws but lacking in more areas...It has more Tommy gun shoot out action scenes though. What this movie is, is a stylish and cool cops vs. gangsters movie. This time it has many more fictional characters on the good side and one historically actual villain in the 1940's that go by the name of Mickey Cohen(Sean Penn). The leader of the cop side who first goes around recruiting goes by the name of Sergeant John O'Mara(Josh Brolin) and he is basically the tough and serious guy and his sorta right hand man is Sergeant Jerry Wooters(Ryan Gosling) and is the laid back easy going flirt. There is some romance between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's character but it doesn't really lead anywhere. And just seems to be there because of what Ryan Gosling currently stands for. Robert Patrick is also good as the gunslinger cop. But out of all of them the one that stands out the most is Sean Penn's ruthless portrayal of Mickey Cohen despite his over the top performance, his performance is entertaining to watch. It's a shame he didn't have much to work with. Just about all the character are one dimensional and underdeveloped and there isn't much transition at all. But if you want to see a movie with guys wearing fedora hats, suits and trench coat while wielding Tommy guns and having bunch of shootouts. With a passable story this one just might be for you. It's like watching a cool very straightforward noir/action comic book style movie with hardly any substance. Overall it's a watchable flick but forgettable.6.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 80's gangster drama have always fascinated me. The style , culture , environment , the attitude - its just can't get better than this. Gangster Squad is a complete package with simple storyline , powerful performances but disappointing direction and loose screenplay takes the toll on the movie.In order to bring peace and calmness in the city of L.A , an officer leads the squad secretly to stop warlord Mickey Cohen from ruling the city.Directed by Ruben Fleischer , Gangster Squad is all gold but no glitters. When you have likes of big stars in the film , the joy will know no bound. Unfortunately , Gangster Squad relies heavily on the shoulder of its star who makes it watchable. The movie begins with a bang with introduction of each character and planning to bring down Mickey Cohen go well. However , the film loses the track later and ending of the film results in a decent watch. Special mention for fantabulous cinematography and stupendous art direction. Josh Brolin was among the best who gives in a good performance. Talents like Ryan Gosling , Emma Stone and Sean Penn are wasted.If you are looking for bullets-firing 80's mob crime drama , Gangster Squad is recommended otherwise you might wanna miss it . Decent 2.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underwhelming Gosling Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie that tries to be a compelling film noir, but is held down by its direction, "Gangster Squad" is no "Chinatown", no "L.A. Confidential" and no "The Untouchables", and as much as director Ruben Fleischer wants to be, he is no Martin Scorsese. Telling the story of 1949 Los Angeles, where a secret group of cops, played by the likes of Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin, Michael Pena, Anthony Mackie, Robert Patrick and Giovanni Rabisi, attempt to take take down mobster Mickey Cohen, this star studded film sets itself up to be a surefire hit. And then the movie starts. OK, since I'm sure every other critic has already made the easy "Crazy, Stupid, Love" jokes due to Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone taking the love interest roles once again, I'll stay away from those. What I will say when pertaining to the acting here, is that mostly all the performances are just OK. Though saying that Ryan Gosling gives a performance which is deemed "just OK", usually speak to the quality of one's movie going experience.Going in I truthfully wasn't expecting much from "Gangster Squad, in the same way I don't expect much from any movie with a pushed back release date (no matter what the reason). But what I saw here was a movie that really wasn't so bad. In saying that, this film, with Scorsese-esque potential, is severely watered down by Fleisher's CGI motivated visuals (none of which fits the story at all) turning "Gangster Squad" into a movie that really wasn't so good either. Some of the biggest issues working against this film stem from the cartoonish feel throughout, with violence that is laughably depicted, great actors overacting and direction which contains more slow motion scenes than "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter". And while within the exploitation genre these aspects may serve to enhance, in terms of "Gangster Squad" it is quickly discovered that Fleischer's intended atmosphere is one of a fairly serious gangster movie.This is not only an overly stylized endeavor, but basically a poorly directed one as well, with an underwhelming sense of 1940/50's atmosphere. During scenes of action, the set designs looked utterly phony, and during scenes of non-action (due to some odd directorial choices) every actor on screen looks as if they are playing dress up. Seriously, "Mad Men" has better production value! Yet, there is some good stuff here. In fact, there is about 20 minutes near the end of the second act, where "Gangster Squad" is a compelling, lean-forward in your chair type of film. Furthermore, Penn as Mickey Cohen is the standout performance, mimicking more notable cinema gangsters of the 40's. He is not great in the role, but he is memorable and seems to be the only one who understands the controlled over-the-topness this script calls for.Final Thought: While "Gangster Squad" is fairly watchable, it may not be something you want to spend $11 dollars to see. The problems with it are still blaringly apparent; and clearly speak to the reasons as to why a film like this couldn't propel itself onto an award worthy, or at least notable, level.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

		<shortDescription>Don't expect too much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a reason some movies are released in December and some in January. In this case it's the performances and the dialogue that eliminates this good looking gangster movie from awards consideration. While not award worthy it might set a record for the number of bullets fired on screen.Sean Penn looks too good to be Mickey Cohen. Josh Brolin still sounds like Tommy Lee Jones. Hopefully Ryan Gosling's voice will change when he grows from a Gosling to a Goose. Emma Stone isn't given enough to do.The movie plays fast and loose with the facts. Maybe it would be boring to say Cohen was convicted of tax invasion. Alcatraz was a Federal Prison where he took a pipe to the head that didn't kill him. If he was convicted of murder as the movie implies he would have been in a State prison. There may be some issues with the "Hollywoodland" sign that was in disrepair in 1949 and restored to just "Hollywood".The cars look good, as do the costumes. The movie comes with a loud score that takes over the action on the screen. The story and the dialogue is cliché heavy which makes it kind of fun.If you have seen all the award contenders spend some time with the "Gangster Squad".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster Squad boasts fine production design, but lacks the craft needed to tell a compelling story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in Los Angeles in 1949, "Gangster Squad" tells the story of a crew of police detectives who undertake a secret assignment to take down notorious gangster, Mickey Cohen.Cheesed up, dumbed down and cliché riddled, this movie seems to do everything it can to insult the intelligence of its audience. Director Ruben Fleischer overlooks character and substance in favour of style and action. The resulting film is one that boasts fine production design, but lacks the craft needed to tell a compelling story.The actors here do the best they can with sub-par material. Sean Penn turns in a solid performance as the ruthless mob-boss, a role he seems to play pretty effortlessly. Josh Brolin also does decent work as the movie's protagonist, Sgt. John O'Mara. Both of these players manage to convey their characters as being somewhat relevant, as they spout lines such as: "Los Angeles is my destiny!", "When I came here I was nothing. Back home I was a gangster, now I'm GOD." Or "We're not solving a case here. We're going to war! ".Emma Stone has very little to do here, which is probably because she plays a character made of cardboard ? a 40's woman who is not intelligent or strong enough to get herself out of her own mess. Ryan Gosling is probably the most disappointing part of this entire movie, however. My estimation of him as an actor has been growing of late, particularly after the finely balanced performance he gave in Nicolas Winding Refn's "Drive". The performance he gives here as slick talking ladies man, Sgt. Jerry Wooters, is just plain bad. This is a real shame because this part seems like it was written for him. Gosling's dialed in effort shows up in his delivery and mannerisms, which are more akin to 2013 than 1949.Am I expecting too much from this action/crime flick? After all aren't most Hollywood action movies formulaic and facile? Well they don't have to be. Particularly when dealing with a real-life crime figure with a fascinating story. The L.A. depicted in movies like "Chinatown" and "Double Indemnity" are intriguing worlds riddled with betrayal, sex, revenge and scandal. The L.A. presented in "Gangster Squad" looks good, but is stripped of having any real presence.If you're looking a low involvement action movie to watch while you relax and chomp down on your popcorn, then this could be your ticket. Just don't go expecting much in terms of realism or substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreadful, Simply Dreadful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My senses were assaulted by the miserable excuse for a film today.New words have to be invented to describe how mind-numbingly dreadful this piece of garbage is.There is no cliché or stereotype you can think of that is not present here.Professional lox, Josh Brolin, scowls throughout the movies in what he apparently thought was how a supposedly tough cop acted.The other actors failed to even meet the low standard set by Brolin.The exception is Sean Penn whose portrayal of Mickey Cohen was redolent of ham but leagues ahead of the rest of the performers.Although I had never seen "Gangster Squad" before, the script was so hackneyed and trite that I knew how every scene would end as soon as it started.They even stuck an Abbott &amp; Costello gag in there ("Post Office is a kid's game", "Not the way I play it")Senseless and ludicrous gunfights abound here. One gunfight scene had a hood holding and firing a Thompson sub-machine gun in each hand without a bit of recoil from the very powerful gun.This film is unbelievably bad. Not in the so-bad-it's-good way either but in the dreadful I-can't-wait-for-it-to end way.There is not one redeeming quality to this film.Every copy of this film should be gathered up and burned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This cartoon-like mess reminds me of another failed LA crime movie from some years ago called Mulholland Falls, which involved "The Hat Squad." So maybe this is merely the dumb cribbing from the dumb. There have been plenty of good and great Los Angeles noir films, but this sure ain't one of them. And poor Nick Nolte! He was also in the aforementioned Mulholland Falls, so he's a two-time loser. Where to start at how bad Gangster Squad really is. For starters it makes a complete hash of real-life characters like Mickey Cohen. Anyone who knows the real history of Cohen's era also knows how inaccurately this film portrays it. If you want to see something that does this period right try Chinatown. I don't know what the director was going for here. Nothing is period accurate except some of the music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster Squad Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood. A place people dream of. A place where aspiring actors and actresses go in hopes of living out their fantasies. A place where big movies are made, and the makers are proudly paid. The place where Gangster Squad was created, and was the setting.The flaw of Hollywood made, straight to the cinema films is that sometimes the looks, stars and big budget appeal are the main focus, forgetting about the important essentials of film-making. If you want to make something memorable, something that will be discussed as truly great, the actual plot has to be extraordinary.But when it takes a backseat, the problems start to arise. I think Gangster Squad, has that exact flaw. And I honestly believe that is why it was so negatively received by critics, and only liked somewhat by general audiences. A film like his had all the potential in the world. A great real life story to base it off where members of the FBI created a gangster squad unit, in order to take down a notorious mob-man by the name of Mickey Cohen in the 1940's and 50's.A star studded cast, with immensely talented actors and actresses. With Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Sean Penn, and Emma Stone, among other well known names, you would think that you are in for something special. And the acting delivered, with Brolin being a legit, intimidating Sargent, and Penn, a ruthless villain, as examples. The characters themselves were so stock, and written so basic, that the only entertainment came from the sheer acting chops of the talent themselves.Or how about how beautifully shot the film is? I'm telling, it really was a sight to behold. Hollywood looked like it went into a time warp, and we were back in the year of 1949. Everything from the filming to the make-up, to the costumes, was done with detail, and style to the highest extent.This could have been another amazing mob movie, for instead of creating that, director Reben Fleischer seemed to go the all out action route instead. Which worked in some cases, as the car chase for example is great fun to watch, but as a whole, it got tiring. Bullets flew everywhere, but no one realistically had an idea how to use a gun except the Officer slash cowboy, Max Kennard character, played by Robert Patrick., who uses a revolver that never misses. So many misses and so little hits just made shed any realistic aspects, but that does not have to warrant negatively in most cases. Being unrealistic does not make a bad film. Overkill does.Josh Brolin was tasked with creating a gangster squad, and that he did, employing a black man whose a knife specialist (Anthony Mackie), a cowboy (Robert Patrick), and even a genius strategist (Giovanni Ribisi) as the brains. A ladies man in Gosling, and a rookie Mexican cop, in Michael Pena, round out the team.Here is the thing, all of the plans, with the exception of one, which was planting a wire in Cohen's house, were just straight destroy and murder enemies. No actually brains, or high tension scenarios, as this squad seemed to be made of superheros battling dumb mafia muscle.Everything seemed easy, and while not all the good guys make it to the end, you can never emotionally invest in them. The majority of the characters are paper thin, and just doing it to take out the biggest bad guy, quite simply. Gosling, who plays Sergeant James Wooters, is the only one given some story. As well as a boring, far-fetched romance add on, with Emma Stone's character.Sean Penn may have made a fun, over the top maniac, as the villain Mickey Cohen. However, a great villain needs to be able to one up the good guys, and seem like a threat, but he never actually did. Cohen was only dangerous towards his own men, while the Gangster Squad was able to take out an army with relative ease.This is a film that ditched going for a classic, for a quick weekend movie hit, and hopes of a taking over the box office. Worth a one time watch for a few, well done action scenes, and beautiful scenery, you can call it a guilty pleasure. But as a DVD to add to your mob movie collection, I am not sure if I can deem it worthy.The biggest issue with this film is that it had all the potential in the world to be so much more. A rental or a view on Netflix when nothing else is on, will provide a fun at time, but easily forgettable film.Superpower Film Scale: 2/51: Villainous Waste2: Careless Bystander3: Hero unaware of powers4.

		<shortDescription>By the numbers ? solid for what it is but disappointing in how unremarkable it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a big budget and it uses it well to get lots of famous faces and put them into a period setting which is nicely delivered with the clothing, vehicles and design of the era all convincing and engaging. All of this is fine and good. In terms of the story we have a group of cops let off the leash in order to tear down a criminal organization using any means necessary. This is done through a series of set-pieces which are reasonably engaging but generally are quite ordinary in how they are done.This feeling isn't helped by the way that the feel of authenticity doesn't carry through from the sets and cars into the characters or the story. In this area the film doesn't convince and it lacks a real sense of atmosphere to the telling. Thematically it is similar to The Untouchables and it is really hard while watching not to compare it to that film ? a comparison which is not kind to Gangster Squad. While one has real style and tension, this film doesn't and I did feel like I was watching it rather than being involved in it. This still worked well enough to entertain as a solid by-the-numbers affair, but there was little that gripped or thrilled me about it. It has a certain amount of class to it, but too much of it is only "OK" to be really a film I would recommend as anything other than a decent enough filler.The cast are mostly part of the problem since we don't really have characters so much as we have roles to be filled. So many of the performances are about "their thing" and less about them being real people within the story. Brolin focuses on getting his Dragnet tone right and doesn't have too much out of that to deliver. Penn on the other hand goes for it and is enjoyably sadistic and erratic in his character ? he is probably the best turn in the film. Gosling does little and his subdued performance doesn't have anything of note behind it. I liked the support from Pena, Patrick, Ribisi, Mackie and others, but they were more about their presences and some good delivery rather than good performances.Gangster Squad is still a solid film that does the basics but not too much else. It is hard not to compare it to better, similar films and be disappointed with how it came out ? but if you can get over this then it is still decent filler. But you will need to get over that first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster Squad (2013) A Bloody Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mobster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) wants to take over post-World War II Los Angeles by controlling drugs, prostitution and most importantly controlling the flow of gambling money all the way from Chicago to L.A. The gambling operation is code named Operation El Dorado. Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) tasks Sergeant John O' Mara (Josh Brolin) with bringing together a force of policemen to take apart Cohen's burgeoning operation, and hunt down and kill Cohen.Sergeant Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) Officer Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie) Officer Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena) Officer Max Kennard (Robert Patrick) and Officer Conwell Keeler (Giovani Ribisi) make up what's called the Gangster Squad, and they go about dismantling Cohen's gang. Keeler is the intelligence officer who bugs Cohen's house and provides the rest of the squad about what Cohen plans to do. But Wooters, the rebel in the group falls for Cohen's girlfriend, Grace Farraday. (Emma Stone) Grace and Jerry know if their romance is discovered, it means death for both of them. Do they end operation El Dorado, do they kill Cohen or does the romance between Wooters and Grace Farraday get in the way? I did not like Gangster Squad. My displeasure starts with the voice over narration, don't get me wrong classic movies like Sunset Boulevard and Citizen Kane use voice-over narration to great effect,, but it's simply not necessary here. The movie is a triumph of style over substance. The movie looks great, it captures the art-deco style of 1940's Los Angeles perfectly, the day-glo colors of the buildings and neon literally jump off the screen,the costumes are similarly spiffy, but the story is simply not compelling. It's like some of the best actors in America got together and decided to play cops and robbers. What makes Cohen want to be a gangster? Is it his background as a fighter? Is it his ethnicity, being a Jew in a profession dominated by Sicilians? There is not enough character development for any of the characters, all the cops are perfect, except for Wooters and other than his relationship with Grace Farraday, this movie tells us nothing about him.Sean Penn gets lost in the prosthetic makeup, and trying to create a distinctive voice for Cohen. It really is not a good performance. When Cagney played Tom Powers in The Public Enemy, his anger as seething below the surface. Sean Penn, sometimes plays Cohen as low-key, but sometimes screams just to show that he is acting. I found Ryan Gosling's performance oddly uninteresting, and I usually like Gosling. He had more chemistry with Stone in Crazy Stupid Love, and that's not a good sign. Stone does her best Veronica Lake (or was it Jessica Rabbit) style femme-fatale, but I never got the sense that she was in danger, or for that matter dangerous. Josh Brolin 's character was made perfect, flawless, and so he couldn't really do much except be flawless. Mackey and Pena were in the movie I suspect to appeal to a certain demographic, as Hollywood is known to do.The writing is subpar, extreme violence fills the gaps for actual plot, and the story was much too long. I saw nothing spectacular in the direction, but it's the first time I actually noticed set design and costume design.Gangster Squad: A bloody mess.For more hot blooded reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie is so gangster! It's pretty good in my opinion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kinda enjoyed it. A lot actually. Not a lot of substance but still a lot of fun. I think some critics were a bit unfair to the movie wanting a more serious dark gritty film. The uniqueness &amp; stylized production of this movie is what makes it it's own greatness. It's not supposed to be a 100% serious "sophisticated theatrical style" movie. The action, dialogue, &amp; plot are all dead on. It was a good honest popcorn gangster flick movie. Plus, it was pretty dark and gritty with a lot of violence in it. I'm confused why these folks are complaining. Remind me of all the old gangsters film that Warner Bros used to produce back in the 1930's and 1940s. Gangster Squad is a 2013 action crime drama directed by Ruben Fleischer, written from a screenplay written by Will Beall. You know the film will have great catchy quotes from these two. The film is loosely based on the story of Los Angeles Police Department officers and detectives forming a group called the "Gangster Squad unit" who attempt to keep the city safe from Mickey Cohen and his gang during the 1940s and '50s. While the film, characters, and events are mostly fictionalized, the LAPD did have a Gangster Squard unit which was created when Clemence B. Horrall was the LAPD's Chief of Police. In the movie, the Gangster Squad is assembled to go after Mickey Cohen. However, in real life it was set up prevent other gangsters from taking over Cohen's rackets after Cohen went to prison on income tax evasion. In this film version, Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) seeks more control, and power. Not only does he whack East Coast gangsters, but also citizens. Sean Penn is really good at this role. I have to say, it's one of the best roles he ever put. He was really scary and good at acting sadist. Chief Bill Parker (Nick Nolte) thinks it's time to destroy Mickey Cohen once and for all, before he become too powerful. He set up a secret team of cops call the 'Gangster Squad' lead by Sarge John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) who would wage war and destroy the entire enemy operation, off official police books. One thing that had me in hysterics was how O'Mara is picked to lead the Gangster Squad because he is a veteran of "Camp X" where he was trained in guerrilla warfare and used it on the Japanese during World War II, yet as soon as he puts his squad together, there's absolutely zero evidence that he has any kind of guerrilla training or even advanced military training of any order. You rarely see it in the film. All he does is point his gun and shoot and try to look badass, it seriously took one of this lieutenants slick playboy Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) to tell him that they needed some kind of strategy. Ryan Goslings voice in the film was really odd. He sound like he was talking in balloon voice. Wooters keeps in touch with childhood pal Jack Whalen (Sullivan Stapleton), now bodyguard to Cohen and informant. Grace Faraday (Emma Stone) is Cohen's etiquette coach and girlfriend. Wooters and Grace begin a secret romantic relationship. Emma Stone is stunning, but her small frame girl frame, doesn't make me think of 1948's starlet. She was too much of a damsel in distress. Add to the group is Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie) is lured by the prospect of cutting off Central Avenue drug addiction at the source. Anthony Mackie is a great actor, but doesn't fit the part as well. Wire-tapper Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi) is the only one with a son and plays it well. Old sharpshooter Max Kennard (Robert Patrick) is followed by his partner "Christmas," Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pe?a), who wants in. With organization and better planning the unit strikes several successful blows at the heart of Cohen's criminal organization and it's look like it might work, or will it? The vintage clothes, sets and L.A locations were amazing. You really got into the feel that it was 1948. The action was interested and packed. It was all pretty good, and every member of the team had a purpose. One action film was cut from the movie that was in the first trailer. In the first trailer of the film, there was a scene where gangsters were coming out of the movie screen, and shooting up the theater, but in the wake of the mass shooting at a theater in Aurora, Colorado on July 20, 2012 the trailer was pulled from running before films and airing on television. It was later reported that the theater scene from the film would be either removed or placed in a different setting, since it is a crucial part of the film, and the film would undergo additional re-shoots of several scenes to accommodate these changes, which resulted in the release of Gangster Squad being moved back to a later date which end up being 2013. While the Aurora shooting was a tragedy. I really hope the DVD had those theater shooting cuts scenes in it because it did look interesting. Sadly, my copy didn't have it. Like I said the movie is pretty brutal and violence, so I wouldn't say this is a film taking small children in. There is a few gory scene that might make you hurl. Overall: The dialogue is catchy and slick, but somewhat cheesy. The acting is pretty good, and the film looks the part. So check it out if you want.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clichéd and Trite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gangster Squad" has real star power with two actors at the top of their game but not in this trash film. Sean Penn may be the best actor in the business and Josh Brolin has been very good in recent films, but even these guys can't overcome some of the worst clichéd dialog to be heard in many years. I found myself mouthing the lines before they were spoken because they were so predictable and unoriginal. The film rips off "The Untouchables," a mediocre movie in its own right, but this is far worse. Ryan Gosling is miscast again and continues to show that his acting range is pretty narrow, maybe non-existent. Sean Penn once justifiably criticized Nicholas Cage for making some really poor choices in film roles and not respecting his talent. This is a chance for Cage to get even. First time director Ruben Fleischer had money, talented actors, and a good story line and produced an absolute bomb. Gratuitous violence is the core of this film and is as boring as the endless gun battles with submachine guns that never seem to hit their target. Fleischer doesn't seem to have any original ideas. Hopefully, we want see him again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By No Means a History Lesson, but Loads of Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a history lesson, then avoid Gangster Squad at all costs, but if you're looking for an Untouchables styled throwback to gangster classics starring the likes of Cagney and Muni, then look no further than this film.Set in 1949 Los Angeles, the film blends real history with fictionalized characters and events to create a love letter to old Hollywood gangster films that plays well to modern audiences. In the film, Sean Penn plays a villainous gangster named Mickey Cohen, a real historical figure who took over most of LA's underbelly in the '40s and '50s, and it is true, like the movie shows, that the police chief created a secret squad of cops, known as the Gangster Squad, to try and hamper Cohen's operations. The idea of the Gangster Squad is that they leave their badges at home, they are not cops, they're just vigilantes out to do what they cannot do as cops, requiring little things like Miranda rights and evidence.Really, this movie just scratched an itch I've had for a long time for a movie like this. I love this era of US history, the era of the gangsters. It's a fascinating era, but one that Hollywood has been obsessed with representing realistically pretty much ever since The Godfather in the '70s. What I love about Gangster Squad is that it hyper stylizes and romanticizes everything to the point that you know they're not trying to be realistic or even historically accurate, they're just trying to make a fun, emotionally involving ride. From Ruben Fleischer's stylish visuals, to Will Beall's screenplay that accentuates 1940's slang, this is a film that knows what it's meant to be from the first frame and never tries to be anything more, and that is why I loved it so much. Of course, what made this movie work so well though, is the fact that I cared for the characters. They made all of the characters likable and relatable. They're all morally upright guys who will always do the right thing, so when they get in gunfights, you don't want any of them to die, that's the true brilliance of this film, and that really has a lot to do with the stellar cast. From Josh Brolin to Ryan Gosling, they cast likable actors in these roles that we're supposed to love, and it works. Though, none of our heroes would work unless you had a villain so nasty that you wanted them to bring him down, and Sean Penn delivers that as Cohen, chewing up the scenery every scene he is in. From the first time you see Penn's Cohen, he is being painted as this emotionless guy out for only money and power, and will kill all in his way to get it. Who doesn't wanna see a guy like that broken?Overall, Gangster Squad works for what it is. While many would rather like to see a historically accurate retelling of the real Gangster Squad, as a fun popcorn movie, this Gangster Squad more than suffices.I give Gangster Squad a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the first trailer for this it was set to Hip Hop and I was like "Why did they do that?" Well, I know cause that's what sells nowadays. When they made the next trailer they chilled on the Hip Hop and new style and it looked more like the movie I thought it would be. Obviously they were going for Zack Snyder meets L.A. Confidential and The Untouchables (none of which are bad), but even with those influences a good movie has to find it's own voice. You could tell that the original script for this probably had that. At the heart of this was a story about how the soldiers coming back from the war were having trouble adjusting and it some ways just found themselves in a new war. If they would have kept the focus more on that and stayed with more conventional old school filmmaking this would have been a really good movie. With its stellar cast and look it was pretty good, I loved a lot of the choices they made along the way. All the criticism on bad acting is unfounded, most square people have never met real life characters like Mickey Coen. Just like with Gatsby and the action movies that now put me to sleep, story and more character development would have served this movie well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So disappointing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the trailers I saw for this movie should be given an award. It must be an art form to be able to edit and portray a lemon like this movie into a gem. I was so looking forward to seeing this but I was still cautious because I know trailers can be off the mark from previous experiences.'Gangster Squad' is a completely different film from what I was expecting, it was actually a farce. It had everything going for it, a superb cast, good locations and based on true events. It's first major fault was the director. My belief is that the director is the key factor in any production, the same as a conductor in an orchestra. You can have the finest musicians at your disposal but if you're clueless as to how to coordinate them, the result is disastrous. Sean Penn, who is one of the finest actors around, came across as a 'Dick Tracy' villain. And the other actors were not far behind for OTT performances.The second major fault was the screen writing. What utter tripe! At one point I thought I was actually watching a 'Dick Tracy' reboot. Clichés and plagiarism (the sound of the bullet shells hitting the floor was robbed from 'The Matrix' and the shootout in the lobby reminded me of 'The Untouchables' Union Station scene).Only one good point, Emma Stone looked the part and could have starred with Bogart with ease. If you want a proper gangster movie, look up 'Miller's Crossing', 'Road to Perdition' and even 'The Untouchables' though Penn must have modeled himself on DeNiro's Capone. For a realistic feel of Los Angelus during this period, Eastwood's 'Changeling' and 'L.A. Confidential' and ultimately 'Chinatown'.My advice is to skip this movie altogether. 2/10 is my rating, 1 point for Emma Stone and the second point for the movie trailer because it completely tricked me.</fullReview>

The only person who's performance I didn't like was Sean Penn. The direction is pretty good as well. Ruben Fleischer has only directed 2 other movies (Zombieland and 30 Minutes Or Less) and I enjoyed both of those films but I was skeptical about him directing this because it's a completely different film than those two films were. However he delivered a truly great movie that I would highly recommend. My second favourite film of the year so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was famously re-edited following the theater shootings in Aurora, Colorado last July. When it finally got released in January of 2013, it was roundly dismissed by critics and did fairly poorly in theaters. It seems audiences haven't been as unkind to it, however, as it has a pretty decent IMDb rating. And I concur with that opinion. It's perfectly watchable. If gun violence bothers you, this is one of the most gun-happy films of recent times. I'm not one who really believes movie violence leads to real-world violence (seriously, are films really more gun-happy now than they were at any other point in American history?), so I'm not offended. The cast is mostly fine, though certainly no one is Oscar worthy. I liked Sean Penn a lot. I'm a sucker for scenery-chewing villains, and he's quite fun as gangster Mickey Cohen. Emma Stone is quite sexy in her old-fashioned dresses. The film looks great all-around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gangster flick unlike anything we've seen in years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read several reviews that all used the word "cliché" in their description of Gangster Squad. Yes there are plenty of aspects of the film that are clichéd and rightfully and properly so! This film is meant to be a tried and true gangster flick from an era long gone by. It is gritty and violent an well acted and just the perfect popcorn theatre action flick. I wish more than anything I had taken the time to see it in the theatre because I think this is one of the films the defines the reason we go to theatres. It has emotion and a solid story and the cliché that people mention is actually what makes this movie great. It is a genre in and of itself, the gangster flick, and the film makers paid perfectly proper respect to the genre without ever making it feel cheesy and that would be a difficult task. 1940's Los Angeles is brilliantly recreated and makes you feel like you are right there amidst the nightclubs and smoky jazz rooms and violent gunfire of monsters vying for territory. Is it a realistic film? Nope. And who cares? I don't believe this film is trying to tell a story from history. I think this is a tommy guns blazing, car chasing, old school detectives gangster flick and it was insanely fun.Josh Brolin seems primed and perfect for his role as leader of the Gangster Squad. He has this old school Hollywood look to him and delivers his lines with precision and really just looks the part. Its important for everyone in the cast to have this classy jazz look to them and he's perfect for it. Sean Penn (who I always seem to have an issue with and yet picks great roles and movies) is regretfully very good in his role as Jewish Gangster Mickey Cohen (loosely based on the real life Cohen.) Penn is a first rate villain. Seriously, Cohen is a brilliantly crafted mobster and Penn makes him believable and downright evil. Ryan Gosling might be the only hiccup in the cast. I like Gosling, he's a great actor no doubt. I just felt like most of the time that he didn't fit into the entire ambiance of the movie quite right. Maybe it was that he was too recognizable as a star or just that he was too modern to really sink his teeth into it but he wasn't great. He was however, decent and fun to watch. Emma Stone was very good as the alluring 1940's type starlet we would expect in this type of film. Her and Gosling have good chemistry as already proved in Crazy Stupid Love and her character is decent without being too big and getting in the way. Its hard in such a huge ensemble cast for everyone to get their piece but I would have loved to have seen more from the rest of the squad including Robert Patrick (loved his ageing gunslinger character), Michael Pena, Giovanni Ribisi and Anthony Mackie. The four of them were great in very small supporting roles and my only complaint is that we didn't see more of them. Nick Nolte was a nice touch of old school class in a cameo role as the Chief of Police.Beginning to end Gangster Squad is a good ol' fashion gangster. Non-stop action, simple but effective story, and just really great chemistry with this cast. The closing battle/gun fight scene in the last half hour is nothing short of brilliant. For a director best known for his comedies (Zombieland, 30 Minutes or Less) and his TV credits, Ruben Fleischer has an unmistakable talent for action. Some people would call this mindless but if that's the case then I enjoyed turning off my mind and joining the ride. I haven't seen a lot of mobster type movies outside of the classics like Godfather, and the very over-rated Goodfellas (which reminds me...thank you film makers for not casting Ray Liotta, the most overused gangster in Hollywood) but this one just struck all the right chords for me. It definitely has a more mainstream feel than The Untouchables did and doesn't really feel like it has a heavy basis in reality but yet pays an homage to a type of film that apparently I really enjoy. So go in with the proper expectations of being simply entertained and Gangster Squad will fulfil your expectations again and again. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fast paced entertainment. It doesn't have the depth of Goodfellas and other classic Gangster movies but it doesn't need to. It is a formulaic entertainer with more action and clichés.Acting was good. Specially Josh Brolin and Sean Penn were really good. Cast was good except Emma Stone and Michael Pena. Pena's character seems unnecessarily added in the story. Dialogues were good at times but also funny at times. It has some funny scenes which i think are not ideal in a serious movie but i liked them. It has lots of repeated formulas. You may feel that you have already seen this many times throughout the movie. But in spite this, it entertains you.All in all, I think if you are not looking for classic Gangster crime drama, it is a very enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

The story was not totally perfect but it was very good and i really enjoyed watching it! One thing that does not affect the movie at all but that i liked was the movies length, the whole movie (excluding after texts) was approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes which is perfect for me who don't have that much spare time for movies, because nowadays movies usually runs for about 2 hours to 2 hours and 30 minutes or even an hour so that was good! The acting was good and not as bad as it can be these days. Some things just happens too fast but it is still okay and does not affect the movie much at all, so i can't really think of any reason to why you shouldn't watch this movie!Summary: WATCH IT!

		<fullReview>The story on which Gangster Squad relies on isn't the most original, far from it, but it does manage to interest, though hardly captivate, because we have seen much better in the same vein. But everything works pretty well, from the late 40's atmosphere that seems pretty well depicted, to the complementary cast with all the actors having their piece of the pie even with the multitude of characters, to the direction and photography to which a lot of attention has been paid.The real reproach that can be made to the movie is its absolute lack of subtlety. Everything seems a bit rough, such as some clichés scenes and dialogues. Moreover, there is a feeling that the scenario was supposed to last 3 hours but was squeezed into 1h45, inducing extremely brutal transitions and a not so fluid rhythm.As for the cinematography, though obviously thought-out, it sometimes offers strange choices (types of camera, CGI) and seems maybe a bit too flashy considering the time of the story.Despite everything, Gangster Squad gives a certain pleasure and it is already a good point for this movie that won't go down in history either with its overused thematic.</fullReview>

No boxing match in the park with the press taking pictures was involved.In 1961, Cohen was again convicted of tax evasion and sent to Alcatraz. The movie makes it seem like he went in 1949.On February 23, 1956, Jack Dragna died of a heart attack in L.A., he was not killed in 1949 by Cohen.Nobody named Grace Faraday ever testified against Cohen.I'm sure there is a lot more but I just don't care.

		<shortDescription>Mob-related entertainment... With some good performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 21st century, it is practically impossible to create a distinctive movie depicting pre and post II World War mafia-police confrontation - there have been tens of brilliant achievements entering the gold-pool of world cinema. Even the real characters have seen a lot of exploitation, e.g. Mickey Cohen was played in 3 good movies before Gangster Squad. True, in the era of digital effects you can create a more authentic background, on the other hand, all this is at the expense of character acting and profound relations between the characters. In the movie in question, there is bigger focus on shoots/explosions, emphasis on characters is rather brief. The ending is trivial as well.But the biggest shortcoming for me is the lack of strong antagonistic couple: Josh Brolin is not a bad actor, but he is still weaker than Sean Penn, thus no overwhelming tensions between them as leaders of opposite groups. Other good actors such as Giovanni Ribisi or Nick Nolte spend too little time on screen, female characters are uninviting to me. Nevertheless, Gangster Squad is not bad or boring, but in the event of choice, I would recommend e.g. Road To Perdition, Public Enemies or Lawless instead (all from 2000ies).</fullReview>

Cliché , no cliché , who cares . It was well worth the time spent watching it . So yeah a good 7. It does appeal to your emotions and makes you wonder about something in the end . Maybe its not really a deep though-out movie that leaves people wondering what exactly the movie was about ( like inception for instance ). Nevertheless it is thought provocative it its own way . Not every film these days has to be tragic . In fact its keeps in line with zombieland from Fleischer and Lieberman's own stories,and is a right mix of both. The fact that this happens in 1940's doesn't make it boorish, rather funny. So I enjoyed it and ask others to watch it and judge for themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is by no means a bad movie. The actors play very well, especially Penn, in the few scenes he gets, the era atmosphere is just right and, besides some ridiculously manly clichés, the script is good as well. It just doesn't have the right feel to it, though. The characters are far from being easy to empathise with and the plot is so straightforward as to not cause any excitement during the film.In a way, it is much like The Untouchables: stellar cast, a piece of American gangster history, an epic battle at the end, but The Untouchables had just more of everything: the characters, the music, the acting, the smarts. Watch that one and you will find it hard to be excited by Gangster Squad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I am on my death bed and the lights are starting to dim, I am going to think back to the 113 minutes I painstakingly wasted on this disgrace of a movie and beg for those two hours of my life back. Regardless of the outcome of my begging - if I make it up to heaven I am going to punch Ruben Fleischer in the face on my way to the gates and wrestle him down to hell so he can feel the pain he put me through for the worst 113 minutes of my life. Sean Penn is an incredible actor, Ryan Gosling pretty good, Josh Brolin could do himself a favor and get a new type of role, but also a very good actor -- typically. The only way this movie could have been as terrible as it was, falls on the hands of Ruben Fleischer. What about Zombieland made people say: "You know what? We're going to assemble an all-star cast and give the reins to this guy!"?There is something to be said about other terrible movies like Gigli ("rhymes with 'really'") or The Room. There is under-rated comedy in the sense that you can see that the actors are digging so deep, and think they are acting their way to an Oscar, all the while you are trying not to pee your pants from belly-laughing at them. Gangster Squad is terrible, yes, but unfortunately doesn't make this grade of terrible.Plot: cliché, predictable, has been done 10x before ? all of which are better.Acting: relatively poor for each of the actors, accents are terrible and distracting. Cast: Obviously A-listers, but miss-casted: Penn is awkward in this role, Stone is just a pretty redhead that doesn't seem like she would be the girlfriend of a gangster. Brolin is on par with Goldblum (uh uh uh) for always playing the same character and acting the exact same way!Special Effects: Laughable, seriously, laughable. (Great job on that opening scene - ha)Overall Feel: Film was rushed in all aspects, Boredom, Is it over yet? What am I doing tomorrow?The (current) high rating is heavily skewed by movie-viewers that are more accustomed to Bollywood. I apologize for those of you who are Bollywood fans, but a 6.8 is an insult to our human intelligence. Have self-respect and steer clear of this "film".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great nostalgic ode to the classic gangster movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is the first small highlight of the young year 2013. It's not that this movie has a truly surprising story line or adds anything new to the genre. The movie is in fact based on true events as many movies are these days and the good cops versus evil gangsters story is rather predictable.The strength of the movie lies in a well-crafted retro touch reminding the dirty forties of Los Angeles. The decorations, make-ups and settings are above standards and create an intriguing basis of this movie. In addition to this, the film mixes tension filled action scenes with dramatic moments that focus on a certain character development. The actors that convinced me most were Robert Patrick as grizzled old gunslinger with a dry sense of humour and Sean Penn in the role of a choleric and dangerous gangster boss who terrorizes not only a whole city but also his partners and his girlfriend. The movie is entertaining from the beginning to the end and offers a surprisingly brutal but also dramatic showdown. Don't expect a new "Once Upon A Time In America", "Scarface" or "The Godfather" but an entertaining and sometimes rather hard gangster movie with a nostalgic flair and convincing actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad crams as much action as it can on the idea of having a police task force that doesn't answer to the law so it can take down the bad guys. It's set in the 50s in Los Angeles, but that's almost secondary.Sean Penn play his top gangster role well, the only problem is that it's a stereotyped character, and quite boring. None of the cops are interesting except for Ryan Gosling's and that only marginally. If it wasn't for him and the beautiful Emma Stone, there wouldn't be anything interesting in this movie.The action is well built, the soundtrack interesting, but that's it. The story is at best a support for shootouts and the fist fights. The dialogs are unimaginative.You will be entertained, nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great gangster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>moviestoenjoy.wordpress.comPersonally, I didn't expect much of Gangster Squad, but the movie was a pleasant surprise. The film brought us a different approach than the latest gangster movies, which were about the personal life of the characters, by concentrating less on the characters and more on the story.Set in 1949, Gangster Squad is the true story of a secret police squad, assembled by Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), to bring down Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), who controlled the whole city of Los Angeles, and was expanding his operations all the way to Chicago.Director Ruben Fleischer and the producers did a job well done, giving us a movie full of action and violence, with a touch of the characters' emotions nonetheless. The cast is expertly put together, with the charming and dangerous Ryan Gosling, who aced his role as Sgt. Jerry Wooters, and the lovable Robert Patrick playing an expert gunslinger called Max Kennard. Even though Emma Stone wasn't perfect for her role, she held her own just fine. While the others did a good job, Sean Penn gives us a brilliant performance, nailing his role as an extremely dangerous and power lusting Mickey Cohen.Better than all the recent gangster movies (the past 3 years) , Gangster Squad is a must see movie, that can be enjoyed by a large audience. With a really decent storyline, a well crafted action, and a nicely assembled cast, the movie is entertaining, touching, and inspiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is up with that nose?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailers for this film excited me. I love the old gangster scene, back when a gangster was a man in a pin-striped suit, not trousers round his ankles and a gold chain. This film had real gangsters! It had the beautiful Ryan Gosling shooting guns! It had the very talented Emma Stone (acting talent, not nice-to-look-at talent!) It had potential to be an early runner for favourite film of the year for me.It failed completely and utterly. The story was predictable from the get go. An over zealous, war hero police detective gets recruited for an off the books, unofficial operation to drive LA's crime boss out of business and out of town. He assembles a motley crew of lovable misfits and screw-ups, and goes to war.One of the biggest let downs was the Stormtrooper Aim. The big shoot out at the end, and the car chase were just stupid. The men shooting automatic weapons at Gosling and co. were unable to hit a bean. Whereas the police officers shooting pistols from moving cars, at moving cars hit some vital shots. Just no. Another thing was the obvious final show-down between Sean Penn and Josh Brolin. Of course they resorted to fisticuffs. Brolin should have either just shot Penn, or made him handcuff himself and waited for back up. But no, he decided hand-to-hand combat with a boxer was a good idea. Had I been at home I would have been on my feet shouting at the TV.Don't even get me started on Sean Penn's nose. Every time he was on screen I was trying to figure out if that was his real nose, or a prosthetic. What the hell?There were no twists and turns. The police officers who you expected to die were the ones who die. The bad guys you expect to die, are the ones who die. I just couldn't take this film seriously. It took you straight from point A-B without making any unexpected stops, or suddenly throwing an F into the mix. The only reason my rating is not 3/10 is because I saw it for free, and Ryan Gosling had lots of screen time. If you are in two minds about seeing it, don't bother. If you have literally nothing better to do, then put it on, but make sure you have something as a back up plan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's like updating The Untouchables but not achieving the same great feat. Very entertaining though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One should despise "Gangster Squad" for simply being a recycled mobster flick converted with new techniques, introducing new faces to the genre. Old themes put inside a new package. Why I couldn't hate this? Well, because they made it decent, with notable qualities and most of us are real suckers for those kind of stories, we simply cannot not love them even with minor defects, wrong approaches and other problems.Seeing this was like seeing "The Untouchables" and since I know De Palma's film like the back of my hand, the only thing I could think was: it's the same film with changes in the story, set in another period and less quality. I'll expose a few changes. This is set in Los Angeles, 1949 and the villain is Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) instead of the 1930's Chicago dominated by Al Capone. Who'll stop the criminal activities by acting with the law's approval yet at the same time working on the same level as the criminals? A group of detectives and police officers led by Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), supported by the new Chief of police (Nick Nolte) who is committed to fight this battle whatever the costs. The team assembled is formed by Ryan Gosling, Anthony Mackie, Michael Pe?a, Giovanni Ribisi and Robert Patrick, they're the new untouchables who deal with Cohen and his wiseguys, some of them resembling the ugly faced characters from "Dick Tracy", Cohen himself seems to be one of those (I blame the awful 3 hour makeup they used on Penn, constantly shifting his face into strange facial expressions).Once again, it's about picking real characters and give them fictionalized actions in order to sell a story. It works sometimes but most of the time you react in complete disbelief because you know some of the things presented couldn't have happened in any way. It's not just that that gets in the way of "Gangster Squad" being a greater movie than it could be. With no question, the script offers potent doses of violent and thrilling moments, some spectacular sequences and a great casting working with those; but doesn't get much substance from the latter. Brolin is the one who deserves most praise for being the most dynamic of them all, playing a character we can't identify and enjoy. The majority of the cast goes OK, doing what they know best in clichéd roles. Never thought of saying this but Gosling and Penn were strange distractions, the first for being put on the backseat, the second for overreacting in a role that usually tends to bring plenty of qualities in projects like this. Ryan's an actor I truly enjoy but I felt his character was often distant, too hard to relate. The good quality he brings to the role is his voice work. Meanwhile Mr. Penn was really a bad copy of his Jimmy Markum except more extreme and far more violent but often ridiculous in scene. Too bad his great momentum in the film was a rip-off (never an homage, it was clearly stolen) from "Scarface" in the climatic final battle ("Here comes Santa Claus!"). If this was played like a serious crime drama ? la Leone or Scorsese it would've been a masterpiece but it sets for too much while giving too little or halfway in convincing us that it wants to be taken seriously. I liked the action, the empathy I had with the heroes cause but couldn't stand much of the bad guys purpose's and their ideals of dominating the city. They made it look like the good guys had plenty of goals to reach while the villains were up for almost nothing. That wasn't convincible, neither the romantic pairing of Emma Stone and Gosling. It's not they don't have chemistry (cause they do), it's more of a case of cheap dialog. So, a woman could fall for a guy over some small talk and good looks? A little doubtful. Such plot line should be taken out (although it reveals some importance towards the ending) and the focus on Brolin and wife relationship should be extended - but I won't forgive the cheap plot twist involving her after a shooting, the writers could think more instead of using such moment to create a poor moment of impact. Those who don't mind clichés, who like classy gangster flicks will enjoy it a lot more than those who prefer more intellectual and engrossing criminal pictures. This was a good work in a way, fun to watch but far from the expectations of being great, historical or to present new dimensions. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather disappointing..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is no thriller or drama - it's an action movie full of cliché comic-book like characters. The very lazy script could probably be summed up in less than ten sentences without actually missing much. It's like Dick Tracy (most of the characters, Penn's and Nolte's in particular, there's a lot of firing, but the good guys can't seem to be hit by bullets) with some elements reminiscent of L.A. Confidential (Brolin's and Gosling's characters are like Crowe and Pierce, Gosling's friend reminds of the Spacey's character), The Untouchables (choosing a squad of outcasts to fight corruption, Ribisi's character) and even Tombstone (the Patrick's character plus the whole Wild-West guns-blazing approach to crime-fighting). The only semi-depth is attempted with the Brolin's wife (convincing enough) and Ribisi's kid (barely used and unconvincing), but this is only hinted at since there's no time to do more anyway (and too many unnecessary/unused characters; e.g. Ribisi's, Pena's; or just plain ridiculous, like Mackey's and Patrick's). So, an over-generous 2/5 or "watchable", but just thanks to some of the actors and some style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Penn is very good as the gangster Mickey Cohen. In fact his acting is the best in the film. Most of the acting is pretty average. The chick in this flick is great eye candy. She's the one in The Help. In this one she is the gangster's moll.Just as I wanted an H&amp;K MP5 after watching Die Hard, you will want to own your very own Thompson submachine gun. I love that Hollywood uses more firepower than the 1st Infantry Division in WWII, yet lectures us on the evils of guns. If there is a sequel in a limp-wristed liberal world of gun control, the only gun anyone will be carrying is a short arm.The settings are good, the colors fine, and the cast multicultural. I guess they couldn't work in a South Asian, German, or some slavic character, but they have everyone else....black guy, hispanic guy, western guy, smart guy, handsome guy (Goslin) and the blunt force trauma guy.The Little Red-Headed Woman liked it though she prefers some sort of romcom over gun play. Well, she's a good wife anyway.Is it worth the money? Yes. Is it better than Django Uncypherable on all levels. It is just good dumb fun with car chases, explosions, hot chicky baby, macho gun play, and a strong moral message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your average "Gangster" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I am not a huge fan of "Gangster" films but Gangster Squad was a very pleasant surprise. The film is clearly aimed at a larger audience than most films of this genre due to the all- star cast that has been put in place. The overall feel of the film is far less grittier and far more "Hollywood" than most other films of this type. Although it must be said that it does not lack for the usual violence found in these films and it has it's fair share of gun fights and car chases.The cast is expertly put together to allow every member of the audience to relate to at least one of the characters. Josh Brolin plays the determined and serious Sergeant O' Mara who has devoted his life to cleansing L.A. of all corruption and crime. The character he portrays is very "Batmanesque" due to his seriousness and devotion to defeating the criminal underworld. Elsewhere Gosling and Stone rekindle their on- screen chemistry from Crazy, Stupid Love with Gosling playing the cocky younger hero and providing an injection of style while Stone plays the damsel in distress. Sean Penn's Mickey Cohen should, in my opinion, go down as one of the great gangster villains in film history as he plays the stereotypical psychotic gang-leader, giving the character a sophisticated image while expertly combining it with signs of his poor upbringing and insane nature.All in all the film is worth a watch as it softens the normally darker elements of this film genre with a touch of Hollywood Style. The twists and turns of the plot accompanied by the brilliant action scenes and high profile actors provide a watch that would appeal beyond the younger generation of violence loving males with elements that would appeal to fans of other genres as well. While not in the same league of greats such as Scarface and The Godfather films it provides a new twist on the genre and its a gangster film you could take your girlfriend to see. Simplified..... It's worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A noisier, bloodier, dirtier version of The Untouchables.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangster Squad doesn't do anything particularly new and doesn't really tell us anything we don't already know. Think of it as a dirty The Untouchables that is louder, bloodier, bolder, more extreme and limited in subtlety. That, specifically, doesn't make it a worse film, just a different approach. But, no, it isn't as good. If you want a sci-fi drama, watch Alien, but if you want a shoot-'em-up in space, opt for Aliens. It's much the same with this. Like Brian De Palma's 1987 classic, Gangster Squad is inspired by the true events, only this time the war against the Mob occurs in the Hollywood of 1949 rather than 19020s Chicago. The legal ways of dealing with such an ongoing challenge are fruitless because the Mob is bigger and stronger and most of the cops are bent anyway, so Sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) is tasked with gathering a small squad of undercover cops who don't mind breaking the law in order to uphold it. Naturally, Mafia kingpin, Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is less than pleased and throws all of his toys out of the pram.Gangster Squad rattles along in a fairly constant hail of gunfire with sufficient time to draw breath, reload, select a new target and recommence firing. In terms of entertainment, there are few complaints. It is liberally sprinkled with references to other Mob films, particularly The Untouchables and frequent shots of a staircase, but any hopes of a classic pram sequence (itself inspired by the Battleship Potemkin Odessa Steps scene, as one feels obliged to point out) are futile. There are plenty of slo-mo sequences, the most visually pleasing of which is a splintering ballet of gunfire, tinsel, shattered Christmas baubles and perforated bodies that is absolutely thrilling, but, as I said, entertainment isn't an issue here.Neither is performance. Sean Penn rarely lets down the side (we'll try not to talk about We're No Angels?) because, quite frankly, he's one of the finest actors walking around on earth at the moment. As Mickey, he's a monster you absolutely wouldn't cross if you value your life but even in such broad entertainment as this, he brings depth and reason to the actions of a man who is little more than a jumped up bully with bigger balls and more guns than his adversaries.Josh Brolin (in the Kevin Costner equivalent role) plays O'Mara as a dedicated and determined man of the law who finds no issue in justifying murder to achieve the ultimate goal. It's all about the bigger picture and the victims, whether they are family, colleagues or civilians are little more than collateral damage for O'Mara, but that doesn't mean it doesn't sting when plans go awry. It's just that the pain is related more to professional failure than human emotion.With a supporting cast that includes Nick Nolte, Emma Stone as the moll, Grace, and Ryan Gosling, as O'Mara's chief sidekick Jerry, the quality smears itself across the screen and Gangster Squad is always watchable. There's never a weak moment whether lead is hurtling through the air or sweet nothings are secretly being nibbled into an ear and director Ruben Fleischer has remembered his lessons from Zombieland and inserted just enough humour to keep the mayhem enjoyable rather than merely brutal. One senses he's enjoyed the process of making a gangster flick as he segues from a shocking head-splattering scene to a shot of a raw patty sizzling on a griddle and casually drops in quips like "I like shooting gangsters in the leg as much as the next man?" Fleischer's failing is that he doesn't bring anything new to the genre but resorts merely to upping the ante. In every situation he takes the dramatic option; why shoot when you can put down your guns and slug it out for a few more minutes of screen action? As O'Mara states, "We're not solving a case here. We're going to war." And we're going to do it in the bloodiest, noisiest way possible and subtlety be damned!For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Men on a Mission Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many gangster films do we have based circa 1950's Los Angeles, how many novels come to mind? Other than James Elroy's LA Quartet and his related novels and films, not a whole hell of a lot. Gangster Films inevitably revolve around New York and Chicago with a occasional nod to Las Vegas. Gangster Squad though isn't really a Gangster Film. I was reminded more of "The Dirty Dozen" than "The Godfather" "The Professionals" more than "Goodfellas" its structure is more in the vein of a "men on a mission" film. You may think then that it would be more akin to "The Untouchables" (1987) same premise but that film was a meandering moralizing bloated mess. It was actually more like what I remember of The Untouchables TV drama with Walter Winchell doing a voice-over, every episode about a raid on an illegal distillery or a brewery. Sean Penn plays Mickey Cohen as a downright scary over the top sociopath gang leader of LA's mob with a dedicated ex guerrilla trained GI Josh Brolin on his tail with a squad of hand picked off the book LAPD hard cases across a demographical spectrum. The rest of the cast are great, but most are underutilized, the film could have been a tad bit longer to flesh out the characters. Ryan Gosling (the womanizer), Robert Patrick (the Western gunslinger), Anthony Mackie (the ghetto, knife expert black cop), Giovanni Ribisi ( geek electronics expert), and Michael Pena ( Hispanic cop). More time also was needed with the Cohen gang. The movie is a time machine to LA of the 50's (even Carmen Mirada makes an appearance) beautiful to look at with a top notch production design. I'll have to pick up the DVD to see how many Gangster/Film Noir references I can spot. A guilty pleasure pastiche of a Classic Gangster/men on a mission/40's Pulp and unlike LA Confidential this one got the HATS right. 8/10</fullReview>

Until a group of cops led by John O' Mara(Josh Brolin) decide to work in secret, in hopes they'll take down all of Cohens operation, that they will slowly bring Cohen down, but will they pull it off? It's not as good as The Untouchables(1987) and L.A. Confidentional(1997), but it does not try to be. It's more of a guilty pleasure, up there with The Expendables(2010). Sean Penn is pretty good has Mickey Cohen, although I think they over did it in the makeup part. The rest of the cast don't disappoint either, Josh Brolin,Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Anothny Mackie, and Robert Patrick are all good. It has some good shoot out scenes, and some good chase scenes also. It's not a Oscar winner, and it's not trying to be.o</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that my pre-conception of this movie was that of a straight up crime drama with some action thrown in for good measure. What I got instead was a straight up no holds barred action movie that the drama aspect played very much second fiddle to. Was this a bad thing...of course not.The performances are top notch from everyone in this film, I really can't think of one actor in it I didn't like. The acting certainly isn't Oscar worthy either but this type of film doesn't require it to be. Sean Penn clearly had a ball playing Mickey Cohen and it shows as his performance was my personal favourite out of everyone. I actually missed him when he wasn't in a scene which is quite a feat since he's playing the bad guy.I feel like this movie wanted to have the sub-genre of Comedy but didn't want to lose it's credibility. As a result, the drama aspect didn't nearly have the amount of impact that it could've had. This is my only gripe however as I enjoyed this a great deal. It's not the best gangster flick I've ever seen but it definitely stands as a solid action movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stylist, Violent Romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of Zombieland and 30 Minutes or Less, Ruben Fleischer makes his first foray into serious filmmaking with his police and gangster movie Gangster Squad, delivering a highly violent and stylist flick that is tonally mixed.In 1949 the criminal underworld of Los Angeles has been taken over by an east coast gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), a man who made his way to the top by using violence and cruelty and maintains control by bribing the police, judges and politicians. But one police officer is not scared of Cohen, homicide detective, Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), an officer who single handily brings down Cohen's brothel operation. O'Mara is asked by LAPD Police Chief Bill Parker (Nick Nolte) to recruit of squad of police offices to run a clandestine operation and go to war with Cohen.Gangster Squad is very similar to 1987's The Untouchables. Both movies are loosely based on true stories and tells of a moral law enforcer who has to run a small team of officers to bring down a notorious gangster. But there are differences as well: Brolin character is much more willing to break the rules to do what he thinks is right and his character becomes more morally ambiguous than Kevin Costner's Eliot Ness and the cops in Gangster Squad are the harden rouges of the LAPD, not the incorruptible officers of The Untouchables.Another theme is the friendship between O'Mara and Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling); two cops with very differing personalities and viewpoints and go on two separate journeys. O'Mara is the moral cop who is willing to defy orders for what he thinks is right and slowly becomes colder and hardened when attempting to bring down O'Mara. While Wooters starts as a narcissistic character that ends up having something to live for, stating the squad needed more of a strategy and the two have a role reversal.There is a jarring style and tone to throughout the movie. Gangster Squad starts off very dark with a man being split in two and a woman nearly being raped which are later contrasted with comedy (which was well done) and flashy visuals. Flesicher seemed confused on whether he wanted make a grim police vs. gangster movie or a fun action romp. In the end he stayed in his comfort zone and used a lot of his visual tricks throughout the movie. Gangster Squad was very much like a Guy Ritchie gangster movie in its tone and look.The strongest aspect of Gangster Squad is the action sequences. There are plenty of violent shoot outs, an excellent car chase, fist fights and stylised montages. They are well crafted, well edited set pieces and Fleischer is very happy employing similar tricks that Zack Snyder employs, i.e. slo-mo and camera pans.One of the main reasons why people are interested in Gangster Squad is new writer Will Beall has been hired to write the Justice League movie. Sadly his story is safe and Gangster Squad is a new version of The Untouchables. The run up to the third act follows typical cop movie clichés we have all seen before and does nothing new. Some of the character very stock, Emma Stone had a thankless role as Cohen's girlfriend who starts a relationship with Wooters, while Anthony Mackie and Michael Pe?a were given one note characters with little for the actors to work with.Beall does attempt themes about Post War America, the rise of affluences and the question of why fight wars if there is nothing good to come back to. But when mixed with Flesicher's hyper-realistic direction, those ideas were not the greatest fit to go with that style.If you go into Gangster Squad expecting a Martin Scorsese style crime thriller you will be left disappointed, but as an action film it is an entertaining romp. But Flesicher does need to vary his style if he wants to be more than a one movie wonder.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com</fullReview>

If it was 100% fiction, would it be a good story? Nobody would watch it. Yet many will say all the embellishments from Hollywood are OK because it's entertainment. Yet the reason they are watching is because it's an account of a true story. Many people don't know the difference between a documentary and Hollywood movie, which distorts their view of the world.

		<fullReview>A lot of people and critics may disagree with what I am about to write about but first I think you should read a decent, non bias opinion of someone who has seen more then a hell of a lot of movies. Reading over critic and user reviews a lot of the feedback is similar and regurgitated because too many people on this site are easily influenced and arguably unaware of what they are writing. Now a lot have said a strong character build up was not made and they where very "one dimensional." Now in a way yes this is true but in all due respect, to that I say who cares? The story is very well written it gets straight to the point and if you don't know a lot about Mickey Cohen then yeah you will think he is one dimensional but people this guy was a real person, he was an amazingly interesting character in the Jewish Mafia phase during the war and post the war times. Sean Penn who I can say I am not a real fan of, blew me away! His dialog was good his acting was believable he really got into the shoes of the real Mickey Cohen. The movie is excellent I went to go see a full blown action gangster movie because God knows there hasn't been a good one in years and I was impressed. People saying Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's relationship didn't go into enough detail? To that I say THANK GOD! I am not here to see how a fake officer fell in love with someone I am here to watch how the Gangs did business and what went on behind close doors and that is exactly what I got. The relationship just added controversy I applaud Fiescher and the writers Lieberman and Beall for breaking away from the unnecessary cheesy love twist that action movies seem to have so often these days. Excellent movie, well portrayed by all and I was entertained. No one can say they where not entertained and a movie is nothing without entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of Strong Direction saved by Non-Stop Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the star power and budget to match, you would expect more bravado filmmaking. Many critics compare this film to "The Untouchables", a household favourite. One thing that stands out among many things in the Brian de Palma flick is the intense cinematography that doesn't blink. Instead, GS is stilted by a lack of strong emotion to the acting or editing. The cinematography and acting are just there, with Josh Brolin wasted in what should have been a shoe-in for his character.The biggest problem I see is that audiences these days are expecting a graphic novel approach to the look of a film like this. As for the story, all the envelopes need to be pushed in this age of extreme movie-making. The intricacies cooked up very well in the script are not given the kind of emotional arc that we all expect as we watch the clash of forces unfold. My guess is that they didn't want to push these cartoonish elements on the one hand, because this is "inspired by a true story", with some scenes trying to play it straight. On the other hand, we are definitely being presented a flick that keeps the guns a blazin', thus putting it's foot squarely in the Hollywood mainstream action genre. Yet the choreography that you expect along with a star powered shoot-em-up is very minimal. Yes, there are a couple slow motion sequences, and a couple CGI flying camera angles, but not enough to a degree that we get swept away in the sensationalism of it all (think your tightly cut Bond film, no dead spots allowed).So I agree with the criticisms that the film underperformed based on the potential of the material. There was a potential for pushing the noir elements, or the graphic novel look, or the script taking the audience down a surprising story path. Or the music being memorable. Between some punchy editing and a rousing score, this movie could have created the momentum that was clearly on paper. But even so, the lack of inspiration by Sean Penn as the gangster Mickey Cohen fails to incite fear or danger to our heroes. Again, tepid scenes that could have been given a twist or flair of bewilderment (aka wtf) could have livened things up (see L.A. Confidential). Scenes that really drag are the touchstone hero spending quality time with the vulnerable wife (make that extra vulnerably pregnant). Brolin is capable of being a living human being, and yet the scenes with his wife are dry and lifeless. Only during a montage where she helps to choose the recruits for the Gangster Squad does she show some life.Ryan Gosling seems to have been smart enough to inject his own charisma to liven up his character, and is the only role that works. There is enough going on behind his eyes that give depth to his character, and how he decides his place in the scheme of things. Emma Stone looks great in period dress and is certainly capable of acting her way out of a bag. Alas, the tension is not handled properly, and her resolution doesn't have the emotional tug that it could have.About every time I felt like I was merely watching a fairly predictable script go through the motions, an action scene would jump out and get your heart beating again. So if you need to get out of the house on a cold day in January, Gangster Squad will at least fulfill the action quotient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless gangster story in which the police are as bad as the gangsters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gangster Squad" (2013) is really a lousy movie because the story it tells is lousy. What I'll most remember about it is that the whole film looks brown. Hollywood sometimes likes to show the past as brown, especially in gangster movies. I'll remember the pregnant wife of Josh Brolin helping him to pick members of his squad. That was a nice touch. Also memorable is Sean Penn's portrayal, which is quite good although he sometimes speaks too low or garbles the words.Other than that, the story is pure fiction, very far from the truth of Mickey Cohen's life and death. There was a gangster squad and it used brains and intelligence primarily. Its head (O'Mara) fired his gun only once, his granddaughter relates. She says the shootouts in this film are outlandish and over the top. O'Mara didn't box with Cohen.All right, there is such a thing as art and artistic license, and movies are art. But what was intended by making this movie so ridiculous? What sort of point is being made? Is it that this excessive and illegal violence is the way to get the bad guys? Is the movie supposed to provide some sort of cathartic release for frustrated law and order types? To me the result is laughable, grotesque and childish. As art it doesn't even come close to some rather good Hollywood gangster movies of the past. Any fan can easily rattle off 20 or more of these good ones from every decade. Even the ones thought to be the worse ones are better than "Gangster Squad". For decent gangster stories, how about "Baby Face Nelson", "The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond", "Lepke", "Bonnie and Clyde", "Dillinger" (any version), "The Long Good Friday", "Mad Dog Coll", "Machine Gun McCain", "Lucky Luciano", "Villain", "Murder, Inc.", "A Bullet for Pretty Boy," and on and on?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm never puzzled by the regular outbreaks of gun violence in the United States. It's inevitable in a society that creates motion pictures such as this. It is insanely, shockingly, unrealistically violent and gory (The amazing thing is that everybody is such a bad shot. With the number of rounds fired, it's surprising that half the state of California wasn't killed. But then, that makes for more bang bang rat a tat tat. It's a very well done movie with a top notch cast.But the continuous, over the top violence destroys any pretensions the producers may have had about creating a memorable or significant movie. They have indulged in overkill in all respects. After being developed, motion picture film is rinsed in water to remove the chemicals. I would not be surprised to learn that the film stock in this film was washed in fresh blood! I lament the fact that such disturbing films are standard fare here in Canada. Our US dominated theatre industry imports them as a matter of course and the TV people are never far behind. They are both a symptom of and a contributing factor in the decline of the United States. Sadly they drag us down too.</fullReview>

As if you continuously knew what was gonna happen in the next scene. Had to shake my head. A fugly 2 stars out of 10."Mickey Cohen wasn't scary or intimidating at all, IMHO."-EveryoneHere are some lines to add to my summary of the movie. I'd like to watch a better movie next. How about you, Migu &amp; Roni? Should we watch something more like a broken hoover? U know? Something that doesn't SUCK. Hmm? Adios.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a classic of the genre but good-looking and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title leaves no doubt as to the genre here, but the squad is not one of gangsters but a special team of cops put together to combat them in the Los Angeles of 1949. Looszely based on some actual characters, the idea for an off-the-books team comes from police chief Parker in the form of Nick Nolte, now in his 70s and looking like a block of rough granite. Leader of the unorthodox crew is former war hero John O'Mara (the excellent square-jawed Josh Brolin) and his effective deputy is fresh-faced Jerry Wooters (the ever-cool Ryan Gosling who alone is a reason for viewing the film).They are out to bring down the brutally cruel Jewish 'Kosher Nostra' crime boss Mickey Cohen who is played so well by a heavily made-up Sean Penn that his performance is almost a caricature. All gangsters movies are overwhelmingly male-dominated, but there are two females roles - taken by Emma Stone as Cohen's squeeze and Mireille Enos as O'Mara pregnant wife - which are brief but strong."Gangster Squad" is not up there with "L.A. Confidential" or "The Untouchables" - both of which it owes much to - but it is immensely stylish and always entertaining. The main weakness is its total lack of subtlety: like O'Mara himself, it just charges through the front door all guns blazing and the characters, dialogue and plotting are all standard to the point of comic book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is a great movie with a clever storyline and a very talented cast.I really enjoyed Josh Brolin,Ryan Gosling,Giovanni Ribisi and especially Emma Stone,a very talented and attractive actress,she's gorgeous and does a great performance in this movie.The only performance I didn't enjoy was Sean Penn,his character was annoying and his acting was just uninspired,they could have made him much more intimidating,he just felt like a parody of a mob boss,even though he was suppose to be serious.Enjoyed this movie and I don't think it deserved all the negative reviews it got,I thought it was very refreshing,because gangster movies are rarely made lately,and fans of gangster films should enjoy Gangster Squad.John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) starts a crew called the 'gangster squad' who will not rest until they find and arrest Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I remember going to see this movie at the cinema as a bit of a gamble, though it looked entertaining and had an epic cast, I hadn't read or heard much about it. The gamble paid off, and I had a great time watching this film.The formula is simple, lashings of epic action sequences, Josh Brolin and beautiful art direction. The cast overall is great, and everyone gives a good performance. But Brolin is the don that takes this bad boy to the next level, he was large. Don't expect anything too much from this film, other than a rockin' good time, and you'll have a blast.8/10, would watch again! x</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gangster movie where Sean Penn is the bad guy, where they use Tommy guns and set unusually in L.A.? And it a 'based on a true story' idea? Why not. Not, this is no Goodfellas etc. It will never be a classic but it is a fun, enjoyable ride to be on. So what it is full of clichés? Most movies in this genre are. The sets are fantastic, the misc en scene creates the necessary moody atmosphere and there is even an elderly gunslinger from a different age. It is engaging, the characterisation is just as you would want it and the plot is predictable and exciting. Peer your eyes away from Penn's pointless and ridiculous prosthetic nose, and Ryan Gosling's usual pointless and ridiculous acting, and enjoy this movie for what it is -a gangster movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie, and I thought it was absolutely fantastic. Also, I disagree completely with everyone who hates this movie. The storyline, the cast, the script and design were all beyond excellent. Penn, Wolfe and Brolin--along with everybody else that starred in this beautiful movie--were among those of the cast that made this movie so memorable. I had never seen these guys in a movie before, but after this movie I found out just how incredible they really are. In conclusion, I strongly recommend that you see this movie; everyone who thinks that you shouldn't are completely wrong, with a capital W. My overall rating is a huge 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad was pushed back from its initial theatrical release due to the Aurora incident. Because there was a scene in the movie that was considered bad taste or at least was very sensible in nature to be shown in theaters. That scene can still be seen in the trailers that are out there on Youtube and elsewhere. And it might have made sense to push the movie, but I think they still could've left the movie untouched and not let a nut-case make that decision.Apart from that little side story, of which you might have been aware of (especially if you live in America), the movie does deal with a topic that is familiar to the movie going audience. That doesn't mean it's cliché. It doesn't mean it's the new LA Confidential either, but it's still a pretty good movie! Of course the cast had something to do with that. The names alone make it a must watch and almost nobody does disappoint in this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Untouchables 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood dishes out hundreds of movies each year with the intend of mindless, awe-inspiring entertainment. "Gangster Squad" fits this category appropriately. It is violent, ridiculous, full of clichés, and not to be taken too seriously. The plot itself is something we have seen over and over again: a group of incorruptible cops come together to take down a ruthless gangster. Sounds like Brian De Palma's "The Untouchables." That movie was also a bloody, inaccurate, fun crowd- pleaser, but it had something that "Gangster Squad" lacks, and that is great characters.Sure, Josh Brolin embodies the appearance and mind of a tough, take-no-prisoners cop, and Sean Penn as Mickey Cohen is intense and over the top, while holding some bursts of brilliance, but everyone else in this movie is blandly acted. The forced relationship developed between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's characters feels rushed and uninspiring-as if its soul intend was just for the purpose of having a romance story. Giovanni Ribisis, Michael Pena, Robert Patrick, and Anthony Mackie are not bad sidekicks of the gangster squad, but not enough dedication is given to them. The rest of the supporting cast falls into this shtick. "Gangster Squad" makes up for it with its grim cinematography, slowed down and sped up action sequences, and not to mention its nice set pieces and costumes. This movie is fun to watch for a first viewing and for that I give it a 7/10. If I see it again though, I probably would not be so inclined to score such a high rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the last good Gangster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The direction of a 1940s gangster flick has been greatly overused in the past few decades, and this movie still holds the mark of cliché as it tells the story of the up-and-comer against the horrific gang boss.On that, however, it pulls off the style quite well. The characters are very driven, and the storyline pulls you in. Any time you feel it's moving a bit too slowly, it pulls out another action scene to push you back to the edge of your seat.Im not a fan of these kinds of movies, so if you're in the same boat as me, then Gangster Squad makes for a good watch... just be ready to take in a bit of cheese, here and there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad in almost every way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Information is extremely easy to come by these days. Seemingly any fathomable topic can be typed into a search engine, and a world of information is unlocked. The biopic genre, that so often relied on myths and hearsay about its chosen topic, faced the reality that their 'artistic licence' would be stepped on, and audiences wanted something much more closer to fact. So, recent biopics, such as The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) and Lincoln (2012), brought the myth back down to Earth, showing us the human beneath the magazine serials and profiles. Director Ruben Fleischer has chosen to ignore this change in attitudes, and opted for a heavily stylised, operatically over-the-top portrayal of the downfall of Los Angeles kingpin Mickey Cohen with Gangster Squad, one of the biggest let-downs in recent memory.Mickey Cohen's (Sean Penn) choke-hold on Los Angeles is growing increasingly tighter, with the police force, judges, and politicians all backing him up. Seeing no legal method of capturing Cohen and his criminal empire, Chief Bill Parker (Nick Nolte) calls in no-nonsense police sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) to infiltrate and destroy Cohen's businesses. O'Mara quickly rounds up his tight crew, who he dubs the 'gangster squad', while O'Mara's friend and fellow police sergeant Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) woos Cohen's girlfriend Grace Faraday (Emma Stone). Using wire-tapping and some simple brutality, the squad start to break down Cohen's money-making schemes, until Cohen's starts to hit back in force, waging war in the city he wants complete control of.While obviously heavily elaborating on 'fact', Gangster Squad's story is undeniably luring. Set amongst possibly the most corrupt and out-of- control era in America's history and against a backdrop Hollywood razzle-dazzle, it's amazing just how dull the film is. I would estimate about 95% of the film is complete bull-s**t, which I could live with, but it's the way it goes about it's bull-s**t that makes the film such, well, bull-s**t. This is a film that tries to capture the 50's noir cool of the era, with sharp suits and cool hats, but there's only so many Gosling poses or look-how-cool-this-car-is moments that I can take. If it spent a little less try trying to be cool, and more time getting to the grit of the story then it may have worked a little better. But this doesn't capture the style of the era like L.A. Confidential (1997) did, it's all forced, hat-tilted-to one side, cigarette-hanging-loosely-out- the-mouth, forced cool.For such a stellar cast, only Sean Penn manages to tune in a performance. As ridiculous as his prosthetics are and as outlandish as his performance is, he seems to be the only one really trying. Don't expect any depth, Penn's Cohen is a simple thug who will kill you if you fail him, and you would find more complex villains in early James Bond movies. Brolin and Gosling, two of the most interesting actors to emerge in the last ten or so years, barely register, failing to breathe any kind of life into their archetypal roles. But it is Emma Stone that suffers the most, serving no purpose other than to be the helpless damsel-in-distress and to give Gosling a reason to take his shirt off. In fact, you could label every one of the Gangster Squad as a familiar archetype you would think we'd moved away from. Brolin is The No- Nonsense Leader, Gosling is The Handsome One, Harris (Anthony Mackie) is The Black One, Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi) is The Nerdy One, Kennard (Robert Patrick) is The Veteran, and Ramirez (Michael Pena) is The Rookie.I mean come on, this is 2013, can't we expect a little bit more from our mainstream films? It's just one cliché after another, including a little boy friendly with Wooters who gets killed by one of Cohen's men, convincing Wooters to join the squad. It even features a scene where a character throws his badge into the sea. At the point where Cohen opens fire on the squad and shouts 'here comes Santa Clause!', I gave up all hope. Apart from the cinematography, and Penn's energetic performance, I would have nothing good at all to say about this film. Maybe Fleischer should stick to comedy, as his previous movie Zombieland (2009), I actually really enjoyed. But if you want a more powerful, honest and dramatic depiction of Mickey Cohen, check out the first five minutes of L.A. Confidential instead.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good v Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a bleak movie, reminding us of an era when corruption in public office was rife, and the mafia ruled the roost.That is until a straight talking square-jawed cop (Sgt John O'Mara played by Josh Brolin) is given the opportunity to "clean up the town" and is ready, willing and able to do so.As always Sean Penn immerses himself in the character of Micky Cohen, a tough and ruthless "Godfather" seeking to dominate illicit activity throughout the USA's west coast with a combination of bribery and thuggery.There is little in this movie that hasn't been seen before, but at the same time it provides riveting viewing as the cops deploy some unconventional tactics to disrupt the gangsters' cash-flow, and the tension builds between the two sides.Increasingly the stage is set for a showdown between the tenacious O'Mara and the arrogant Cohen, and when it comes it produces an almost archetypal fight between good and evil.As well as Josh Brolin and Sean Penn there is a sterling supporting cast including Ryan Gosling, as a seemingly ambivalent cop - but driven to action through his attraction to the gangster's moll (Patty, played by Austin Highsmith). Nick Nolte puts in an almost cameo appearance as Chief Parker.If nothing else this movie reminds us that if it were not for the sacrifices made by real life cops similar to the characters portrayed here, who stood up to a pervading evil in the face of great personal danger (to themselves and their families), the world today would be a much scarier place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangsta Squad is today's The Untouchables... yeah I don't think so. Seeing Sean Penn acting like a gangster portraying Mickey Cohen is quite the entertainer ,but feels like it shouldn't have been him playing it. It did seem like he tried to hard trying to bring this character and well.. it just didn't work out. Another thing is that, Emma Stone was practically pointless having no use for the film, another eye candy to look at. Overall, the members of the gangster squad are quite bad-ass tearing down the places of Mickey Cohen's empire! For some what, the acting was a little dull. The action scene could have been much better expect for the ending which was awesome. I would say watch this movie loud if you like loud gunfire and things getting torn to pieces. If you don't care for the acting and want to watch decent action scenes, then this movie is the way to go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Movie has that Cool look of saturated Technicolor or the Four Color Wonder of the Primary in Comics, especially the post Super-Hero Wave of the infamous E.C. Line. Even the title would have made for a great Comic Book. Some of that Underworld violence was so "terrible" that the do gooders persuaded a "Comics Code" that brought all that to a creativity stifling halt.What does all that have to do with this Film and Cinema in general. Well, that is exactly what this is. A "Comic-Book" Movie. So comparisons to the Pulp Magazines and Paperbacks of the Hard-Boiled School is not fair. There is nothing here that is that. The Dialog is written like it was intended for the 10 centers not the 25 centers.So the Art, the Script, and the display are all Low-Brow dressed up in High Period Style. Nothing and No-One is real or believable, everything is over the top, telegraphed, and mindless. Literary wit is replaced with dumbed-down ditties of delightfully vacuous patter, "you know the drill".This is not to be taken seriously like its betters. It is trashy fun and throw away junk-food for a Fast-Food-Film-Fix. It is meant to be enjoyed as much as an artificially flavored snack. So just don't expect anything of substance. It's a "Guilty" pleasure, so pleaded.</fullReview>

The only question in your mind should be, "is it better than the others?"The answer is, "Yes!", although in truth the others include some excellent wares.... let's call it first equal.Penn's acting and presence is just so damned awesome. Brolin is well Brolin; this can get a bit much in large doses but most will like him here for what he does best; square jawed gritty resolve, devil may care, vengeance type stuff.... and then as ever, there is the squad, who are a pretty cool take on what (according to formula) must be a smart, steely but quirky bunch of misfits.

		<shortDescription>Bloody good gangster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As mobster movies go, the first five minutes of this one should set this off as one of the best I've seen in my movie-loving years. A stylish monologue is where we meet our main characters, and as Sean Penn beats a punch bag and looks thuggishly into the camera we hear Josh Brolin recount his days in the war and the plight of the good man against the bad. All of this within the first three minutes, but the real action begins as we witness the brutish criminals led by Italian-American- accented Penn tear a guy in half as he's chained between two vehicles. With this he declares 'Mickey Cohen owns Los Angeles now', and boy can you not help but believe him. That is, of course, until John O'Mara (Brolin), the vigilante reluctant-hero of the piece enters the story and we see the damage he can do, when so inclined. This involves beating senseless a couple of scumbag criminals and sticking another's hand between the floor and the elevator shaft ? cue horrible scream and a 'this-shit-just-got-real' moment. Suddenly the audience is left wondering if Mickey Cohen does own Los Angeles, or if the real fight has just begun? (which, considering it's a nearly-two-hour-long film, is a fairly good assumption to make)?As Cohen's influence over Los Angeles grows and seeps into law officials who love their "whores" just a little too much, O'Mara, with the prodding of the chief of the LAPD who tells him rather inspiringly that he "want to talk about the war for the soul of Los Angeles", takes it upon himself to bring together a rag-tag team of vigilantes whose sole aim is to drive Cohen out of LA before he can "own the West" through the central book, which controls all western gambling and puts Cohen in a pretty sweet position both in terms of money, prestige, and position on the law vs. criminals scale. All of this happens against the backdrop of personal relationships, which play a big part in the characters decisions and motivations ? namely that of Brolin and his heavily pregnant wife, as well as Gosling and Stone, whose on-screen chemistry just oozes sex-appeal.If you would like to read the rest of my thoughts on this movie then go to this site (filmrambler.blogspot.co.uk)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have to preface this by saying that I am not really a large fan of gangster movies, at least the recent ones ie. Public enemies and movies like it. However this was a very different tale with great performances all around. I have to say that Josh Brolin has hit another one out of the park. His performance made the movie what it was. Emma Stoe Delivered a great performance and so did Ryan Gosling, but what really surprised me was the great chemistry that shone through throughout the film among all the actors. Sean Penn shone through as a bad guy the likes of which there has been a while since has been in my book. His demeanor in this film really allows the viewer to hate him along with the protagonist. All in all I would like to say that the great cast, the great storyline as well as a great execution brings this film up to a level way beyond what you would believe of it. The grade of 9 I gave because it was an unexpected gem, and not necessarily because it measures up to other films with such a rating. Most of all this movie is an enjoyable watch throughout. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all the 'creative interpretations' of facts in and around the final days of Mickey Cohen, GANGSTER SQUAD proves to be a surprisingly entertaining evocation of post WW II Los Angeles - right down to the very clever use of posters and billboards used during the artistic running of the final credits! This movie captures Los Angeles better than most and in that setting it creates a credible story with a fine cast that, apart from the gore of dismembering a body attached to two opposing cars and a lot of bullets and killings, makes a case for the idea of a group of rogue cops bringing Mickey Cohen down.In 949 Los Angeles gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) has moved in, with the intention of controlling all criminal activity in the city as well as an eye on the entire West Coast: his dream is to rid the crime world of the Chicago mobs' move to take over big crime in LA. He has bought local judges and police, and no one is willing to cross him or testify against him. Everyone except Sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), a former World War II soldier, whose goal is to settle with his family in a peaceful Los Angeles. Police Chief William Parker (Nick Nolte) decides to form a special unit whose mission is to take down Cohen, and chooses O'Mara to lead the unit. O'Mara, with the help of his pregnant wife (Mireille Enos) chooses 4 cops (Anthony Mackie, Robert Patrick, Michael Pe?a, Giovanni Ribisi) and asks another cop and vet, pretty boy Jerry Wooters, to join him but Wooters is not interested: he incidentally is dating Cohen's current girlfriend (Emma Stone). But when he witnesses the murder of a young boy by Cohen's people, he joins them, and they decide to take apart Cohen's organization. Cohen wonders if a rival is going after him, but eventually he realizes it's the cops. The manner in which the dance between Cohen's henchmen and the gangster squad plays out is full of surprises and twist and turns and makes for solid entertainment. Based on a book by the same name by Paul Lieberman, adapted for the screen by Will Beall, and directed with skill by Ruben Fleischer, GANGSTER SQUAD may not be very close to the truth but is still is a fine movie diversion.

		<shortDescription>Essentially an action movie, not a mob drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Los Angeles and gangsters. Before "Gangster Squad," the first film that ought to come to mind is "L.A. Confidential." For Ruben Fleischer's latest, that creates an outrageous comparison point. The "Zombieland" and "30 Minutes or Less" director was probably not aiming that high. Even if he weren't, he's still not even aiming to add a prestigious entry to the gangster film canon. "Gangster Squad" is instead one of if not the only history-based gangster movie that just wants to be an action flick.Okay, so maybe not just an action flick, but considering the slick characters, numerous gun fights, explosions, etc. and sharp-tongued dialogue, no questioning entertainment is the goal. Considering we're used to mob dramas that have high aspirations and a disproportionate amount of these films have won great acclaim, a number of audiences are likely to find something a bit off.The first reason is the historical context. Jewish gangster Mickey Cohen has settled in Los Angeles in hopes of establishes his criminal network and owning the city. Police Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) wants to break his grip before it takes complete hold, so he recruits Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) to put together a team that will operate outside the department and the sight of the law to bring Cohen down.O'Mara assembles his team in classic (albeit formulaic) cinematic fashion, with men who each have various specialties from the sharpshooter (Robert Patrick) to the tech geek (or the '40s version of a tech geek) played by Giovanni Ribisi. Among the last of the men to be convinced is Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling), a womanizer who seduces Grace (Emma Stone), Cohen's etiquette coach and play thing. Together, they plot ways to hit Cohen where it will sting most.If the team-assembling sequences don't tip you off as to the movie's super squad action flick qualities, Cohen's sinister ways of torturing and killing the men who screw up and the ubiquitous actions scenes will. Even if the events depicted in the film were all true, they definitely didn't look this pretty in real life.Fleischer's glory-shot style with big action payoffs simply wars with everything we've come to expect from the genre. Strike that?mob dramas have had among film's greatest payoffs, but with a jaw-dropping realism that shakes you deep down. As terrific as "Gangster Squad" plays late '40s dress-up, it does so with the intent of glorifying both the era as well as organized crime and law enforcement. If you like your movies slick, "Gangster Squad" will fail to disappoint you as you might be lead to believe it will, but if you prefer something that gets its hands dirty and doesn't care much for looks (more of a Sly Stallone type gangster film), you won't find it here. There's a reason Ryan Gosling and Josh Brolin are the heroes here.Honestly, I applaud Fleischer's choice to focus on the glitz; after all, this is set in Los Angeles and Cohen had over-the-top aspirations. The script's choice to be more of a fast-talking action film was probably not as necessary. Regardless, going into "Gangster Squad" anticipating an action film done in '40s costumes will greatly improve its entertainment level.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<fullReview>Having read a good deal of Gangster Squad's discussions here on IMDb as well as elsewhere around the web, I have noticed that quite a lot of people have a misconception about the film and say that it didn't live up to their expectations. Somehow after seeing the trailer and finding out that the film is set in the 1940s and tells about police officers' fight against Mickey Cohen, a substantial amount of audience members (especially some sophisticated cinephiles) automatically started thinking that it had to be a noir/gangster film masterpiece of the same quality level as, for example, The Untouchables or Scorsese's and Coppola's works. And these very cinephiles started bashing the film even before seeing it just because of its director Ruben Fleischer who had only made two comedies. But Gangster Squad never actually had to be a masterpiece. Just the fact that a film is set in some particular time period and tells about some particular events doesn't mean that it has to be on the same shelf and even compete with genre icons. So if you don't expect Gangster Squad to be something it isn't (and doesn't really want to be) you'll get a nice genre flick, light and unnecessary yet professionally made.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangster Squad was a really good movie. The cast is fantastic and they all deliver flawlessly. Josh Brolin and Sean Penn counter one another perfectly and the supporting cast of Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Anthony Mackie, and so many more all fill key roles. The plot and characters were both developed really well also. There were a few plot holes that can be explained through assumptions but pretty weak ones. That and some of the action sequences, especially early on, is what held the film back. Ultimately I think that's the cause for the lower ratings. I don't think a lot of these "experts" actually watch entire films if they don't like how they start and this movie starts slowly. Once it gets going though, it's a really enjoyable film. And it has freaking Emma Stone in a little red dress, that should be enough reason to watch. In all seriousness though, it's a solid movie that most people were probably enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad was a bit underrated in my opinion. Sure the plot follows the standard cop drama template and has cookie cutter characters (the "squad" members can pretty much be summed up in one word: the leader, the cowboy, the smart guy, etc.), but the setting was unique (we rarely see a mob movie set outside of Chicago or New York), the casting was spot-on, and the action scenes were fluid. There was even a few nice touches of comedy without being overly wacky. Above all its not something I would watch everyday but its a good movie to sit down to at the end of the week when your tired and don't want to analyze every scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LA looks like a bunch of people machine-gunning each other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ruben Fleischer's "Gangster Squad" works if you don't take it seriously. There was some controversy about it due to what was perceived as an endorsement of police brutality. I wouldn't say that the movie endorses that, just since the whole thing seems like a big joke. This look at the LAPD's efforts to bring down mob boss Mickey Cohen makes it look as though LA in 1949 was a bunch of people shooting each other to hell. Seriously, the movie comes across as a comical version of "Scarface". The cast members do a good job in their roles, particularly Sean Penn as Cohen. It's an enjoyable movie if you accept it as nice, brainless entertainment instead of a drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster Squad is truly an enjoyable film and I just happen to love it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an absolute sucker for films of the crime genre. Movies such as The Godfather, Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction and so on have a spot on my top 20 films and from the trailers, I felt that this film was perhaps trying hard to be something miraculous like The Godfather turned out to be from the way it was shot. I was unsure whether I really wanted to see this film because I really didn't want to have to take in a bad film as my first film of 2013.Gangster Squad revolves around the story of a group of cops under the leadership of John O'Mara who have been sent undercover to solve the crime that goes around in the city and to finally, eliminate the powerful Mickey Cohen. It was definitely an interesting plot and the story kept me interested the entire way through. There was something rather special with this film whether it be the characters or simply the great action sequences in the film to go alongside some beautifully shot scenes that closely resemble that of the 1972 masterpiece, The Godfather.Sean Penn is the highlight of the film, playing the antagonist, Mickey Cohen who is truly a fantastic villain. His character is immediately one to hate and so, the director has already achieved one important goal with the film. The cops in the film are interesting. Jerry is truly a likable character as he is most like us and Ryan Gosling is truly great in this role. Then there's John O'Mara, played by Josh Brolin who is a true standout but by the far, the best of the good guys is Kennard, played by the T-1000, Robert Patrick. This guy was the badass of the film and in some ways, reminds me of The Man with No Name, played by Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone's iconic Dollars trilogy.Mickey Cohen is quite an interesting character, to be fair. Despite his goals being nothing special, because they have been done by far better crime films, he is truly intense in this film. The words he says in the film truly have intensity and a certain vibe to them. What really adds further enjoyment to the film, for myself, is the great action at the end of the film and how satisfying everything turns out to be. The special effects in the film are truly great, there are several great moments, especially some great dialogue in the film and makes for a rather enjoyable experience.Early on, I may have thought that sitting down and watching Gangster Squad maybe something I regret, but as time went by, I was truly glad to have seen the film which was evident by my big smile. Gangster Squad is an intense and enjoyable film with great characters and a good and entertaining story and makes for a great popcorn flick that should be checked by all fans of crime films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loosely based on the story of Los Angeles Police Department officers &amp; detectives attempts to gun-down then mob-king Mickey Cohen, 'Gangster Squad' is A Passable Entertainer, that offers some pumping action. And Sean Penn is Marvelous as Mickey Cohen!'Gangster Squad' Synopsis: Los Angeles, 1949: A secret crew of police officers led by two determined sergeants work together in an effort to take down the ruthless mob king Mickey Cohen who runs the city.'Gangster Squad' works till it lasts. This isn't a significant film, but the pumping action deserves a mention, as it stands out. Will Beall's Adapted Screenplay is fairly engaging, but isn't power-packed. Ruben Fleischer's Direction is glossy. Cinematography, Editing &amp; Art Design, are so-so.Performance-Wise: As mentioned twice before, Sean Penn's portrayal of Mickey Cohen is rocking. The 2-Time Academy-Award-Winning Actor delivers a performance that defines power &amp; fear! Josh Brolin is perfect, while Ryan Gosling is only improving with every film. Emma Stone lacks the sex appeal this character demands. Giovanni Ribisi, Anthony Mackie, Michael Pe?a &amp; Robert Patrick are alright. Nick Nolte is decent in a bit role.On the whole, 'Gangster Squad' has some merits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is loosely based upon true events. Gangster boss Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) runs the city of Los Angeles, CA and he thinks a rival gang is trying to take him down. Wrong. Police Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) has had enough of Cohen and he authorizes Detective Sgt John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) to form what is now called a Gangster Squad to take Cohen down. The Gangster Squad has one rule: leave the badges at home. Here's the thing: Hollywood knows you heard about: Capone, Bugsy Siegel, Meyer Lansky, Frank Nitty, Baby Face Nelson, Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, but you don't know much or anything about Mickey Cohen. Until now. I thought DJANGO was brutal in places, but this one has it's moments too. Whew!You cannot help notice that the settings, and photography give the illusion of a great movie about to be seen as the sets and photography are spectacular. The scenes in the night club made it seem like we intruded on a real night club. There are big stars in here and you get your popcorn and settle in. Then you notice the dialogues aren't too good (some humor may have helped), and you get the feeling that no one is committed to the script, which is also suspect (and that may be the reason for non-committals); O'Mara's Gangster Squad doesn't do any planning to bust up Cohen's operations ( even Sgt Jerry (Ryan Gosling) makes mention that they act like a bull in a China Shop); and still no one can hit anything with a machine gun from 10-feet away as it seems to take about 100-rounds to fell one bad guy. The chemistry between Jerry and Grace (Emma Stone) Cohen's latest squeeze is not convincing. The shootings overwhelmed everything as they went on for too long. To have big stars uttering weak lines is not the way to go as this sinks everything. But, to be fair, Sean Penn overcame the weak dialogue and was very good, as usual. Nick Nolte as Chief Parker was good in a limited role. No CGI was incorporated and maybe that could have helped too, ah?. maybe not. To be honest what kept this going for me was the photography which I cannot praise highly enough. It was like you are there and almost had that 3-D effect. Kudos. I hate to admit this, but I stayed because of the photography. The rest was watchable. Other notables in here: Robert Patrick, Michael Pena (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Casey's Movie Mania: GANGSTER SQUAD (2013)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GANGSTER SQUAD has the hallmark of a classic 1940s period gangster drama, but the movie is nothing more than a hollow genre exercise.The next Brian De Palma's THE UNTOUCHABLES (1987)? Well, it seems that ZOMBIELAND director Ruben Fleischer is trying to ape that modern gangster classic. From the outlook, GANGSTER SQUAD looks promising enough. It boosts with a fine cast (e.g. Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling and Sean Penn), slick art direction and costume design, and plenty of exciting gunfights. However, the movie is strangely uninvolving and everything in GANGSTER SQUAD is just a glossy surface with no depth.http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2013/04/gangster-squad-2013.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2013 is far from over but I think it's safe to say that Gangster Squad won't make any major "top best movies of this year" list. In spite of having an already established director (Ruben Fleischer, who directed Zombieland) and an amazing cast (Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin, Sean Penn, Emma Stone &amp; Nick Nolte ? just to name a few), Gangster Squad was a rather average movie that wasn't very well received by the audiences nor the critics. It also did kind of poorly on the box office. So what exactly went wrong with this gangster flick loosely based on true events? The movie has a pretty standard setting and structure. In 1949 Los Angeles is completely run by the ruthless gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) and no one dares to take a stand against him. Growing desperate because of this situation, the chief of police (Nick Nolte) orders Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) to start a guerrilla war against Cohen and his mob. O'Mara gathers a band of other police officers willing to make a change in their corrupted city ? the most prominent being Cpt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling). Not only does this movie's plot remind of Brian de Palma's 'The Untouchables', but Gangster Squad goes an extra mile by ripping off a shootout scene from the aforementioned de Palma classic. One of the movie's problems is that it follows too many characters who are often left undeveloped. The most developed and most interesting is surely Sean Penn's character, Mickey Cohen. He's also the best actor in the whole movie.Speaking of actors and their abilities, the best aspect of Gangster Squad is its cast ? not the acting, but the cast. This movie combines some pretty big names in the movie industry, but the final acting result is somewhat underwhelming. No one shines and everyone, save for Sean Penn, is quite forgettable; especially the young Ryan Gosling who exploded in 2011 with hits like 'Drive', 'The Ides of March' and 'Crazy, Stupid, Love'. Gosling has always been a versatile actor (for example, in The Believer he plays a Jewish Nazi and in Lars and the Real Girl a socially inept young man) but in this flick he shows a boringly bland performance. Another young star, Emma Stone (who also had a role in 'Crazy, Stupid, Love'), is likewise unconvincing in her quasi femme fatale role. Furthermore, the frequently cheesy dialogue only draws more attention to the plain performances in the movie.As I said, the plot is very standard for this kind of flicks but, unfortunately, that isn't much of a redeeming quality - Gangster Squad is fairly predictable, with lots of clichés and even some plot holes here and there. But the movie really starts falling apart during its action sequences. Most notably during one car chase scene which is confusingly conceived and due to this is a complete mess (the audience can't tell who is in which car and who is chasing who). The other action scenes pass off as avoidably pretentious, since Ruben Fleischer decided to make some strange directing choices (pausing the action whenever a bullet is shot in one scene, unnecessarily bullet time in another scene). As a consequence of its bizarre directing, bland performances and predictable story, Gangster Squad is nothing more than a violent gangster flick that will, no doubt, be forgotten in a couple of months; since the only memorable thing about it is that it wasted an almost perfect cast.Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as i thought it would be but still a Decent film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can safely say i liked Gangster Squad and i thought Sean Penn was good as the bad guy Micky Cohen. Sean Penn plays an Evil Gangster character in the film and there were a few scenes where i found him to be quite sinister. i thought the film had some good Action scenes that were well edited.Now I have to Admit this film lacks substance and character development and it also lacks a story and we don't know much about any of the characters which is what makes it so hard to care about any of them,after all if you don't know anything about people how can you relate to them?. Josh Brolin was cool in this film but i have to admit that his character was written quite poorly and there didn't seem to be much depth to him or to any of his crew. Like many films this film has a few problems and it is a little slow in some points,so if people are looking for a film that is Action packed from beginning to end this film is not it,you do get Action but you don't get it all the way through,you get some descent Action scenes once in a while then a bit of suspense and then some more Action later on. you get some good car chases in my opinion, and the lead guy Josh Brolin kicks allot of Ass in this film!.so if anyone is a fan of Josh Brolin they would probably like this film because the guy beats up allot of Gangsters in this film. I don't really know the actor but i thought he did okay in the film and he was a cool Leader and i liked his determination to bring down Micky Cohen.I liked how he never gave up and kept fighting to the very end to bring him down. I also liked Ryan Gosling in the film i thought he was A bad ass and his character was allot tougher than he looked. there was a cool scene in the movie where these two guys were pestering him and his girlfriend and Ryan just goes crazy and knocks them out!. that was a pretty cool scene in my opinion and i thought Ryans acting was good.Most of the cast was fine in their acting,i didn't really see bad acting from anyone although i will admit that Sean Penn was a bit over the top in some of his scenes when he was going psycho and beating people up.there was this one scene when Sean Penn comes out of his hotel and gets his gun out then he says here comes SANTY CLAUSE! and he starts shooting everyone like a maniac!. that scene made me crack up Laughing! i thought that was Hilarious!. I don't know whether that scene was intended to be funny or not but it sure made me laugh!.he was way over the top in that scene!. Even though he was over the top i still liked that scene i thought you had a pretty solid shoot out between Sean Penn and his men and Josh Brolin and all of his men.All in all this film is not great but it is an okay film and quite entertaining,you get some Decent Action some decent car chases, and some decent fights.the directing was a little poor but i thought the Action scenes were nicely done and well edited. there was a very cool scene at the end of the film where we get to see Sean Penn and Josh Brolin fight each other one on one!.I thought the fight was quite good! and it looked very realistic and it got very nasty and intense and bloody which is probably why i liked it!. This film is basically just a fun time waster.if you go to watch this film expecting it to be Amazing you will be disappointed.people should just enjoy this film for what it is,some mindless entertainment.In my opinion its a fun way to kill some time,the film is okay and it least worth a watch.</fullReview>

But, nice to see him with a bit more talk than in 'No Country for Old Men'. And, yes - he was in Goonies! And 'No', his hair has not changed since! Good cast, excellent 20's style. The whole look of the film was exciting. Had a similar feel to Ocean's Eleven when Josh Brolin was choosing his 'team' of characters to take on Sean Penn. But, cannot be compared to that film really. There was not much character development. I felt the film was mainly strong on how it 'looked'. Couple of good fight scenes. You saw a glimpse of Ryan Gosling's furious inner anger that he can play so well during the acid scene which was exciting and i must admit i don't think i've ever seen a good Sean Penn film so i must say he was excellent in this. He was crossed between the Joker and Robert De Niro. Josh Brolin is good to watch. Bit sick of Giovanni Ribisi popping up as an 'awkward character'. Ryan Gosling has effortless acting. Definitely an entertaining film, but - please, don't expect anything great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 2013 now, and cinema industry isn't in good form, as i see it. (for many reasons). Studios don't want to spend their money for experiments, they want profit. And that's why, in this particular case, we have standard script, good actors, kinda good techniques of shooting and etc. So can these 113 minutes be interesting? My answer is yes, indeed. You will enjoy movie if you like gangster movies at all - those car chases, gunplays, wordsplays, simple plans, bad guys, good guys. If you like to watch famous actors - you will see pretty good ensemble cast here. Actually, this film is full of clichés, but it's very hard to do something brand new on this old territory. I don't want to defend it's predictability, but this movie provides exactly what trailers promised and a little more (i mean some little details - references to other movies, good shots, few jokes). Maybe it could be great with other script and tone of the story, but we have what we have, and if you'll miss this one, you'll probably lose not that much, but something. Oh, and last thing, almost missed it: it's 7 because i like actors and didn't expect anything good when i came to cinema.</fullReview>

I went in to the cinema with an open mind, ignoring the trailer making it look like another Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone get together movie. The acting was half-assed in some parts but excellent in others, the script was alright but had a tendency to go in to the cheesy, the slow motion camera effects were cool but pointless. My biggest gripe with this film is that there was nothing innovative Despite all this the movie was fun and I was never bored. The parts that were good, were very good but then the part that were bad were rather bad. (Spoiler, sort of) Then of course Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone end up together.

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is the semi true account of the rise to power of notorious gangster Mickey Cohen and the off the books police squad put together to take him down. The films leads are Josh Brolin and Sean Penn and the fast rising star Ryan Gosling.Josh Brolin is solid as Sgt John O"Mara while Ryan Gosling was a bit flat as the smooth ladies man Officer Jerry Wooters. Sean Penn who is always brilliant gives a spirited performance as Mickey Cohen. One my even say there is a tinge of over acting on Penn's part but it is not his fault. The rest of the characters are so flat and surface level that Sean Penn's character seems like the only one with a pulse. I will say that Giovanni Ribisi was excellent in his role as the wire tap man Conway Keeler. It was a reserved performance and a change from his usual maniacal antagonist role. For the most part the film is just surface level with plenty of good action and tough guy lines at the right moment but you never really feel deeply either way for the good guys or bad guy. The films photography is phenomenal from Oscar winning DP Dion Beebe.( Miami Vice) Over all it is a popcorn film but don't expect to be wowed. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad isn't the best gangster movie, but definitely not the worst. Gangster Squad is just a fun, shoot em up movie that you go and see it with your friends. The directing for Gangster Squad I felt like it was kind of the strong parts in the movie. Ruben Fleischer did a pretty good job with it. Although the tone switches from serious to comedic, I felt the parts that were serious were very serious and the comedic parts were funny. For the acting, everyone did there job good. Josh Brolin, the sergeant in charge of the squad, played his part good and Ryan Gosling, the young cop also part of the squad, was one of my favorites of the movie. My other favorites were Anthony Mackie and Giovanni Rabsi. Mackie played a black cop which was the fist to be recruited in the squad and Rabsi plays a very smart family man. Also Robert Clark and Michael Pena are the remaining members of the squad. Clark plays the sharpshooter and a father figure to Pena while Pena plays the young hot-headed cop. And Sean Penn plays Mickey Cohen, the gangster who is taking over L.A. part by part. He is a scene-stealer with a switching accent and a violent nature. Emma Stone plays Gosling's girlfriend and Cohen's girl. She wasn't bad at all but I felt she was a weak link in the acting I felt, with Nick Nolte as the mayor. It maybe because they are not in that many scenes. Enough with the acting, the action scenes were really cool and fun to watch. For instance a car chase happens and that was one of my favorite scenes. The writing wasn't anything special for one of these gangster movies. But anyways if you're looking for something to hold you off until A Good Day To Die Hard or Dead Man Down, I would suggest this. It's not a mindless action film, but its a good film to go and see with your friends and eat a bucket of popcorn. I give this a B+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhere in Between "The Untouchables" and "Dick Tracy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you can surmise with their classy-looking poster, this was one very stylish, glossy gangster movie. With such as stellar cast that it had, you are bound to expect a lot out of it. This may be why many people were disappointed by it. The great potential was there, but this movie never really rises to the level of other classic gangster films which obviously influence it.The film was set in the late 1940s, when gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) ruled the Los Angeles underworld. The chief of police (Nick Nolte) secretly assigns good cop Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) to assemble a team of dedicated cops who would combat the Cohen gang vigilante-style. When you watch "Gangster Squad," you will notice that it is like a patchwork of scenes "inspired" by its predecessors. Off the bat, you will recognize films like "LA Confidential," "The Untouchables," "Dick Tracy," and "The Dark Knight." This film lies somewhere between the serious intentions of the first two, and the cartoonish nature of the latter two. The production design was excellent in re-creating 40s LA with its Hollywood glam and its seedy underbelly. The photography was slick with its bright palette of colors and lighting effects. The camera angles and blocking were purposeful to make the members of the "Gangster Squad" look extra "cool" when they walk away together or shoot guns together.Instead of taking matters very seriously, the execution of the film by Fleischer was more tongue-in-cheek. The main antagonist, Cohen, was portrayed by Sean Penn in a most exaggeratedly over-the-top manner -- a caricature of a mad and violent mob boss. Penn was made to say the darnedest things like "You know the drill?" and there was an actual drill there, or "Here comes Santy Clause!" in a hotel lobby Christmas shootout, while sounding like the bad guy in "Home Alone".I did like the members of the Gangster Squad though. Josh Brolin was again the deadly serious cop much like his Tommy Lee Jones persona in MiB3. He does better in scenes with his wife Connie (Mireille Enos). Ryan Gosling also fit the bill as the lover-boy of the squad, as he becomes involved with the requisite beautiful damsel-in-distress Grace (Emma Stone). X-Philes like me welcome the appearance of former X-Files cast members Robert Patrick and Giovanni Ribisi in memorable supporting roles as members of O'Mara's Squad. All I can say is, contain your high expectations, and you will enjoy this film. The genuine classic Hollywood atmosphere and the high-octane hand gun, shot gun and machine gun action are all there! It is a shallow, cheesy film so do not expect deep pathos and emotion. It does not take itself too seriously, so you are not expected to as well. Enjoy it as you see it. It won't have any deeper meanings to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I reached a point while watching this film, a point where, like some victim of a particularly brutal interrogation, I had to separate the mind from the body. I had to send the mind to a tropical island while my body languished in the movie theater. I reached this point when, about, oh, 20 minutes or so into the movie, I realized it was bad and likely to get worse. Did I expect more from the director of Zombieland and the writer of Lethal Weapon 5? Did I think they could take the vivid, excellent source material and from it craft an entertaining and memorable Noir, ripped from Los Angeles' &amp; the LAPD's oft-shady history? I guess I must have. I ignored the fact that comedy cutie Emma Stone is supposed to be a hotsy- totsy gangster's moll, and the fact that baby-faced pretty-boy Gosling is supposed to be a hardened , cynical cop crawling the dirty back alleys of the city. I hung my hat on Sean Penn, who might as well be a pre-programmed hologram of Penn as generic period gangster -- whole lotta shouting and a vague accent tossed in to make it look as if he earned the paycheck. My guess, post-viewing - is that Fleischer was drawn to the material because he could, like, have a lot of gunfire and trendy actors du jour in old-timey clothing. Story-shmory. He didn't want to complicate things by, like, developing an understanding of the genre and/or dramatic storytelling. Roget Ebert sums it up best by suggesting you rent Christian Slater's Mobsters if you're hungry for shallow, faux Noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed Gangster Squad, it looks very good, has some nice acting talent in there with no characters I could say in any way were bad and it held my attention mostly. Had some great one liners and humour and plenty of action alongside the slick looking sets with great music and a vibrant colourful LA backdrop.I couldn't help making comparisons to the untouchables in my head while watching it and The Untouchables it certainly is not. The story line is kind of comic book and although there are some emotion turns from the indisputably good acting talent these looked quite out of place in retrospect. TGS suffers from predictability, the story is by the numbers and in restrospect whilst the best is tried within the style of the film the characters (and again I reiterate the cast did well) are essentially quite 2 dimensional. So fun popcorn Gangster flick it is with some laugh out loud moments for me, the kind where every Baddie has terrible aim. The Untouchables it is not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Los Angeles, 1949. Ruthless, Brooklyn-born mob king Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) runs the show in this town, reaping the ill-gotten gains from the drugs, the guns, the prostitutes and?if he has his way?every wire bet placed west of Chicago. And he does it all with the protection of not only his own paid goons, but also the police and the politicians who are under his control. It's enough to intimidate even the bravest, street- hardened cop?except, perhaps, for the small, secret crew of LAPD outsiders led by Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) and Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling), who come together to try to tear Cohen's world apart.One of the rare occasions where a film looks as slick as it's trailer does. Just a shame the story had no real substance to it. Otherwise Gangster Squad would've been the first film I've seen this year to find it's way in my top 20 shortlist. I was hoping something along the same lines as Michael Mann's Public Enemies. But all I got was half that and a bit of Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy. That's not to say I didn't have a good time with Gangster Squad. The action set pieces are very impressive and Ruben Fleischer, who's most notable for directing Zombieland, does well to keep the camera focused on the action. Mind you, there was at times these bullet timed type gunplay sequences, which I felt almost hindered my enjoyment of the action. The use of a digital camera used to film some set pieces is also very evident.Performances are all solid. Brolin leads his troops well as the war veteran leader of the Gangster Squad. Ryan Gosling continues to impress and has great chemistry with Emma Stone, who also plays a good damsel in distress. Also it was great to see that Michael Pena, Giovanni Ribisi, Anthony Mackie and Robert Patrick had more than two lines to say in the movie. All four are brilliant character actors who do well in their respective roles.Where Gangster Squad fails? The story isn't much, neither is the script, but it rolls at just the right pace. Sean Penn (with prosthetic nose) makes a decent bad guy, but his character at times would ramble incoherently, which I found annoying.Gangster Squad isn't the most memorable of gangster crime movies, but it excels with the action on display. And again credit to Fleischer for directing action good enough to keep me entertained. It's worthy of the release and also worthy of a Lovefilm or Netflix rental night with a bag of popcorn. See it if you have the time.I'm off to play L.A Noire.ticket-for-one.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good time, maybe not such a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being new to the movie reviewing business, I will keep this short and sweet. If you're looking for a fun movie, with good action, and a somewhat interesting plot, Gangster Squad is your movie. However, corny lines, weak supporting actors, and ridiculously caked-on make-up (Sean Penn) make Gangster Squad the mediocre film that it is. I was entertained, but not blown away. There were some very awkward and cheesy "mobster" one-liners from Penn. Brolin did a good job and it was nice to see him in a different role than we saw in MIB 3. Gosling is was very quite and soft spoken. I'd say pay matinée price for this fun time. Don't waste your 10.50 though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's no "L.A. Confidential" It's more shoot em' up blood and fist fights L.A.!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest take on the L.A. underworld of criminals of the 1940's is straight and simple it's a shoot up of blood and murder your typical 40's film of good guy facing the bad guy. Unlike the champion "L.A. Confidential" which was complex a mystery and thrill of corruption, scandal, and a plot twist, "The Gangster Squad" is all about blood and violence with guns and car chases in the city of angels. Set in 1949 Los Angeles the days in which Mickey Cohen(Sean Penn in a fearsome role)ruled the town with gambling, payoffs and bribes all while having a house of whores. Ready and determined are two up and coming L.A. cops in the veteran Sgt. O' Mara(Josh Brolin)and young stud Sgt. Jerry Wooters(Ryan Gosling). To add some spice and sizzle along the way is the performance of Emma Stone as the classic 40's sex symbol with red hair and lipstick it's interesting as she gets to go to bed with both the good guy(Wooters) and bad guy(Cohen)! Overall this film is a nice little treat with the cops fighting their own way and style to bring down the bad guys. It's a flash like and glamour look at 40's L.A. a film with style but little substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There it was, the big climax near the end. BORING. You know what I'm waiting for? For Sean Penn to star in a romance film, with himself. Seriously. It seems that every movie he does is just one big self love film. "Look at me, I'm Sean Penn. I'm great." Now wrinkle your face in deep emotion. I remember they did that on Sesame St.OK, enough about Penn. Let's get back into this movie. Yuck. In my opinion, it should have been an animation. Really. Because this was such a comic book style flick. Everything was predictable. Everything.I honestly don't know who gave this thing such high marks. Maybe all the voters were from Venezuela.But on the flip side, if you love Sean Penn, jumping up and down, flapping his arms and wrinkling his face, then maybe this movie is for you and you'll enjoy it. Or maybe not, it is quite violent.But for you gore fans, it's just so predictable. You won't even enjoy it. There were some "quality kills" for you Chow Yun Fat fans. For me, I was expecting more of a story, deeper plot, a little intrigue. This film delivered none of that.Oh well. I've said enough.Godfather, Miller's Crossing, Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, Unforgiven, True Romance, The Matrix, just to name a few.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster Squad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Los Angeles, late 1940s. Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) reigns as the gangster king, a rule of terror and corruption that the police force have put up with for too long. Sgt John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) is assigned a mission that Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) hopes will end Cohen once and for all: they will create the Gangster Squad...What director Ruben Fleischer did for horror in Zombieland and the heist movie in 30 Seconds Or Less he tries to do with gangster films in Gangster Squad. When the title "Inspired By True Events" flashes up on the screen at the start one couldn't help but remember another classic gangster film based on true events, The Untouchables. That had Robert DeNero playing Al Capone, another real life gangster, just as this film does; sadly, it made me really want to watch The Untouchables, and towards the end, LA Confidential.That is not to say the film is bad at all, but it is very much a case of style over substance. It's the kind of gangster film you'd show to someone watching their very first one. It has all the bare essentials: crooked cops, honest joes, stereotypical bad guys and a sexy dame to boot (Emma Stone, doing her best to play a Gilda type smoker but just not given enough screen time to create a decent chemistry). These bare essentials are just not given enough time to breathe and develop. You want to learn more about the characters because they are interesting - particularly Robert Patrick's ageing gunslinger-type cop and his relationship with Michael Pena's fan.Brolin growls nicely but is overshadowed by the underplaying of Mireille Enos as his long suffering wife. Ryan Gosling also underacts superbly, giving a cool drifter vibe to the film that never takes over the picture. For full scene chewing, Sean Penn nails it as Cohen - his is a berserk character, dangerous and quiet, perhaps every so slightly insane. It's a wonderful interpretation, though again perhaps a little two dimensional.The film looks fabulous, and this is where the true triumphs of the film lie. The scenery, the costumes (from Stone's gorgeous dresses to the men's suits), they all add together to create that period of the turning point in the 1940s. However, it's clear that quite a lot was done via computer, again one trick that you cannot accuse LA Confidential of.The theme of war filters through the story; these gentlemen are all fighters, survivors of the Second World War, adrift in a city that has changed from ideal paradise to frightening hell. This is a world where Land is still on the Hollywood sign - things have to change. Cohen cannot be killed simply because his empire would still exist. These guys aren't fighting Nazis anymore; these are their own flesh and blood, and previously safe families and friends are now threatened. It's a nice touch but again you want it to go deeper into this war like theme.Not a great film, but a decent starting point nonetheless.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid January Flick, But Far From Being Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Say hello to Santy Claus!!" Probably the worst line you will ever hear Sean Penn utter in any film he is in. And, sadly, it happened in "Gangster Squad." Gangster Squad isn't a bad film. It was very enjoyable on many levels, and kept me entertained for a good two hours. I thought the cast was perfect. Josh Brolin is a good actor and I am starting to become a fan of Ryan Gosling's gangster/thriller movies. I saw him in "Drive" and thought he did a good job in that as well as in "The Ides of March." Nick Nolte does a good job, though he isn't in it very much. I like the gritty setting and it kinda reminded me of the video game "LA Noire."BUT... there are things I did not like about the movie.1. Too much action. It seemed like almost every scene was action filled. There was a little bit of a layoff on the action after the beginning, but after that, it just seemed non stop and didn't really make the movie better. 2. Too cliché, just like any other movie at this time of year.3. Nick Nolte... 2 scenes. WTF???4. Emma Stone. Kinda unnecessary in this. 5. The script coulda been better. Why hire a rookie writer to write a script with as many good actors like this, and have it be mediocre or decent at best? This is the same guy who will be writing the Justice League movie, and that makes me a little worried.But overall, a solid, decent January flick that kept me entertained for two hours. Just don't expect anything Oscar worthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm getting a little annoyed with all the film snobs who are, well, snobs. This is a movie of a certain genre, and it does a very fine job of being that kind of movie! It is what it is, and it ain't what it's not. It's a gangster shoot-em-up B-movie, except with big-budget production values and cast. I like depressing, serious art-house fare as much as the next intellectual with an MFA (which, yes, I have) but I've also learned to appreciate formula flicks like this. It's not story- intensive because it isn't supposed to be. It actually has better acting and character development than I was expecting, and the production design, cinematography, and editing are all quite good; even excellent. Heck, it's worth it just for the sake of seeing Sean Penn as an over-the- top evil mob boss. I would say that it's worth seeing in an actual theater, but it'll make good DVD material too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lavish, silver tongued, and blood filled depiction of a shoot-em-up style outfit of loose-cannon cops determined to dismantle a merciless mob boss in post-war Los Angeles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right off the bat, I really can't stress how incredible this movie looks. From the frame rate to the gel in Ryan Gosling's hair, it's one of the best looking films you'll see to date. Now that that's out of the way, let's get to the review of this guns-blazing, over-the top, and extremely fashionable flick that is Gangster Squad. There's nothing I appreciate more than a film that balances witty dialogue with a particular amount of bloodthirsty and downright ruthless violence. For the most part, this is where this movie shines. Josh Brolin delivers as the intended hard-boiled Sgt. O'mara, who is operating under the raspy, washed up chief of police played by Nick Nolte. The whole plan is for O'mara to put together a (get ready) "squad" of cops who all specialize in different skills necessary to take down the ferocious, all powerful big- nosed mob boss Mickey Cohen, superbly played by Sean Penn. The plan is far fetched, considering Mickey controls the better part of Los Angeles and the corrupted LAPD. The squad consists of Jerry Wooters, the womanizing fellow cop and friend of O'mara's, played brilliantly by Ryan Gosling, as well as other fellow cops Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie), Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena), Max Kennard (Sullivan Stapleton), and the brainy, tech savvy Conwell Keeler well-executed by Giovanni Ribisi (you might know him as the guy who kidnaps Ted in ahem, "Ted").The dialogue this movie consists of is more than satisfactory, notably Ryan Gosling's subtle and seductive exchanges towards his dashing squeeze Grace Faraday, notably underplayed by Emma Stone. Also notable is Sean Penn's intimidating and memorable scenes in which he whack's his own associates and isn't afriad to make a bloody example out of people who are unlucky enough to cross him. I mean, Jesus, one of the very first scenes involves him having a man literally pulled in half just for botching a job he was suppose to carry out. Penn is really not someone to f*** with in this movie (except when he cries "here comes Santee Clause!" during a shootout which followed with a drawn out groan and shaking of the head by yours truly). Nonetheless, he is what gives Gangster Squad the violent, cringe-worthy qualities it's meant to have. While the film delivers sleek, bullet ridden actions scenes you'd very much expect, it really isn't anything new. You have the overused slow- motion tommy gun sequences with bullet shells bouncing off the concrete and cars blowing up with civilians in the crossfire. We get that. Much of that is a given in a movie like this that isn't trying to be anything else other than just that, an outrageous but satisfying action movie.Like many films of the genre, towards the end the writer starts to throw in the towel in the category of endings. I felt the latter part of the story was rushed, and the plot suffered with holes starting to appear as the squad's master plan went to fiascoland. Not to spoil anything, but some very significant events pertaining to some main characters come out of nowhere and don't really make sense as to how or why they happen. These include Brolin and some minor characters making decisions less logical than driving a smart car into head on traffic. Still, these sudden bouts of character stupidity aren't really anything new to us.Gangster Squad was pretty well worth my time and kept me entertained as all hell. It is exceptionally casted, and despite other reviews, there wasn't any other movie at 7:45 this evening that was showing that I would rather have spent my money on. This movie can be complacent at times in its excessive and violent demeanor, but does not attempt to be a deep, meaningful, Oscar-winning gangster flick. You get what you see. What I saw was to my overall liking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster Squad: A Beautiful, But Forgettable Crime Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mob/Crime films have always been one of Hollywood's greatest sub-genres. Some of the greatest films of all time are mob/crime films: The Godfather Trilogy, Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino, the list goes on. However, every once and a while we get a film that tries really hard to fit in with the big boys. Gangster Squad is one of those films, and it pains me to say that it is and will remain one of the most disappointing films of 2013. Gangster Squad is a crime film loosely, and I do emphasize "loosely" based on the events coinciding with the fall of famous crime lord Mickey Cohen, the man who headed to Los Angeles, and attempted to carve a mighty criminal empire out of the American west. That's about all Gangster Squad manages to get right, because everything else about this film's story is fabricated in order to create a thrilling, slick, action film. Now, that's okay, because many mob films have changed the facts, case in point; Public Enemies (2010) had John Dillinger die last, when in actuality, he was killed before Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson were. Here's the thing though; Public Enemies was a great mob film that had a good story, well-written characters, and solid direction, along with great fight scenes. Gangster Squad is a film that copies other classic mob films in structure, has one-dimensional characters, and focuses more on the action than a good story.The plot focuses on a 1949 Los Angeles, where Mickey Cohen (an overacting, make-up laden Sean Penn) is taking power and preparing to create a new criminal empire that doesn't have to rely on Chicago anymore. Cohen has the cops, the judges, and the witnesses all in his pocket, because if they don't support him, he kills them. LAPD Chief Bill Parker (grizzled veteran Nick Nolte) decides to have an undercover squad of cops form up in order to bring down Cohen's empire. Sgt. John O'Hara (a fantastic Josh Brolin), forms the Gangster Squad, consisting of himself, the womanizing Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling continues his streak of excellent performances), the old veteran Max Kennard (T-1000 Robert Patrick), the knife-throwing Colman Harris (a solid Anthony Mackie), the tech-savy Conway Keeler (Giovani Ribisi), and the rookie Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena redoing his End of Watch performance).Now all of these actors are good, but with the exception of Brolin and Gosling, the squad has nothing to do other than standing around and shooting things. It feels like at least 20 minutes of film was left on the editing room floor, because I really wanted to know the squad better, but I never did. Instead the squad forms up, and begins bringing down Cohen's empire in an action montage, albeit a very well made one. Emma Stone continues to impress by playing Grace, a beautiful girl who falls in love with Jerry, but is pretty much owned by Cohen. It's nice to see Stone and Gosling together on screen again; their on-screen chemistry is great, and it's one of the only subplots that gets any attention. Now I was willing to forgive this film for its faults thanks to the action scenes, but unfortunately, even they got repetitive. The final gunfight was a bore, and the film used WAY too much slow-motion. I don't need to see a Christmas ornament explode in slow motion, thank you. The final fight scene straight-up rips off Lethal Weapon! It's obvious that director Ruben Fleischer is inexperienced making mob films because all he's ever made are action comedies Zombieland and 30 Minutes or Less. He knows how to craft great action scenes, but he can't seem to get story or character development right yet. I think Fleischer should just go back to directing comedies, because it's clear that his lack of experience hurt this film as a whole, and if he makes another film like this one, then his career will not last much longer.Overall, this is a really beautifully crafted, but extremely disappointing film action film that sacrificed story and character development for explosions and people dying by the dozens. The set design is incredible, the music is great, and the action was for the most part great, but when the story can't match the effects, and can't give it's characters anything to do other than run around and shoot guns, then the movie as a whole is a failure, and for a film that had a lot going for it, that makes it all the more disappointing.Final Verdict: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is one of those films that just gets better and better as it progresses. The film is an action packed twist of crime set in the 1950's. The film is based on the Los Angeles Police Department forming a group of officers known as the "Gangster Squad" who's job was to keep L.A free from the corrupt and dirty life of Mickey Cohen. When watching the film, i felt like there was some huge similarities between Gangster Squad and Public Enemies. However i didn't feel that Gangster Squad was a "rip off" of the film because they were both as thrilling as each other.In other reviews, people complain about the amount of violence involved with the film. However for me, the more violence; the better the film. However i did believe that the film suffered with some undeveloped characters and relationships.Overall i believe Gangster Squad was a thrilling and enjoyable film, and would recommend it to others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Exactly The Untouchables</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was hyped up as the gangster film for a new generation. Well, I don't know about that. The film is based in 1949 Los Angeles where Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is looking to take over the entire west coast with drugs, gambling, prostitution, you name it. Everyone in the city appears to be afraid of him and he has many government officials under his thumb. In order to rectify the situation, Chief Bill Parker (Nick Nolte) has decided to put together a gang of covert police officers to handle the situation. At this point, the film is pretty much like any other gangster film. There are no surprises and plays out pretty much as expected. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) is enlisted to head up the band of fed up cops who are tired of having to bend to Mickey's demands. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) reluctantly joins the group and becomes enchanted with Grace Faraday (Emma Stone). The relationship between these two is not covered as well as it should have been. They meet, have sex and are seemingly in a committed relationship (just like that). Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie) is taken from his job as the cop in the "hood" to stop drug usage at the source. Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi) is the electrical genius whose responsibility it is to find out as much information as possible in relation to upcoming criminal activity. Max Kennard (Robert Patrick) is the sharp shooter of the group and thinks he is stuck in the old west. Rounding out this group is Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena) who is Max's partner (only because no one else wanted to work with a Hispanic) who injects himself into the group without being asked. I think that the entire cast did an excellent job and the realism of the time period was well done. This film is nowhere near at the level of Scarface, the Godfather or Good Fellows and if this is a film made for this generation, then they obviously have not seen the aforementioned films. The one thing that struck me funny is that in a lot of the shoot out scenes at relatively close range with automatic weapons, it is a long time before any one gets shot. I'm thinking that someone needs more practice with a gun. There were a couple of times that I had to turn away, but for the most part it was no big deal. I give this film and amber light.</fullReview>

Josh Brolin is a role model and top notch in his performance. . The only downside is some way too cheesy lines, a couple fight scenes are zoomed in too closely and Ryan Gosling's voice work sounded like a prepubescent teenager besides those three things it's a nearly perfect film reminiscent of Dick Tracy-esque villains.

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad doesn't beat around the bush. And that's what's so good about it. We don't waste ten minutes while John O'Mara decides whether or not to take the chief up on his offer. We don't spend half the movie hearing his wife whine about not wanting him to do what's been asked of him. And we don't spend an hour and a half waiting for the love story to evolve into what we all know it will right from the start. These, among many other examples, are what is so refreshing about Gangster Squad.The movie is set in 1949, and centers around a 'Gangster Squad' led by Josh Brolin trying to bring down the criminal establishment in Los Angeles led by mob king Mickey Cohen. They are effectively given a free license to do whatever is necessary to achieve the required outcome. Sound fun? It is. The movie never takes itself too seriously (it is after all called Gangster Squad). The action is fast paced, you'll never find yourself checking your watch, and the story never slows down. It knows it doesn't have time to waste, because a movie like this can't get away with being three hours long and still fall under the guidelines of 'not taking itself too seriously.' Don't get me wrong though it has some hard-hitting moments and some very violent scenes.The acting was brilliant across the board. Josh Brolin for me stole the show. He had just the right mixture of intensity and likability. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were their usual charismatic selves and Giovanni Ribisi was as excellent as ever. Sean Penn also really impressed for me. His make-up job, while a touch distracting, was effectively done and his performance suited it. Maybe not quite reaching the iconic status of the likes of Al Pacino in a similar role, he still turned in a very memorable performance.Gangster Squad is worth every cent the price of admission. It isn't pretentious, slow, dull or just trying to win awards. It's designed to entertain you and nothing more. And during awards season especially, that is incredibly refreshing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Los Angeles, 1941: Mickey Cohen is taking the town street by street, now a group of 5 cops are what could hopefully bring the city back to freedom. This small band of cops by day and vigilantes by night include; Sargent John O'Mara, Sargent Jerry Wooters, Officer Navidad Ramirez, Officer Max Kennard, and Officer Conway Keeler. After seeing the trailer (the one reedited after the Aurora Massacre), I knew that this was a must see! The cast was phenomenal, the writing was great, and the direction was spot on! Another element that aided the movie; it evolved. Nowadays, movies tell situations, this told a story, a story that didn't have a main objective, it had objectives, it was something more of process of elimination. It holds up to the reputation of the movies from the 40's - 50's, many homages were scattered through out, and if you're an old soul, you'll really get a kick out of this movie. This is a definite 9/10, a movie that was this well written, has to go up one on the movie rating scale for me!</fullReview>

How is it possible that a movie of almost a 100 million budget can look this ugly? My point is that Gangster Squad is a boring, noisy, overly violent and repulsive film in every way. During the film I wanted to spit on the silver screen, and I would have if there hadn't been people sitting on the lower rows.I had great expectations towards this film. It's a crime film. It has a cast that includes Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Nick Nolte, Emma Stone, Anthony Mackie, Michael Pe?a and Sean Penn. And it has lots of violence. This description may sound dumb, but sometimes turns out to be very entertaining. But not this time. Gangster Squad is a waste of money and time for filmmakers and as well as audiences.The film is set in LA of 1949. Gangster Mickey Cohen is about to take control of the city. Police chief Bill Parker orders Sgt. John O'Mara, one of the few honest cops, to form a team to wage a war against Cohen. This team is a bunch of scurvy caricatures: there's a ladies man named Jerry Wooter, a tough guy Coleman Harris, a little nerdy technician and the necessary "brain" of the squad Connwell Keeler, a master shot Max Kennard and his loyal apprentice Navidad Ramirez. Once the team is together, they beat up and shoot people, blow up some cars, listen Cohen's chores through police radio and then have some fun.I guess Gangster Squad is supposed to be some kind of tribute to old crime-classics, but those classics weren't as disjointed and badly written as this. First problem is the characters. They are totally undeveloped and don't have an ounce of depth. O'Mara is a careless tough cop and the rest of them are what I already said. Penn's Cohen is just evil, nothing more, and Stone's Grace Faraday just an ornament. The characters don't progress in any way and you don't feel anything towards them.The movie's amount of violence is highly excessive, but it can be entertaining if the film is an intentional parody, like Sylvester Stallone's latest Rambo. Gangster Squad doesn't know what it wants to be. The laughably poor dialogue is just parody, but sometimes the movie tries to be a serious tearjerker-drama and sometimes an over-the-top action flick. And as usual, the nature and effects of violence are a completely unknown concept. The members of the squad are supposed to be good, honest men with wives and sons, but meanwhile they're also unstoppable killing machines who kick other people's ribs to mush, shoot them in legs, listen to them screaming, then go to a beer and back home to hug their beloved as if nothing had happened. The action sequences look cheap and are badly shot, and slow-motion doesn't make them any more enjoyable. And the soundtrack sounds like a cheap replica of Hans Zimmer.The performances of the actors are so mediocre it gets annoying. But then, what can the actors do with roles as thin as these? Brolin, who was terrific in films like No Country For Old Men and Milk, doesn't even try in the role of O'Mara. Ryan Gosling is an obvious choice for a role of a ladies man, but he's nowhere near as good as in his earlier films. He and Stone had some nice chemistry in romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love, but even that seems to have withered away. Penn seems to really enjoy playing a villain for once, but enjoys it way too much. His performance is the nobility of overacting. Nolte's role is small, but gives a proficient performance.Gangster Squad is one of the most bitter disappointments for a long time. It's an undistinguished and boring dud that's impossible to praise in any way. If you wish to see good old-fashioned crime films, watch movies like The French Connection, Chinatown and L.A. Confidential. Those films have great stories, great characters and great acting; everything this film doesn't have. This should have been released straight to DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that more and more people will choose their local cinema over more expensive nights out in these austere times. My wife and I are such a couple and as a consequence find ourselves not only running out of things to watch but watching a lot of very bad movies. You do live in hope though that every once in a while something very special will come along that reminds you why the cinema can be a great night out.Enter 'Gangster Squad'! I really didn't have high hopes for this movie based on the trailer. Even the name sounds too much like the 'monster squad' and conjures memories of an old children's movie. How wrong I was because this movie has just gone straight into my top five of all time, and that doesn't happen lightly! I already liked Ruben Fleischer's work and am a great fan of the soon to be a TV show hit Zombieland. The cast is also fantastic, everyone is top of their game here. Most importantly though (as has been a constant disappointment in cinema lately) the writing and story are exciting and believable. It is the kind of story I love, terrifying bad guys hopelessly outnumbering our few heroes who have little chance of success. Amongst the heroes we have some amazing characters too; the old gunslinger, the genius, the knife thrower, the cowboy, the jester who can't shoot and the gruff battle hardened leader. It must be said that there are some parallels between Gangster Squad and The Untouchables but that's not a bad thing. Gangster Squad is far superior but if you liked The Untouchables then you're in for a real treat here. All the actors are fantastic but I feel that Sean Penn deserves a special mention for his role as Mickey Cohen. Probably the best portrayal of a gangster kingpin I've seen. He was evil, creepy, dominating and sinister the whole time he was on screen. In the scenes where he fought he really moved like a real boxer, he really became the character.I'm sure a lot of people will compare this movie to all the classic gangster greats (Casino, Goodfellas, The Godfather) however they all seem a little dull compared to The Gangster Squad. I know it's practically a criminal offence to even compare another movie to The Godfather but if we're simply comparing gangster movies I'd say this one is far better. It has action, adventure, romance, thrilling moments, heroes, suspense and more. Can't recommend it enough, go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth The Wait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangster Squad, one of the best gangster films I've watched. Even though it was postponed to 2013, it was really worth the wait. After watching 2 of Ruben Fleischer's movies : Zombieland and 30 Minutes Or Less, this may very will be the best out of the other 2. It was time for Ruben Fleischer to direct a less-comedic movie. Sean Penn's character as Mickey Cohen was tremendous and it was really smart of Ruben Fleischer to pick him for the role. It will also be nice if Al Pacino were to played that role but since he played the role as Michael Corleone for The Godfather franchise and Tony Montana in Scarface, maybe it was time for Sean Penn to be given a chance to be the bad guy. It was also smart of Ruben Fleischer to pick Ryan Gosling as he is the player type of guy. The amount of violence in the movie was just nice, not much of sexuality and the language was fine. All in all, it was a great movie and it's worth the 113 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie Review: "Gangster Squad" (*** out of 5) - I was quite surprise by how much I actually enjoyed this film. The film is loosely based on the story of the Los Angeles Police Department officers and detectives who formed a "Gangster Squad" unit in an attempt to keep the city safe from the likes of mobster Mickey Cohen (played by Sean Penn) in the late 1940s-early 1950s. The film features an ensemble cast that included Josh Brolin (Sgt. John O'Mara), Ryan Gosling (Sgt. Jerry Wooters), Nick Nolte (Police Chief Parker), Emma Stone (Grace Faraday), Michael Pe?a (Officer Navidad Ramirez), and Giovanni Ribisi (Officer Conway Keeler).Mickey Cohen (Penn) is on the verge of establishing the largest wire gambling hub on the west coast which would effectively give him control of all of California. He has already bribed city officials, dirty cops, judges, and elected officials; and pretty much owns the city of Los Angeles. With the wire gambling hub, Cohen will basically have control of every dollar bet on the west coast. Chief Bill Parker (Nick Nolte) recruits Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) to wage guerilla warfare on Cohen, due to his special operations background and training during World War II; he mission is simple: dismantle Cohen's empire by any means possible and force him out of Los Angeles. The film has that film noire feel to it, and Josh Brolin was perfect casting for the role of Sgt. John O'Mara. However, more enjoyable was Mireille Enos as Brolin's somewhat supportive and pregnant wife Connie. Ryan Gosling plays the pretty boy well, while Emma Stone's Grace adds just the right amount of eye candy to lure the likes of both Gosling and Penn.This is not quite "The Untouchables"; however, the cinematography is wonderful, the film is well written and well acted, and the plot works (though it's a little predictable). This film is definitely worth seeking out. It is interesting to note that the film gives the impression that the Gangster Squad was responsible for Mickey Cohen's arrest. In reality, Cohen was arrested in 1950 for the more mundane crime of tax evasion. He was also not sent to Alcatraz until 1961, over a decade after the film's time frame. Funny how Hollywood loves to rewrite history?.See more of my reviews on FB @ "The Faris Reel"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is not a bad movie, but not a great one either. Gangster Squad is well acted and directed. However, for those who remember the 1987 Untouchables classic, the script was almost the same as the Untouchables. A new organized crime squad is created to combat a gangster. The squad plays by their own rules. One of the squad's members is murdered. The script has a big gun fight climax near the end. I did not mind Gangster Squad, but if I was going to watch Gangster Squad again I would say No, and watch The Untouchables. Gangster Squad is a six or seven out of ten. A good escape for -42 weather on a cold February day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb Fun w/ Lotsa Guns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Testosterone-fueled and bloody basic, GANGSTER SQUAD holds few punches. Centering on James Brolin's square-jawed/hard nosed Sgt. John O'Hara in post-war Los Angeles, this is a mindlessly involving romp that borrows more from Westerns than old school crime flicks.O'Hara's band of rouge lawman wind up screwing with Mickey Cohen's seedy rule of L.A. by attacking his casinos, not busting them; burning the cash instead of taking it home. The best scenes have the Squad in action, screwing with Cohen's operation like a gang of schoolyard punks given permission to wreak havoc, without limits.Sean Penn does an okay job as the cutthroat crime boss Mickey Cohen, although his reactionary scenes mostly consist of vein-popping tantrums, seeming more like someone's grumpy father than an infamous kingpin. Any capable actor could have pulled off the part, but Penn ? perhaps channeling pal Robert De Niro's Capone from THE UNTOUCHABLES ? has a good time no matter.It's really Brolin's ride but he's not alone. Ryan Gosling's Jerry Wooters is a mellow lady's man who falls for Cohen's moll played by Emma Stone. Their love scenes and dialog together mean nothing ? in fact when the bullets aren't flying, any of the character development? including O'Hara and his worried pregnant wife? is paper thin and ultimately pointless: Which would be a hindrance in a movie that doesn't celebrate non-stop action with such addictive gusto.With Robert Patrick on board as a gritty dead eye veteran partnered up with Michael Pena's semi comic relief ? and others including Giovanni Ribisi as a family man/technical guru and De'aundre Bonds as a tough black cop, this is a roller coaster ride where the good guys play bad and have a literal blast doing it.Just don't expect anything but fluff ? fueled by Tommy Guns and perpetual explosions ? and you'll do all right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has some major issues.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, by the movie alone, this movie is worth about an 8/10. It is highly entertaining, has some fun moments, and gets the setting right. This is exactly how I imagine 1940s LA. Yes, the movie is cliché, but oh well, what movie isn't now! I give it a 7 only because of the fact that there are huge moments in the true story completely screwed up in this film. I'm okay with movies being different from their source material, just not when the source is a real story. I read the book first and found the book not that exciting, but an interesting piece of history. The book is for the story, the movie is for the action. They go hand-in-hand rather well.However, I got really ticked off when there were way too many faults with the movie and the true story like:The real Gangster Squad consisted of 8 members, not 6; The real Gangster Squad didn't consist of a Mexican, Black, or old sharpshooter; Connie had a baby girl; Grace Faraday's character was completely fictionalized, Jerry Wooters was on Vice Squad before Gangster Squad and was not part of the original 8; (and the three that mainly made me mad) Mickey was never convicted of murder (he went to jail because of taxes (like Capone)); Con Keeler was not killed in real life, he was actually the last to die of the original 8 in 2012. and Jack Whalen was part of the Gangster Squad, not Mickey's crew, and was shot off-duty (suspected by Mickey Cohen) in the head and killed which lead to a very intense court battle, which never took place in the movie.Overall, even with those faults, it is still entertaining as heck! This is a definite buy for me, but not immediately unless they release the original cut with the movie theater shootout because I really want to see that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is about a group of policemen who figure they have to break the law in order to stop the dominating mafia of Los Angeles.I wasn't really planning on seeing this movie, but some friends of mine were, there was no school that day and I had nothing else to do. So I came in with low expectations, seeing as how I'm not a big fan of gangster movies.Gangster Squad is OK. It's not really good, it's not really bad, it's average. Josh Brolin from Men in Black 3 does an alright job as the main character. There are also a couple other interesting characters, such as the old guy with the constant perfect shots.The movie is extremely cliché. You know those typical scenes in today's Hollywood action films, where are couple characters are sitting quietly in a restaurant, and then suddenly one of them starts threatening the other or beat them up. This happened multiple times during the movie.The villain is pretty cool. When he gets angry, you know it's because he died in Minecraft while carrying 10 valuable diamond blocks. OK, I'm just kidding.This movie is pretty stupid. If it's based on a true story, why doesn't take itself seriously. It's like if James Cameron made Titanic a comedy.Overall, Gangster Squad is nothing special. If you're like me and only like action scenes if they're either done with good choreography or good suspense, you'll get pretty darn bored with this movie.</fullReview>

Fun, two-fisted auctioneer about the real-life account of the LAPD's undercover unit out to stop the mob led by Mickey Cohen (scene chewing Penn) out to run his 'destiny' for gangland rule. Led by tough-as-nails with a heart of gold Brolin appointed by the ever-gravelly voiced Nolte with a ragtag team including cool-as-a-cucumber Gosling (affecting a goofy dese/dem/dose accent); gunslinging cowboy Patrick and his wet-behind-the-ears sidekick Pena; brawler Mackie and electronics geek Ribisi. Stone gives good glam as the reluctant moll and Gosling's main squeeze. The script by newbie Will Beall - based on the Paul Lieberman book - gets the tone down but director Ruben Fleischer's kitchen sink approach is a hit and miss in this cross between LA CONFIDENTIAL meets THE UNTOUCHABLES.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much better than the trailer and expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Feeling mediocre while watching the fancy cast quarreling aggressively by shooting flashy shot-guns and hurling through the smoky old town upon dark shadows, and a good-looking guy making out with a promiscuous girl that solitary stands out is my first impression of the trailer. In a word, it does not really give me a "I want to watch this!" temptation since everything looks conceivable like a rerun of "God Father." However, every negative aspect fades away as a single dedicated cop fearlessly bursts into the building of the most notorious and strongest mob leader, Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) to rescue a gullible girl who falls into a "Wanna become a Hollywood star?" trap by taking out a herd of mobs by himself. That is when the movie gets intense.The plot is basically about a group of skilled cops who goes undercover in the public to shatter every plan of of Cohen's which is conquering the entire territories of Los Angeles. Cohen is shown as the most influential and powerful man, protected by paid cops, a lawyer and even a judge despite committing a series of crimes and casualties against people whom he despises. A series of nerve-wrecking battle scenes starts to transpire such as car chasing, a cruel torturing that leads to a homicide, and non- stop bloody shootings. It involves no gimmicks but intense and vibrant knocking and smacking along with a well-adapted slow motion technique that allows us to see who gets shot and evades without a massive confusion.Visually, the atmospheres of city and looks of the cast are splendid. The traditional costume and the way they narrate with some distinct southern accent bring a realism of good old days. The acting from the cast is amazing and comical too as each character unleashes vigorous talent. Except, Emma Stone, who plays a role of Grace Faraday, a wife of Cohen or more like a girl with less moral who clings to Cohen for wealth and prosperity does not show as much appeals as her other movies such as, "Easy A" or "The amazing Spider-man." I feel like the role ins't for her.I assume a lot of people who have already read the novel and watched the old version of the movie will criticize my review for not including significant details. However, it is a nicely condensed movie with a lot of potential. By watching "Gangster Squad", I have decided not to judge movies based on the trailer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster Squad Doesn't Know What Side It's On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every movie rides a very thin line between being a humorous comedy or a serious drama. No genre of movies ride this line thinner than period pieces, films that attempt to capture a certain time in human history in every aspect. They can go from feeling like a breathing comic book or to a snapshot of history. Rarely does a film capture both. Gangster Squad has managed that very thing, and dare I say in a good way. Capturing both could be a good thing if done right. Gangster squad captures both in the wrong way.This is the VERY loosely based true story of mobster Mickey Cohen's reign over Hollywoodland, as it was affectionately known, and Los Angeles county. Aside from names and positions, the majority of this film is fabricated and the spin of money making film makers yarn. The essential Gangster Squad there seems to be little known about and what they did or accomplished, even less. What is known is how Cohen was taken down and what he did, subsequently afterwards. The movie tells the story of 5 legit cops who put all ethics and laws aside to take down Cohen. In there pursuit is every aspect that makes up a perfect story from a young bitter bachelor cop that falls in love to the gritty veteran who can't seem to let the war go and the ambitious aspect that came with it who also happens to be an expecting father and wants clean streets for his child to grow up on. The dossier on these gentlemen couldn't line up more perfectly outside a Hollywood script therefore taking away the credibility of the film piece by piece.The trouble with Gangster squad is it's inconsistency as a film. It starts out fairly light hearted, tho in a darker tone a la Guy Ritchie. While it's a serous topic the humor seems to take center stage. the lines almost seemed to be delivered over the top outside of Emma Stone and Sean Penn who are masters at this moment in delivering dialogue. One of the other great speakers and dialogue deliverers is Ryan Gosling who at the out set seems to be a very satirical and almost cliché character. My initial thoughts were that this was gonna be a Guy Ritchie meets Brian DePalma film. While on paper and in minds that sounds fantastic, on screen it didn't seem to be working.About half way to 3/4 of the way the film takes a very serious turn and forces all the loose comical appeal of the characters out the window and now forces you to try and look at the film as a serious work of art with great ambitions. There's one problem...it's way to late for that. Everyone seemed to be looking for the next funny moment, which only seemed to arrive when a bloody Mickey Cohen seemed to weep when arrested, but unsure if it was a weep or smile. The faults all lay with the director as the actors seemed to transition well and not make a dramatic change in character, accents and demeanor remained the same but the tone and flow of the film was destroyed.Initial impressions were, if I wondered what would have happened if Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy and L.A. Confidential had a love child this would without question be the answer.Every actor signed up with a great script and rightfully so, don't fault them for being let down creatively.It is worthy to note that a substantial portion of the movie was taken out and some was re-shot after the tragedy in Aurora, Colorado and the massacre at the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises. This may have played a significant role in the feel and flow of the film but based on the final product, so much was left as a "what could have been" type feeling. www.loveyourmovies.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Awesome, Bloody Action Flick With All the Trappings of a Classic Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I'm a bit biased. I'm partial to movies featuring trench coats, fedoras, tough-talking cops, smooth-talking dames, and blazing Tommy guns. "Gangster Squad" is the type of movie I go to the movies hoping to see every year, my typical fantasies transferred directly to the big screen.Recent attempts at the genre, like Frank Miller's misguided "The Spirit" and Brian De Palma's overwrought "The Black Dahlia", have been hit-and- miss. But "Gangster Squad" hits the mark, having more in common with De Palma's 1987 classic "The Untouchables." The premise alone bears an uncanny resemblance. Set in 1940's L.A. instead of 1920's Chicago, the movie follows an incorruptible cop hand-picking a team of honest cops to take down a notorious gangster, this time Mickey Cohen instead of Al Capone. But while "The Untouchables" required a great cast to carry Kevin Costner as its lead, Josh Brolin's acting chops are more similar to Sean Connery's. Brolin plays Sergeant John O'Mara, a grizzled hero whose unwillingness to stay out of Mickey Cohen's way makes waves for his superiors, but Chief Bill Parker (a surprisingly dignified performance by Nick Nolte) recruits him to head a task force with the mission of undermining Cohen's rule. O'Mara contrasts sharply with younger, go-with-the-flow Sgt. Wooters (Ryan Gosling), who is content to spend his nights gambling, drinking, and picking up dames at Cohen's favorite nightclub, but soon finds himself joining the team. O'Mara recruits switchblade-wielding beat cop Anthony Mackie, old-timey wild-westerner Robert Patrick (complete with six-shooter and Yosemite Sam mustache), and tech whiz Giovanni Ribisi to round out the team, with Robert Patrick's Hispanic partner Michael Pena joining the party without being formally invited.While "The Untouchables" boasted method actor Robert DeNiro as Al Capone, it was hard to forget he was Robert DeNiro. By comparison, Sean Penn disappears completely into the role of infamous boxer-turned- mobster Mickey Cohen. He's truly terrifying from the moment, barely past the studio logos, we see what he does to those who oppose or fail him. Emma Stone, needless to say, is pretty as a pin-up as the dame, Cohen's main squeeze with red hair and redder lips. But she's not the movie's only eye candy. There's plenty of gorgeous cinematography of Los Angeles landmarks and glossy recreations of 40's nightclubs and casinos. And, as much as I want to dislike Ryan Gosling, he's great as the youthful detective whose love affair with Stone's character forms a large part of the narrative. But it's ultimately Brolin's straight- laced detective and family man who carries the movie, from the moment he punches his way into a mob-controlled hotel to save a blonde bombshell from being initiated into a brothel in his introductory scene.While "Gangster Squad" has all the trademarks of the film noir genre, that's just the outward veneer of an all-out action flick, more in the vein of "The Untouchables" or "Dick Tracy" than "The Maltese Falcon", with fist fights, shootouts, and a car chase (with beautiful vintage 40's vehicle, naturally) that are as bloody and brutal as anything else in movies right now. While the movie may include a few clichés too many, or Ruben Fleischer (who directed Emma Stone in "Zombieland") may rely a few times too many on modern film tricks like slow motion and dizzying camera angles, "Gangster Squad" is the best entry in the genre in decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original "G"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In hip hop world of Atlanta you when you hear references to a "G", you know they mean gangster. In Gangster Squad, you are taken back to the original gangsters, ones that not only fought the law, they were the law. Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) is the ultimate "G" ruling his kingdom as ruthless as anyone can. He is ready to make the leap and take over the West coast operations to be, as he put it, "God". Breaking the hold from Chicago and shifting the power centers. In comes a special unit set up to deal with breaking the syndicate known as he Gangster Squad. According to Anthony Mackie (officer Coleman Harris) who was in the Atlanta screening this movie is loosely based on historical characters from that era, when gangsters were celebrities, they were celebrated and interacted freely with business and politicians of their day. As noted in the movie two things you can't take back, they are bullets and words, this picture if full of both. Some gruesome scenes and old school man on man combat, a wild adventure into the underworld where gangsters ruled the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A low intelligence, shallow, action packed popcorn ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Got a chance to see this at a screening and I can say I was lucky. Gangster Squad is one of those films that would almost make me regret spending the money on a ticket. Not that I had high expectations, but the film is still a let down, with all it's top notch talent all but wasted. This is a film that is low on intelligence, high on thrills, and a far cry from the gangster film it attempts to imitate.The film is simple in it's plot: Mickey Cohen is attempting to own 1940's Los Angeles and a small unit of police go off the beaten path to try and nail him. As I stated, there isn't much to this low intelligence film. It's predictable and shallow, giving us only the slight semblance of character development we'd half expect here. Every character is a one-note cliché archetype: We have the hard boiled do-gooder, the young buck, the rookie, the old gun, the smart guy, the dame, and the token black guy. I mean it, those are the characters we get and there isn't much more to them than that. Even Sean Penn's Cohen is a one-note, evil bastard through and through.That said, for all the intelligence the film lacks and the clichés it delivers, it does so well. The action scenes are enjoyable, well shot and plentiful. The acting is also quite enjoyable. Though it may be one note, the actors relish in their performances and deliver their characters solidly. The final shootout and mano-a-mano fight are also very satisfying and well done.There really isn't a whole lot more to be said for the film. It's mostly empty and shallow, a breezy, low developed film with a lot of solid action and a decent fun time. If you're looking for something more out of this film, prepare to have your expectations defied by the script and direction. However, if you're looking for a brainless fun time with some good car chases and shootouts, then you don't need to look for much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good but I liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1949 Los Angeles a bunch of policemen and others form a gangster squad (led by hunky Josh Brolin) to bring down ruthless mob king Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) who's trying to run the city. An utterly predictable story, terrible dialogue (I almost laughed aloud at a few of the sillier lines) and some wonderful actors (Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone) giving their worst performances. Still I sort of liked it! There's plenty of gunfights and extreme violence to keep you interested and the movie LOOKS great. The costumes are beautiful! Stone is introduced in a form fitting red dress that just takes your breath away. Also the settings perfectly capture 1949 Los Angeles. This movie should easily win an Oscar nomination for Set Design. It's a little too long and reality disappears completely at the end (I still can't figure out how the squad got all those guns at the end) but I was entertained. Worth seeing for the sets and costumes alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has received many bad reviews, but not because it's a bad movie. The truth is it's just not what people expected it to be. When you hear about a mafia movie, you expect an epic, inside look like with Goodfellas or Casino, but Gangster Squad is from the cops point of view and more like The Untouchables. Gangster Squad is based on a novel and is about an off the books LAPD operation aimed at bringing down Micky Cohen. In the 1940s, LA had a growing mafia problem on it's hands, and Mickey Cohen was set to become the next Al Capone. Unbeknownst for decades, the LAPD sent a group of cops, who didn't play by the book, after Cohen and by going after his business interests, they attempt to destroy his growing empire. The story is a great one, well deserving of a film adaptation, but what people didn't like was how it turned into an action film. This story has all the makings of an epic mafia drama, an you will be hard pressed to find a better performance than the one Sean Penn gives as Mickey Cohen. It was somewhat disappointing that they didn't get more into Cohen and his operation, but for what it was, it was a great film. As for the cast, it features some of Hollywood's best an brightest as old school meets the up and coming stars of the big screen. Every one from the stars to the ancillary characters give Oscar worthy performances that will be sadly overlooked. because of the nature of the film. If you're looking for a classic mob drama, you're going to be disappointed, but if you want to see an action packed cop movie with a mob element, then Gangster Squad is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is a crime thrill-ride with an all-star cast. However despite all of its efforts it still echoes as an Untouchables Lite, an L.A Confidential without rules, and Scarface character traits. Whilst crime is my personal favourite type of genre this does stand as probably the best since 2009's Public Enemies, but not in the leagues with the best.Starring; Josh Brolin (No Country For Old Men), Ryan Gosling (Drive), Sean Penn (Mystic River), Emma Stone (Zombieland), Michael Pena (End Of Watch), Robert Patrick (Terminator 2), Nick Nolte (Warrior) and Anthony Mackie (The Hurt Locker). The film is full of faces that are instantly recognisable, giving the film the push factor at the box-office.Directed by Ruben Fleischer, who is best known for directing Zombieland and 30 Minutes or Less, he borrows the plot from The Untouchables in a way that just about pulls. Having clichés to parts from other movies we all know, the movie is destined to be compared to everything and anything in the crime genre. One possible example is the 'Here comes Santa Claus' quote said by Cohen as he pulls out a machine gun. Almost a reference or a mimic to Scarface's famous 'Say hello to my little friend' quote perhaps?So the plot develops quite early in the film and is in summary a group of police officers put together to unlawfully bring down the L.A Gangster Mickey Cohen. The team consists of an over-dedicated cop, a guy who never misses, a knife guy, a tech guy, a Mexican newby and of course Gosling's character as the rather good looking guy. There I said it.. Gosling's character is one of the only ones who sells the teams narrative, adding the doubt into their plans, the questioning of their motives and with his charismatic appeal and humour adds to the films overall strengths.The film is notably written by Will Beale, who does almost copy the plot to previous films. However in more recent news Beale has been hired for the write-up to the superhero assemble movie Justice League (2015), a huge movie in which he must prevale. Trying to almost make the film a unique satire it has all been converted into a 1940's graphic novel colour patte. This and the overuse of slow motion are all efforts to make it a cinematic gold, but does it work that well? for me it did.Filled with scenes that build the tension it is at certain points unpredictable and anything could happen giving the surprise factor. Whilst still grasping onto the humour the film attempts to deliver in all areas; with one of the humour highlights subtly being 'You know the drill' as said to a henchmen. Then you see them kill some guy with a drill! it is a comic genius!.. (it's really not, but brings a smile.)Set for an original release date of September 2012 the films release was delayed in respect to his Aurora shooting massacre during a The Dark Knight Rises screening. As seen in the films early trailers one of the scenes for the movie is a cinema shoot-out, again out of respect this was cut from the film and re-shot with a Chinatown setting.Once again with crime being my favourite film genre this is not in the leagues of the big players such as L.A Confidential or The Untouchables but it is still a rewarding and entertaining ride to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is Ruben Fleischer's third feature film, after Zombieland(2009) and 30 Minutes or Less (2011), and follows Mickey Cohen(Sean Penn) a ruthless mobster who wishes to rule the whole of LA and will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Then Chief Parker(Nick Nolte) assigns Sgt. John 'O Mara(Josh Brolin) an off-the-books mission where he must recruit members to tackle and take down Cohen's plan.When I first heard about Gangster Sqaud, I was excited. Aside from its fantastic cast - Josh Brolin, Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, Nick Nolte, Anthony Mackie, Michael Pena, Giovanni Ribisi and Robert Patrick - it had a great director and a good story. I went into the theater expecting to be satisfied, not blown away, but just about on the line. But this exceeded my expectations.It has it's flaws, and wouldn't rank highly on my all time favorites list, but it has great comedy, unbelievable performances, and Fleischer's directing was so unique to a gangster film. It's a great time at the cinema and is thoroughly enjoyable. It is most defiantly the director's most complete film and is the start of something wonderful. If, maybe, they had to have worked on the script for a tad bit longer, tightened up the screws and made more of a character out of the gangster squad, I would've enjoyed it so much more.My main complaint would defiantly be the ending. It didn't satisfy me, like a good ending should. It didn't seem rushed or anything bad, it just didn't make much sense. Which is exactly what I'm talking about when it comes to tightening the screws. A tad bit more work, and it could have been on track for one of the best gangster films of all time.A great gangster film, well directed, well written, incredibly acted and a vastly enjoyable film. I give a B+. In other words an 8. (To be accurate about a 7.6, which rounds up to 8.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first, don't go into this expecting a serious gangster story along the lines of Goodfellas and the aforementioned Untouchables. This just serves to give the audience and good time, and it does just that. However, that said, it isn't a bad movie as conventional movies go. The story is interesting, you care for the characters and above all, everyone plays their parts well.The acting in this movie, as I said before is very good. True, Ryan Gosling's voice does get a little annoying near the end of the movie, but it's still not enough to pull down the film as a whole. The two stand-out performances in the film have to be Sean Penn as Mickey Cohen and Emma Stone as Grace Faraday. Penn's portrayal of Cohen is truly electrifying and breaths new life into how a gangster boss should be portrayed and is possibly my favourite portrayal of a real life gangster boss, sorry Robert De Niro. Emma Stone's performance is equally brilliant. She is able to show Grace doesn't feel threatened by Cohen, but is a little scared by him. The rest of the cast do a great job too. Josh Brolin, Robert Patrick and Michael Pena all do good and I hope Michael Pena gets more work in the future as he is a brilliant actor. Also, this isn't really a problem, but it's just something I noticed, Nick Nolte sounds like Bane would do if he smoked since he was five.But as it is a movie just to have fun with, as you would expect from the director of Zombieland, the action sequences are wonderfully stylish and violent. In the opening scene a man gets torn in half by two cars and it's at that point you say to yourself, "ok, so that's what I'm in for". Also, the slow-mo isn't over used, instead it just amplifies the gloriously violent actions scenes.Overall, Gangster Squad is an extremely fun gangster movie, that can be classed as a good movie if you judged it under a general movie status. But, top tip, you do have to switch off your brain for this one. However if you do that, you are in for one hell of a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pay no attention to the critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer of Gangster Squad, I started to look forward to it. But I was surprised to see how negative the critics were about the film and made me feel skeptical about seeing it. But when I heard some moviegoers thought it was awesome. So in the end, I decided to go see it and I really have to disagree with the critics, and go with the moviegoers because it was a really action flick!Granted the story is cliché and predictable, but I what I enjoyed about it was the cast, the characters, the 1950s-style setting and the ground- breaking action sequences. Pretty much all the actors did amazing in their roles, particularly Sean Penn (as the ruthless gang lord, Mickey Cohen), Ryan Golsing (as the slick Jerry Wooters), Josh Brolin (as the courageous Sgt. John O'Mara), Robert Patrick (as the badass, gunslinger, Max Kennard), Giovanni Ribsi (as the intelligent Conway Keeler) and even Emma Stone (as the attractive Grace Faraday).If you like movies like The Untouchables and L.A. Confidential or if you're a fan of gangster and/or action movies, you'll enjoy Gangster Squad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GANGSTER SQUAD with Josh Brolin, Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Mireille Enos, Sullivan Stapleton, Nick Nolte, Robert Patrick, Giovanni Ribisi, Michael Pe?a and Anthony Mackie, directed by Ruben Fleischer. Rating: 6 out of 10.Cinema-goers hoping for a gritty, hard-boiled mix of "LA Confidential" and "The Untouchables" will be disappointed with Ruben Fleischer's colorful and cartoonish "Gangster Squad", but this violent, melodramatic tale - set in the late 1940s and (very) loosely based on fact - about a secret LAPD unit charged with taking down mob boss Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) comes with a top quality cast, nifty period details, witty dialogue, cool costumes and plenty of bloody action set pieces. So it certainly has entertainment value and should please those punters looking for a glossy, fast moving period gangster yarn with loads of spectacular gun play.The graphically gory opening scene plays out under the famous Hollywoodland sign in the hills and shows Cohen chaining a man to two cars and pulling him apart before allowing his dogs to feast on the poor fellow's intestines.Mickey sees Los Angeles as his personal fiefdom and because this brutal, dead-eyed thug has corrupt judges, cops and sheriffs on his payroll, the new police chief William Parker (a grim, grizzled and florid-faced Nick Nolte) is powerless to go after him by legal means. But when the tough, honest and courageous Sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), a decorated WW2 veteran, flouts the rules and busts into one of Cohen's brothels to rescue a young lady from a fate worse than death, Parker asks him to set up a small, highly secretive task force and "drive the bastard out of town" by any means possible.Aided by the advice of his worried, but supportive pregnant wife, Connie (Mireille Enos, from "The Killing and"Big Love"), O"Mara recruits knife throwing beat cop Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie), ace cowboy sharp-shooter Max Kennard (Robert Patrick) - who prefers a six shooter to a tommy gun, technology buff Conwell Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi), slick-talking ladies man Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) and Kennard's rookie partner Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena) and prepares to launch attacks on one of Cohen's casinos and his heroin running operation.Meanwhile, Cohen is setting up a massively lucrative operation which will give him control of all the wire bookmaking west of Chicago and make him virtually untouchable. Thus time is of the essence It does not take long for Cohen to realize the gangster squad are an incorruptible crew and he tells his cohorts "a cop who is not for sale is like a dog with rabies, there's no medicine for it, you just gotta put 'em down"."Gangster Squad" was lensed by Oscar winning cinematographer Dion Beebe, it takes place in a smoky, neon-lit, sepia-tinted Los Angeles and the Hollywood Boulevard of the '40s look a treat, but the film sure does not have the depth, style, character development or rich, noir flavor of "LA Confidential". A hard-boiled Josh Brolin is well cast and looks the part, while Gosling and Stone (as Mickey's moll, Grace, who falls for Wooters' charms) provide some romantic heat and there are effective supporting turns from a warm, strong, emotionally potent Mireille Enos, Robert Patrick and the Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton (so good in "Animal Kingdom"). Anthony Mackie, Giovanni Ribisi and Michael Pena are all fine actors and turn in convincing performances, but one wishes they were not shortchanged by a script that fails to give them any big individual moments.Then there is a heavily made up, scenery chewing Sean Penn as Mickey Cohen - who is portrayed as a raging, full blown psycho, devoid of any charisma or likable traits. It's an entertaining and enjoyable performance, but history tells us there was more to Cohen than the one-dimensional character we see here. Unlike Harvey Keitel (who played Cohen in Warren Beatty's "Bugsy"), Penn will not be receiving an Oscar nomination for the part. Still, the film would be a whole lot less fun without him.The cliché-strewn "Gangster Squad" suffers by comparison with "The Untouchables", but while Ruben Fleischer seems to have been inspired by the De Palma film, his flick is not in the same league. However, while this not a film that lingers on in the memory, and I would have preferred more storytelling and character development to go with the blazing action and violence, it's not boring, it should do quite well at the box office and it made for a relatively enjoyable two hours at the movies. Go with low expectations and you won't be too disappointed. GRANT AUBIN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mobs vs Independent Cops!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarface, the Godfather, John Dillinger and now Mickey Cohen, these men have attempted to stand above the law time and time again. For years, audience members have enjoyed watching the power these men have wielded as they spread a reign of terror across their cities. Yet the organized crime world has had many dry spells in the cinema world, leaving the art of gangster tales to the television studios. Tonight though, I was entertained by the latest action crime drama entitled Gangster Squad. Now if you're like me, you may have had your doubts when you saw the commercial. The idea of a band of off the book cops uniting to take on the scourge of L.A. may have been a little far-fetched. Sure Josh Brolin has a little bit of lone warrior in him, a.k.a Jonah Hex, but I had my doubts about Ryan Gosling's role after seeing the movie Drive. After all most of the roles the blue eyed, blonde hair star plays have been more about kissing than killing. Yet the Gangster Squad seems to have opened up a new door for Gosling allowing him to finally take on the action genre. Although Gosling still retains many of his chick flick traits, his character has some bite as he brandishes the weapon with L.A's best. The squad is awesome in this movie as each member contributes some quality to make it efficient, fun and colorful. Brolin's edge, and take no crap attitude drives the group to take risks. Anthony Mackie provided some wit and justice, while adding some razor sharp knife throwing skills to mix up the action a smidge. Robert Patrick and Michael Pe?a provide the extra gun power to the squad, though Patrick's character has some well-timed lines that made the audience and I laugh. Fans of the awkward Giovanni Ribisi will rejoice him again, as his character adds the intelligence and strategy to coordinate the squad's efforts. All of these characters had a chemistry together that complemented the chemistry these actors had with one another. These guys were a great cast for this movie, each filling in their cop role quite well with no cheesiness or macho heroism. Also contributing to the fantastic cast is Sean Penn, who not only looked the part of a gangster, but played the part as well. Penn managed to don the sinister cloak, using a calm demeanor and merciless commands to get his way in the city. Like the classic mob bosses, his actions speak louder than his words, as his soulless response to the ruthless acts makes you both hate and respect him. Thus, this cruel tyrant's reign and character are what set up the good plot of this movie. Although simple and tired, Gangster Squad's pace, action, and characters keep it fresh, fun and exciting to watch for the two hour time frame. Unlike some crime drama movies, Gangster Squad kept a pace that didn't feel slow to me. One reason was the movie interlaced the plot and character development, with action that helped to break up the slower scenes used to build the tension. The action scenes were executed perfectly to momentarily relieve the building conflict before bringing the audience into the tension of the scene. For me the action was nicely balanced with most of the battles being longer than a minute, yet fast enough to not drag on and have you praying it to end. I'm sure many will say the battles paled in comparison to the classic mafia films, but these battles have been some of the best I have seen in a long time. Instead of a mindless bloodbath filled with bullets flying into and through people's heads, these battle scenes returned to the classic style of combat. Both gangsters and cops used the environment for cover, attempting to gain the advantage with some clever strategies. Of course in any gun fight there are still idiots who stand in the open who can't seem to hit anything other than the conveniently placed cars. Have you gotten the idea that fighting makes up a good part of this movie? Good because that is the main feature this movie has to offer. Yet Gangster Squad does have a few other qualities that help keep things fun and entertaining. The story is simple and easy to follow, and combined with the characters is suspenseful enough to keep you into the story. Unfortunately the story is still cliché of a typical mob movie and is fairly predictable to determine what events are happening next. The setting of this world is also impressive, helping bring you into the mafia world in the retro Los Angeles. Flashy casinos, live singing, and sleazy crime joints filled with shady looking men are brought to life in this mafia underworld. Other things to quickly mention are the camera work is good, the action is somewhat diverse, and there is some humorous dialog interspersed throughout the movie. Yes I know it's not much, but there aren't too many things that stand out in this movie from what I talked about earlier.Overall, I enjoyed Gangster Squad despite the predictable storyline and mafia cliché's. Yes, I'm still a little bias towards the action, but I did find the movie balanced on many levels. I would have liked to have seen more from Emma Stone's character, but the Squad itself made up for the lack of her involvement. Yes there are still some things that need to be edited, but it's definitely one of the better gang movies I've seen in a long time. I feel that this is definitely one meant to be seen in the theater in all its surround sound glory. Yet for those who don't like mafia movies, naturally you are going to want to avoid it. My scores: Action/Crime/Drama: 8.5 Movie Overall: 8.0 So until next time my friends, this is Robbie K signing off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the cost of a cinema ticket increasing recently, I don't watch as many movies as I would like to. In fact, I rarely watch movies because as a student, it's difficult to afford them.I saw the trailer for Gangster Squad and was intrigued. I'm going to keep this 'review' extremely short. It's not as much of a review, as a recommendation.The movie is about a gangster from the 40's and 50's called Mickey Cohen. I think the film is loosely based on facts. Sean Penn takes the role of Mickey and absolutely nails it.The movie had a Scarface feel to it and was simply fantastic. With beautifully choreographed scenes and incredible gun-fights, it was a real throwback to the gangsters of that era.I strongly, strongly suggest you go and watch this movie. Don't expect it to be the best movie ever, just enjoy it and you should come away feeling satisfied, like it was money well spent.Thank you for reading, Enjoy the movie! I hope you like it as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean Penn as a Jewish gangster? That's a stretch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a problem. It's not with the story, and it's not with the acting per se, nor is it with the cinematography and even the incessant inclusion of gratuitous violence, but with Sean Penn being cast in the principal role of a Jewish ex-prizefighter turned ruthless gangster. This is one of Hollywood's more egregious casting gaffs. There is no way that Mr. Penn is a Jewish gangster. This has nothing to do with Mr. Penn's skill as an actor. Rather, it has a lot to do with the way the character is portrayed in the movie, completely two-dimensional, a stereotypical composite of how gangsters decades ago looked and acted according to Hollywood. Asking Mr. Penn to play a stereotype is a bit much to ask, and it comes off as phony. Now, gangsters were violent and engaged in all kinds of criminal activities, but they weren't two dimensional characters. And the idea of a bunch of police officers becoming some kind of vigilante squad that will out muscle the syndicate is so pure Hollywood as to render the story superfluous. If somebody likes movies with loads of gratuitous violence, which includes shootings, beatings, knifings, clubbings, boxing (inside and outside of the ring), punching, gouging, and, of course, gunshots (hand guns, rifles, and automatic weapons), even someone being stretched and quartered (which was a form of medieval torture), all graphically depicted, then this movie is for you. This movie makes the level of violence depicted in any war movie from World War Two look like kindergarten. Now, the question is: was the level and intensity of violence at, let's say, the Battle of Okinawa, in which American forces lost over sixty-thousand killed and wounded and the Japanese over one hundred thousand, less than that in Los Angeles circa 1950? Watch this movie and draw your own conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have heard of this film and seen the promos, then the excitement for this movie will surely be there. Great actors like Josh Brolin and Sean Penn and sexy Emma Stone will definitely pull the audience to the cinemas. And the actors don't disappoint.Based on true events in Los Angeles in year 1949, the story involves the gangster Mickey Cohen played by Sean Penn and how police officers form a secret squad to sabotage all the ongoing operations of Mickey Cohen in the city. The dialogues are very stylish and well written and will leave the people very delighted. Movie starts with a very promising note. It maintains it pace pretty well throughout the first half but loses it in initial parts of second half. However movie soon picks it up back again.Acting wise every actor has done a good job. Although Sean Penn was good in the role of Mickey Cohen it seemed that he was trying to hard. Ryan Gosling and Josh Brolin were great as usual. Emma Stone wasn't given much screen time but she did what she was supposed to do..add to the glamour quotient of the film.Final verdict: Great Star Cast, impressive dialogues and nice cinematography makes this movie a good watch. It is a nice gangster movie, good but not great. Avoid comparisons with movies like 'Goodfellas' and 'L. A. Confidential'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before major league baseball came to the west coast if you referred to the Mick in the Fifties it wasn't Mantle they were talking about. And Mickey Rooney was kind of eclipsed in the title. No that would have been gangster Mickey Cohen, a crude, violent, and vulgar man who ruled Los Angeles organized crime and was often at odds with quieter and less attention getting folks like Meyer Lansky and Frank Costello.If you watched Warren Beatty's classic Bugsy you saw the genesis of Cohen's character played there by Harvey Keitel. After the contract hit on Benjamin 'Bugsy' Siegel in 1947, Cohen became number one in organized crime on the West Coast. Sean Penn picks up on that character and puts his own particular stamp on Cohen. As a performer Penn amazes me at the range of what he can play. Ironically at 5'9" Penn is two short to have played the over six foot Harvey Milk for which he won his second Oscar and he's too tall to have played 5'5" Mickey Cohen. But Penn made these parts his own and dominates both of those films.Cohen attracts so much attention unto himself that reform police chief William Parker played by Nick Nolte has decided that he has to do nothing but declare a no quarter war in secret less civil libertarians get up in arms. So he recruits an idealistic Josh Brolin for the job. After this the plot of this film runs pretty close to Kevin Costner's The Untouchables with Brolin being far less of a boy scout than Costner was as Eliot Ness.Wife Mireille Enos makes the useful suggestion that for this kind of disagreeable work of being LA's own secret police, Brolin needs some disagreeable people for the squad. Those he gets are Robert Patrick, Anthony Mackie, Michael Pena, Giovanni Ribisi, and cynical war veteran Ryan Gosling who makes war on Cohen real personal by moving in on his main squeeze Emma Stone. Both Stone and Enos have the only two women's roles of substance, but both prove to be critical in shaping the motivations of all the men around them.Unlike what you see here, Mickey Cohen did not go down for first degree murder. Like Al Capone whom he tried to emulate in methods and style, Cohen was taken down by the audit boys at the IRS and like Capone did a stretch in Alcatraz. Still if you're wanting action, the final shootout between Penn and his hired guns and the Gangster Squad recruited by Brolin should more than satisfy anyone's craving.Gangster Squad like the more fictionalized LA Confidential before it is a great depiction of a bygone era and a colorful one. And Sean Penn totally dominates this film, hitting on all levels the various the various strains in the psyche that made up Mickey Cohen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Gangster Squad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Ruben Fleischer's Zombieland was a riot, with plenty of fun in its fantasy premise of a group left fending for its survival against a zombie apocalypse, but gets all serious here with his treatment of Gangster Squad, set in the 40s post WWII Los Angeles where its riddled with crime and corruption, with gangsters owning every turf and calling the shots in the running of the city. A few good men get rounded up by a common ideal to take back their city, starting with getting rid of head gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn).By the time this film runs into its 30 minute mark, you'd see all the shades of Brian De Palma's Untouchables, where instead of Capone, we have Cohen, who got introduced to audiences in a more sadistic fashion, making De Niro's scene with the baseball bat look like a stroll in the park, setting the violent tone that's to pepper the film at every opportunity. And given today's standards, who would blame Fleischer in making this ultra-bloody, especially when it boils down to fisticuffs and the bloodying of any pummeling to the face, and expending plenty of lead through vintage machine guns, which pushed back the film's release after the infamous Aurora, Colorado massacre which required scenes to be reshot.Then we have Josh Brolin as Sgt John O'Mara, given the green light by weary police chief Parker (Nick Nolte) to go under the radar and assemble a crack team of his own to use any means possible to wrest control from Cohen, and cripple the gangster's operations, with a Mission: Impossible styled disavowing hanging over their heads should any of them be caught. If this doesn't sound like Elliot Ness gathering his troops, I don't know what is. Dogged by an inherent sense of righteousness and honour, O'Mara assembles the titular crack squad consisting of marksman Max Kennard (Robert Patrick hidden behind thick makeup), his unofficial understudy tag-along Navidad Ramirez (Michael Pena), intelligence Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi), Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie) with throwing knife skills that got severely underused, and then the Romeo of the lot Sgt Jerry Wooters, whose romance with Cohen's moll Grace Faraday (Emma Stone, literally a flower vase role) brought about an edge to the team.And just like the Untouchables, with its stylish art direction and production values to recreate the aura and romanticism of its early American era, the drama unfortunately centers around a handful of its leads, without giving much of the other supporting characters screen time to get to know them beyond their single-ability that brought them to the fight. And even then we don't get beyond O'Mara's sense of duty, Wooters' rather maverick ways and romance with Grace that didn't threaten the dynamics of the group nor put him very dangerously close to Cohen's gun-sights. This film could have been a lot more with deeper character study since we have five very different kinds of cops each with their own personal agenda brought to the table, but we get none. This instead got traded for its stunning visuals, a combination of slow-motion, stylized action sequences ranging from montages of raids the Gangster Squad undertakes to close Cohen's various operations, to personal one on one fisticuffs, since Cohen is after all a mobster who got to where he is through sheer professional boxing prowess and experience. Camera-work, CGed or otherwise, also made quite an impact with its fluid motions to capture the crux of any situation.There's little to wow on the narrative side of things, since plot development moved in very expected fashion. Probably the sole interesting peak would be how O'mara's wife Connie (Mireille Enos) got involved in handpicking the Gangster Squad, which boiled down to a pragmatic, selfish and very valid real life reason of keeping her husband alive in a job known to attract Trouble, and surrounding him with people blessed with the necessary skill-set to get their mission accomplished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic American action movie with a great cast &amp; setting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I love the post-WWII era. The suits, the hats, the demeanor of the ladies ? everything points to a society with much richer cultural roots. So when you take my two favorite things, that being the post-WWII era and any combination of Josh Brolin/Sean Penn, you naturally have my attention (catch that Django reference?).Sean Penn plays Mickey Cohen, a boxer turned mob-man wanting to take over Los Angeles and make it his new home. Turns out that the LAPD doesn't like East-coasters coming in on their land so they form an "undercover" unit, later dubbed as the gangster squad, to quickly and quietly take down Mickey Cohen.This movie almost has an Ocean's Eleven feel to it, which I strongly enjoy, and there is no lack of action. The movie itself is actually quite dark which I thought was an excellent and accurate portrayal of the mob underworld. Anyone who thinks that mob-men are actually nice people who do things "by the book" has got another thing coming. Sean Penn portrays his character flawlessly (as Sean Penn usually does) and Tommy Lee Jones .err, Josh Brolin does an excellent job as well. Throw in Ryan Gosling, playing another dreamy lady's man, Emma Stone, and that weird guy from Ted who dances to 80&#x2032;s music and you got yourself a solid cast. With the solid cast comes a solid story and, surprisingly, quite a bit of humor. I thought the humor and the darkness of the plot counterbalanced each other and it didn't make the audience feel uncomfortable in any way. This is a rare thing in today's movies because so few of them can balance two polar opposite sub-genres of film so eloquently.Although the film's plot is general and the above-average movie-goer can more-or-less guess what's coming next, the many action scenes and gun fights keep the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the show. This is a classic American action film set in one of the best era's movies could be set in.All-in-all I highly recommend this film while it's currently out in theaters.+2 for Brolin/Penn +2 for supporting cast +2 for counterbalancing of humor and dark-atmosphere +2 for it all coming together</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most movies give you a chance to get comfortable with their narratives before they hit you with the hard stuff. "Zombieland" director Rueben Fleischer's profane, bullet-riddled, urban crime thriller "Gangster Squad" cherishes no such illusions. Early into the action, the arch villain of Angel City?real-life hoodlum legend Mickey Cohen?threads chains around the rear bumpers of two automobiles with an angry out-of-town mobster entangled in a hammock of chains between the cars. Native Americans saved this ghastly fate for only the most repugnant whites in old western movies, except they used horses rather than cars. After a brief conversation, Cohen orders the cars to careen off in different directions. An aerial long shot depicts the poor dastard as his body bursts apart in the middle. Indeed, "Gangster Squad" isn't for everybody. This suspenseful, often violent, but thoroughly melodramatic law and order epic recounts how an undercover unit of Los Angeles cops fought fire with fire. They destroyed Cohen's dreams of turning California into his own private criminal empire. Movies like "Gangster Squad" were once the bread and butter for Warner Brothers. The landmark Burbank studio produced the earliest and most controversial gangster thrillers in the 1930s with the three most memorable stars: James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, and Humphrey Bogart.Los Angeles Police Chief Bill Parker (a beefy Nick Nolte of "48 HRS") summons World War II veteran, Sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin of "Jonah Hex"), because he wants somebody fearless enough to tackle a dangerous assignment. Lately, Jewish crime figure Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn of "Bad Boys") has been creating chaos in the City of Angels. Not only does he own a respected judge, but also he has been cheating on his mobster cronies both in Chicago as well as Los Angeles. The Chicago mob isn't happy with Mickey's behavior. The King of the Sunset Strip refuses to bow and scrape to the Windy City hoodlums. He has nothing but contempt for local crime boss Jack Dragna (Jon Polito of "The Big Lebowski") and orders hits on his life. At one point, a shoeshine kid dies in an attempt on Dragna's life. Cohen has established himself as a warlord, and he refuses to share and share alike with the mob. Incidentally, for the sake of armchair movie historians, "Gangster Squad" takes place after the demise of Benjamin Siegel, a.k.a. "Bugsy" (1991) with Warren Beatty as the notorious crime czar who forged Las Vegas into the gambling capital of America. At one time, Mickey Cohen worked for Siegel as a henchman. Two bullets in the head terminated Siegel's criminal reign in 1947. "Gangster Squad" opens in 1949 during the rising tensions of the Cold War between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. Essentially, Chief Parker asks O'Mara to assemble a unit to harass Cohen. "Don't make arrests," Parker orders him. "This is occupied territory. Wage guerrilla warfare." O'Mara forms a rainbow-colored "A-Team" consisting of African-American Officer Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie of "Real Steel"), older white cop, Officer Max Kennard (Robert Patrick of "Terminator 2: Judgment Day"), his Hispanic partner, Officer Naiad Ramirez (Michael Pe?a of "End of Watch"), Officer Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi of "Ted"), and eventually Sergeant Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling of "Drive"). One of the first things that they do is plant a bug in Cohen's house so they can monitor him. Methodically, these guys shoot up Cohen's bars, casinos, and disrupt his narcotics traffic. Wooters takes an interest in Cohen's girlfriend, Grace Faraday (Emma Stone of "Easy A"), who is supposed to be teaching Mickey etiquette. "Gangster Squad" was "inspired" by true events and this means that Hollywood has taken dramatic license with history. Actually, the movie is loosely based on Paul Lieberman's book. As far as I know, our rugged hero didn't go toe-to-toe with Cohen in a public place and beat him to a blood pulp. Of course, movies have to be both heroic and confrontational, and "Gangster Squad" possesses both of these attributes. This obstreperous, 110-minute, R-rated, shoot'em up doesn't flinch when it comes to outbursts of violence. Despite the recent bloodbaths both in movie theaters and elementary schools, this standard-issue, old school Warner Brothers release embraces wholesale violence with relish. Fleischer features fashionable thugs armed with machine guns strafing anybody in sight, including poor white shoeshine boys. Fleischer stages the action with considerable finesse, and he relies on a charismatic cast to deliver a synthesis of "The Untouchables" with Kevin Costner and "L.A. Confidential" with Russell Crowe. Despite a plethora of action, largely frontal assault firefights on gritty city streets with .45 caliber Thompson submachine guns, "Gangster Squad" suffers from halfheartedly etched characters, a contrived screenplay by former LAPD homicide investigator and novelist Will Beall, and a numbing sense of predictability. You can guess what is going to happen before it does, but everybody looks good doing it. Nevertheless, genre fans should appreciate the studious lengths that the filmmakers have taken to recreate Los Angeles in the late 1940s. Some of the action was lensed on genuine L.A. locations and enhances the authenticity of the action. Flinty-eyed Josh Brolin makes a sturdy hero, while suave Ryan Gosling channels Humphrey Bogart. Sadly, Emma Stone lingers on the periphery as the thankless love interest who eventually figures in the demise of Sean Penn's Mickey Cohen. Penn chews the scenery as Cohen. No doubt he watched both "Scarface" and "The Untouchables." Altogether, "Gangster Squad" qualifies as an energetic actioneer, with strong performances, and atmospheric cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kicking off the New Year with a Bang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2013 is starting off with a bang as Gangster Squad takes you out for a 1940's mobster thrill ride, done with a modern sleekness that you would want from this kind of movie, while keeping you entertained the whole way through. With Josh Brolin as the official film hero the film plays out as smoothly as he talks, but Sean Penn is the definite star of this film. His on screen performance is awesome as he doesn't hold anything back playing one of the most notorious mobsters of all time. You with love his one liners and feel the fear he tries to drive into those that cross him. As a whole the film plays to all the classic clichés that it should and doesn't take itself too seriously, which worked great for it. If you were expecting the drama or epic war that films like the Godfather brought, well you are looking at the wrong film. This is a classic and campy mobster movie, with lots of action, a drop dead supporting lady ? Emma Stone, and of course lots of dead mobsters. Basically this is a kick butt guy movie to start the year off with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a Good, Old-Fashioned Butt Kicking Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangster Squad (2013) *** (out of 4) A gang of cops team up to bring down Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) who is trying to take over the streets of Los Angeles with his non-stop violence. The cops know it's going to be an uphill battle and they're not going to get any recognition but this here doesn't stop them. If you're expecting some sort of L.A. CONFIDENTIAL then you're going to be highly disappointed because this film isn't an art picture and it's certainly no where near a great one. It really does seem that GANGSTER SQUAD is one of those dirty, exploitation noir type thrillers from the 1950's that just wants to show a bunch of butt kicking. The major difference is that this here is 2013 so you can get away with a lot more cussing and a lot more violence. Those two things are on full display here including the violence, which is rather graphic and at times you really feel as if you're watching a SAW picture. The first ten-minutes might have some people feeling quite uneasy as we see Cohen and his form of bloody justice. Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Anthony Mackie, Robert Patrick, Michael Pena and Giovanni Ribisi plays the gangster squad with Emma Stone playing Cohen's muse and Nick Nolte playing the big dog who sends these guys out on the mission. As you can see, we've got an A-list cast here and while none of them deliver Oscar-type performances, it does seem as they're just taking it easy, kicking back and having some fun. This is especially true for Penn who is just so over-the-top at times you can't help but think he's playing a spoof of Cohen. Only someone as talented as Penn could do something like this and still make the performance work. Brolin is also very good as the tough guy and I thought he had some good chemistry with the rest of the boys. Patrick clearly steals the film in his supporting role. Both Gosling and Stone are good but their romance is pretty bland. Again, if you're expecting an art film or an Oscar-worthy film then forget it. You could pretty much call this the ROAD HOUSE of gangster pictures but the important thing is that it's a lot of fun. This is especially true of the final ten-minutes, which make SCARFACE look tame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Untouchables Lite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To suggest Gangster Squad is nothing more than a scene-for-scene recreation of the superior The Untouchables seems a touch harsh, although the similarities between both films run deep. But where Untouchables kicks into fifth gear following the assassination of a certain ageing Scotsman, Gangster Squad is content to cruise at 80 km/hr in a 90 zone, never truly hitting the suspenseful heights of its most comparable equivalent, and doing little to distinguish itself from the majority of big studio actioners.Josh Brolin plays the honest, rugged John O'Mara, a man hell-bent on washing the streets of post-WW2 Los Angeles clean from the dirty grasp of ruthless, egomaniacal gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn). To do so, he recruits a rag-tag band of misfits- with a license to not only stop Cohen, but to cross the line between detective work and straight-up vigilantism in the process- including family man Conway (Giovanni Ribisi), veteran firearms expert Max (Robert Patrick) and the casual, charismatic Jerry (Ryan Gosling).Despite its intermittent predictability, though, the film strings together some sexy individual parts en route to a solid final product. The acting is above par across the board, with each background contributor doing just enough with the script to keep their character from resembling a plug-and-play stereotype. The obvious highlight is Penn's hammy, James Cagney-channelling performance, but Brolin is perfectly cast as the upstanding moral leader, while Gosling slow plays his smart-aleck role, drawing attention even when his romantic subplot with Emma Stone's Grace stagnates.Having dealt mostly in comedy, director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, 30 Minutes or Less) deserves credit for presenting the action nicely, bookending the film with a pair of thrilling fistfights and showing the cajones to make a major studio film like this one as gloriously violent as it was. The opening scene's sheer shock value alone sets up what looks to be a nostalgic hark back to the purest noir, complete with a hard-boiled setting, voice-over narration and femme fatale. Of course, it all becomes an afterthought by the halfway mark, but the effort is there. It may lack the deep-seated hubris of The Godfather, the sweeping rise-and-fall narrative of Goodfellas, the vibrant excess of Scarface or the ensemble cast execution of L.A. Confidential, but Gangster Squad works with a plot that is just tight enough and a cast that is just layered enough to make for an enjoyable enough experience; destined to be forgotten by the following morning, but an inoffensive slice of escapism during its runtime.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*</fullReview>

The 40s atmosphere is colorfully captured by evocative cinematography and music.It's quite tense waiting to see which of the heroes survives and every encounter is quite nail biting. Expect some over the top machine gun fire, lots of fighting and even car chases.The new "King of Cool" Ryan Gosling and the surprisingly lovely Emma Stone have proved chemistry and their encounters ignite the screen. She has the old world glamor look in her 40s gowns.Josh Brolin steps into a new role for him - the hero role. Sean Penn is well cast as the evil boxer turned gangster and his ugly looks fit the part.It's a good start to the year for action movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The actors make the genre fresh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if you miss the Magnificent Seven and Untouchables as much as I do, but both of them are parodied and imitated in Ruben Fleischer's Gangster Squad. It's a rousing gangster movie about the removal of kingpin Mickey Cohen from dominating the crime world in 1949 Los Angeles.Yes, it's the movie rescheduled from September because of the retooling necessity for a theater massacre too much like the Colorado tragedy.Inspired by real events, Gangster Squad echoes The Magnificent Seven with an extended sequence of Sergeant John O'Mara(Josh Brolin), an honest LAPD cop who is a WWII vet, recruiting four other incorruptible officers and a shootout straight from the famous stairs sequence involving AL Capone's accountant from the Kevin Costner Untouchables. In addition to the delight of seeing excellent actors enjoying their roles, the sense of humor, even when machine guns are blazing, echoes the post-modern ironic revision of the serious film noirs in the '30's and '40's and memorable younger ones like Chinatown and L.A. Confidential.No matter how accurate the account is, the story and characters are straight out of '40's gangster types in a good vs. bad formula that's not stale in this thriller. Although its heroics and humor are mostly over the top, its actors (Sean Penn as Cohen and Ryan Gosling as Sgt. Jerry Wooters stand out with Brolin) are spot on with the requisite bravado and sarcasm married to very bleeding hearts, for Los Angeles that is. Let's not forget the durable Nick Nolte as the honest police chief; his voice gets more gravely with each film?all the better for seasoned, tough characters.As gun moll and girlfriend of Mickey and Jerry, Emma Stone's Grace is the femme fatale. Typical of the genre, she's trouble no matter how sweet she is. In her slinky dresses and shiny makeup, she's a male fantasy of naughty. Just like the film itself.Throw in the period details like vintage cars and art deco buildings, and you'll be in nostalgia paradise, LA style. It's an enjoyable movie like many others you've seen before, but rarely with such nimble actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shallow but stylish and entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Essentially The Untouchables with more style but less substance, director Ruben 'Zombieland' Fleischer has pretty well lived up to expectations. His take on the war between the LAPD's incorruptible minority and the top mob outfit at the time - being 1949 - very much foregoes a strong narrative and any meaningful character arcs in favour of looking slick, acting cool and delivering blood-spurting popcorn entertainment. On that level it works perfectly. Fleischer has a certain visual flair that renders his 1949 Los Angeles ultra-smooth and hyper-real, how it might have looked and felt to the gangsters of the time, and he builds on his reputation of being able to supply vicious and enjoyable violence with a tongue-in-cheek vibe after the humorously gory Zombieland. The up-for-it cast have a blast too: Sean Penn's larger-than-life gangster Mickey Cohen is excitingly erratic, Josh Brolin's tough cop John O'Mara is a true hard-ass, Ryan Gosling's smooth lawman Jerry Wooters oozes charisma and Emma Stone's femme fatale Grace Faraday is an absolute bombshell. Shallow without a doubt, but a joy to watch anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A harrowing story of corruption and evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangster Squad is an exceptional work of art revealing that there is no difference between an apocalyptic world ravaged by Zombies and a post-war City of Angels consumed by malevolent greed. The profound impact of Zombieland director Ruben Fleischer's skillfully crafted portrait of Los Angeles' kingdom of gangster in 1949 is grounded in how delicately he peels away the layers of the shocking and violent nature of human beings, yet manages to deliver a soulful and emotional journey into the compassion of humaneness. Set against the background of an affluent world dominated by power at its most corrupt and evil, it deals with the relentless warfare between Brooklyn-born mob king Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), who runs the show in this town, reaping the ill-gotten gains from the drugs, the guns, the prostitutes and?if he has his way?every wire bet placed west of Chicago, and Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), a man who's come back from war, and can't quite figure out how to live in peace time. Ironically, with the outstanding Zombieland, Fleischer placed a group of ill-fated characters in an apocalyptic nightmare; the nightmarish hell of Gangster Squad is not sci-fi, but a fictional account of real life events that shaped our future and is prevalent in daily news headlines where innocent victims are killed in gang warfare. If there's one reason to this film, it's most definitely for Penn and Brolin's outstanding performances, well supported by Ryan Gosling as a charismatic cop, Nick Nolte as Chief Parker, Anthony Mackie as a switchblade-wielding cop, Giovanni Ribisi as a family man and electronics specialist, Robert Patrick as gunslinger Max Kennard, Emma Stone as Gosling's sweetheart and and Mireille Enos as O'Mara's wife. Although the film ultimately belongs to Penn and Brolin, it's a terrific ensemble piece where the faultless synergy and volatile energy between performers allow the characters to burst to life; Fleischer competently commands intimate moments that reveals the true nature of the characters, and vividly uses the language and visual dynamics of film to emphasise the world of the characters and how it motivates and controls their sometimes irrational behaviour A major contribution to the overall impact and success of Gangster Squad is Will Beall's exceptional screenplay. Beall, who launched his writing career in 2006 with the publication of his acclaimed first novel, L.A. Rex, after working for 10 years as a homicide detective and gang investigator with the Los Angeles Police Department, proves that if you write what you are familiar with, the truth and honesty of the telling results in superior storytelling that is provocative, commanding and laced with a wicked sense of humour. Fleischer knows how to make the most of a great script, and turns words into action that is visually arresting, spectacular and filled with meaningful intent. Los Angeles in the 40s was an era of affluence and corruption and Fleischer meticulously captures the period. He allows for a breathtaking visceral cinematic tour de force that culminates in an emotional connection between the audience and film; he masterfully uses the medium to bring the story to life. In one scene, when O'Mara vengefully approaches Cohen at Slapsy Maxie, the nightclub where Cohen spends his evenings dining with the public officials he keeps in his pocket, Fleischer uses Steve Jablonsky's powerful score to turn an ordinary event into extreme suspense; he places a Christmas Tree with all its trimmings in the midst of a thundering shootout, and through meticulous editing by Alan Baumgarten and James Herbert, the popping of bullets in effective slow-motion is intercut with smashing baubles. Another unforgettable moment in the film is when O'Mara bursts into his house to find out what happened to his heavily pregnant wife after the mobsters riddled their house with bullets. In the tradition of classic shootouts like Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde, Brian de Palma's The Untouchables, Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, and Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch Fleischer pays respectful homage with Gangster Squad; the bloody deaths are voluptuous, shocking and poetic. Flawlessly lensed by Australian-born Dion Beebee, who studied in South Africa before moving abroad, the stylistic Film Noir approach, combined with a contemporary digital format, adds texture and ambiance to the period and gives the film a believable and authentic constructed realism. Beebee's 'nourish' lensing perfectly captures the conflicted lives of men imprisoned by greed and caught between the wholesomeness of family and decadence of corruption. From its shocking opening scene to its illuminating finale, Fleischer and his creative team immerse the audience into the reality of Los Angeles in the late forties. The reality allows for a real connection between the violence, compassion and camaraderie. Gangster Squad is also not just a film about violence, but a powerful statement of how crime and gangs can tear the fabric of family and society to shreds. Fleischer shows that violence in film can be graceful, and its poetic justice underlines the cruel and malicious nature of human beings and their intentional or inadvertent actions. If you enjoy crime films and human dramas with bite and aptitude, Gangster Squad provides ideal escapism into the past, allowing a harrowing story of corruption and evil to resonate and reflect our contemporary crime ridden cities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster Squad: it's the Untouchables but darker, grittier and better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film started out with a guy pretty much being pulled apart by two cars, there isn't too much blood splash or gore in it, it's just gangsters being badass. Shortly afterwards one of the good guys ends up taking a bad guys hand off by shoving it out of the grille door in a lift, letting solid concrete do the work. This film can best be described as the Untouchables but on crack. If you took the Untouchables and removed Sean Connery's almost James Bond-esque cheesy lines, made it darker, more gritty and you are getting close to Gangster Squad. Where some films of this kind have an air of triumphalism throughout, this is a battle for the good guys from the first bullets to the last punch. However, there is humour within, yet it is more of a dark almost "soldier" humour within it.There are a couple of points in around the first third of the film where you might think they could have left on the cutting room floor, but if you watch carefully you will realise these segments of getting the gang together do add value later on. The film isn't too heavy to watch and the effort to make this a realistic depiction of 1940's LA has obviously been put in. This isn't James Bond with massive all encompassing battles involving trains, diggers, tanks or anything too epic. This film is the grit, up close and personal street fighting with a tommy gun in each hand. Whilst the emphasis is more biased towards the good guys, they don't have an easy ride. This film could very well appeal to many on several different levels, whether it be fans of gangster films or just a bit of an old fashioned incorruptible cops in a highly corruptible world kind of film.</fullReview>

John O'Mara, who is assigned to lead the cops, in bringing Cohen to justice. Alongside him are Ryan Gosling as Sgt. Jerry Wooters, Anthony Mackie as Det. Coleman Harris, Giovanni Ribisi as Det. Conway Keeler, Michael Pe?a as Det. Navidad Ramirez, and Robert Patrick as Det. Max Kennard. Complicating matters is a stunning Emma Stone as Grace Faraday. Also Nick Nolte as Chief Bill Parker has a great cameo.The films strengths lie with Penn and Brolin. Both drive the film with their respective actions. Brolin representing the law has to make some very difficult decisions. Penn at first is very funny, then turns very scary, it is a revelation, to see this.Great locations, enthralling action, this is my 1st best film 2013.</fullReview>
