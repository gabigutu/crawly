		<shortDescription>Destined to be a Christmas classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to a special showing as one of the events to mark the centenary of the Alliance Française in Canada's capital, I had the privilege of attending a North American premiere of this remarkable film just two days before today Remembrance Day (Veterans Day in the U.S.) Both an appropriate theme and a cinematic Christmas gift come early. I think it may become my top film among several hundred seen this year, just as A Very Long Engagement - also set in the trenches of the First World War - captured my heart and critic's choice last December. Writer-director Christian Carion and all the actors do an amazing job in this multi-country Euro co-production. It should appeal not only to audiences across that continent but to film goers around the world. In addition to presenting a parable from real life relevant for any war-torn age, including our own I might add, Carion works wonders with front-line incidents great and small while drawing compelling individual character portraits from a top notch Scots, French and German cast, each speaking in their native language and accents. That goes for even relatively smaller roles: for example, that of the junior German officer at the front, Lieutenant Horstmayer (ironically a Jew who recalls a Paris honeymoon with his French-speaking wife), as played by the superb young actor Daniel Brühl (Goodbye Lenin, The Edukators). There is so much more that could be said about this remarkable and timely movie with a timeless message. Even had France not chosen Joyeux Nöel as its selection for the 2006 Oscar best foreign-language film category, I would herald it and rejoice in the advent of a new classic that is in another class altogether from the general run of "holiday movies". A story of harsh truths as well as transcendent art, it finds humanity and hope in the midst of battlefield horrors. Seasonal glad tidings indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Footnote to the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This very touching story about a true occurrence during the first Christmas of the Great War is very moving. Although the truce was not a generalized event, it did happen in quite a few areas all along the front line. It was the only moment of sanity in an otherwise gruesome experience in futility. Twenty years later, these same countries would be at it again.Karl Marx said that wars are awful events pitting ordinary people (proletariats) one against another for the benefit of the wealthy, the powerful, the aristocrats. This aspect is depicted very well in this movie. I would just like to add a footnote: Alfred Anderson, the last survivor of the Christmas Truce of 1914 died November 21th, 2005 at a nursing home in his native Scotland. He was 109 years old. Lest we forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joyeux Noël - Marry Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I invited a friend with me to watch this movie, I had very low expectations. I usually don't like French movies, and I don't like war movies. At the beginning of Joyeux Noël, the director of the film said that it was based on a true story and that he wished that if we liked the movie, that we would tell everyone about it and recommend it. And so I will! One can't usually laugh of a war movie, but I did. It was filled with much humor, and I found it very amusing! The cat, the music, the people -it was all very incredible, and I will give you my word that I will buy this movie on DVD -it's already on my wish list!!! I recommend everyone to take a look at this significant movie! -Jeanett Stykket, Oslo, Norway</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was sceptical before watching this film but by the end I had tears running down my cheeks.By depicting the feelings and destinies of the soldiers, the film demonstrated the absurdity of war and how each soldier is more than a mere cannon target. It is a commentary on the utter stupidity of politics governing war events from behind curtains while not actually experiencing the real war. By depicting a unique event in European war history that occurred on Christmas day 1914 it shows viewers that Europeans can be as one even as "enemies".About ten years ago I watched Paul McCartney's video "Pipes of Peace" and thought that what it depicted was completely fictitious--nothing more than pacifists' dreams. I have now learned that it was true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night I went to special screening of Joyeux Noël ahead of it's release on 22nd of December.Wow, what an amazing movie. As a rule I generally tend to blacklist war movies but this so different.This is in no way about the glorification of war but instead tells a tale of a group of human beings that see past their differences for one night.Apparently all based on true events known as the The Christmas Truce of 1914.I highly recommend this movie to any and all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zut alors! WW1 drama Joyeux Noel arrives under a big black wintry cloud, having been selected to represent France in the Best Foreign Language Film category over the much-hyped March of the Penguins at the 2006 Oscars. Insane, they said! It can't be done, they said! As co-producer Jean-Francois Camilleri fumed, Penguins (France's most successful export at the US box office) was "finally a foreign film that Americans love. It just proves the stupidity of French politics in this profession." Well, sour raisons to yeaux and yeaux and yeaux: unwanted child Joyeux Noel is a joy from start to finish and should hold its head up high against those rambler birdies in dinner jackets.Mostly, we should give thanks and praises that Ron Howard didn't get his hands on it first. Here's a more-or-less authentic account of that near-mythical Christmas in 1914, when Scottish, French and German soldiers proclaimed a temporary armistice, swapped champagne and cigarettes and played footie together ("looks like trouble for the Jerries", a Scottish soldier observes wryly, like a dug-in Des Lynam). From the sickening horror of No Man's Land, to the elegiac carolling of the bagpipes - and the almost off-hand revelation that Bruhl's German captain is Jewish - everything here is perfectly judged.There's humour here too, albeit of the slightly mordant variety, and even the appearance of a local French farmyard cat, claimed by each side as their own, doesn't upset the potentially fatal juggling act. In the midst of this, a living snow angel (Kruger) delivers an ice-melting burst of opera, the impact of which you can blame on a bad cold. The denouement, in which the troops are judged by the superior officers as having been guilty of "high treason" is underscored only by an excoriating sermon by Ian Richardson's Bishop who, far from applauding his priest's generosity of spirit (having delivered "the most important mass I ever gave"), reminds his chastened men that Christ came "not with Peace but with a sword"; that these Godless Germans should be cut down, every man, woman and child. Subtle it ain't, but it does act as a sobering reminder of the Church's culpability in both World Wars. Ultimately, Joyeux Noel achieves the near-impossible, by keeping the treacle to a minimum while leaving one in no doubt about the finer aspects of humanity. Utterly magical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a new xmas classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always had an interest in WW1 and when I discovered that a film about that conflict was being released, I knew I'd have to see it as soon as possible. This is a very special movie. Telling the story of the extraordinary Christmas truce between waring soldiers in the trenches at Christmas 1914, it demonstrates just how ludicrous war really is and how the human spirit can overcome blind hatred. Performances, cinematography and direction don't really matter in this film. Though all these elements are of a high quality. What's important about this film is its message. It is a "feel good movie" with a difference. The difference is that the plot is based on a true event. It is sure to become a fixture on Christmas T.V. listings over the coming years. But go and see it now. Particularly if, like me, your beginning to get cynical about this time of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! Joyeux Noel was a great movie. I wasn't sure if I was going to like this film but found it to be moving, heartwarming and a wonderful cinematic experience.The fact that the story is based on real events that happened shows that their is some good in humans across the world. In this story, all sides are respected as humans and the soldiers come to understand that under God, we are all one.Please, even if you don't normally go to foreign language films or war movies, go to this film. The war scenes are not prolific. You will come out changed and smiling from the inside out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly powerful and must see film about the futility of war.It depicts that whatever those in power would have us believe there are more similarities between various nationalities than differences.Wonderful performances by many little known actors.First class cinematography and other production values.Illustrates that there can be no war if if if you have no enemy. It is impossible to kill a man with whom you have shared drinks and stories and grown to likeWonderful music and singing as those who have suffered and fought each other in the trenches slowly gather to mark Christmas Eve by drinking and talking with each other, swapping addresses, singing Christmas carols common to all three nations (Germany, France and Scotland), burying frozen corpses and playing soccer together.Not perfectly historically accurate but very close to an actual incident, A vivid illustration of the foolishness of war. While some have laid the blame at the feet it is clear that the primary blame lays with those who order others to go to war while safely enjoying the better of things far from the trenches</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Power of Song as a Gateway of Understanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/director Christian Carion ('Une hirondelle a fait le printemps' aka 'The Girl from Paris') is unafraid to write and create cinematic tales that touch the heart as well as the mind. 'Joyeux Noël' is a story of war and its effects on soldiers that goes far beyond sentimentality (or the opposite emphasis on brutality as found in American films) and offers the viewer insights to the responses of young men's minds to the monster of war and how they cope.Based on a true story, the film opens with the usual callous killing among three groups of soldiers - German, French, and Scottish - who face an oncoming Christmas Eve in the trenches, the realities of fighting have precluded their getting time to retreat for air. But a miracle happens: among the Germans is a famous opera tenor Nikolaus Sprink (Benno Fürmann) who has aligned with his fellow troops in the trenches, hoping he can bring some minor sense of Christmas and understanding to them. His soprano partner Anna Sorensen (Diane Kruger) finds a way to be with him in the trenches on Christmas Eve, 1914. Meanwhile the disgruntle troops of all three sectors are planning meager festivities and a bit of relaxation even in the trenches as the bodies of the day's plunder lie in the snow of no man's land. We get to know the French Lieutenant Audebert (Guillaume Canet) and his orderly Ponchel (Dany Boon), the German head of the regiment Horstmayer (Daniel Brühl), and the Scots - especially the priest/medic Palmer (Gary Lewis).Christmas Eve comes and the voice of Sprink (in reality the tenor Rolando Villazón) sings 'Stille Nacht', rising out of the trenches to sing in the open of no man's land. Soon he is accompanied by the Scottish bagpipes and the 'chorus' of the Germans, the Scots and the French. They all emerge, share gifts of champagne and other libations, and agree to a cease-fire in honor of the holiday. It is in this magic moment that the true personalities of these warring men surface and each is seen as a vulnerable puppet of the WW I, exchanging addresses to meet after the war. Anna Sorenson has managed to enter the scene and during a communal mass led by Palmer she sings (the voice is Natalie Dessay) an Ave Maria (composed by the film's composer Philippe Rombi): the lovers have previously sung a duet version of Bach's 'Bist du bei mir'. For that moment in time the horrors of war melt and the camaraderie of the men glows and is carried into Christmas Day when all three groups of soldiers agree to bury their dead together. Of course the brutality and ignorance of war re-engages and the leaders of the three groups enter camp and threaten courts martial and punishment for the troops' lack of military discipline. The film ends in a manner that leaves the audience able to integrate the happenings of that Christmas Eve on the futures of these men.The script is superb, the cast is uniformly excellent, the sets and cinematography are creatively moody, and the musical score by Philippe Rombi is one of the finest in years: the ending song 'I'm Dreaming of Home' deserves to become a standard. Would that everyone could see this film, a bit of global hope in the cloud of the destruction that shadows our world right now. Highly recommended. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie about the foolishness of war, how religion causes wars and how there is really no division between church and state</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an incredibly well acted and executed film. It is thought provoking about the obvious issues of war and peace and how the enemy looks like us.The film is set on Christmas Eve at the beginning of World War I. The film opens with showing the naiveté of youth as the word of war being declared spreads through the town. The local parish priest follows his young parishioners into the battle field. This really is an ensemble piece with many fine and talented actors. It has the added bonus of incredible music. It also has important themes about the role of religion in the world. How good will try to raise it's head in even the most dire of times and then evil shoots it down. While I think that this film is a must see, I fear that the negative depiction of organized religion will keep this movie from the praise it so richly deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did it take 90 years to put this on the silver screen?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About three years ago, I read about this story in a magazine. I instantly contacted a friend who is a film producer and told him about what I thought would have to be a wonderful movie. Although he told me that some others were already planning to do this, my hunch was right. Great story, great film, although I agree that both Führmann and Krüger aren't exactly doing a good job when they are dubbing the touching soprano's and tenor's voices. I wouldn't actually say that she's bad, but for a woman confronted at the same time with the horrors of the trenches and the human spirit's ability to overcome them, while trying to save her lover from this place, her performance is not, well, particularly emotional.Bizarrely, even for Germany, the version released to cinemas across the country this week is almost entirely dubbed in German. This, I might say, adds some strange kind of comedy when ordinary soldiers from the trenches act like they don't understand the other while both speaking perfect German. On the other hand, it makes the German lieutenant, who actually speaks both English and French look overly ridiculous when he tries to utter "chouette".There are so many memorable moments in this film it is hard to come up with them all, even immediately after leaving the theatre. But I particularly loved the opening scene in which three little boys, in Germany, France, and Britain respectively, are standing in front of a blackboard and are repeating the jingoist everyday rhetoric of the day, and the scene in which the church leader is preaching to new Scottish troops that they are on a crusade against evil, right after he "fired" the field priest for performing the Christmas mass with the soldiers who fraternised with each other.In any other context, I would have said this is over the top, too open a reference to the religiously influenced jingoist rhetoric of certain world leaders of this day - but I'm pretty sure it's an accurate reflection of the indoctrination of 1914-1945. And that's even more scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eventually, one of the best Christmas classic that we have...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility".Joyeux Noel (aka Merry Christmas), a heartwarming film set in the World War 1 trenches is a ? 19M joint production of France, Germany and the UK with star studded talented cast of Diane Krüger, Daniel Brühl, Brenno Fürmann, Guillame Canet, Garry Lewis and Danny Boon.Merry Christmas is a very poignant film surrounded by beautiful Christmas carols and well written storyline. It is like the heartbreaking moments of Saving Private Ryan plus the uplifting energy of Love Actually combined together in a single package.Christmas Eve of 1914, the English, French and Germans celebrated the Christmas Eve together in the war trenches singing, drinking and sharing their pictures from home. The film's opening credit is pretty impressive; it begins with children of different nationalities talking about their understanding of war. Things like why they should get rid of one another to ease the danger and make this world a better place to live in, but the question is, do we really have defined or particular enemies? In Merry Christmas, unbelievable but true, they have extended the fraternization for three more days to bury the victims of war in both sides. I found a very moving scene in the film where the officials are talking about Christmas, the day when Christ was born is the very same day when they are burying their comrades. In the end of the film, I have my teary eyes when they are all going back to war and forget about their so called "crime of fraternization" and then they sang the song "I'm Dreaming of Home". History has kept this truth for years because on that time, they believed that it is a crime of disobedience and disloyalty for their countries. But I guess it is damn better to be loyal to the human race in general right? In one of the last scenes, the English priest is telling the soldiers that the World War I is a crusade, a battle between good and evil, the English and French being the savior and the Germans are the evil ones. Well, I know it is pretty controversial but I never believe in the literal meaning of the world 'Crusade', the crusade that they are talking about that there are definite groups of people that would assume the word good and bad is just absurd.Looking at Joyeux Noel, the most outstanding aspect of the film is probably the strong direction from Christian Carion, he is a very emotional director who can effectively show human reaction to the absurdity and hostility of war. The cast is also very powerful not only because of their acting skills (we know that already) but it features box office hit makers such as Diane Kruger. But the best performances from the movie came from Daniel Bruhl (not because I'm a fan), Guillame Canet (France' answer to Tom Cruise) and Danny Boon, the one who played the role of the priest. The film score is fantastic, it features old recognizable Christmas carols and I just love the song I'm Dreaming of Home, it is so touching and nostalgic. This movie is definitely one of the best five movies of 2005.Last night, there are just three people watching the last full show. But despite of this, I realized one thing, if it's always Christmas everyday, may be those millions of people did not loose their lives in the series of senseless wars?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carols in the trenches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Joyeux Noel" integrates a large European cast as the film explores the Christmas Eve truce of 1914, something that has been documented in other films about WWI. Where writer/director Christian Carion succeeds is in the way he presents the material for the screen.We are taken to the trenches, where German, French, and Scottish troops are seen fighting a fierce battle in which the Germans are showing a superior advantage from their side. During the exchange many soldiers die and are left in the snow covered field as the troops regroup to consider what kind of action to take.In the spirit of the Christmas holidays the men from each faction are given extra rations, ornaments, and even trees and liquor from each of their countries to celebrate the occasion. It's a wonder to see the German side awash with small trees that are lit and raised over the edge of their trenches. Suddenly, there is the sound of music everywhere and the commanders of each faction come together to declare a cease fire so the men can celebrate Christmas Eve.It's at this point that the main point of the film is made, as the terrible war seems to recede and all the men come together to rejoice, more like friends, than enemies. It's a lovely moment in which peace on earth seems to be achievable.As all this is happening, Anna Sorenson, a talented singer, comes to the German side to be reunited with her tenor husband, Nikolaus Sprink. They are instrumental for bringing more joy to the men by joining their wonderful voices to sing traditional songs and carols.Among the cast, Diane Kruger, Bruno Furmann, Guillaume Canet, Daniel Bruhl, Bernard LeCoq, Ian Richardson, Alex Ferns, and other actors from many countries come together to celebrate and forget the insanity and death that surrounds them.Christian Carion is to be congratulated for bringing this story to the screen as it shows human nature at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacifism, Religious, Political, and Human drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the most moving and powerful films I have ever seen. It speaks to the pointlessness of war without being at all typical to our American views of pacifism. It is beautiful and magnificent, with some incredible performances, especially by Daniel Bruhl, Guillaume Canet, and Gary Lewis. Set on Christmas Eve in 1914, during World War I, soldiers from France, Scotland, and Germany sing Christmas carols together, share champagne and chocolate, and say mass before returning each other's dead the next day. The difficulty comes when their commanding officers order them to shoot shortly after this incident and none will, having looked their enemies in the face, exchanged addresses, and learned stories from their enemies' lives. War becomes a shared human experience resulting in a bond that cannot be explained to church officials, country leaders, or even each other. This film is an experience that leaves you reeling and thinking about those whom we (Americans) slaughter abroad, how they all have faces, stories, and purposes. You will leave the theater and not know quite what to do with yourself! Everyone should see this film once; no other film could ever live up to the humanly universal experience that this film depicts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film the day before Christmas Eve last year and I have to say that it was the highlight of my Christmas. No, I did not have a rubbish holiday - the film just made me realise what Christmas must be like for the people who do not enjoy the relative peace we take for granted.I cannot think of a single bad thing to say about the film. And this from someone who usually avoids foreign language films like the plague because it annoys me when the words are out of time with the movement of the lips.I thought that using actors from each of the countries involved in the conflict was a master-stroke and made it all so much more believable. I shed a tear at the end, though I could see why the men needed to be moved from the front having made friends with 'the enemy.' I know that this is going to be a must see film for me every Christmas and I am eagerly awaiting the release of the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christmas' Miracle and Insanities of War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the Christmas Eve of 1914, in the Western Front in France in World War I, the Scottish, the German and the French troops have a moment of truce and share moments of peace and friendship. When the soprano Anna Sorensen (Diane Krüger) succeeds in convincing the Prussian Prince to join her tenor husband Nikolaus Sprink (Benno Fürmann) to sing for the German high command, Sprink brings her to the front to sing for his comrades in the trench. The Scottish Lieutenant Gordon (Alex Ferns) and the French Lieutenant Audebert (Guillaume Canet) have an informal and unauthorized meeting with the German Lieutenant Horstmayer (Daniel Brühl) and negotiate a truce for that night, and the priest Palmer (Gary Lewis) celebrates a mass for the soldiers. When their superiors become aware of the event, they have to pay for the consequence of their armistice."Joyeux Noël" is a dramatization with fictional characters and situations of a true event of a Christmas' miracle and insanities of war. The story is extremely beautiful and recalls one of those masterpieces of Frank Capra, with a magnificent anti-war message, and I have included this wonderful and remarkable movie in my list of favorites ever. This is the first film that I see from director and writer Christian Carion, and I was really impressed with this classy and very well acted production. The wonderful Diane Krüger deserved a nomination to the Oscar for her brilliant top-notch performance in the role of Anna Sorensen; and she is perfectly dubbed by the French soprano Natalie Dessay and the soundtrack is awesome. There is a joke, I do not know whether intentional or not, when Horstmayer tells Audebert that he is not married with a German wife (in 2005, Canet was married with the German Diane Krüger). My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Feliz Natal" ("Happy Christmas")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The miracle continued</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer gave me the impression that the events on Christmas Eve is the grand finale of the movie so when I saw that scene coming just about an hour into the movie, I was a little surprised, happily so. The miracle continued into Christmas day, and beyond.But I must back up a little and plead ignorance. The miraculous events that took place on Christmas Eve in 1914 may not be as widely known to the world as some might think. This was the European arena of the first "World War", which was in fact essentially a European war, a war that means far less than WWII to the world outside Europe, even English speaking North America and Australia. And after all, it's over 90 years ago.The story is unquestionably worth telling and judging from the unadorned style of the storytelling, it would seem that it was told quite truthfully. The sweeping panoramic aerial shot and grandiose music at the start conjures up sort of a Lord of the Rings feeling, but it gets down to earth soon, introducing the key characters and bringing the audience to the battlefield.While the events were the best manifestation of the Christmas spirit, there is also a embedded love of music which, strangely, brought to my mind the "banjo duet" scene in "Deliverence". Far-fetched as it may sound, there are similarities in having music as the bridge that breaks the ice of communication.Happening over 90 years ago, this is a miracle founded on a common Christianity heritage, which traverse national and language barriers. The movie makers did make a small point that it was beyond Christianity, by showing how a Jewish German soldier was moved. It is also realistic that the miracle did not touch every single person - for the Scottish soldier, the loss of a beloved brother was just too great.But it was heart-warming that the miracle did not stop at the magical Christmas Eve, but continued on into the glaring reality of the bright Christmas Day, and beyond, in a relatively simpler world at the turn of the last century. Today, a miracle of this magnitude would require a lot more. It would be a huge challenge to just write a fictional script, let alone find a true story. I am hoping that Steven Spielberg will take up this challenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The French really know how to make a movie about war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carion's movie Joyuex Noel has placed a flower of history, into the barrel of the gun of war. I cried, I laughed. It was gripping. Maybe because I am a Vet. Joyeux got a standing ovation in the theater I saw it in. Common soldiers learned to see past their flags of war, &amp; recognize themselves in the face of their enemies. Their realized war is insane, childish, silly and not for adults. It is no accident this movie came out of France. That whole society is 100% against the US Pentagon war machine pirates bloody attack on Iraq. The punch line in the movie Joyuex, that most movie critics seem to miss, is that all the mutineers, Scottish, French &amp; German, were them executed by their own officers as soon as they started following orders again. As when all the German soldiers were locked in box cars &amp; shipped to another front line, to be forced into another battle, until they were all killed. This, to try to silence the knowledge of this beautiful Xmas mutiny, this great leap forward for the whole human race on Xmas day. To prevent the press from learning about how the war, WWI, ended before it had even begun. Look at he million of people who died in WWI, after this first battle. What would have happened if these 3,000 now humanize solders had quite fighting &amp; gone back home &amp; talked about how they stopped the war!. Or to write books about the love they experienced on that day? They had the guns. They could have just started marching back home. I want to know more about this battle. Did any of them survive? Did any of them go on to write books? Remember, this was the initial battle in WWI &amp; it stopped the war! This shows the power of soldiers to control war. What if they had refused to follow orders, imprisoned the commanding officers, as they came from HQ, to restart the war, &amp; stayed in their fox holes! They could have formed, hell, they did form an army for peace, for a week. If they could have just held their fire for a month, they could have stopped WWI before it went any further. The story could have gotten back to their villages. And the press. If they had just held out for a month, taken their officers prisoners. Then their own governments would have had to have sent in more troops, their own cousins, to attack their own troops. The new troops would never have fired on their own kind. WWI would have ended, before it ever began. That is the lesson of this fabulous movie. Now, how can we reach the teenage boys with this movie? This French cinema director Christian Carion deserves a Nobel Prize for Peace for his excellent &amp; exciting movie. Peace is an economic system. Joyeux Noel exposes how common soldiers can bring peace, even in the middle of a war. Using songs. I participated in a Navy mutiny in 1961, during the US invasion of Cuba. I was given a year of punishment duty for refusing to help invade Cuba. So I was really happy to see another movie on how soldiers can say No! to their officers, in a musical way &amp; actually stopped a war. Our mutiny in 1961 did not stop the Bay of Pigs, but because we 30 sailors at Patuxant River said NO! to our officers, as did hundreds more in other military bases, President Kennedy, knew he had the support of the majority of the common soldier &amp; sailors in the military. So JFK stopped the invasion of Cuba. Because JFK had spine, Bush &amp; the CIA then ambushed JFK in Dallas, as punishment for JFK?s refusing to attack Cuba. President Kenndy died a hero, for participating in our mutiny. God bless JFK. My life story is based on my experiences. True events. I took the time to speak up against an illegal attack on Cuba. While I was in the Navy. Most people can have an exciting life too, if they will just turn off the TV, get out of their apartment, &amp; go fight the war machine. Even by making another great film like Joyeux. There are still great battles to be won, &amp; it can be fun, based on true events. You will survive &amp; have fun, in the long run.We Vets for Peace are now doing marches in all 50 state capitals, July 4th, 2006, to bring the US troops back home before Christmas 2006.

		<shortDescription>MERRY Christmas REVIEW</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Merry Christmas is a French War movie written and directed by Christian Carion in 2005. It deal with the Christmas Truce of the First World War in December 1914 between the French, Scottish and German soldiers. Christian Carion directed other movies such as Monsieur Député in 1999,and L'Affaire Fareweel in 2009.This movie was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards. It was screened out of competition at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.The actors contributed to the success of the movie : Benno Fürmann, Guillaume Canet, Diane Kruger, Gary Lewis, Alex Ferns, Danny Boon.But if someone thinks it's thanks to them, I find the characters flat, There is a lack of complexity in them even if throughout the story the History is showing. Despite that I was overwhelmed by this movie.The main plot of the movie : « One Chirstmas Day of the officers have coffee together and decide to « bury their dead on the day Christ was born ». Later, the soldiers play a football match. » The scene when soldiers are able to fraternize shows the fact that soldiers are not just « machine to kill ». This scene permits to highlight the humanity of soldiers because most of the time in war movies we forget the fact that they have a heart. During this Truce, the soldiers are on an equal footing whatever their nationality, they all have, during the Christmas, memories about their family, and faith.Christian Carion encountered difficulties to find a ground of some hectares because of the French Army. He found a French military training ground but the commandant of the base said 'no' ! Moreover he participate in the hostility of militarist because he refused to show archives of the army which prove the existence of brotherhood during the war. But he finally found a ground in Romania. Despite that, Christian Carion is « armed » as far as the scenario is colored, fed by small real facts (the cat which passed from one camp to the other...) The acting is perfectly managed with sometimes elegance...Merry Christmas sound like a « anti-war » movie if I could say so, even if it's a war film because the film celebrate Man capacity for empathy and forgiveness.AdelineI found spectacular the fact that was able to mix fraternization and humanity with the atrocity because we never lose the horror of war even if it's Christmas Truce. Despite the war, the language, despite cultures, men under their statute of soldiers will meet and appraise during some hours because the military authorities will stop.It's an irreproachable realism, this movie gives us a parenthesis of love and peace which raises several questions to the spectator, like the legitimacy of war. Merry Christmas, a lesson of humanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never have I been moved so much by a movie. I first saw it in France, with my wife, in December 2005, after having spent the week in Ypres and its surrounding battlefields. As a historian, I am aware of the extremely localized setting of the 1914 Christmas truce and thus, of its geographical (un)importance. I am also aware of the highly stylized and symbolic rendering in the movie, of the real events of 1914. But as a soldier, I cannot help thinking "My God, what if the truce had spread all along the line until all soldiers refused to wage this (in retrospective) basically useless war?" Simply hearing "Bist Du bei Mir" will forever bring tears to my eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film overall!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joyeux Noel or Merry Christmas should be shown every year on television. It is beautiful movie about the true meaning of Christmas. The director does a brilliant job in depicting three military units like the Germans, French, and the Scottish who are fighting the first Christmas away from their loved ones and facing an invisible enemy. While they stop and have informal and unauthorized ceasefire on Christmas Eve. The soldiers whether German, Scottish, or French begin a platonic fraternization of brotherhood. It's nice to see a film about war that isn't. As they become friends, they share good times even for a brief time. Their leaders will face the consequences of resisting to continue battling in no mans land. Yet there are beautiful moments like when they start singing together and playing music. It's still a great film and should be viewed around the holiday season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If "Joyeux Noel" Is Not A Classic Yet, It Will Be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the many films that take place during Christmas, most succeed in entertaining. Some give a credible message of hope with which audiences genuinely identify.However, only two movies of which I know succeed in moving audiences and rekindling their hope in the virtues of which mankind is capable: "It's A Wonderful Life" (1946), and this movie."Joyeux Noel" is not just a Christmas movie. I imagine anyone who sees this film will make an emotional connection to it regardless of their race, color, or creed.Based on a true story, the film chronicles the start of what was then known as the Great War, but what we know today as World War I. It's hard to believe when you read about WWI in a text book, but at the time, it was the bloodiest war in (then) recent memory.It's also easy to forget how senseless the war actually was from the very beginning. However, this film succeeds in emphasizing the inhumanity of war through a brilliant beginning montage of children from England, France, and Germany reciting actual text from each nation's respective official war declarations.Putting children in these parts was a smart move, because your attention wouldn't perk up if an adult was saying these lines. When children are seriously discussing war in a classroom, and not on the playground, you know something's amiss. Adding to the cold authenticity, the children speak in their own languages."Joyeux Noel" was filmed and financed in France, Germany, Romania, and Scotland. It's important to note this fact because if it got near Hollywood, EVERYONE in it would be speaking English, a move that regularly damages the credibility of many American films that take place overseas.The film continues showing civilians from France, Germany, and Scotland right when war breaks out in 1914. One young Scottish man is excited to enlist, stating that it is the "start of (his) life". His local priest, Father Palmer (Gary Lewis), is not so sure.You are also introduced to two famous German opera singers who are also lovers, Anna Sorenson (Diane Kruger) and Nikolaus Sprink (Benno Furmann), whose voices are heaven sent. Neither singer is required to enlist in the Great War, but they are both sent to the German front lines to entertain the troops on Christmas Eve.After a few more introductions, we see the Western Front of the war in France, with French, German, and Scottish soldiers engaging in combat that is far from romantic. You see the trenches, not so much of the actual combat, but you don't have to guess how ugly the war actually was.Even worse, these soldiers are fighting on Christmas Eve, when many of them looked forward to returning home to their families. Eventually, what begins as Anna and Nikolaus singing for the German soldiers results in the lieutenants of each platoon agreeing to a Christmas Day ceasefire. However, thanks to these opera singers, what further evolves becomes something more uplifting and moving than just a day off.In 1914, the Great War was far from over. To those fighting in it, there seemed to be no end in sight. However, on that Christmas Eve, as this film so brilliantly elaborates, the battle grounds became an actual common ground for all the troops. Seeing that gradual metamorphosis of the land and the soldiers is truly breathtaking.From this point of the movie on, you may become an opera fan if you weren't one before seeing this film. You will look at the World War I German army in a far better way if you're an American or British person. World War II may be a different story, but go along with me here.Finally, you may never listen to "Adeste Fideles" (the Latin version of "O Come All Ye Faithful") the same way again. It's even more astounding how great holiday songs become better through the darkest of times, and that is probably the point of the entire movie.Just like "It's A Wonderful Life", "Joyeux Noel" details a bleak time in history, and shows how the human spirit of generosity can make a world of difference through even the darkest times. The comparisons to the 1946 classic don't stop there."Joyeux Noel" has a story line that gradually builds to a grand conclusion, and the sum of the previous events is not equal to its parts. Like "It's A Wonderful Life", the thrill is seeing how all the circumstances come together to create that conclusion. It may be complicated to detail to friends, but once you see the movie, you realize it's more profound than just cocktail party chatter.While these two movies differ greatly in their plots, they also have a few other things in common. "Joyeux Noel", with a budget of $22,000,000, made less than that worldwide, thereby making it a flop. It also was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2005, but lost.However, just like "It's A Wonderful Life", it will be considered a classic soon. It may not be next year, but it could be 10 years from now, or even 20. It's not just an entertaining film, but a truly great and important film.There are no magic tricks in this film to remind the characters about the true meaning of the holiday season, and for good reason. Kindness and charity are things of which all humans are capable even in terrible times. "Joyeux Noel" gets that idea. I only hope that others who see this remarkable cinematic achievement will take away that message, and still come back to the movie year after year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Piece of Heaven in the Middle of War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Joyeux Noel French director Christian Carion created one of my favorite war movies. Using historical facts to create a dramatized interpretation, he crafts a heartbreaking story about a truce between French, German and Scottish soldiers living in the trenches, on Christmas' Eve of 1914.The movie not only reveals the best of human nature in scenes filled with sadness, humor, mercy and love, but also exposes the absurdity of war by showing how difficult it becomes to kill someone once you've shared a glass of champagne with, or had a laugh with, or played a football match with, or attended mass with. And then asks, why do these people allow rulers to put them in this position in the first place, of having to kill strangers who never did them any harm.Philippe Rombi's score contributes to the paradoxical atmosphere of melancholy and joy that permeates the movie: we know such happiness won't last forever since we've all gone to history classes; but like the soldiers, we enjoy it as long as it lasts. Rombi gives us sweeping epic pieces, intimate melodies, bag pipes for the Scottish soldiers to play and songs for the Germans to sing. It's one of the best scores I've heard in a long time because of its range.The movie benefits from some of the finest European actors working today, including veteran Gary Lewis, who plays a priest who joins the war with the boys from his parish to watch over them. He gives my favorite performance in the movie and represents religious faith and altruism in the best way since the late Ian Charleson played Eric Liddell in Chariots of Fire.Then we have Daniel Bruhl and Diane Kruger, who are now stars thanks to Quentin Tarantino, but who were just getting recognition when they made this movie. Bruhl's performance as the German officer is my second favorite one in the movie.I had the luck of watching this movie on the big screen thanks to a friend who dragged me to it. I've now watched again on the silver screen and it stands as one of the most emotional experiences in cinema for me, and if it depended on me everyone would watch it too. Such beauty existed to be shared and enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to finding out how this historical yet forgotten event would be put to film, and how accurately it would be depicted. I am not disappointed. This evokes emotion without ever slipping into sentimentality or sap. It personalizes without robbing the true occurrence of attention. There is focus put on certain characters(all of which are quite well-written), but never to the point of such being lost on what really happened. The plot is great, and develops well. Some liberties are taken with the story, and they are not all justified, but the core is kept intact, and this manages to both tell what happened and make us feel and care about it. The overdubbed singing could have been subjected to better synchronization, but there is little to any criticisms directed at the acting itself. The same goes for the production value. The technical aspects of this are excellent, as well. The cinematography and editing are just about flawless. Pacing is rather good. Writing and directing are commendable. All three sides each speak the actual languages, adding to the already well-established sense of realism. I recommend this to anyone interested in the period, and the specific situation in particular. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christian Carion has directed a perfectly beautiful drama that documents an important pause from WWI. It is the cinema that depicts the Christmas break in the war that lasted for only the holiday itself. Diane Kruger plays Anna Sorensen, the German opera singer who woos the troops with her magnificent voice and beauty. Her counterpart, Nikolaus Sprink, is played by Benno Furmann, and he too has a very charming appearance as well a voice quality that rivals the best. Guilaume Canet plays Lieutenant Audebert and his acting is believable and satisfying. This is an important docudrama that should be on everyone's list of must see films. It is both educational as well as cinematic perfection. It can now be rented, so be sure to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>at the risk of being redundant, i must say. this is one of the finest most heart warming films i have ever seen. i am not a war movie person, and when i was asked to see this movie i was reluctant, expecting it to be another "everyone dies and the war ends" type of movie, but it exceeded my expectations.this movie used comedy and drama to successfully point out the flaws in war, and the desire for peace. The young men being forced to fight in this war merely wanted the same thing, peace. They were not enemies by choice but by force, and in portraying the friendships made this was clearly evident. It was because of this common want that they were able to form bonds of friendship, through a language barrier and even having been taught to treat the others as enemies. it was after watching this that i was truly hit with the absurdity of war. Why, are the men who start a war, the political leaders, sitting at home enjoying tea while young men are asked to fight until death. And why are these men who were all so connected, through honeymoon locations and faiths and culture, forced to fight against each other? This movie confronts these questions full on.The use of beautiful music, comedy, and heartfelt acting created a movie worth seeing for everyone. Not only those interested in World War I, or War movie in general will enjoy this movie. A classic, and now one of my favorite movies of all time. Please go see Joyeux Noël,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that I originally had some misgivings about watching a movie about World War I. Given the lack of attention it has suffered, I didn't expect historical accuracy or even a good story to be of paramount importance to the movie - and as an amateur historian I'm quite a stickler for these details.However, I'm glad I overcame those misgivings. Although I knew that I was watching a movie, and that these soldiers on the screen were almost entirely, if not quite entirely, fictional, I couldn't resist the outbursts of emotion. I spent the second half of the movie in various degrees of tears.Two days later, the impact has not lessened. This movie, along with its subject matter, has become my sort of argument for proving that human nature is not inherently warlike: that the moment we realize that our opposite numbers are like ours, our hatred, our arrogance, are washed aside. The magnificent display of humanity made by these soldiers has been called the last of such displays. Unfortunately, those who say so may be right.And the world is much sadder for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching film worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a student of history, I enjoy seeing motion pictures that bring to life events in history. Sadly, very few are made, mostly for cable, and those that do make it to the big screen tend to be inaccurate. Despite being a dramatization, this film deftly captured the spirit and essence of the Christmas Eve Truce of World War I. I found the film to be poignant, sad, and funny, with many outstanding moments, my favorite being the clashes between the German officer and the Scottish priest with their superiors over their actions. Of all the powerful performances of the film, the one that stood out best to me was that of Gary Lewis as Father Palmer, from when we first see him in his church, crying over the departure of the town's young men to war, to the final scene in the military hospital. The one thing that struck me in watching the movie, was that the truce was most likely as successful as it was because the soldiers, the British, French, and Germans, all had a shared heritage that created a deeper connection that was able to cross over the boundaries of war, just as Union and Confederate troops did during the Civil War. As such, I would not draw upon it as a truly accurate analogy to modern day events, but it does speak volumes on how useless war can more than often be. It showed for one moment how soldiers, albeit for a brief time, could cast off the coat of the warrior, to reveal the human hidden beneath. This is a film that is worth the effort to go and see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a Moment in Time, War Came to a Halt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War, indeed, is a horrible thing, but two young Scottish lads don't know it. Father Palmer (Gary Lewis) does, as well as Anne Sorensen (Diane Kruger) who watches as her lover, tenor Nikolaus Sprink (Benno Furmann), is called off to war in the middle of a stage production at the Berlin Opera. So does Lieutenant Audebert (Guillaume Canet looking a lot like Patrick Dempsey), who vomits into the floor right before leading his men to battle against the Germans in a remarkable transition from the beautiful, silent moments before the war, to its very trenches.It's in the trenches where we meet the entire cast, which is large and who speak in their native tongues. Among them, there is an enigmatic, sad character, Lt. Horstmayer (Daniel Bruhl) who is in charge of leading his troops to victory. There is some animosity between him and Sprink, whom he does not see fit to serve because he is foremost an artist, and artists have no place in the war. However, a manipulation of events send Anna right into the trenches with the sole intention of reuniting with Sprink and giving a Christmas Eve recital.This recital, which comes halfway through the film, does a little more than alleviate the misery of the German troops. It inspires them to set Christmas trees on top of the trenches where they are stationed. The Scots, in close watch nearby, are stunned at the action: is this a ruse that will garner further attack? Not quite: Sprink sings, then Palmer in a surprise gesture joins the Germans playing his bagpipe. At this point -- the recital -- JOYEUX NOEL opens itself like a lotus flower who was always there: troops put down their arms -- tentative at first -- and under the aegis of the Moon, Palmer gives mass, and Anna sings to the skies, and to them all. War comes to a halt.A truce is declared, at least for the night. But in that time, men become close and get to know each other -- not good when they're on enemy lines. Such a move is considered treason and comes with a price. However, JOYEUX NOEL asks you this difficult question: how can you attack men with whom you've shared bread, wine, life stories, pictures of loved ones, and moments of happiness? Not an easy question to place an answer to and JOYEUX NOEL doesn't want to: being a depiction of actual events makes any sentimentalism moot.One small irony in the movie is that of Horstmayer bring a German Jew and there is an image of he and his troops being sent out in a freight train out into an uncertain future while they hum a Scottish tune. Daniel Bruhl stands out in showing a man caught between duty to his country (when only twenty years later it would release carnage against all Jews) and his own humanity to others who share the same stories, similar lives, hopes, and dreams. It's good to see that this one time, humanity won.</fullReview>

It was a brilliantly beautiful film that shows just how much we are all the same, no matter which side we fight on.It also shows the stupidity of using young men and women as pawns in failed diplomacy.We also can closely look at this film and see the same things happening today as happened in 1914. We who are not fighting are sitting home eating our fat turkeys while our soldiers are fighting and dying. We really don't care as it does not affect us. Sure, we toast our brave men and women, but it is just words.

		<shortDescription>A very different, and powerful, Christmas film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A recreation of the infamous WW1 event, 'Noel' deals with the extraordinary circumstance when, during the first year of The Great War, French, German and Scots laid down arms and celebrated Christmas Eve and Day together, sharing gifts, singing hymns and playing football. Stereotypes and barriers are broken down, and the soldiers begin to see each other as more than just 'the enemy'.A unique war film, 'Joyeux Noel' is more about the human capacity for forgiveness and understanding even in the face of such paramount horror and radical nationalism. It accomplishes via having several aces up its sleeve. First, it boasts a fine range of European talent, including the likes of a young Daniel Bruhl, Diane Kruger, Guillame Canet, Benno Furmann, Gary Lewis and especially, Danny Boon. Sort of the French Sandler/Williams, Boon is a comic actor who proves his dramatic chops here, playing the French Lieutenant's aide/barber. He's sort of a lovable manchild who brings a sort of rural heartiness to the trenches, like having his coffee at 10 every morning to remind him of his mother. In any other film, this could've been obnoxious, but Boon walks the line aptly and the film's careful spreading of humour make it quite charming.On top of this, we also have a moving but sparse choral-centric score, fitting the yuletide setting, and rather convincing recreations of the tight, filthy trench life and the desolation of No Man's Land. It may not be overly gritty or gory, but it still conveys the impression of a place you don't want to be in. As far as negatives go, I have not much to say really. Maybe the superior officers are a little one note 'this is most unorthodox!', but the story's not focused on them, so it's not a big issue. Honestly, what's good here is really good, and makes for one of the most different and best Xmas films out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that spreads powerful messages of humanity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Joyeux Noel' is really a wonderful film. It is true in its historiography of the Christmas Truce of 1914 that happened in Ypres, Belgium; an event that revealed that friendship, music, and humanity really do mute the belligerent sentiments of war.I had little idea of the plot before I saw 'Joyeux Noel.' I thought it might have been yet another World War I epic. For the most part I was right; it is a marvelous WWI epic, but it is dissimilar to all the others. The military ideal of patriotism that is so often saluted in war epics, is belittled in front of the incredible humanity and comradeship that the soldiers showed. I was simply enthralled at what I was seeing: soldiers from three different trenches were sharing champagne, playing soccer, and attending the same Christmas Mass. They were collectively committing high treason, while celebrating a friendship that had no geopolitical borders.Christian Carion's "Joyeux Noel" has enlightened audiences across the globe. This is a marvelous ode to the brave soldiers of WWI who chose to toast together and break bread in a Christmas truce, rather than obey the warmongering orders of high command. It makes us understand the universality of our human experiences, despite wartime propaganda and nationalist sentiments.The acting was superb by the German, French and Scottish actors, and the music was beautifully executed in the spirit of the times. Congratulations to those involved in making this inspiring film a reality. This visually and sonically captivating picture will make you think, make you laugh, and will make you cry.If you have yet to see "Joyeux Noel," definitely consider renting this astounding epic. Seeing it will make you a better person.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So moving and a Yuletide treasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joyeux Noel seemed like an ideal seasonal movie. Already in the Christmas spirit I ventured to watch it, and finished the film with a feeling of hope and tears down my face. It is an incredibly moving film, with a subject matter that anyone would identify with, which is explored intelligently and broodingly here. The cinematography, lighting, costumes and settings are appropriately moody yet very beautifully done, the script is emotionally complex and never overly-preachy and the story is compelling and moved and haunted me a long while after. The characters are believable, no offensive stereotypes or clichés as such here, and the cast particularly Diana Kruger give dynamic performances. And I have to mention the soundtrack, simply divine and one of the best I've heard recently. Oh and for fans of Natalie Dessay and Rolando Villazon, they sing here, and wonderfully might I add, very understated and fitting with not a too original interpretation or over-tensed note in sight. In conclusion, a treasure. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having spent the last three Christmas seasons in Afghanistan, in the Army in RC Capital area, (and am FINALLY home in central PA), I can attest to "I'm dreaming of home; I feel so alone...". Anyone else who also has been "downrange" during the holidays can identify with this film. I cannot see this movie without choking up at multiple points. It was based on true stories of fraternization, which afterward were brutally suppressed and all possible records being confiscated and destroyed. Only by diligent searching for the remaining few records that escaped the censors and other military authorities could this tale be reconstructed. See references at the Noel14-asso in France.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This sleeper woke me up!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! This movie is a real gem and I came across it totally by happenstance.My wife and I discovered it in our local branch library. It was actually she who took it home. I stared at the cover box rather suspiciously. Foreign film, subtitles (not just of one language, but French &amp; German to English), World War 1 (rather dated, it seemed) . . .No, this didn't seem like "my cup of tea . . .", uhh, "my cup of ACTION" (I'm a guy, I drink beer not tea.) For the first 15 minutes or so, I sat there only validating my preconceptions. "This movie is SLOW . . . this movie is too GIRLISH for me . . . not one person has been killed or maimed yet from a karate blow by a macho lead man . . ."Despite my stubborn reluctance, the movie suddenly, somehow, caught my attention. I sat there "enchanted" and mesmerized. (Yes, I actually use the word "enchanted" -- like I said, I drink BEER, I also watch FOOTBALL and BOXING. Despite this, it's really the most appropriate adjective.) The production values are excellent. The story is captivating. The acting, in every way by everyone involved, is fantastic (and considering most of it is done in foreign languages, the fact that I was able to notice how great the acting is alone proves my point).The story is beautiful, sensitive, cool, great, magic, and MEMORABLE. The fact that it's based on TRUE EVENTS only adds to the enchantment.This movie re-instilled my faith in human nature, at the same time that it reaffirmed my criticism of the "powers that be" who distort personkind's inclination for fellowship and foster wars.Enough said. I urge everyone to see this movie. The fact that it didn't win an Academy Award is beyond me. Politics, I'm sure. I'm not talking about Best Foreign Film, either (it WAS nominated for that) -- it should have won Best Film (period!).Whatever your personal politics. Whatever your religious affiliation (or lack thereof). This film cannot "offend" anyone who (like the Tin Woodsman) was given a heart by the Wizard. In the movie, one Prussian (German) officer states, "I'm Jewish!" (And the magic touched him!) I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE 100%. The rest is for you to judge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could anyone dislike this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film in my Foreign Films class, and was touched. I normally hate emotional movies, but somehow, this was an exception. What I admired the most was that despite how it seemed like a fairy tale, the director tried to remain more so than others true to the actual event, and many of the things did happen. The singing really DID happen. The burials really DID happen. Another interesting part was the blend of source music (Music from the scene) and score music (music inserted afterwards)Also, the film went to show the triumph of brotherhood over propaganda. Despite the fact that the citizens are taught how evil the "Huns" and so forth are, the soldiers who actually do the fighting learn otherwise. The French officer said it well, when he pointed out how that the men behind the lines who said things like "Kill the Germans" really didn't know the war itself.The one thing I did not like was that they showed the punishment of the soldiers who took part. I would have preferred that the film ended on Christmas day. Then again, the most touching seen of all would be lost in that case: As punishment, the German soldiers were loaded onto a windowless train and sent off to the Russian front. However, right as the train started to leave, the soldiers started to sing a Scottish song.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joyeux Noel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joyeux Noel was a very moving movie that depicted violence and peace very well. What I got out of this movie is that there is always a potential for peace. Even in the most violent situations. The fact that this movie is based on a true story makes it even more powerful. In history two sworn enemies actually put aside their differences to celebrate Christmas. If they could do it in one of the bloodiest times in history, we can certainly do it today. This movie shows us that peace is very attainable and we simply have to bridge that gap to reach it. Joyeux Noel was a very good movie that did justice to the issue of violence and the potential for peace.There were many powerful scenes in the movie. The most powerful scene of the entire movie was during Christmas Eve. A German began to sing in the trenches and a Scottish soldier began to play to bagpipes to the rhythm of the song. It was very powerful when the German walked right out of his trench where he could have been killed holding a Christmas tree above his head. This man risked everything by leaving his trench and sparked a peace agreement between the armies. Shortly after, still on Christmas Eve, another powerful scene took place. While celebrating mass that night the original singers wife began to sing to the congregation. During her song, soldiers began to cry like it was sung by an angel. The soldiers were so relived to finally have a rest from the warfare and the singing only made the experience more powerful. Christmas Eve came and went and was followed by a period of more peace between the forces. One day, the German commander came to the French trench and warned the French of an artillery bombardment. The French took refuge in the German trenches along with the German soldiers. They huddled together in the dead of winter white bombs tore the French trenches apart. This scene was exceedingly powerful as well. Another powerful scene came after the high ranking French had found out about the peace agreement. The replacement army was at church and the priest was talking about how God wants every German to die. This was powerful because it showed how inhumane people are during times of war. These scenes demonstrated how bad violence is and how good peace is.There was one scene that stood out in particular regarding the issue of violence and the potential for peace. This was the scene where the German began to sing. When he and the Scottish began to sing together he took a Christmas tree from his trench. At first, all you could see was a light coming from the trench across a war torn battlefield. The man was not shot and he created peace between enemies. This is a true story. It shows how one man can truly make a difference regarding violence. If one man can do this, millions can change the world. We could create peace if we really tried to. It does not matter how much nations hate each other; for Germany and France had a history of hatred. All that matters is that we are willing to work towards a peaceful world. This movie was a good example of how a violent world can become a peaceful one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The impossible dream!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recorded this movie from a TV broadcast and before watching it heard from a few people how much they enjoyed it. When I watched it I felt that it must have been recorded live because it was quite a mess on the screen due to unusual interferences during the recording. Pass the frustration of the spoil we managed to see it and all of the 5 of us enjoyed it tremendously. I'm glad that there were notes on IMDb about the story versus the history. Yes it was a little too much to think it may have been true. It's one thing to be inspired by an event but it's another to compare the two if too much liberty has been taken with the inspiration. So one should not loose touch with the reality of war. Although I'm prepare to believe that some extraordinary events took place during this tragic period, I feel it would not have been to the scale portrayed in the film. But it is a film not a documentary and I think it told the story very well, with humour, feelings and class. For the entertainment, from me: Tres chouette! (and here for those who wonder about "chouette", originally I believe it's the noun that describe an owl in French, but it's also a light way to describe something good, nice etc... and the "hibou" it's male counterpart, but the same bird in English, is usually associated with ugliness!) Unlike a comment I read, I appreciated the willingness of the German officer to throw this word in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Holiday Movie with a Bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful holiday movie with a bite. It is based upon actual events during World War I centering upon Christmas Eve of 1914. Historical facts tell us that the soldiers from both sides left their trenches and met in the no-man's zone in a peaceful celebration of the holiday. They exchanged information about their lives, shared holiday goodies, sang, and prayed together. This was all much to the chagrin of the generals and leaders who - after the events of fraternization - disbanded the companies or sent them to other locations.This depiction of those events is highly romanticized, but not totally sanitized. There are brutal scenes of battle that might be disturbing to young viewers, so it is not a movie that a family with elementary aged children or younger will be able to watch together, but older children - hopefully - will be inspired by the humanity that was still able to exist in the midst of carnage and horror. After all, these were real men and women, and these were real events.The basic story centers around two German opera singers - the woman who was able to use her celebrity and influence to actually visit her lover who is serving on the front lines. In reality, the Germans were very enthusiastic about the celebration of the holiday and provided their soldiers on the front lines with Christmas trees. In the film, the soldier begins singing and carries a lighted tree into the line of fire. Historical records show that the singing of the Germans and their practice of putting the lighted trees along the edge of trench often precipitated the holiday fraternization.On the DVD, there is a most interesting interview with the writer and director that gives some good insight to his quest to tell this story on film.Even with the presence of war and death, this film - supported by beautiful music and superior production values - makes you feel good because it reaffirms man's basic humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More high praise {from a movie-loving minister's perspective}</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those disinclined to read long-ish comments, right up front I want to pass on a strong recommendation to watch the Special Feature Interview with the writer/director, Christian Carion--after watching the film of course. (Technical point: Unlike watching the film itself, it seems you have to go to "Subtitles" from the Main Menu and turn on subtitles {in English, Spanish, or Portuguese} and then go to Special Features and choose the interview, unless you understand French.) You're likely to find that his comments--about the historical, archival, and anecdotal sources for events dramatized in the film--enrich your appreciation of it.Now, given all the comments already posted, there's not much more to say in praise of this excellent, stirring, thought-provoking film. As a longtime cinema-loving human being who is a Roman Catholic priest, I simply wish to say that I thoroughly appreciate the humane, moral/ethical richness and complexity of Joyeux Noël. I've already begun recommending it, and can easily imagine watching it and showing it around Christmas-time for years to come.Its portrayal and exploration of the role of religion, like any dimension of the human person and society/culture, is entangled with the "angels of our better nature" (A. Lincoln), as well as the demons of our worst selves and of our collective dynamics.One minor issue I'll mention since I've identified my profession and religious affiliation: One depiction of common knowledge about religious observance confused me slightly. I would have thought there would be more denominational divergence. Chalk it up to my lack of knowledge regarding Christianity in Europe and the U.K. at the start of the 20th Century and/or to the need to overlook specifics for the compelling needs of focused, emotionally-rich storytelling.Finally, this film was one of the Academy Award nominees for Best Foreign Language Film in 2006. Just before watching it this week, I happened to have seen Tsotsi (2005), which won that category. I've also seen another nominee, Paradise Now (2005). Choosing a "Best" from among these three excellent films would seem to be a daunting dilemma.</fullReview>

No better example of such stupidity can be found than in the First World War.

Based on a true event, details may be fictional, but stay in the spirit of the informal truce.Truly a multi-national movie. The cast and dialog seems equally divided between French, German and English (Scots, to be precise. Fun reading subtitles for two languages.

		<shortDescription>Another great European co-production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this day and age, when people seem to war and separate for any possible reason, this is a movie to soothe one's soul. Long story short, it's Christmas Eve, warring parties decide that it's better to have a truce during the holidays, during which Scots, French and Germans party like it's 1914. Well, it was.It is a bit annoying that what seems to unite them is Catholic faith, but in the end you see that religious belief had very little to do with what happened. It was basic human kindness. And it's based on a true story as well.A big cheer for Benno Fürmann, another German actor to make it to Hollywood. I liked him in this movie, as well as in Ring of the Nibelungs and even in The Order, which funny enough was broadcast on HBO the very day I watched Joyeux Noël. I just hope he doesn't turn into another Udo Kier, always present, but cast in stupid or insignificant roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joyeux Noel (Merry Christmas) is about the famed 1914 fraternization during the first world war where both sides felt the spirit and celebrated Christmas together. There's nothing more inspiring than individuals who can overcome the pettiness of the war mongers to provide a little humanity to each other. Fear allows leaders whose primary solution is war to come to power and to relentlessly stoke the fires to keep that fear alive to propagate war. While I don't personally know whether this film is as factual as it should be, it is very believable for people during that era. Trench warfare was extremely tiring and bloody and the people were simply not used to such vast and expansive warfare.

		<fullReview>Based on the true events of Christmas Eve 1914, Joyeux Noel really is one of the best Christmas films I have ever seen, tied with 'It's A Wonderful Life'.How this master piece didn't win its Oscar I have no idea, for it fully deserves it. First of all the screenplay is amazingly, fair to the French, Scottish and German's who each deliver magnificent lines thanks to the wonderful Christian Carion.His direction really is good too. For example, you are shown these different nationalities by their clichés, e.g. the French with wine. But as they meet on Christmas Eve you witness all that disappear.Wonderful actors like Daniel Brühl from Ladies in Lavender, Gary Lewis from Billy Elliot, Diane Kruger from National Treasure and a lot more really portray their characters flawlessly.A brilliant score finishes this epic film to create the kind of story you will never forget.Although I'd recommend waiting for an English release, the French one is a bit confusing!Highly recommended, you'll be wondering by the end, what was the point of the war?Fantastic.</fullReview>

At the end of the year, Christmas arrives with his snow and the family presents for soldiers of different nationalities. But, another unthinkable event will change all the lives of four men: a French lieutenant who is the son of a general, a Scottish pastor, a German opera tenor and a female Danish soprano. Christmas songs and music will be the cement of an incredible fraternization between soldiers of divers nations, German, French, British. During one night and the day after, they are all friends to said "good Christmas" to each other. After that, their different armies for this unbelievable act of friendship will punish them. The movie is a hymn to the friendship between men and a denunciation of the absurdity of war and is very well acted and directed.</fullReview>

Without this remarkable control of tone in the direction, the film would've been the worst kind of "Hallmark" TV schmaltz. Instead, you feel something too rare in the movies today, what Truffaut called "a series of privileged moments." The acting was first rate, too. Some of the featured players are already Hollywood factotums (remember Diane Kruger in Troy and National Treasure?) but everyone in the cast is remarkable. The Scottish clergyman and the French barber are just two examples of character acting that cannot be topped.The Christmas Truce of 1914 is brought to life here, and as one character says about that brief moment of sanity and peace, "you were not there, so you cannot understand." But thanks to this film, the audience feels the privilege of participating in a true miracle.Ah, let's pray for a second miracle: that Spielberg will not attempt a re-make.</fullReview>

To the brutal way that war was fought and wondering just how these men could put aside the deaths of people they were in the trenches with and come together to celebrate one day.The more you find out about the characters the more you care and hope and pray that somehow the day after the war will just end. But we all know history we all know it continued on. We all know that more deaths were to follow and that another war would follow.Rent the movie, watch it twice.

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Nominated for a Best Foreign Film Oscar, it has only now made it to a Dallas theatre. One's opinion of this film will be determined by perspective - watch it as a "message" movie or a "feel good" movie. I believe it is far superior as a feel good film based on actual events. The messages that writer/director Christian Carion touches on seem to be haphazardly tossed in because he thought it might make the film more important. The actions of human nature and the spirit of the soldiers are what makes the film important ... not the arrogance of the generals or the involvement of the church.The well documented, self-imposed WWI Christmas battlefield truce between the Germans, French and Scots is both chilling and heart-warming and really brings to light the outlandishness of war. As fascinating as the calling of the truce is, even more interesting is the camaraderie and confusion felt by the soldiers after Christmas Eve.Although, the cast is huge and character development is non-existent, a few of the actors manage to stand out. The youth and naiveté of German Daniel Bruhl (Goodbye Lenin) and French Lieutenant Guillaume Canet (the one who looks like Patrick Dempsey) are the keys to the truce. Canet's real life wife, super model Diane Kruger, seems to enjoy every one of her close-ups, but her lip-synching is not quite the class of Milli Vanilli. Ian Richardson's brief appearance as a Bishop will have you questioning your religion. There is a very awkward scene joining screen legends Michel Serrault and Suzanne Flon (now deceased). Their scenes are a perfect example of some of the bits and pieces that abruptly change the flow of the film and prevent it from being classic film-making.Definitely worthy of the Oscar nomination, but probably lacking the punch to become a Christmas classic, the film will bring a smile to your face ... while at the same time bring the realization of how lucky the soldiers were to have two world class opera singers and a multitude of bagpipes in the trenches on Christmas Eve.</fullReview>

Nevertheless, this is one movie that everyone should see, Christmas or not Christmas. It will really tug at one's heartstrings, and will leave one in awe-that a truce really happened in history, that it is possible, that basically, all humans share the same thoughts and feelings, no matter what side they are on.This movie also is not afraid to sugarcoat, as it shows the consequences of the truce on officers, men, and even a chaplain. It also has many humorous scenes amidst the drama.On the whole, a movie that is not to be missed. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Xmas in the Trenches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike so many of the current crop of war films this film doesn't over-step the mark with an overly-obsessive focus on the harrowing images or war and a near medical precision with getting the fx right when someone is blown to bits.This film concentrates on some distinct characters - a Scottish Captain, a French Lieutenant and a German Commander and his opera-singing misfit soldier. It is a tribute to the production that the production is for the most part tri-lingual and does it's best to remind the audience that the First World War was in fact fought fairly equally between these three nations on the Western Front (despite the late arrival of the Americans). The plot is nicely balanced and uses some actual facts about the first Xmas in the trenches in 1914 (apparently the Germans did sing 'Silent Night on Xmas eve, and did have Xmas trees on the trench-tops and somehow contrived to play their opposite numbers at a game of soccer on Xmas day!) The script even manages to get a woman into the frontline (deftly played by Diana Kruger - fresh from her debut in Troy) and neatly intertwines the viewpoints of the three warring nations. The three officers are all superbly acted and the real task of any film is to get the audience to care about the characters ... which you invariably do. The Scotsman is an irreverent rogue, but nevertheless a decent sort, the French Lieutenant is a troubled philosopher and missing his wife, the German commander seems harsh at first but gradually warms and shows that he is a young-man in very difficult circumstances.The film has little conclusion other than the futility of war - pretty much standard issue for a WWI film I guess - but because the emphasis is not so much on the fighting but how they carve out a brief reprieve from the insane slaughter, the film does acquire an edge over other similar war films. If you enjoyed 'A Very Long Engagement' then you will like this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Different...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at the screening in Cannes this year. It is a very interesting take on the sometimes over-exploited themes of war so apparent in modern cinema, and calls up memories of "Life is Beautiful". Here you find three lines of soldiers - Germans, French and Scotts - forced to fight a war they don't understand and finally giving in to their own human feelings of friendship and well-being when German singers start to perform Christmas carols between the trenches. It is nice to know that human nature is described here not as a nature of war, but through the immediate aim for peace in these soldiers who all suffer the consequences of their respectively "destructive" acts of fraternization as seen by their own governments.There are many bittersweet and undeniably brilliant scenes here, but there was one problem I had with this film. It is told in three languages (French, German and English) with subtitles and It was sometimes clear to me, being fluent in German and English and understanding French enough, that the director had problem with these foreign languages himself. In fact, he does not speak either German or English sufficiently to be able to direct certain ways of speaking correctly, having to rely on his assistants to help him and therefore the German and English dialoques sound extremely wooden and unnatural. Even the usually great Daniel Brühl has trouble convincing me with his performance and Diane Kruger proves once more that she is simply not made for acting. The scenes where she performs songs are sometimes so badly dubbed (and therefore it is clear that she is not really performing herself) and performed with such lack of emotion that it was becoming ridiculous.Anyway, a nice movie with some language and acting issues, but worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Merry Christmas is wonderful, yet disposable entertainment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On Christmas eve in the First World War, an unexpected truce was agreed upon by the warring French, Germans, and the Scotsman contingent of the British army. The truce began when ex-tenor turned German private Sprink (Benno Furmann) gave an apt rendition of "Silent Night" which the Scotsmen quickly offered to accompany with their bagpipes. Feeling the Christmas spirit despite their hometown being invaded by the Germans, the French agreed to celebrate Christmas eve with their enemies. Undeniably schmaltzy and melodramatic, Merry Christmas seems to be doomed to be in the company of other schmaltzy films like Pay it Forward or Benigni's Life is Beautiful. However, one has to look beyond the evident schmaltziness and keep one's cynicism at an all-time low to truly enjoy the film, which I thought was decently made and truly touching. After all, one cannot fault writer-director Christian Carion as the film was based on recorded events that truly happened during World War I. I think Carion tried his best to make the film as grounded and as realistic as possible although sometimes his screenplay gets a bit too oratorical and his direction gets a bit too overhanded with his overuse of the musical score. Carion promptly neutralizes the fuzzy feelings that are generated by warring men playing football and poker on Christmas Day by immediately portraying the sad repercussions of the men's fraternizing with their enemies. I thought that was a very welcome addition to bring back the audience from its suspension of disbelief to a more realistic ground that despite the innate humanity in everyone's heart, politics and the irrationalities of war still determine the fates of these men. There are also some technical aspects that I feel could've been polished a bit more. The lipsynching of the songs is quite obvious and very distracting especially since its hard to believe that Diane Kruger can belt out those high and strong note with her anorexic frame. Merry Christmas is wonderful, yet disposable entertainment. It is France's submission to the Oscars and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a nod as it possesses almost everything that the Oscars want - a war film, with themes of peace and humanity, and of course the resulting emotion of fuzziness and pride for one's humanity. ***1/2/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fell in love with this unique piece of art, it is really touching, humane, artistic, ethical, aesthetical and entertaining. it doesn't just immortalize the true and honored story of "The Christmas Truce" of 1914 during the World War I, but gives a lesson about humanity and how pure morals could be spoilt by the war machine and by the widespread of ignorant hatred, I loved how the first scene resembled three school children from France, England and Germany all repeating a memorized speech of hatred against the other nations then the film ended with three scenes of the three supposedly confronting armies rejecting hatred and returning to their regular state of humanity. P.S. I liked that the commander of the German troops was a Jew that's married to a French woman, and I liked that everyone spoke his own language, it affirmed the message of accepting people's diversity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sincere anti-war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Christmas 1914 with the horrors of trench warfare on the Western Front. Three nationalities have an unauthorized truce. Palmer (Gary Lewis) is the priest from a small Scottish parish. Nikolaus Sprink (Benno Fürmann) is a German opera singer and Anna Sörensen (Diane Kruger) is his singing partner. French lieutenant Audebert (Guillaume Canet) is being reassigned further back in artillery. He's worried about his pregnant wife caught behind German lines.There is a little bit of action but mostly it's sentimental anti-war feelings. It over-does it a little when everybody moves from one side to the other to avoid the artillery barrage from both sides. They could easily just communicate and hide in their bunkers. The horrors of trench warfare isn't as visceral as the best war movies. It's very sincere but maybe a little too sentimental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On Christmas Eve 1914, while the Great War degenerated in a bloody stalemate with men entrenching themselves and slaughtering each other in mass, Some of them decided to lay down their guns and make a truce to celebrate Christmas without any bloodshed.They shared their meals, exchanged cherished ones pictures and for this very special Holy Night, learned to like each other like brothers instead of hating each other to death.Joyeux Noel is telling us this true story about soldiers who regained their human being status for one night and one day. It is very moving from start to finish. It will melt your heart and bring you a lot of tears.It is a real ode to Fraternity, Peace and the Christmas spirit. Its message should be spread throughout the world and unfortunately today many people are still dying because of the ignorance of mankind too eager to kill each other rather than understand each other and live in peace.So to the world, Take the inspiration from those men who dared to disobey their superiors who never cared for them anyway and make peace. Try to understand each other. We are all the same despite our differences. That the message of Joyeux Noel and what a powerful message it is. Merry Christmas everyone &#x2665;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent, thought-provoking and often very moving film with a powerful message of humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the Christmas truce of 1914, this is an excellent, thought- provoking and often very moving film with a powerful message of humanity. Contrary to the propaganda at the time and, in some cases (rather worryingly), more recently, the First World War was not fought for the sake of freedom. It was fought for the sake of the vaulting ambition of imperialists on both sides. There was not a great difference between fighting for Liberty, Equality, Fraternity / King and Country or Kaiser and the Fatherland, something which is illustrated very effectively throughout the film. As in reality, the British, French and German political and military leaders in their ivory towers came down very hard on their subordinates when they learned of the truce. There is one rather unbelievable development but the film is otherwise very well written and directed by Christian Carion. This is the first French film that I have seen but only about a third of it was actually in French with the remainder being in English or German. It was a co-production with Britain, Germany, Belgium and Romania, which is rather appropriate given the film's positive attitude towards international cooperation.Daniel Brühl, one of the few actors in the film with whom I was already familiar, gives the best performance as the German Lieutenant Horstmayer. The commander of the German 93rd Infantry Regiment may be a bit of a slow-burner compared to some of the other characters but he eventually develops into the most interesting character in the film. Horstmayer initially seems to be the stereotypical German military marionette. However, he is shown to be a good and decent man when he agrees to the Christmas Eve ceasefire with the Scots and the French. Although he is Jewish, he is deeply moved by the impromptu Christian service held in No Man's Land and involving soldiers from all three nationalities. He is initially contemptuous of the tenor turned private Nikolaus Sprink, played quite well by Benno Fürmann, but he warms to him after the truce. Horstmayer often speaks lovingly of his wife of two years, something to which the Scottish and French can relate, and in a poignant moment it is revealed that she is French.Guillaume Canet is likewise excellent as Horstmayer's French counterpart Lieutenant Camille René Audebert. In his first scene, he is as apprehensive as his men prior to a major assault on the German trenches, becoming physically sick as he has been through it before and knows just what to expect. However, this is not the only thing that he is worried about as his wife is living in Lens in the occupied part of France and he has not had contact with her in months. She was heavily pregnant when they last spoke and he does not even know whether she has given birth to a boy or a girl. Audebert has a nice relationship with his aide-de-comp Private Ponchel, who starts out as a comic relief character but has one of the most moving scenes in the film when he describes his daily ritual of 10 o'clock coffee with his beloved mother. Danny Boon excels as Ponchel, displaying a flair for both drama and comedy. During the truce, Audebert and Horstmayer seem to bond more than any of the other soldiers and it is suggested that the two would have been friends if they had met before the war. Carion announced recently that is thinking of a sequel focussing on the two of them after the war and I really hope that he does make it as it is an excellent idea. There are so many things that could be explored, not least the discrimination that Horstmayer would face as a Jew once the Nazis rose to power.Canet's then wife Diane Kruger has the only substantial role of any woman in the film as Sprink's fiancée and fellow opera star Anna S?rensen from neutral Denmark. While Kruger is a wonderful actress, I found it incredibly hard to believe that a woman would have been allowed into the trenches under any circumstances in 1914. She does have a pass from Kaiser Wilhelm II but this is merely a plot device designed to make it seem plausible. Carion was essentially trying to shoehorn a woman into the plot so that it would not be entirely male dominated but it does not work at all as it just rings false. I would have preferred it if they had kept the exploration of the pain of separation from loved ones more subtle, as in the examples that I mentioned earlier. The film also has strong performances from Gary Lewis as the Scottish priest Father Palmer, Steven Roberston as Jonathan, Alex Ferns as Lt. Gordon, Bernard Le Coq as the French general (whose identity I correctly guessed), Ian Richardson as the jingoistic, racist Bishop and Thomas Schmauser as the German heir apparent Crown Prince Wilhelm, the only historical character in the film.Overall, this is an excellent anti-war film which illustrates that people are basically the same in spite of national borders and different languages. In that sense, it is surprisingly upbeat and perhaps even a little life affirming. For the season that's in it and given the subject matter, I feel that it is appropriate to wish a Joyeux Noël, Frohe Weihnachten and Merry Christmas to everyone who celebrates it and peace and goodwill to everyone else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is The Best Christmas Movie to watch on Christmas/Eve. Even better for Christmas than 'It's A Wonderful Life.' It displays the true Spirit of Christmas that the soldiers experienced, ending at the foot of the cross with all its meaning. The Christmas truce actually happened on many fronts in WWI, but it was mainly to bury their dead. The screenplay is a compilation of many stories. In real life there was a cat that went between both sides, but when it turned up with a new collar, it was shot by the other side for spying (typical SNAFU with officers following the letter of the absurd). As always there is just plain stupidity in killing each other which the movie exemplifies along with the contrast between basic goodwill, moral duty and institutionalized hatred.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different Kind Of Christmas Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joyeux Noel captures a rare moment of grace from one of the worst wars in the history of mankind.This is a movie about the World War I Christmas truce of December 1914, depicted through the eyes of French, Scottish and German soldiers.It stars Benno Fürmann,Guillaume Canet,Daniel Brühl,Diane Kruger,Gary Lewis and Alex Ferns; and it was written and directed by Christian Carion.When the war machines began rolling in the summer of 1914, the devastation that it waged upon German, British, and French troops was palpable. As the winter winds began to blow and the soldiers sat huddled in their trenches awaiting the generous Christmas care packages sent by the families, the sounds of warfare took a momentary backseat to the yearning for brotherhood among all of mankind. It is here that the fate of a French lieutenant, a Scottish priest, a German tenor, and a Danish soprano's lives were about to be changed forever. On Christmas Eve of that year, the lonely souls of the front lines abandoned their arms to reach out to their enemies on the battlefield and greet them with not anger or hostility, but with the simple, kindly gesture by trading chocolates and champagne, playing soccer, and comparing pictures of their wives and to put their differences aside long enough to wish each other as brothers a sincere Christmas greetings to one another.But when Christmas ends, the war returns.The movie captures a rare moment of grace from one of the worst wars in the history of mankind, World War I.Although it has been justly accused of sentimentality and manipulation, but if any subject warrants such an earnest and hopeful treatment, it's the horrors of trench warfare. The cast delivers low-key but effective performances as the movie dwells on the everyday elements of life in the face of war.In the end,this is one film that is a marvelously entertaining history lesson that is glossy, emotional and touching that a viewer should not miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If war is futile the trench warfare style of fighting which defined World War I is the most futile of all. Men dug into trenches a few hundred yards apart waiting until the men of one side are ordered to come up out of the trenches and charge at the enemy. Ordered to their deaths as these men are inevitably slaughtered. In this movie the Germans on one side and the French and Scottish on the other are fighting over a tiny, inconsequential strip of land in eastern France. The war was never going to be won or lost here. But men would die here. And for what? The film begins, rather brilliantly, with scenes of children from each of the three countries reciting patriotic speeches about their country's superiority and the inherent evilness of the enemy. And then we meet the soldiers. These aren't evil men. These are young men who just want to survive. Young men ordered off to war by men who sit comfortably far away from the front lines, protected from the savagery and true cost of war. The men in the trenches have retained their humanity. Their leaders, as will become painfully obvious by the film's end, have lost theirs.The remarkable events depicted in this film actually did happen. Sure there are some things changed and embellished to make a true story into a movie but the heart of the story remains. And what a story it is. Soldiers stopping the senseless killing and laying down their arms to come together to celebrate Christmas. In doing so they come to realize they have more in common with the enemy than they would have imagined. Bonds are formed. Which will of course make going back to slaughtering one another somewhat difficult. But that is a concern that is reserved for the movie's end. How good is the movie that leads towards that inevitably uncomfortable ending? Pretty good indeed. It's a heartwarming story. Character development is rushed or, in some cases, nonexistent which is a little disappointing. More time spent getting to know these soldiers would make us so much more emotionally invested in their fate. But the movie still manages to pack a serious emotional punch. Once the story sets itself up there are times where things move a little slowly and the movie seems to get bogged down a little. But for whatever little quibbles you may have with the film the good far outweighs the bad. The performances are uniformly excellent, the cinematography is wonderful and the message is inspiring. There is so much more that can bring us together than there is that can tear us apart. The men in the trenches figured this out. If only their leaders had done the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I watched Joyeux Noel, I tried to note individual moments that made an impression (for better or worse), tried to evaluate the acting and tried to begin formulating the ideas that would grow into a full review. Then I stopped. I realised it was quite pointless. Because Joyeux Noel is a beautiful and moving film that makes a big impact due to the essence of the tale.Written and directed by Christian Carion, the movie takes some real characters and events as a base upon which to build a series of heartwarming moments. It's WWI and on Christmas Eve there ends up being a ceasefire between the Scottish, French and German forces on the front line. This extends to the next day, Christmas being considered a day worth giving over to the claiming and burying of the dead. But then how can you go back to the trenches and take aim at someone you have now befriended the previous evening and shared tobacco and alcohol with? There are a few moments here and there that will annoy those who dislike any sentimentality in their movies but I'd have to say that, despite it sometimes feeling forced from a cinematic perspective (camera movement, score choice, etc), there's always something about it that feels very genuine. The whole movie serves as a reminder of humanity and what individuals can achieve when not being crammed into a unit and pointed towards an "enemy".The technical side of everything is just fine, and Carion directs his script well, but the acting from people like Gary Lewis, Diane Kruger, Benno Furmann, Daniel Bruhl, Guillaume Canet, Dany Boon, Robin Laing and Alex Ferns is consistently great. Each person is given just enough time to present someone very real and very far removed from the image of them held by the opposing armies.Joyeux Noel has the same blend of unrealism and wonder that usually tends to come from amazing stories with a basis in fact. Sometimes the content can be a bit too sweet or unbelievable but as long as there's an identifiable truth at the heart of the matter, as there is here, then it usually turns out to be something well worth your time. As it is here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best side of our souls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In December 1914 in the peak of World War I the spirit of Christmas prevailed for a few hours over the hatred of war. Captivated by the singing of a German soldier who is also an opera tenor, on Christmas Eve, German, French and Scottish soldiers and officers come out of the trenches and fraternize like human beings, establishing a temporary ceasefire, celebrating Christmas and attending a mass said by a Scottish military chaplain. This message is indeed the most important part of the movie and it's well conveyed in terms of images, scenes and dialogs proving that those men weren't indeed each other's enemies. The movie isn't particularly epic since its director has chosen a more realistic and naturalistic way of telling the story presenting no heroes there but just only normal human beings with normal human feelings and sentiments. We can see then that the best side of men's souls push them to be friends of one another and it's the war that makes them artificially each other's enemies. The acting is good too although simple since there are no heroes there. One of the best movies of the last 10 years indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving film about the Christmas truce in World War I</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very good and moving French made film about the Christmas truce between the troops in the Western Front in 1914 during World War I. That day, English, French and German troops spontaneously stop shooting at each other and tentatively went to no man's land, where they end up exchanging gifts and even play an improvised soccer game. When superiors of all the countries involved learned about this, they naturally objected in the strongest terms about the fraternization, so an episode like this never happened again in the rest of the conflict (I first learned about this historical incident in the 1980s through Paul McCartney's video Pipes of Peace).Sentimental but never manipulative, pacifist but not terribly preachy, this film has a solid, old fashioned narrative style, as well as a very beautiful photography. It is also benefited by very fine performances, even if I'm not familiar with most of the actors. The only one I recognize was pretty Diane Kruger, as a Danish soprano visiting the German front to pass the time with her German lover, a fellow opera singer (her moving performance of Ave Maria in front of the troops is one of the highlights of the film, even if she was naturally dubbed by a real opera singer). Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Now, almost 100 years on, little has changed, and wars are still being fought. One would wish that those soldiers would also just walk away and give up fighting - not only temporarily, but permanently -, and even more so, that those in power would heed their message. One Christmas wish that I hope will come true someday!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a film this Christmas that captures the spirit of the holiday without all the commercial glitz and jazz that is our modern Christmas this is the film for you. Joyeux Noel is a breath of fresh air. It encompasses the reality and brutality that was trench warfare while still showing us that Christmas isn't about the presents we buy and the decorations we put up in our homes. Based on a true story this movie does not accurately portray the historical event with perfect precision but that isn't really an issue for me. The film is based on a true story and does take artistic liberty like any "based on a true story" film would. I won't discredit a wonderfully movie film that exhibits the reality of the human condition because the historical accuracy isn't perfect. I consider this a great family film for the holidays but if you are watching it with those who don't enjoy subtitles you may have a problem. The German and French soldiers speak in their native languages. While this lend to the realism of the film it does cause a problem for those who don't like reading subtitles. Overall this is a wonderful addition to the holiday films I watch every year and I recommend it to anyone looking for a warmhearted film around the holidays.</fullReview>

It portrays the power of music in overcoming barriers between people. It displays the very best and the very worst of religion in a time of war.Almost all the details in this movie are true, and are woven into a work of art.The DVD contains director's comments, and a version with director's commentary over the whole movie which are enlightening on the history of the events, and of the artistic and personal emotions of making the movie.Ten years into US wars, it is a poignant movie for Christmas, and a call for a common humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Christmas Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is filled with the joy of Christmas, of the feelings that come over people as they celebrate the coming of Jesus Christ into the world. That he was a child of peace, and the meaning of love for the people of the world is what is conveyed in this movie. Both sides, the men who are being told they have to fight, have no love for what they are being forced to do, in the middle of this Christmas Eve. It seems against the nature of all of them to want to hurt anyone on this night, and it is from that spirit that the events of the film unfold.So, the celebration of Christmas in turn moves all of the other events of the film, and makes it possible for the two sides to want to lay down their arms on Christmas Eve. The French, the Germans, and the Scots do so . In the film, the role of the French Lieutenant, played by Guillane Canot becomes I think the strongest. Benne Furmannn as the tenor called into service is the moral leader who already knows through opera the common friendships of music. His lover, played by Diane Kruger shows the love of man and woman, and the priest shows the love of God for all. The voices of Natalie Dessay and the opera voice for Furmann are key to penetrating to the should of all the men that Christmas Eve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joyeux Noel ( Merry Christmas)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the true-life story of the spontaneous Christmas Eve truce declared by Scottish, French, and German troops in the trenches of World War I.Diane Kruger, Daniel Brühl, Benno Fürmann and Guillaume Canet head a first rate international cast in a truly powerful, provoking film.This film though at times a bit preachy, tells a tale of a group of human beings that see past their differences for one night. For instance, it is the art of music that for maybe just one short day, silence a war.There are many memorable scenes throughout the film, but one of the best I felt was the opening scene in which three children, in Germany, France, and Britain respectively, are standing in front of a blackboard, repeating the lines of hatred that they have been fed, for years. Indoctrination.Another scene that is just as horrifying is the one where the Archbishop ? gives a truly despicable Evangelist like sermon about how the Germans should all be killed, young or old and that their mission is a 'crusade' to save the freedom of the world.Another well done scene is when Benno Fürmann's character, an opera singer before the war- gets on top of the trench and he stars to sing his heart out with "Stille Nacht." ( Silent Night) Though the singing may be some bad lip synchronization, it doesn't diminish the scene.A truly wonderful film in all aspects. Interesting as well, is the fallout that the soldiers face because of their actions. The neutral cat who sides with whomever feeds him and is alternately named Felix and Nestor, is exectued for treason and both the Scots and the German troops are sent to other theatres of the war. The French to the Sonne, while the Germans are shipped to the Eastern Front while singing a Scottish carol!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made and an excellent chronicle of the pointlessness of the First World War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was based very loosely on actual incidents that happened throughout the Western Front in 1914 and 1915. Despite the war being unprecedentedly bloody and savage as well as pointless, there were several spontaneous stoppages of war for the Christmas holiday. This was NOT officially sanctioned but sprang up spontaneously.My wife was rather critical of some of the story elements that seemed improbable (and could not be confirmed in a subsequent search on the Net). And while I agree that there almost certainly was NOT an incident where a female opera singer and her husband set the stage for a cease fire, this didn't particularly bother me, as the essential spirit of the film was accurate. Men who had been trying to kill each other for months DID put down their arms temporarily and celebrated a holiday together--allowing the spirit of brotherhood to briefly unite them and provide some small shred of humanity to an otherwise pointless war. Additionally, I liked the music--it provided a very surreal quality that showed the stark contrast between war and the higher things of life.What I particularly liked was the fact that this film was a joint production by many countries (France, Germany, Britain, Belgium and Romania). This ensured that instead of relying on everything to be dubbed or spoken in one language, they instead spoke a multitude of languages--like the soldiers really would have used. Also, being a multinational film project, no one was portrayed as the bad guys--something that is very accurate for WWI--one of the few cases in history when there was no hero--only millions and millions of victims or survivors.All around this was a top-notch production and was highly entertaining but also profoundly sad---as viewers will no doubt realize that few of the men who experienced this truce survived the war. I also really appreciated the film showing the after-effects--when those in authority (including an insanely nationalistic bishop) reacted against the truce--punishing those involved because they were worried peace might accidentally take hold! For those who cannot allow themselves to watch anything profound or sad, then avoid this film and just watch mindless films designed for the unrefined palate. Otherwise, an excellent film in all respects. And, if you liked this film, also trying watching the French films A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, GRAND ILLUSION and J'ACCUSE or the German film WESTFRONT 1918 or the American films THE BIG PARADE or the great ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Full marks for this film, in a world of shallow Hollowood films, big meaningless bangs and fast cars, this movie blows them all away with its thoughtful exploration of those that have tragically been forgotten by a world that has ceased to care about the futility of the first great war. For many years I have attempted to sell a script based upon these events, but without success, and I am so glad that the 1914 truce has finally been filmed for all to see. All, is probably a handful of individuals, as I had to order the movie, as it was not in any shop, disgraceful really, but what can you expect? These forgotten, unknown soldiers, have led to a forgotten unknown film. That in itself is a crime. This film is a beautiful, but terribly tragic tale, the burial of the bodies was very moving, knowing that shells may well have churned them up again. It was also fantastically acted by all concerned, and it left me speechless, although I just had to say something, so I came here to voice my opinions. I will endeavour to praise this film to friends and family, in hope that they will buy it. I know this is not much of a review, but praise is all that is needed. Now someone should make a film about Kuentz, Harry Patch, and Henry Allingham, the stories they could tell, if anyone really cared to listen. At least Joyeux Noel is there, and I hope to God, that in time it gains a large fan base, it certainly deserves that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The kind of war film that doesn't need to show epic battles in order to draw attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joyeux Noel is set during the early months of the First World War. Germany has pushed in France and is attempting to break through the French/British lines in order to capture Paris and take France out of the war. Along the western front three different nationalities sit and wait for the same orders, to go over the top and to charge across no mans land to engage their sworn enemies. But Joyeux Noel (French for Merry Christmas) does not show us the great sacrifices made during battle but the shred of humanity these soldiers had left as Christmas Day approached the front line/We follow three different stories. The first is that of French Lieutenant Audebert as he struggles to lead his men and look good in the eyes of his General father. The second is that of German opera singer Nikolaus Sprink's and his lover Anna. The third is that of Fr. Palmer, a priest turned soldier, who is trying to comfort those at the front as much as possible, especially through his bagpipe playing. All three countries meet on the destined December 24 when Sprinks is overhead in the opposite trenches singing for his men. Eventually everyone comes out to meet one another and a beautiful scene involving a mass with the three armies occurs.Most of the actors in this film are relatively unknown, at least here in the States. However, I thought the cast did an excellent job. Benno Furmann does an excellent job as the opera singer turned soldier. I found Guillaume Canet's portrayal of French Lieutenant Audebert by far the best acting piece in the film. Many people may also recognize Gary Lewis as the Roman Catholic Fr. Palmer who also gave a strong supporting role in Martin Sorcese's Gangs of New York. The cast may be seemingly unknown to people in the States and abroad but they do a great job at portraying the face of humanity.Diane Kruger I would say is your only A-List star in the film. She's been bashed again and again for her performance as Sprink's lover and partner in opera and I struggle to understand why this is. I thought she did a wonderful job as Anna. Her delivering of lines was convincing and her lip syncing, though not great, was far better than most of us could probably do with opera. She's not put into the film as eye candy or anything like that. Her character relationship with the German's is very interesting to watch and especially her going to the front lines to sing for them.The film is full of clichés and corny scenes but you know what, they work. We don't see the corniness, we see the face of humanity. We see a real life event brought to the screen in sweeping fashion. We are shown how through just a little understanding, war can be avoided. We also come to understand is that of, is anyone really responsible for the dead during war. Is their really blood on one's hand's if they kill in war? The film brings up all this as it shows the Christmas Truce of 1914 along the western front.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Serendipity is one of the great pleasures of life. Or as Forrest would put it, "Life is like a box of chocolates.." I went to see the new Bond film and found the 8pm show sold out! (In Cape Town? In season? Never!) As others had gone to see the new BORAT extravaganza(9/10), and I'd already paid for parking and had already had my Vodka ration for the day, we went to the Nouveau to scout out something starting in the next 5 minutes. All that was left were two films; the Clint/ Japanese take on Iwo Jima which ended at @ 2h00am and MERRY Christmas(Joyeux Noel).It basically tells the story of the Christmas truce during the first World war. This was when along the frontline, the Germans, French and British/Scots struck up a truce that in some areas lasted as long as 10 days. They exchanged food, stories, even liquor.The cast. apart from one or two familiar faces is, to an anglo watcher, utterly unfamiliar. No Depardieus here. It is in three languages (four, if you include the way the Scottish speak English) and was the French Oscar contender for the best foreign film. ( The year Gavin Hood did us proud with Tsotsi.) The most amazing thing about this film is that it ever got made at all. Normally a film has 1,2 or maybe 3 producers/production companies. This one had 27! Can you imagine the teleconferencing bills at the end of it. And the pecking order. It probably took 3 weeks just to decide on the language they would all correspond in. And lets not even get to the catering.And yet it works. It has joined the Christmas classic collection with others such as IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (8/10) and ELF (9/10). It really talks of mans common humanity, despite adversity and trying circumstances. The bravery of those who took the first steps can't be overemphasised. There are a number of scenes which stand out, but for me the carol singing scene was the most moving.Next time you find yourself at the movies and you don't know what to see, take a flyer; you may be surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christmas 1914, after 5 months of WWI, the first Christmas come. But soldiers are fighting, and there's death everywhere. However, in some places, things are very different. Inspired in real facts, the film tells us about a history of French, Scottish and German soldiers that, during Christmas night decide to forget their hates and just stay with the enemy as a friend or an allied, showing us how easily is to achieve peace if people wants. Moving and touching, it will become quickly a Christmas classic. The actors are good (although their part is not very hard), and the script is great. The story is very well written and it is able to touch you in deep. The end, tough logic, can be disappointing and, if I should say something wrong about the film is the fact that in any time you are not told who's in whom army, so you must deduce it from the comments of the soldiers, which results a little unpleasant (it cost me some mistakes of nationality, which caused me a little confusion about what was happening). Highly recommended to anybody. A delicious chant for peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't really add anything to the previous comment, other than it was a film that touched me immensely, and would strongly recommend it for exposing the inanity of war, with a striking example being the sermon given by the British bishop. One has to wonder what happened to the real soldiers involved in the incident, and some thorough research could be helpful, as the film is based on a true event. Is there also an allusion to the German lieutenant actually being French through the line "You're not married to a German", as addressed to the French officer? As noted above, strongly recommended, not just for the storyline (which is based on a true event) but also for its authenticity, with the French speaking French, the Germans German, and of course the Scots Scottish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This tender film about opposing sides fraternizing on Christmas of 1914 during WWI pounds the viewer with an anti-war message. And why shouldn't it, war rarely makes sense and WWI was one of the most senseless. Why should they all spend months and months in the nasty, dirty trenches because some anarchist shot an arch-duke. Though bitterly opposed in the beginning, the soldiers realize on Christmas eve, while listening to each others musical celebration of the season that they aren't all that different and don't really like the war that much. They join together for a Christmas Eve mass, play soccer together the next day and then warn each other of impending artillery attacks. As the letters home run through the military censors, the Masters of War, at first surprised and then dismayed, hurl castigation at the friendly soldiers for deigning to love their fellowmen rather than slaughter them. They immediately transfer them so the killing can get back on track, but the soldiers are changed by this interaction and the brainwashed hatred begins to lose its hold. This movie is like a swiss chard tart (François Payard makes one that is great). Sounds gross huh, because the idea of something sweet and delicious coming out of something bitter and unappealing is difficult to imagine, but it does just that. It transforms into a delicate, sweet dessert that would satisfy any sweet tooth, leaving just a hint of counterbalance beneath the sweetness to ground one in reality. 7/10http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an unbelievable true-life story of a spontaneous truce on Christmas Eve during WWI. The Scottish, French and German troops in the trenches stop their fighting each other to celebrate Christmas together. This holiday cease-fire allows these warriors of war a few fleeting moments to redeem themselves and prove there is some humanity amid battle. The co-mingled troops celebrate the birth of Christ, as well as taking care to bury their dead comrades. Peace and goodwill abruptly fade behind the sounds of rifle fire and bombs.Credit Christian Carion for writing and directing this uplifting must-see film. Visually sweeping.

It's still a very good movie, and would suggest it to almost anyone.However, Oh!

		<shortDescription>Recalling The Christmas Truce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was highly enjoyable and was laced with emotion, humour and tragedy in equal measure. The whole production was excellent.The recollection of this event was one of those defining moments in history. To some historians, the 1914 truce was the last gasp of high civilization of Edwardian Europe. To some, it was soldiers along with Officers giving themselves an unofficial break from the war, as the soldiers were spending Xmas in the trenches, instead of at home, as they were promised by the Generals &amp; politicians of their respective countries. To some, the episode conjures up romantic notions of idealism and the futility of war. The film, tried to give areas to all those notions and dreams. With no criticism attached to the actress and the writers, but allowing a woman at the Front, especially - most especially at that time, would never have been allowed to happen. Theirs artistic license, but this was overboard. A beautiful woman spending time with soldiers who have been in the trenches....not a good mix. It added, I suppose to the story-line and allowed a romantic interest...but it could've been omitted, in the name of authenticity.The only other criticism or comment, is the ending. The soldiers/participants having their regiments mixed up, or being sent to different fields of operations, left a very sour taste in the mouth, especially for a film, that was made in the hopes and idealism of Xmas. It would've been a better ending, if we had seen, the German singers united together at the End of the War. But hey..I'm a romantic at heart. I would've liked to have seen a little bit more emphasis on the football game...as the Allies won that!!! Anyhow, a good film, with good performances..Ian Richardson gave a sermon, that a KKK meeting would've been proud of...brought home the hatred and fear, that usually blunders humanity into war..and of course, sustains that war. The Priest left his crucifix at the dressing station...but he was exposed to real Christianity...In the madness, hatred, strain and horror of war, he had witnessed men of numerous Nations come together and discover that they were and always will be fellow human beings, with all the same emotions, hopes and aspirations as each other. The nicest touch in the film, was the German Officer, making it known that he was Jewish...That captured a fleeting truth of the absurd notions of Nationalism in Germany, that was to inflict greater catastrophe further down the line. A special mention should be made, about the kindness and co-operation that soldiers of opposing sides did for each other. The German Officer returning the French Officer's wallet. The importance of mail and ensuring they were properly distributed. It all added to the humanity and niceties of mankind....That it is possible to do a kindness in the midst of conflict and savagery.We remind ourselves of this humanity in the hope that we and our representatives will learn the lesson. Sadly, and always, we never do!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What will go down as one of the more beautiful portrayals in the midst of battle becomes slightly too overt with it's noble intentions only when the direction insists on hammering certain elements beyond the natural pace. Based on true events, the powerful symbolism throughout becomes even more resonant in retrospect. Detailing the cease-fire and fraternization from French, German and Scottish troops on a most unusual Christmas Eve in 1914, Merry Christmas is in many ways the war AND Christmas movie that has been waiting to be made. Equally divided between the three regiments, no other film has managed to capture the futility of bloodshed as seen through all parties involved, in quite the same way. Although I feel this universally potent script did not reach complete fruition due mostly to the often repetitious direction, the overall impact from outlining these real events in the uplifting manner they are portrayed can indeed become a pillar of movie faith that fans will be able to confide in long after the final frame is extinguished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Spirit of Humanity in the Midst of Chaos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on true facts, "Joyeux Noel" tells us a touching story which while historically significant, is not widely known: In the midst of WW1, when lives where wasted among the trenches every day, a spontaneous truce was achieved on Christmas Eve by some soldiers of the three main warring sides (Germany, UK, and France). Taking advantage of the Christmas spirit, the enemy soldiers met together, and then sang, drank, and even played football together! This wonderful atmosphere lasted for a couple of days, until the reality of the war resumed, and they started fighting each other to death, again.In the film, we watch a French unit, assisted by a Scottish regiment, who are trying to overtake a German position. The situation is bleak for everybody, and it seems that they are going to spend the most miserable Christmas of their lives. However, when an enlisted German tenor (and his surreptitiously brought wife) sing to their comrades on Christmas Eve, and they are joined by the Scots who accompany them with their instruments, something starts to change. Soon the commanders of the three units meet together, and agree on a one-day ceasefire. However, the ceasefire is just the beginning...Although the specific story depicted in "Joyeux Noel" is fictional, it is so wonderfully presented that it could well be true. Not only has Christian Caron come up with an impeccable direction which brings us the exact atmosphere of the WW1 front, but also all the actors have done their best to be very persuasive in their roles. The result is solid and touching war drama, which is an hymn to the spirit of humanity in the midst of chaos. Well done! 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Garth Brooks recorded a song about the impromptu Christmas truce in World War I. Christian Carion brings this tale to life with a cast most Americans have never heard of. With the exception of a hard-nosed man, the commanding officers in the field are sympathetic. It could've fall into the trap of using stock characters or excessive violence, but it never does that. It does have an early battle scene that has an intensity like that of "Saving Private Ryan." It also has some comic relief; Frank Witter plays a great supporting role as a German soldier named Jorg, and a cat from a nearby farm steals the show. Benno Fuermann is fabulous as a German opera singer, as is Diane Kruger as his Danish fiancée. You can't say enough about this one. Stephen Spielberg, eat your heart out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I heard of this episode when I was a schoolboy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My comment comes in late, as I saw the film in last November, but I just bought the DVD and so I once again had the deep pleasure to watch a most excellent movie . I had very briefly heard of the WWI episode it describes in upper school when I was a boy in the late sixties. In those days, there was no discussing the official History of France, and such events as shown in this film would only be named to impress us with the "obscene" behaviour of soldiers having completely lost their sense of reality and military discipline. So it went. And for years I have been wondering how French soldiers could have been induced into fraternizing with our German arch-enemy. Those soldiers were supposed to be "heroes"; how they might be perceived by us kids was not relevant, and neither did we know how we should see their heroism. It had never dawned on us that the Germans might have been anything but "monsters". My grandmother had always been telling us a lot of dreadful stories from the two World Wars she had had to live through, and how no good could ever occur from the Germans. Fortunately, as I grew older, I got a much better understanding of human nature, and meeting people from other countries helped me grasp the fact that men tend to be much the same everywhere, especially so in Western Europe, where for centuries the frontiers have been moved around . From the very first time when I heard of the film, I had been willing to see it, and to have my 15-year old son see it with me. Wow! We both found it deeply human, and to top it all anti militarist without any of the usual slogans and anti-war-cries that were fashionable in the past. It even tells that the Germans were not the infant-eaters my grandmother used to tell us they were. We all are brothers, and wars are a nonsense. I really love this movie, you know.</fullReview>

Joyeux Noel, takes a whole different view on War. Finally, we have a movie that doesn't show how cruel the soldiers were, but how human they were. This movie is a must for anyone, it really changes your perception in things, how in the end, religion does unite us, and how sometimes we can put our duties at pause, and enjoy each others company (whatever race). Most of the soldiers during WWI, fought the war because it was their duties as citizens of their own country or because they were forced, not because they hated the opposing soldiers.

It kind of blew me away since I didn't expect it to turn out how it did. This movie gives you a warm feeling and leaves you in a good mood.Most of the action happens in the trenches that surround a no-man's land, trenches occupied by British (Scotts), French and Germans. The French leader and the German leader impressed me the most with their acting performances but the Scott wasn't bad either. I especially liked their priest (the Scott priest that is). The story is inspired by true facts and this is cool to know, especially after you saw the movie. Of course, it's probably exaggerated a bit, but I reckon it's still close to the real life.There are moments in the movie when I was overwhelmed by not-so-happy-feelings such as: injustice-anger. Anger on the injustice of war and its futility, anger on the wooden-headed leaders of our world and their narrow minds, their obtuse decisions and last but not least, anger on stupid priests. You may think that the events portrayed in this motion picture are pure fiction, but I am sure that in real life, the situation is far worse. But overall, the movie left me with a nice good feeling.Oh and by the way, despite its title, don't feel obliged to watch it during Christmas, it's really not that important, trust me. It'll give you more pleasure if you watch it far from Christmas as it'll bring some of that Xmas spirit in your heart! 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who should be responsible for the killing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To tell the truth, I've scarcely watched French movies before, and the reason is very simple--I don't speak French. I don't know what led me to the watching of this film. Perhaps the theme introduction of the film and the participation of the Scottish soldiers in the battle remind me of a fascinating British film called "Regeneration" I watched several years ago. Thanks God! My choice to watch it proves to be correct. Both of these two are significantly successful in demonstrating the main theme of anti-war.But along with the proceeding of watching this film Joyeux Noël, something indistinct haunting in my mind till the end of it, which makes me feel that what make this film outstanding is not only the vivid revival of fierce battlefield, and the penetrating criticism of the cruelty of the war and the alienation of humanity, but also something else, which, seems to be scarcely touched by other anti-war films I've seen before. Yes, that's the AFTERMATH of the respectable decision made by the front officers from different sides to make a temporary ceasefire. It's for sure that the ceasefire on Christmas Eve is a very incredible event on the front between enemies, and this is the very point that attracts the audience in cinema. What is the aftermath of the ceasefire? The French officer and his soldiers were redeployed after the examination of their letters by their high-ups, waiting for an unknown punishment; the Scottish soldiers were agitated by the newly-arriving higher-rank priest to fight and kill their German enemies because they were condemned to destroy the human civilization. We can draw a plain conclusion that the slaughtering will go on and the ever-peace-making soldiers will have to fight their enemies again, although the Germans had ever offered them the shelter from bombing. Then the unavoidable question is, WHO SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KILLING? Perhaps we can never take the answer for granted that the high-ups should be responsible for this. We can not forget that during the ceasefire the German officer asked the French Lieutenant to invite him for a coffee after capturing Paris. What's the implied meaning of his words? Of course some may say that although the ever-friendly German officer would participate in capturing Paris, he was just to carry out the order from his commanders. Yes, this is undoubtedly true. But the fact must be that he was determined to take this order and carry on killing his French enemies although he know that his soldiers had just experienced a very rare front peace on battlefield. Hence the controversial answer may be both the high-ups and the subordinate officers and soldiers should be responsible for the killing among each other. As a matter of fact, this kind of paradox dilemma will lead undoubtedly to the ultimate theme of the film, that is, the WAR ITSELF should be responsible for the killing. We hold a solid belief that every one is born sinful, and the devils within our bodies are waiting eagerly to burst open if only time permits. And the TIME is that we are put by the war maniacs into slaughtering ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Movie Show review (beautiful and touching)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on true events, "Joyeux Noel" tells the story of three armies in the trenches of France in the First World War, who put down their weapons for one night, for Christmas Eve, and are forced to acknowledge the humanity of one and other. It all starts with the Scottish army singing and playing the bagpipes. Then from behind the trenches, the German army starts putting up Christmas trees and singing Christmas carols. Suddenly, everyone has joined the singing, and the Scottish, German, and French lieutenants call for a cease-fire for the night so that everyone can join in for a Mass together. It's not the Christianity that brings them together (the German lieutenant is Jewish!), but the longing they all share for a sense of community and humanity. "Joyeux Noel" shows the futility of warfare and teaches us how impossible it is to kill another human being after you've made a true connection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, what a lovely war, indeed - humanity abounds, limitless within us all, with the universality of music and songs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to French writer-director Christian Carion's passion and in depth research, "Joyeux Noël" aka Merry Christmas (2005), is a worthwhile (and entertaining) war film to experience about the historical Christmas 1914 in the European trenches. A collaborative film effort no doubt, with British/Scottish, German and French actors/crew in the three languages spoken, translators and all.It's an achievement to be able to deliver a film about war which has an encompassing humanity theme at its crux and yet quite entertaining at the same time. War is nothing to make light of. It's the human beings involved that made the event memorable and heartwarming. The courage demonstrated and the risk (and trust) the soldiers shared may very well be divinely engineered. (Beliefs to each its own.) As I was reading Dr. Wayne Dyer's "Inspiration: Your Ultimate Calling," my mind wandered to the fraternizing scenes - it was a lovely war! The moments the soldiers shared, coming out of their respective trenches - how they mingled in harmony is touchingly amazing. With the close proximity of the trenches, the delightful strain of Scottish bagpipes was audible to the other sides, followed by the German tenor singing a familiar Christmas tune infectious to 'singalong' by anyone, the French would not be missed as the German and Scottish consorted. Everything has its place and time and happens for a reason (evident or not at the time is no matter.) The music and songs, and the bagpipes, included in the film, along with the wonderful unobtrusive performances all round, truly gave us a sense of how it was that Christmas of 1914. Carion is a good storyteller - just as his first film "The Girl From Paris" aka "One swallow brought spring" released in U.S. 2003, was charming and touching at the same time, with meaningful plot points. He included facets of human situations/relationships, father and son, man and woman, priest and beliefs, even details about a cat being shared by the soldiers between the zones. Michel Serrault, who's the irascible farm owner in Carion's first feature, graced a brief cameo in the kitchen. Benno Fürmann, who was in Tom Tykwer's "The Princess and the Warrior" 2000, played the German tenor/soldier. Daniel Brühl, who's the young violinist in "Ladies in Lavender" 2004, and Gary Lewis, who's dad in "Billy Elliot" 2000, both held key roles.Besides Howard Hawk's "Sergeant York" 1941, with gallant Gary Cooper (my IMDb comment posted 13 October 2004), "Joyeux Noël" is another significant film about war and humanity to be appreciated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joyeux Noel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very well-made war movie indeed. Very good acting, and I really got the sense of the tension that the trench warfare of 1914-1918 would have been like. All of the soldiers on both sides lived in constant fear of death. That's why the Christmas Eve/Day reprieve must have felt like divine intervention if only for a brief time. The singing duels between the German tenor, who walked a Christmas tree out into no man's land while caroling to the allied powers, and the Scottish bagpipers who piped away on the parapets of their ramparts towards the German lines, moved me to tears.The film raises great philosophical questions about when is it appropriate to fraternize with the enemy. After all, these soldiers had much more in common than the war propaganda would have them believe: most came from humble backgrounds, many had wives, many visited the countries of their enemies before the way, most were Christian, etc. It really makes one think that, despite the way most people are indoctrinated to believe that the enemy is pure evil, human beings are essentially the same at heart with the same hopes and fears for their families and friends. It's the politicians who are the ones who should be held responsible for war (in this case, the Kaiser of Germany, the Parliament of the UK, and the Premier of France made the colossal blundering decisions to mass millions of men to trench-warfare deaths).From a stylistic standpoint, I enjoyed the three-way dialog going on: French and German with subtitles, but much of the film contained English (well, with a Scottish brogue!). Also, I really got a sense of the starkness and cold of trench warfare in winter by the shading of light in the photography.It's too bad this film wasn't shown on wider release in the US. This is one movie I will purchase on DVD when it arrives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautiful story of a real Christmas miracle of peace spontaneously breaking out between the lines in WWI. I will never forget the haunting scene of the soldiers at Christmas Mass in the middle of no-man's land. Based on a true occurrence, the film raises all sorts of questions concerning the nature of war and peace without resorting to preaching or political posturing. One other notable feature is the music, which becomes as much of a element in moving the plot as the characters themselves. If the film fails at anything it is to convey the true size of the incident, which for reasons of story is confined to a small group of soldiers in one trench line. Still, a solid achievement. The film chronicles a bright moment in a bleak century of war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some who do not believe that the event where enemy soldiers could actually take a respite from war and meet before again continuing the battle did actually happen or is merely a sentimental myth attached to the Christmas season. Certainly we believe as we wish, and yet there seems to be enough evidence that the event depicted here actually did occur in the manner enacted in Joyeux Noél. The acting and scenes invite the viewer to join the soldiers in the celebration of camaraderie and feel the companion emotions and confusion about who we should really hate as our enemy. In addition to the movie, the story is nicely told in a song entitled, "Christmas in the Trenches" by John McCutcheon; in the CD "Live at Wolf Trap." I wonder if the story has ever been portrayed by a German filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A straightforward fictional telling of a heartbreaking event; all the pathos is in the story itself, and in our knowing what will befall the participants. As one of the most unsympathetic characters predicts, the whole thing would have to be done again 20 years later.In the clear light of hindsight, it would of course have been better for Europe if all of the participants had up and gone home before New Years. The movie makes that point so well that you forget, for the moment, that they were having their Christmas celebration in a French cow pasture, where the Germans had not been invited, and that it therefore behooved the Germans to pick up and go home first. One more than technical point. Many of the American reviews have described Fr. Palmer, the Scots clergyman, as an Anglican priest. He is a Roman Catholic. Scotland had a good sized Catholic minority but very few Anglicans. Palmer's rural church contains a brightly colored statue of the Madonna and Child, something one would not see in an Anglican church. On Christmas Eve in no-man's land he says the old Latin Mass, universally used before Vatican II, and thus familiar to the Catholic soldiers in the Scottish, French and German ranks. His Catholic faith is a central part of the common European heritage that the War would shatter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had some time to while away, and this happened to be the only choice, so I figured I would go see it. After all I could always walk out if it turned out to be too depressing as war movies tend to be.I was in for a very pleasant surprise. This was an absolutely heartwarming experience and a great tear jerker. It is as relevant today as it was in 1914 when the events on which it is based, actually occurred.It beautifully portrays the naive enthusiasm of youth to go to war, the stark reality of actually fighting a war, the loneliness and helplessness of having to be in a place where the 'superiors' have ordered you to be and all the while hating the enemy and feeling noble because you are making sacrifices for the defense and honor of your country. Somewhere amidst all this, realization dawns that you may be paying too high a price to fulfill the desires and satisfy the egos of the 'powers that be' who send people to war but themselves sit in the comfort of their offices. ......to realize that the people at the other end of your guns, bombs and cannons are as human as you, missing their families like you and hurting like you....... so you come together in your loneliness, put aside your anger, hatred and mistrust for a brief period of time to celebrate life, love, the joy of Christmas and to truly live the message of Christ - Love thy enemy, if only for a brief moment. Unfortunately, the 'superiors' did not view it like that. Instead, they were reprimanded for their 'human-ness'I walked out with a greater understanding and a heart full of gratitude for the sacrifices made by all people however lame the justification of war......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film made my thoughts over the old Germany changed. Well I guess somewhere in my subconscious told me that these merciless enemy of the world during the old times were actually as knotted and determined like any other country would fight for their aspirations. Sadly there are millions who are caught in between the warring countries' ambitions and idealisms. And the complicatedly sad truth about it is that those who took part as pawns of the warring countries had in no way desired what they leaders wanted. They're mixed up, confused, longing for their families, scared, lonely and angry.I had this film long before. I just let it sit in my collections not knowing the brilliance it carries. I only owned it in the first place because it's a highly rated foreign film whose translation of German title I don't even know. I had the chance, the isolation to watch this film and it give me the chills over the beauty of the truth I never thought had been part of world history. The film per se is superb. The cast, the settings, and the sounds everything, as typical as they are, but like I always wanted over a film, whether it is cliché or contentious the story stands out. It's totally new to me! Warring countries fraternizing with each other? I mean if you've first heard of it and idiot enough not to think it's clearly impossible to happen. But the instance each party experiences led them to form such truce. It's heartbreaking, bitter sweet, poignant, touching at its best and really beautiful. Indeed nothing more is despicable than those who never thought of the efforts and lives sacrificed for the country's best. The leaders as they may be as necessary as leading the entirety could be as appalling more than the enemy for putting their men in no-man's-land while joyfully feasting over their wealth and safety. I saw through the characters inner thoughts. It was indeed the beauty that led this film as better as it was. I saw "The Pianist" and "Schindler's List", compared the two and filled my thoughts of hatred over the old Germany. But not everything was it seems to be. This film made its light seems ridiculous, impossible but in anyway such impossibility is probable when you know a man's heart speaks truly than they're countries' will.A worth of film certainly. It made me cling to my religion tighter than ever. But really there are those well in the church that seem to know so well but knows nothing at all being in the war could bring forth.</fullReview>

In fact, it's one of the best films of 2005. Christmas eve 1914. The French are in their trenches. A few meters away, the Scots are there to help them. Not 100 meters from there: the German trenches. But on this day, they all decide to call a truce. There will be no bullets flying around on this night. The movie successfully presents the two sides of the same medal: barbarism and humanism. The actors are great, especially the three officers. The cinematography is superb, right from the opening scenes. You really have to see this movie!

		<fullReview>It seems I had waited 44 years for a movie about this fascinating historic event. I love modern history and movies. I purchased this DVD and kept it for Xmas day. This was a tad disappointing. A weak sub plot attempted to pad out the movie involving two singers and at one point I thought it was turning into a musical.The movie was not gritty enough and missed a golden opportunity to show the true horror of the trenches and the incredible beauty of this amazing event. Don't get me wrong its not bad I just expected more. I somehow think this attempt will be bettered when a true filmmaker gets a shot at it. Until then it's a passable attempt and well worth seeing.There is a sermon at the end of the movie that I find questionable. Good subject matter does not guarantee a great movie, however its the rare magic that happens when you mix the two I crave for. Schindler's list and All quiet on the Western front are fine examples. The cinematography was good the DVD has a good quality soundtrack and I found the white balance in a predominately white environment well done. A lack of special features and an historical documentary was also a missed chance.</fullReview>

I saw this film at the movie theater yesterday, and was perhaps a bit skeptical, but I was quickly captured by the storyline....and at the end nobody rushed out, everybody sat completely still and didn't say a word, far into the end credits and that is not something that happens very often.This movie is based on a true story, which makes the message even better.

Why people kill each other for religious beliefs, money or "power" and try to make excuses about it is just not understandable to me. This movie I have to say gave me hope.This movie is one of the movies that you can spend days thinking about. My first thought was that it is a nice Christmas Story. But I checked and found out that it is a true story. If you expect a genuine war movie with huge battles and a lot of action you will be disappointed.Instead what's waiting for you is a story that shows that there was a very special thing that happened during WWI, something that I thought to be impossible. It shows that there is something good in everyone. The church and politicians get a bashing again, but knowing it is true and not fiction should open even more eyes on what's really going on.Acting is excellent, especially the first part depicting what the French Officer feels just before battle. I found the facial expressions to be very good. The actors were able to make you understand what they felt with only a look.I have one little thing that I thought of being not very good. It's the lack of information of the lives of the three officers. We get to know "Spring" quite well, but that's about it.Anyway this was one of the best I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time and when i finally managed to get a copy on DVD i couldn't wait to watch it only to be really disappointed. Joeux Noel doesn't show any of the true horrors of WW1,the trenches look far to clean there's no mud, rats,lethal barbed wire,hardly any carnage or dead mutilated bodies,not that i partically want to see that,but if this film is depicting WW1 then this is what you would expect to see because thats how it really was.The soldiers look far too bright and fresh and don't at all seem exhausted and fatigued or battle weary so it just doesn't convince that they have been fighting in a horrific war.For instance not one of them had shell shock when in reality many of them by that point would have had. Because the film plays down the true horrors of war, when the actual scenes of the Christmas Truce happen it just doesn't seem to mean much,and its all very sudden there's no big build up and not much apprehension,as in reality the soldiers at first believed it was a trick,so they didn't all rush out to shake hands with the Germans as this film suggests. Then what really ruins it for me is the female opera singer who is living in the German trenches who then comes out to sing{mime}to all the soldiers she is all elegantly dressed and of allthings she is wearing a bright red cape,how ridiculous is that.I know its good to stretch your imagination a bit but this is just going to far,there is no way she would have been allowed in the German trenches or any one else's for that matter,and this for me is where the story loses all credibility it just becomes more fiction which is a shame because there really is a good story to be told here.I've been interested in the Christmas Truce for years and have watched many documentaries about it and always thought it would make a great film,however this one just doesn't do it. The Truce scene in Oh What A Lovely War handles the subject much better even if it is for only ten minutes, it captures the atmosphere perfectly and is memorable,this one sadly isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is inspired by a true story about a Christmas Eve truce in 1914 during World War I between the Germans and the English but the story is badly distorted in the movie. Actually there were numerous such truces. None were ever sanctioned by the commanders but contrary to what occurred in the movie, no one was ever censured or punished.Such truces often occur in warfare when two armies face each other during long periods of time in trench warfare. As a Marine Lieutenant in Korea, we had such truces with the Chinese on two occasions, one of which is recorded in one history of the Marines in Korea. In both cases we had been been in trenches opposite each other and the Chinese initiated the truces. Every night we were serenaded by a woman who would also blast us with propaganda and on the two occasions, she invited us to have a truce beginning at dawn the next day ending at sunset. We always wondered where she was during the night so that we could shell her but during the truces, she would come out during day and serenade us. Thus, we found out where she broadcast from and a couple op days after our last truce, we shelled the spot. We never heard form her again and there were no more truces. One of the reasons we agreed to the truces was that it gave each side a chance to recover the bodies and that was the main reason. Moreover, both on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, the Chinese shelled the hell out of us.The movie really takes license with the Christmas truce. It would never have happened the way it did in the movie. No woman would have ever been permitted to get close to the front lines and enemy troops would never been allowed in the opposing trenches. No one was that stupid. and one Christmas Carol that was not sung in the movie was O' Tannenbaum or Christmas tree which actually was sung and very popular with the Germans.For those who want to know more about what really happened I suggest they go to the following Website: http://history1900s.about.com/od/1910s/a/christmastruce.htm Even with all its flaws, I still think it was a good movie. It would have been better if they had left the woman out of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A trite and clichéd but well-intentioned misfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles Dickens knew the importance of establishing horror if you want to show moments of peace or redemption that have real impact. After all, he began A Christmas Carol by emphasising Jacob Marley's death because, without that knowledge, 'nothing wonderful can come of this tale.' Sadly, Christian Carrion's Joyeux Noel/Merry Christmas seems oblivious to that lesson, and so without anything tangible in the way of the horrors of war or the psychologically draining nature of trench warfare by way of contrast, there's no sense of relief or wonder to the brief respite offered by the spontaneous 1914 Christmas Truce on the Western Front. As a result, the film carries no real weight. What's worse is just how horrifically bland it all is.At its best it's well-intentioned pap, a woefully inaccurate retelling that gets practically nothing right, historically or artistically. The scant regard it has for history is bad enough when there are so many powerful true incidents from that period to draw on, but the sheer overpowering wrongness of many of the inventions and the complete lack of any emotional involvement with the barely drawn stereotypes is equally deadly. If you're going to invent, at least invent something better! Perhaps it's the preponderance of production companies involved in this Franco-German-Anglo-Romanian co-production (more than a dozen companies and tax shelter funds are credited) that left it so bland and lifeless ? certainly there's a feeling that this is not the film anyone wanted to make, merely the one that everybody could more or less agree on Most of the performances are weak to invisible, with Gary Lewis failing miserably to provide anything but an actor's extreme discomfort in a role that's meant to be the heart, soul and conscience of the film while Benno Furrman substitutes a look of stoic indigestion for characterisation as Diane Kruger's Danish opera singer in the trenches (no, seriously) mimes her way through the classics. Only Daniel Bruhle makes much of an impression out of his underwritten role, although even he is outshone by a blink-and-you-ll-miss-it cameo from Michel Serrault and Suzanne Flon that briefly wakes up the film.Carrion's previous film, Une Horondelle a Fait le Printemps/The Girl From Paris, was quite superb, for the most part avoiding cliché or whimsy and creating believably flawed characters, which makes his flat handling here seem all the worse. Easily the most desperately disappointing film of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bittersweet, surprisingly heartwarming tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christian Carion is not a prolific filmmaker, but the efforts he does make are noble and display, for the most part, a high level of technical directorial competence despite his relative inexperience. There are of course a few flaws, in this case the hamminess of Diane Kruger and especially Benno Fürmann in two of the lead roles. But although each *part* is made with loving care, on the whole his films seem to lack any sort of grandiose vision or context.Having met and talked (briefly) with Carion my impression is that he is a very kind and very humble man with an earnest desire to see good triumph both in life and on film yet a healthy degree of skepticism as to the capacity of this world to "work things out." I also suspect, however, that he is something of a perfectionist and not perhaps wholly self-confident: there are moments in his films, such as this one, which appear artificial and overly-polished.And I think part of this stems from the fact that Carion tries earnestly to work in a context that he does not fully understand. In the case of Joyeux Noël, Carion tries and unfortunately fails - though his is a much noble failure than that of Jean-Pierre Jeunet in the deliberately commercial "A Very Long Engagement" - to capture the spirit and atmosphere of 1910s Europe. He fails - but he deserves credit for nearly succeeding. Other contemporary filmmakers would have taken the subject of the Christmas Truce and created a banal lesson about top-down bureaucratic WORLD PEACE that would make Eleanor Roosevelt proud. Carion does not succumb to the temptation to do so.Nor does Carion - who was apparently a "seeking" nonbeliever when I met him in 2006 - neglect to amply depict - as James Cameron neglected to do in "Titanic" - the still ubiquitous presence of Christian belief, ritual and cultural referential in the Western society of that time. However, he fails to bind this Christian culture and energy to the characters, and in so doing he fails to provide an important aspect of the context in which the historical Christmas Truce took place: the common religious, ethical and cultural referentials were still strong enough to provide, if only for a moment, a solid covering of chivalry.Not that he doesn't try. Hints are given as to the respective family and parochial lives of the major characters from respectively Scotland, France and Germany, but not nearly enough. Carion doesn't seem comfortable trying to flesh these out more: if he is trying to respect the rule that a writer should stick to writing what he knows, then the film is better off for it. Regrettably, though, the dearth of cultural context means that anyone not already deeply initiated in European history and the Christmas Truce - or even, after a few successive viewings, someone who is - will find that the film seems... small, much smaller and less significant than its subject matter. This WAS, after all, the "War to End Wars," and the truce involved hundreds of thousands of troops along the trenches. Yet Carion never expands outward from the cannon-fodder layer of wartime society - a Christmas Peace had been requested by Pope Benedict XV and rebuffed by the military commanders - and so we never get a sense of the drama or the moral significance of the events.I would say that "Joyeux Noël" is on the whole a failure, but it is a noble failure, one that should provide hints for a jumping off point when somewhere down the road someone decides to paint a more grandiose picture of this under-appreciated happening. But if such an honest and tasteful filmmaker as Carion cannot penetrate deeply enough into the more primordial imagination of the period to portray it more fully, it is questionable whether a truly satisfying and earnest portrayal of the Peace can ever be realized in the modern world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Christmas Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason why I decided to sit down and watch this movie is because I heard about it and decided that it looked like an interesting movie and certainly one which will demonstrate the pointlessness of stuff like this. When I found it I decided to sit down and watch it and this movie succeeds in what it was trying to do.The plot is that as the French, German and Scottish armies are fighting World War One, they all decide one night to cease fire - Christmas Eve. As the sides come out of their trenches they share photographs, items such as champagne and have a musical performance by German opera singers (one who happens to be in the war, the other is his girlfriend) and a mass. The next day they can't go through with killing people who a few hours ago were considered friends. They then decide to hold the cease fire for a little longer to collect dead bodies and bury them and after that they have a football match.There are a few complaints with this movie so I'll just list them. The action is awful. I know it might be a nitpick because there is only 2 action scenes in this movie but it's the kind where I had no idea what is going on. I would also say it is easy to tell that Diane Kruger and Benno Furmann were dubbed in their singing voices, I mean both do pull through really good performances but this is really obvious.Everything else however is really good, I'd say one of my favourite scenes in this movie is when the medic/priest is asked to go back to the parish by another, higher priest and then the higher priest gives a sermon on why killing the Germans who they once considered friends is good, and this isn't an over-the-top shout (nor is any other person who tries to say killing the opposing sides they shared stuff with is a good thing).The acting is fantastic, the writing is really good and so is the directing and the cinematography. Everything the movie wants to say is said really well and it was certainly right to give it a nomination for best foreign language film (although how did that work when three languages are spoken and they're pretty well evened out).My advice is if you want something to watch for Christmas this year then this is certainly one I'd suggest you'd consider. If you're an atheist or non-Christian (which I am) then I'd also suggest checking this one out. If you like War movies then this doesn't really have the action of one but it does have the drama of one. If you're looking for some kind of blend then I'd also suggest this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humanity In Its Rawest Form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set during the Christmas truce in the early stages of WWI, Joyeux Noel presents humanity to the extent of sentimentality, revealed as a fragile entity which should never horrifically suffer. Despite its dire setting in battle trenches Joyeux Noel focused upon the personal events intertwining the characters emotions and relationships at a time ironically defined as the most wonderful time of the year.The use of juxtapositions is a recurring device which brings to attention both extremes of humanity. Still images of the life's wonders such as a merry gathering and relaxing by a lakeside become quickly distorted with the eloquent technique of using children to speak destructive words. "We must exterminate that race" was a response from an English boy, his expression and our acknowledgment of history during the last century was clearly meant to horrify us as a foreboding to humanity's cynical actions as witnessed during the emotional distance soldiers place against their enemies and to some extent their own companions.Yet the juxtapositions strike an emotive chord for the unity of humanity. Joyeux Noel's exceptional inclusion of tenor singing, a remarkable talent which one can only respond in appreciation, is skilfully used to portray the remnants of human beauty left from the onslaught of war. The striking manner of the tenor's voice sets off a mutual respect from all sides of the battlefield as he walks along no man's land as a symbol of unity through music which all humans enjoy. Although sentimentally it can be seen as overblown it is nevertheless effective in its intentions and makes for great drama in the latter stages as the attempt to regain humanity with one another is tragically halted.The humanity theme is also enhanced by the acting's sincerity. All principle actors offer truthfulness to their characters particularly in the earnest relationship between Nikolaus (Benno Furmann) and Anne (Diane Kruger) as the war halts their companionship and Gary Lewis as Father Palmer, a Priest struggling with his faith in the horrors of war. Such complications are worn out clichés in cinema but each actor invests their emotions in making Joyeux Noel heartfelt and worthy of dignity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the story takes place in WW1 in 1914 around Chrismas time in Eastern France. The French, Scottish and Germans are fighting against each other, France and Scottland (UK)are in Triple Alliance and Germany is in the Triple Entente, so they are against each other (duh!). The story starts at the beginning of the war, when the war was declared. Everyone was happy (for years the governments were forcing militarism, imperialism and nationalism on the people (making more and more arms, saying that other countries are bad, telling people that your nation is the best and no other are ever going to match it). So the movie takes place around Chrismas, on Chrismas eve, the Germans had a soldier who was originally a singer, he was called to perform for the prince of Germany (who for some reason bugged me). He brings back his female parter. He performs for his fellow soldiers, and slowly but surely, makes his way near the no man's land (zone that separates the two enemy trenches), singing a Chrismas song. The Scots with there bagpipes start to play the melody, standing near the trench lines. The two enemy generals meet each other, and the french, (a bit jealous) come out too. They exchange whine, chocolate, pictures of their wives, languages, small stories, the name of the cat they find (Germans say it's Felix but the French assure them it's Nestor), they even play soccer. There is also the midnight mass. In the end, this movie is AWESOME, but it bugs me that the generals (or commanders what ever, I'm not sure) all speak English, and the Frech one speaks English and the German one speaks all three (German, French, English) and very well too. So does the female singer. I recommend to everyone, especially the ones who are fond of history (since it's actually based on real facts(they actually played soccer...together), I recommend it to teachers to show to their history class, to anyone who loves a love story, war story, or happy story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know much about the world war I history, so the opening was a little vague. They could have listed a brief description at the very beginning of the movie, so people can get a general idea of this war. That would make this movie so much more interesting to watch. And they should have also typed each army's nationality when they first appeared, so people who can tell which is which.Because I know a little about that part of the history, the first 40 minutes didn't seem to be so interesting. Maybe it was because of the cameras angle, all the three lieutenants seem to be short. They don't seem to have the military men's manners, they act more like common men. Nevertheless, they are good actors.I wanted to stop watching in the first 40 minutes several times. After all, I was thinking tom myself, what is so great about those soldiers singing silent nights together? We already knew that, how long can it last? I thought that that particular part would only last for 5 minutes at the most. I was wrong. It made me cry several times. It was so touching as the movie goes on.At the end, the old priest was intense. He delivered that speech really well. Overall, this is a very good movie. This is a definitely a movie that you can watch it more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For most film lovers a'' Christmas movie '' equals sappy crap with talking snowmen, corny romances and a fat capitalistic midget with a beard. Or the endless adaptations of A Christmas Carol.'' Joyeux Noel '' has a different angle, more mature in every way possible. It's the reconstruction of a forgotten piece of history in which Scottish, French and German soldiers came together from the trenches to celebrate this Christian feast. Their will to be together as humans overcame their grudges and hateful thinking. This is what Christmas is about: being together, and accepting each other for what you are. The tone of the movie is heartwarming and sentimental. And so it should be! There are enough epic war tales about the negative sides of war and their brutalities. This one is focusing on something beautiful without lacking to be be critical towards the concept of war itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christmas Truce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I'd say this was an interesting and important depiction of the Christmas Truce of 1914, where troops on both sides of the lines sporadically declared a cease-fire and often exchanged small gifts. It's been said this was the last dying breathe of the 19th century, when enemies could still act with a sense of chivalry towards one another. All of that, along with the entire Victorian sensibility, came to an end due to the horrors of the First World War. By 1915, the war had become all consuming and the superiors behind the lines made quite sure there would be no repeat of 1914 by shelling enemy lines on Christmas eve.One criticism I'd have of this movie, though, is it's less than flattering portrayal of religion. Keep in mind it was the shared faith of the combatants that created the possibility of such a truce in the first place. That religious hypocrites exist cannot be denied, however this is less a fault of religious beliefs than of man's own hypocrisy and failings. In an interesting book called, "They Thought They Were Free," Milton Mayer points out that, were it not for their Christian faith, the Germans would have been far worse in World War II. In any event, neither World War I or World War II had much to do with religion. Rather, they were wars first of nationalism, then of virulent ideology that grew out of the shattering aftermath of the First World War.Ultimately, Europe has never truly recovered spiritually from the First World War. It was this war, rather than than its sequel, that culturally broke the back of their world. Because of this, it's important that films remembering what World War I was, what it did, and its long-reaching after effects are so necessary. While this is certainly a well-done movie, it would have been more effective had it been a little less broad in its brush and focused more on the tragedy of the First World War, of the senselessness of such a devastating war where there were no real winners, only millions of dead and a society in tatters.It might be well to consider this while watching this film, that it isn't completely within context and the producers seem to have their own agendas based more on their own convictions that reach far beyond the First World War rather than on the facts and causes of that particular conflict and how the Christmas Truce symbolized the last breath of innocence in a world about to essentially commit suicide. By so doing, they might have missed a chance to reach more people, regardless of personal beliefs. I tend to think the pseudo-intellectual tendency to assault people's deeply held religious convictions is counterproductive at best and not fair - individuals may fail to live up to any conviction, whether it be religious, ideological or ethical. I simply feel the portrayal of the bishop was a bit over the top and was presented as the position of the Church hierarchy. Historically, this is inaccurate - the Pope had tried in vain in the autumn of 1914 for all sides to enter in to a cease-fire (p.s., I'm not a Catholic, so this is not a personal defense of that Church - rather it is meant to be fair). It is sad that some tend to view others faith with contempt or disdain, because it clouds our vision and fails to aid in our understanding of what war is and why we should be cautious when entering in to a violent conflict. Again, World War I had nothing to do with religion and everything to do with nationalism. Sometimes it is indeed necessary (see World War II for illustration of this), yet we should never enter in to war with anything but wide-eyes as to what it really mean and only after exhausting other avenues to resolve the issue (Mr. President, please see the above). World War I is perhaps the best example of a war which served no moral purpose other than to kill millions - there were no clear-cut "good guys" or "bad guys" exactly in this war. It's a shame there aren't more movies covering this period in time and how a war nearly a century ago still reverberates throughout European society and beyond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspiring look at humanity- exhibited, crushed and enduring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Christmas Truce of 1914 has always intrigued me. At a time like today when an event like this is almost unimaginable, it is wonderful to see a film that reminds us of a time when humanity could trump ideology. Joyeux Noel effortlessly shows that Germans, Scots and French could lay aside their war for a short time and celebrate the things they had in common instead of those that divided them. The three commanders were the embodiment of the kind of officer everyone hopes exists - intelligent, courageous, loyal to their men, flexible, kind, and generous. The film shows us that the front line soldier sometimes has a greater understanding of the world than the majors, nobility and clergy who are ultimately the power figures. There are many scenes that stand out but the one where Sprinks walks across the snowy No Man's Land carrying a candled Christmas tree singing Adeste Fideles will stay with me forever. The film drips with irony from the threat that the Bishop gives about "killing the Germans now or later" to the prescient scene of the German Jewish commander in a boxcar being sent to his death to the fate of the opera singers. A truly outstanding film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie yet; it's on my list. But I want to tell the people who loved it that there is a wonderful song called 'Christmas in the Trenches', by John McCutcheon, an American folk song writer and performer that is very haunting and beautiful. Unfortunately, it only gets played at Christmas time; in this nightmarish era of massive bloodshed and death, it might be helpful to play it more often. If you type 'Christmas in the Trenches' into Google, you can get the words. If you look up John McCutcheon, you can find out how to get the CD. Whenever I think about this movie, the song plays in my mind. It's unlikely that it will be heard in the film, a Franco-German production, which is a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a war movie but a soldier's movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By Jason Brown Joyeux Noël is a film that gives hope for unifying people of all nationalities, cultures, and faiths. Despite the WWI setting, Joyeux Noël is not a "war movie," rather a soldier's movie (much like Jarhead). It tells the fact-based story of a temporary truce between German, French, and Scottish soldiers from December 24-25, 1914 known simply as "The Christmas Truce." It provides many insights into the soldier's mentality of the times relating to politics and religion.The actors do an amazing job and credit must go to the director, Christian Carion, for skillfully directing this international cast to near perfection. For those who saw Diane Kruger in Troy as just another pretty face, she shows a very convincing and dramatic role as Anna Sörensen. One of her scenes epitomizes the film. Anna enters a French family's home, now the German HQ, and asks the couple where to find someone. The husband ignores her while the wife politely responds. The message is clear; the husband cannot see past the fact that they are the "enemy" and cannot bring himself to socialize with her. The wife, however, saw past that and saw the human being behind the propaganda and talked with her.Joyeux Noël is a must see for anyone looking for a relief from modern war movies. It may not depict the horrors of WWI, but it provides thought-provoking insight into the event and how humility can triumph, even in times of war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Oscar-Nominated Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joyeux Noel is one of the best films about World War I since "All Quiet on the Western Front" (1930). It's clearly more subtle than that film, but director Christian Carion does an excellent job of taking us through a story at a critical time of the early days of The Great War (World War I). The cinematography is brilliant, to say the least. But this is not your usual Hollywood-type 'war' film. The characters are distinctive and the story is compelling, though from a low-key level. German-born Diane Kruger ("National Treasure") never looked more beautiful on screen. Her stunning good-looks can capture any movie-going audience. Her character of Anna Sorensen is strong, yet subtle. The casting for this film was extraordinary - being as perfect as one can possibly hope for. Christian Carion, who also wrote the screenplay, put his heart and soul into this picture - and it shows. This motion picture is sterling. Though nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film, I truly wish that it had actually won the Oscar. The last foreign picture that I felt this good about coming out of a movie theater was "Life is Beautiful". Just from a cinema-graphic point-of-view, Joyeux Noel looks even better than that film! Hopefully, this motion picture will soon be used as a teaching tool in world history classes in universities and secondary schools across America and the world.</fullReview>

NO...It's just a movie about the way that things should be and should have been, it's a movie that desperately tries to keep us alive until tomorrow and also to remind us about how we really are, about how we really feel...The music that inspires the soldiers, the Chistmas that touches their souls are just a frame to contain their real feelings that would have been there deep inside their heart no matter what. Perhaps just being close to death, it reminds us about how precious life is, sadly, the ones that have the power to stop the wars, they never remember they never see things like this, they just continue to drag lives into their small so called causes. STOP listening to these voices and let's all learn something from this movie, that no matter from where we are, no matter what language we speak,what color we have or in what churches we pray, we are all alike and we can all celebrate together not only Chirstmas, but every single day, together in a better world...It's an amazing movie that everybody should see it and understand its message and; it doesn't really matter if the facts are real, they'd better not be, because it would prove us how badly we have failed, until now...ENJOY IT !!</fullReview>

I must say that a bit of the dubbing was bad but you forget all about it after a while.But all the greatest films have songs in like Baz luhrman said ... "Song is the only thing you can put all your emotion into". The songs were used for lots things like prayers to a kind of surrender for Christmas.But above all it really does move you as you get to know the characters and you really feel for them as the story goes on.

		<fullReview>It's not a bad movie -- I'm giving it a 7 -- but it drags a lot because there's really not enough to make a movie out of. there are a heck of a lot worse films out there, but there's really not that much to it in terms of story.After a few scenes to establish some characters, and some very short scenes to show you the "horrors of war" (which doesn't really work because the scene is so short), the film eventually sets up the Christmas Eve truce -- which is basically just a series of light-hearted gags about how we're all the same really.What little character development exists is basically just a means of extending the length of the film. Unfortunately, the character development is pretty ham-fisted most of the time, which made it hard for me to buy into, say, the relationship between the two singers. It's more like the film-makers are saying "take my word for it, these two are lovers, so you should feel for them." You can't do that and still expect me to care. You need to show me some scenes that prove to me these two are deeply in love. It's the same with the relationship between the two Scottish brothers, or with the French Lieutenant and his wife.It's an okay movie -- a pass-time if you're really interested -- but leave it until it comes out on DVD. It's not worth the full cost of a theatre ticket.</fullReview>

At the preview, we had a movie critic who had some facts about this movie that he shared. In reality, there was a cat and it was found guilty of treason and it was executed. They filmed a scene showing the cat being executed but decided to edit it out of the final movie. That to me showed the absurdity of war.

I saw this at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 35 films I viewed there I may have to rank this as high as #2. World War I was so long ago and not as covered by filmmakers as other wars and conflicts. We can name Wings and All Quiet on the Western Front from the 20's and 30's and Sgt York and The African Queen from the 40's and 50's or Lawrence of Arabia and The Blue Max from the 60's and 70's but it's been a long time coming since a good movie about the Great War has come around. I was very familiar with the events of the Christmas 1914 trench truce and this movie is a pretty faithful dramatic composite of actual events. There were a few areas of this film that I would have liked seen a little more background development and character development but this was a good film and I would give it a 8.5 and recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful film, but would Protestant Scottish soldiers really have participated in a Catholic Mass?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been interested in the First World War for almost 40 years, since studying the War Poets at school, and have been aware of the Christmas Truce for a similar length of time. I have read and heard on television reminiscences of men (all now dead) who participated in the truce. It was obviously a very powerful experience for all concerned. Perhaps the most powerful experience was not the truce itself, but the effect on the soldiers when hostilities recommenced, and in many cases for decades afterwards. The English novelist Henry Williamson described his participation in the truce in one of his semi-autobiographical novels and the experience led him not only to question the whole basis of the war, but to develop a strong affinity with the Germans which eventually led to his involvement with fascism and National Socialism.I was therefore very excited when I discovered that this film had been released. It has not been on general release in the UK as yet, but I managed to see it on a business trip to London. Expecting it to be a sell-out, I booked my ticket well in advance, only to discover that I was one of only two members of the audience in the whole cinema! I was surprised and very disappointed by this lack of interest.Bearing in mind my existing knowledge of the truce, the film was pretty much what I expected: powerful and moving in places. However, for me there was a slight lack of credibility because of obvious historical inaccuracies and simplifications.First of all, at the beginning of the film we see two Scottish brothers, who at the outbreak of war are about to enlist. Then we see them in the trenches in France at Christmas 1914. This is highly implausible. The British soldiers in the trenches in December 1914 were those of the Regular Army (The 'Old Contemptibles') together with some Territorial battalions. Unlike Germany and France, which called up trained conscripts, the recruits who joined up in the UK in August 1914 would have had to undergo basic training and very few would have reached the front line in France by Christmas.Secondly, we see the two brothers' Catholic priest (who has also joined up and is serving in the same battalion) leading a multinational 'carol service' on Christmas Eve with prayers and carols in Latin, in other words a Catholic Mass. Not 'Oh Come All Ye Faithful' but 'Adeste Fidelis'. The French would have almost all been Roman Catholic. It is mentioned that the German regiment comes from Munich, in the Catholic south of Germany, so the majority of them would have been Roman Catholic too. A Franco-German Catholic Mass in these circumstances is quite conceivable. But over 80% of Scots at that time were Protestant! Many Catholic Scots had Irish connections and would have been reluctant to join the British Army, so the proportion of Protestants in a Scottish regiment would have been much higher than this. It is easy to forget in these ecumenical times, but sectarianism in Scotland was very strong at that time, which it still is to some extent. The soldiers would have been mainly Church of Scotland, or from one of the other breakaway Presbyterian sects, and it is very unlikely that they would have knows the words of 'Adeste Fidelis' or of the Latin prayers. In the unlikely event that they did, they would have been very reluctant to participate in such an overtly papist ritual, even at Christmas. Yet the film depicts all the Scottish soldiers enthusiastically participating in this Latin Mass! That such a multinational Catholic Mass could have taken place at that time is so implausible that it seriously undermines the credibility of the film.No doubt there are many other slight inaccuracies of this nature, but these are the two that jumped out at me.For those interested in the First World War in general and the Christmas Truce in particular, I would recommend this film as a powerful experience, but they should be aware that although based on a true occurrence, the story itself is fiction with much oversimplification.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly .....boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film manages to render potentially fascinating true events into a story that is, in a word - boring.The characters were one-dimensional and the acting, excepting that of Guillaume Canet and Daniel Brühl, ranged from forgettable to plain bad. Benno Fürmann was especially wooden, and Diane Krüger came across as a silly twit. The Scotsmen were portrayed as, well, "jolly good Scots" and not very bright. Suffice it to say that too many characters were annoying, and as a viewer, I wanted to slap them after a short while.The film itself sunk into Hollywood depths of cheese, which shouldn't have happened in a Euro telling of this subject matter.Very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent in every way; to repeat an earlier comment, why has it taken so long before people get a realistic idea of the event?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm researching my father's army career. He was a Kerry-born regular soldier so found himself in France by the third week of August 1914. His battalion of the Royal Munster Fusiliers some 900 men, had "ceased to exist by the end of September" according to a recent historian, following its rearguard action at Etreux, near Le Cateau. Dad was wounded at Ypres in November 1914, says family folklore, so was in a Manchester UK hospital at the time of the truce His two brothers in the same unit did not survive the war, but Dad did and lived long enough to see his children serve in WW2. The eldest was killed at El Alamein in 1942. Dad never forgave Britain for its Ireland policy post-1918. All this has coloured my own faith and politics with some intensity. Critics of the film should have been in my home when the dreaded War Office letter dropped through the door.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War I Clichés Marshalled For Sentimental Effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Joyeux Noël" uses every movie cliché about World War I since at least "All Quiet on the Western Front". But despite stiff directing and characterizations by writer/director Christian Carion, it still manages to push irresistible buttons and be touching. For all the sentimentality, each character of a very large and genuinely multi-national cast, of French, Germans and Scots, does have his reasons, in that great phrase from Renoir as another war observer. We are never confused which trench we are in. Guillaume Canet is almost distractingly handsome as "Lieutenant Audebert," like a French "Dr. McDreamy." The comparable German hunk Daniel Brühl is all bearded to try to make him look more serious and grown-up, though one of the implied plot themes is that the spontaneous holiday truce is partly made possible at this particular point in the lines because of the youthfulness of those in charge, as the more senior officers are off for Christmas. Their youthful exuberance and naiveté does come through well. French audiences doubtless enjoyed an ironic plot turn when they discuss the nationality of their wives.Canet's off-screen ex-wife Diane Kruger has an odd co-starring role as a soprano who traipses to the front to entertain the troops, with her lover, played by Benno Fürmann with none of the charisma he evinced in "The Princess and the Warrior (Der Krieger und Die Kaiserin)", perhaps due to all the self-sacrificing operatic lip syncing he has to do. He seems like he's acting in an old silent film. But we have seen all these actors do more challenging work.The post-Christmas Eve camaraderie is more intriguing than the go for broke tear-jerking religious and singing cooperation. A more contemporary commentary on the bureaucracy of war is the concluding montage of the reactions by their elders (including a chilling cameo by Ian Richardson as a bishop), as if needing to stamp out a contagious peace virus, whether that part of the story is true or not.While inspired by true events (and there's also a lovely song "Christmas in the Trenches" by John McCutcheon about it as well), there's a certain convenience in setting a fictionalized anti-war film in this view of World War I: there's none of the messy ideological issues of later wars (other than a brief opening with the childs-eye view of the war); the warring parties are all Western European with a mostly shared culture, particularly around religion and the Latin mass (except for a token and heavy-handed reference to one guy being Jewish); some are not far from home, and the countries were close enough so that some had visited each other's neighborhoods and knew their language (sometimes they share French, sometimes English). Though that does lead to the ironic comment by a Frenchman to a German: "You don't have to invade Paris to come have a drink with me."The film evinces only a frisson of the class cynicism that made "A Very Long Engagement (Un long dimanche de fiançailles)" so memorable, the authority issues of "Paths of Glory", or the gritty realism of the British "The Trench". There is just a brief recognition that the generals, as usual, think they are fighting previous wars with a closing mention of regret for the cavalry.The musical score emphasizes the schmaltz, though it is sweet how it is traditional songs that unite them. It was ridiculous that the MPAA originally gave this film an R rating for a brief romantic scene, and the war scenes are more about frozen bodies than blood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated , Bland, Anti-War Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joyeux Noel takes place on the Western Front in the first year of "The Great War" in 1914. The dying monarchies, very much into bluster and uniforms have decided to play a bloody chess game; its pawns, their country's youth. The powers that be have no idea what they are in for. The general feeling is home before Christmas. When this fails to happen, the warring sides stage an impromptu Christmas cease fire to celebrate, play a game of soccer and bury their dead. The warriors behind the line are appalled. You don't start a war to have peace break out on a whim.Writer, director Christian Carrion has made a noble plea for sanity with Joyeux Noel. The film is based on a series of historical facts (Richard Attenborough's "Oh What A Lovely War" had a powerful scene depicting the same incident). But Carrion takes liberties that gives the film a somewhat Hollywood gloss and dated look. Two opera singers happen to be at the front to sing at the event. One is a draftee, the other a beautiful Swedish diva. Things begin to look like an Andy Williams Chrismas Special once the trees and lights are up. Carrion is also more concerned with his universal message than with his characters who mostly serve as cardboard stereotypes, draining the film of some of its humanity. Sincere as Carrion's effort is, it becomes a victim of its own idealism in conveying the incredible waste of human life in "The War to End All Wars". The more cynical viewpoints expressed in Paths of Glory and King and Country with their vainglorious commanders and scapegoated infantrymen drive the point home with far greater force. The ambition of the officers and generals in the rear and their willingness to sacrifice the faceless foot soldier at the front is more at play in these works then in Joyeux Noel whose war mongers tend to caricature. Well intentioned as it is Joyeux Noel is a bland entry to the anti-war film genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is awful, humankind at its worst in a subliminal way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please read the whole comment before you judge. The feelings that this movie shows should get 10 out of 10. But as i read other comments, i understood that the message can be or even the meaning of the movie is mistaken.This movie shows in a cruel way how bad humankind is. More cruel than any violent and bloody film can show. On Christmas the British, French and German are stopping to fight to celebrate Christmas together. How ironic and how realistic. It shows just how much good is in humankind, but isn't used for important things. Who cares that those soldiers were friends for one night, when they shoot each other again. There are no good things in war.If you find this movie heartwarming and showing the good of humankind, you could be the soldier that shoots his friend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silent Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any film based on this subject matter is, by definition, destined to wind up as something of a Curate's egg. The Christmas 'truce' of 1914 has been well documented and even mentioned in passing in several films set in the same period but until now it has never been the centrepiece of a complete film. Given that almost everyone knows ABOUT the truce, albeit vaguely but very few are in possession of any concrete facts the writer-director probably felt it safe to graft his own fictions onto a factual situation probably figuring that 91 years after the event any actual survivors would be well over one hundred years old and hardly in a position to let out a squawk at the odd anomaly. With so many targets - the church, the generals, the propagandists etc - to aim at the scattergun approach is not a bad option on the grounds that SOMETHING is bound to be hit or, to put it another way, some 'ideas' are bound to find favor with SOME viewers. When shooting a film in which three languages figure prominently it's a good idea if the director is reasonably fluent in all three lest any 'message' gets lost in the shuffle. Alas, THIS director is fluent in only one of the three which is all too apparent. The only reason I can think of for top-billing the non-actress Diane Kruger and allowing her to demonstrate that she's also a non-singer and even, ludicrously, a non-MIMER, was to secure finance; to the best of my knowledge feminine lieder singers were conspicuous by their absence at the truce as were, if it comes to that, celebrity Male lieder singers although, in the interests of fairness, SINGING on both sides did feature strongly. For an 'anti-war' tract the horrors of trench warfare are strangely absent and what we get is an almost anti-septic environment which is probably no worse than a camping expedition when the weather turned nasty. On the other hand it is a genuine pleasure to see Suzanne Flon in what may have been her last film sharing the screen with Michel Serrault. One is left with the awkward question What Was It All For; okay the rank-and-file demonstrated that common humanity has it over political machinations every time but lessons WEREN'T learned and within 24 hours half the participants had either killed each other, been killed by their own Generals or shipped out in disgrace. Those who wish to see a message here will do so others will just wonder what it hopes to achieve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>you think the French love to surrender? well you still might think so but not for the same reason...surrending because of love towards others, surrender in lieu of stupidity. you think war is still a good think no matter what? go watch this movie you think there is no humanity in this world anymore and nothing makes you happy about humankind? go and see this movie France has done a surprising job in co-producing this movie with about 6 movies and taking clichés about europe, war, military and telling them apart. you want a make feel good movie made in France, it is probably the only one made in France, usually you usually sleep, snore, get bored and feel really bad about your life, i am french and usually don t watch franco-chiant movies, this one is one to see and to vote for</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Son of a WWI vet, I found this very disappointing. Firstly, it gave a sanitised depiction of trench warfare, further weakened by a schmaltzy and improbable romantic sub-plot and, despite decent performances in the lead roles, a set of caricatured minor characters from central casting(noble priest, slimy bishop,comic-relief Ponchel)and plodding direction - not to mention poor lip-synching of the singers and, as so often, overlit night scenes and unrealistic snow! The essential point - the futility of war - was made in a didactic rather than dramatic way, so that some of the schoolkids in the audience when I saw it were visibly bored. For a multinational production with a worthy aim, this was an opportunity missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thursday March 16, 700pm Metro CinemasJoyeux Noël opens with a moving prologue of school children from France, Germany, Scotland and America reciting the memorized dogma of war. The story builds effectively as the War To End All Wars begins with tearful farewells and marching troops. Unlike most films dealing with the same material, here is a very balanced approach allowing for sympathetic portrayals of all sides. Cinematography, editing, art direction, costumes and visual narrative are all excellent but the film fails to deliver effectively at the pivotal moment and instead fizzles out into inappropriate attempts at ill-conceived humor. Tiny votive candles on holiday trees perfectly and inexplicably light the night of the country battlefield as opposing sides agree to a cease-fire on Christmas Eve 1914. Joyeux Noël concludes with an overstated condemnation of nationalism and organized religion. Set in the horror that eventually cost millions of lives, this story seems far too lighthearted and superficial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The two opera singers are SUCH bad actors, I wondered if they were out of budget for some competent ones. The lip-synchronization was TERRIFYING. They didn't bother AT LEAST watching some operas to see that a soprano cannot possibly sing all those high notes with her mouth almost closed and relaxed like she's singing Christmas songs in a family event. Even Kathleen Battle cannot do that.I wouldn't even want to talk about how RIDICULOUSLY WWI was depicted. Honestly! People DROWNED in mud in Passchendale (sp?) and here's we've got solid ground, tidy trenches, healthy soldiers, etc....Bad dialogues (i.e. 'I have lice')???!!!!! There are far too many fictitious characters. People had shell shock. Here, we've got plenty of characters that seem like Harry Potter counterparts. As somebody else also stated.NOT worth watching. EXTREMELY overrated and boring. By the time I watched half of it, I thought it was an avant-garde movie because it also seemed so naive, but the directors were clearly striving for a typical, joyful Christmas film. And they failed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One hoped that this was all over: Euro Pudding Films. Taking cash from many countries, and in return each country has to get a reward somehow. Here goes...The story is a "natural" for this, involving three countries clashing. With a director and not an auteur this could have been a very nice basis for a decent movie. But the director simply struggles: Three story lines, one dimensional characters, questionable talent (Krüger just can't act, can't even dub her lines properly, Fürmann has been, is and will be a poser, and both of them can't even deliver proper lipsync singing performance. Rest of cast is OK, with Daniel Brühl again a brilliant stand out; the man's just got it, presence, you now what I mean. Technical credits soso, just OK for these days. In parts very bad editing (eg. going from mid shot to mid shot with different light set up on Krüger, awful). BUT the movie is just BORING. I found it difficult to sit through. OK for DVD. Don't spend money on a cinema ticket. It's a bomb in Germany and now I know why!</fullReview>
