		<shortDescription>Why laugh? Why not?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why, but I seriously can't help but laugh at the Harold and Kumar movies. They're so over the top and silly that you can't help but laugh. The first adventure we went on with them, they just had the munchies and needed some White Castle. The second adventure was to get the loves of their lives back and end up going to Guantanamo Bay. Now, we get to celebrate the joyful holiday of Christmas with them. I admit that when I saw the trailer for this one, it didn't make me laugh too much. I wasn't sure if this was going to have the same kick as the previous films had, but A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas not only delivered in the laughs but was actually a very good movie that in it's own crude way was a touching story about how friends can grow apart but reunite by the weirdest situations.Harold is now a successful businessman who works at a popular company while Kumar is still living the life of a stoner handling a bad break up with Vanessa. At Maria's Christmas party, Harold meets Maria's father. He explains to Harold that he never had a perfect Christmas and he is counting on Harold to make this one the best for his daughter, Harold's wife Maria. Maria's father also brings to Harold's house the perfect Christmas tree. When a package addressed to Harold arrives at Kumar's apartment, he decides to deliver it to Harold. The package turns out to be a large marijuana joint that Kumar cannot resist smoking. Since Harold has gotten married and does not get high anymore, he knocks the lit joint out of Kumar's hands and it lands in the tree and causing a fire. So now Harold and Kumar are on a new adventure to get the tree back before the family returns.I know that the situations were out of control. We have some dark jokes with a child taking every extreme drug known to man, we have Neil Patrick Harris on the verge of raping a woman. I know I should have been disturbed technically, but why not just have a good time and remind yourself that this is just a movie? I thought Neil Patrick Harris was just too funny as usual when the boys ask him where he's been and that he got shot and branded a hooker, he replies with "can you be more specific?", I almost died laughing. I loved the creepy waffle making robot that Kumar had, how it actually loved Kumar and saved his life. But the moment that really got to me was seeing the kid who was on every crazy drug running around on the ceiling, it was so out there that I just had to laugh.Like I said, there are some very extreme jokes that a lot of people will take offense too easily. There is a moment where Neil Patrick Harris is talking about Heaven and I know that if you have strong religious beliefs, you're not going to like that scene. Though I don' know why then you are seeing a Harold and Kumar movie since they're not listed in the tactful department. But what I really liked about this story is that it showed their softer side, Harold is growing up and Kumar wants to stay the same as a stoner who is just cruising through life, we all have friends like that and it's hard to keep in touch when you're on different paths. I loved seeing them remember what's important, that it's OK to let go a little bit or that it's OK to grow up. I would recommend this for the fans, it's a great follow up to our favorite stoners. If you're looking for a good laugh, I think you're in for a treat, Harold and Kumar do not disappoint.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plenty of silly, social comment and "oh no they didn't" laughs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked the first two Harold &amp; Kumar movies then you will likely like this one. If you have never seen a Harold &amp; Kumar movie they are implausible story line, very irreverent, even crass, comedies that always break taboos.This movie's story line is again unlikely and at times totally ridiculous, it's a total cut up comedy. You get the sense that the actors were having fun while they were filming. I laughed (and moaned) throughout the entire movie which I think is kind of the benchmark for this genre.A lot of the humor uses or pokes fun at the 3D effects so see it in 3D if you can, it's a real treat, the effects are great. There was enough pot smoke and coke blown in you face that you could almost get high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harold and Kumar make decorating a Christmas tree a wild and dangerous adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think part of the reason the first movie worked so well is because going to White Castle is, relatively, a very simple, ordinary trip. But when it's Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) it becomes a very wild adventure. I didn't enjoy the second one as much because escaping from Guantanamo Bay wouldn't be an easy task for anybody. For this third movie, Harold and Kumar are back to turn a routine errand into a hair-raising, hazardous experience. Harold has to decorate a Christmas tree.But when Kumar comes over and accidentally burns down the tree, they then have to find a new one, steal it from a drug-lord gangster thug, try to not rape his daughter, crash a musical production of The Nutcracker, and limit the number of people they shoot and drug (to only Santa Claus and a baby).The 3D is of course a gimmick. They know that; we know that. It involves joints coming out of the screen and eggs, blood, and guts. It is as juvenile and pointless as you can get. But that is the point.The jokes are of course offensive. But, again, that's the point. It makes it okay when the out-and-proud Neil Patrick Harris makes gay jokes, or when Cho and Penn make racial jokes.I enjoyed the journey that they take in "A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas". Every time the baby found a new drug to imbibe, or Kumar smoked another joint, I laughed. It's the type of humour that has made the franchise so successful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very stonerific if there was such a word:)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morally wrong on soo many levels and unnecessarily filmed in 3D but that somehow managed to work pretty well for the most part but this film is so much fun and hysterically funny that you will have a blast. It's great to see all of these lively and wacky characters come back to the big screen that it should be a every year tradition because their company never gets old and it will have to be one of the best stoner comedies ever as well as Christmas comedy ever next to Christmas Vacation. The thing I like about these movies are that the jokes are relevant, ballsy and unapologetic kind of like Family Guy and they are to me always consistent with making me laugh because of the outrageousness that I just can't get enough of this series, they are on a roll! Overall this is a treat for only fans of the series because if you were offended by them before this one won't change your mind, you will love it or you will hate it, I for one loved it!!!! Bring on more Harold &amp; Kumar!!! Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Funny Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas is not going to surprise anyone. It follows the same successful formula and chemistry between John Cho and Kal Penn as the first two. The film also is rude, inappropriate and has questionable taste just like the first two. So while the basic concept is the same, it has been plugged into a Christmas setting making fun of the holiday and managing to shoot Santa Claus in the face in the process. Damn it's funny! I'm not big on buddy comedies but behind closed doors I secretly love Harold &amp; Kumar. White Castle was funny, Guantanamo Bay was even funnier taking on the issue of race and national security, and 3D Christmas is poking fun at religion and holidays. Because many may be afraid of being ridiculed for touching sacred subjects and therefore don't, Harold &amp; Kumar movies repeatedly take on the challenge and find something original to laugh about. Sure making a baby high, John having his penis stuck to a metal frozen pole, and poking fun at the Catholic sex scandals may be inappropriate to some, but everything's fair in comedy and what the filmmakers have done will make you laugh over and over. So while much of the film may be ridiculously over the top, it all works. And while we don't see enough of Bobby Lee in the film who seems to be able to make you laugh without doing much, we do get Neil Patrick Harris playing himself as a closeted heterosexual. That scene is not just really funny throughout, but it steals the show. His scene is nothing short of a "must see" moment that is destined to be classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a 3D Movie that Entertains!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have an affection for raunchy comedies and I love 3D so this marriage in "A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas" definitely filled voids in places where most movies have been lacking as of late.First and foremost, the movie was entertaining throughout with no dull moments. All the characters were great and Neil Patrick Harris was hysterical. Although some might think this film could be considered lowbrow, it really isn't because it was well written and the situations (as absurd as they are) work to even satisfy an intelligent viewer with a good time.The 3D experience was better in this movie than most I've seen in years. It was consistent throughout, no eyestrain, very clean, and had some nice out-of-screen effects that paired well with the comedy.As morally and politically incorrect this movie is; it ultimately does have a good message with a lot of heart and actually put me into the Holiday spirit! I know; I can't even believe I just stated that but sadly it's true. I'm definitely jaded, but then again aren't we all by now? Definitely a must see in 3D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's goes back to it's roots of being simple but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What started as a simple stoner trip comedy, becomes something that pushes the limit with every installment. And that is the case with this 3rd one, most of the humor comes from that is so messed up that it's funny...Well for some viewers at least although it can offend the others. While some movies the 3D is not worth it, this is one of those movie that has to be seen in 3D if your going to watch it. And for the most part the 3D is worth it and it actually plays a crucial part in the movie since the plot brings out and gives 3D scenarios. If you don't see it in 3D it can be a bit confusing cause you might not get some of the jokes. Anyways if you liked stoner comedies and comedies that pushes the limits this movie might be worth checking out. The movie had one special ingredient that made this movie better than the second one and that is the simple but fun aspect. Although Harold and Kumar is not in college anymore and is now full adults, I wouldn't mind another sequel.7.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roldy and Kumar and Great 3D!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To put it simply, Harold and Kumar was incredibly funny. The movie is set six years after they escape from G bay (you must ignore the fact they haven't aged). For me to say this was just another Harold and Kumar movie would be unfair. I loved the first one. Simple premise with many jokes and characters along the way. Half of what made it funny was the fact Roldy and Kumar were going through this hell just to have some fast food. Escape from G bay had funny moments but them escaping a maximum security prison holding war criminals to reach America and regain their innocence? It was a little much. Don't get me wrong I still liked it but it felt like that magic was gone with the simplicity of the first. So when I saw the third was about to come out and it was a "christmas special" I felt hopeful for a good one but not confident. The third instalment had that simplicity again. Yes, there was new characters and the 3D was new but they all worked so perfectly. Yes certain things were dumb and even weird like the fake baby Jesus winking at me or a coked up baby running around on the ceiling but its that kind of movie! They were going through hell once again to simply find a Christmas tree. The new characters were very funny and the old jokes and characters were seen and told in a new way (unlike Hangover 2). Another new character was the use of 3D in this instalment. It was incredible, and not just the smoke and coke flying at me but characters acknowledging it and poking fun. Bottom line is its OK to be apprehensive because the second one was just alright and a comedy like this in 3D could be thought of as being corny and trying to hard but they pulled it off perfectly. Harold and Kumar is dumb fun and for what it is this is a great comedy. Just make sure you catch it in 3D! Read my other reviews at rollginreviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So naughty it's actually nice!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like just earlier this week was Halloween... oh, wait a tic, it WAS Halloween.&nbsp;The beginning of November is an unusually early time fir a Christmas movie to come out, but then again, it's not like there hasn't ever been a Christmas movie that's been released at the beginning of November. This year, it's Harold and Kumar who have taken the honour of releasing a Christmas movie near the beginning of the year, and for such a premature Christmas film, surprisingly it turned out to be great!A Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas is more fun than it has he right to be. For one, you can tell by the trailer it promises fun to be had, and it lives up to the promise. The film in tone, is like a mix of the first two movies. It has the ridiculousness of the second movie mixed with the style of the first. In addition, throw in NPH, Amir from CollegeHumor and characters we've seen before, and you have yourself what may be the most fun film of the series.The film takes place 6 years after the first. A you may expect, hard working Harold is successful, has the beautiful Maria as his wife, and life couldn't be any better for him. Meanwhile Kumar is a big fat and lazy frack-up. He sits at home and smokes pot all day, and has blown his chance at true love.&nbsp;Harold has invited his father in law (played by Danny Trejo!), who inadvertly brings his whole family to the household. The prejudiced in law replaces the faux tree with a naturally grown Christmas tree. When Kumar receives a package for Harold, he takes it over, where they reunite and discover, it's a mega joint. Kumar tries to burn it up, but they inadvertly burn the tree... Resulting in the two going on another zany adventure, this time to replace the tree!!!First off, you know what to expect, from a Harold and Kumar movie, however that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Because the film is consistently funny throughout and manages to keep you laughing until the final frame. The jokes are raunchier than ever! There's babies taking drugs, Russian mafia jokes, dark humour, you name it. There isn't a thing this film doesn't have.The star power helps too- while they may be getting a bit old (Cho is 40, and damn he looks so young, how do I look that handsome at 40), Cho and Penn deliver the usual great performances, but I must note, holy crap, Cho really does prove himself as the talented actor he is here. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Penn too, but Cho was easily the attraction for me. Trejo,well, what's not to love about him? Excellent actor and it shows, Patton Oswalt is hilarious as expected and Amir from CollegeHumor is a great actor here as well. And Neil Patrick Harris... Well, who can deny his brilliance?The 3D, on the other hand, is what prevents me from giving it a full mark. As you may have seen in the previews, it does abuse the gimmick greatly, but otherwise you really shouldn't waste your money. The screen gets very blurry during the more motion-y shots, and other than the flying out, it doesn't really come as good use.Otherwise, the new Harold and Kumar film is very enjoyable. And surprisingly very heartfelt too, as it has a great message about friendship. It will indeed snap you into the Christmas spirit and make you feel happy indeed. And while it may not be the best of the series, nonetheless it is indeed very enjoyableOVERALL: 8/10THE GOOD: This latest entry in the series proves to be insanely fun entry with everything you could expect in a H&amp;K movie, and more.THE BAD: The 3D. Not like that's anything new,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Poor Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I loved the first movie. It was a very nice idea with some good laughs. Then there was the second movie, which I think lacked for laughs a lot compared to the first. And then this! All I can say is, apart from a baby getting high with the munchies, and a penis stuck to a frozen pipe, this was the worst of the three movies. I hate to say it, but if you liked the first two and think this will be the same, don't get your hopes up. It's terrible. And WTF is up with the 3D? This ruined it for me hugely, because there are good 3D movies, and then there are really cheesy diliberate 3D 'pokes' at the screen to make you go, 'Awesome!'. Once I had saw the trailer I thought that it was a family movie, that's how low this third sequel has dropped since the first two. It's an 18A? It should be a 12A! Yeah there's drugs and some nudity in it but, really? This isn't something for fans of the first two movies. I still don't know how this movie has got a 7.2 Rating. It should be a 3.4 rating. Overall, if you have seen the first two movies, I don't recommend this one. Unless you want to because you might as well see this as you have seen the first two. If you have'nt, then you won't be as disappointed as I am. I hope that they pick it up again and bring a much better fourth part to these movies. And if it turns out like this one, I will give up with Harold &amp; Kumar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well how to put this....i was so anxiously waiting for this movie to come out as it set the tone in the last two amazing ventures. I was expecting the same old Harold &amp; Kumar type of jokes and was ready to laugh my ass off on this one too but i was Disappointed!! The movie was dragged and got boring to an extent that i was talking to myself that am i really watching Harold &amp; Kumar?? This movie was released in 3D which the director really really strongly emphasized on many occasions which looked pretty rookie to me...Lastly, the type of jokes were not Harold &amp; Kumar standard at all..especially on few occasions i thought they took it overboard...The heaven joke which i think was way too bizarre and was not required at all....Final word: i wish they had lived up to the legacy of Harold &amp; Kumar!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are people saying this one is the best of the three movies, some say it's the worst. I say, this movie is so bad directed you can't even relate it to the previous 2! This is obviously a movie not for kids, so why put Santa claus, the hero waffle robot and miracles in this?I really don't get the point of the director...Another thing that annoyed me is the 3D thing. During the whole movie you will see hats and things flying in slow movie just to show people the 3d technology... First 2 times:"yeah OK they need to show off this 3D thing". The 20th time:" omfg why they keep doing this?". It gets really annoying! It has some great moments too, but its a disgrace when comparing to the first 2. Any other director would have made this a great movie! This is one of the most overrated movies i've seen here, NEVER a 7.1!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly, significantly weaker than the other Harold and Kumar movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... fortunately, however, "significantly weaker" still equals very funny. But there are just a handful of laughs spread throughout this picture rather than a constant supply.Of course, all humour is subjective, but having the two title characters apart for so long in the movie does harm the laughs, even though it does drive the narrative. There's also an awkward "feel good" "moral of the story" motif to the picture. Still, this being Harold and Kumar, then part of the "warm" moments does involve the term "cock meat sandwich".Lots of the genuine humorous moments occur with the parodies of 3D. However, how well this will play if the movie is broadcast in 2D remains to be seen. Like the seasonal motif, A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas limits itself with the 3D gimmick, unless it has designs on becoming a holiday staple.The equal opportunity offending continues in decent form, though seeing a baby getting high is in questionable taste even for this series. As in previous films, a highlight is Neil Patrick Harris, though his assertion that "we'll see you in the fourth one" does nod towards a slightly cynical edge in this film's construction.Overall, still a pretty funny movie in its own right, but worrying signs that the joke is beginning to wear thin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3D part of the gag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold &amp; Kummar movies are mercifully free of hypocrisy, with no taboo left unviolated. This is not a film you take your mother to (let her see it by herself). Everyone is criticizing the 3D as gratuitous, but it was part of the humor, exaggerated like in Piranha 3D. I usually despise 3D as a pointless distraction; this was a rare occasion when it seemed to fit. Pot smoke wafting out towards the audience--what better use of 3D? How could anyone complain about gratuitous 3D given this film's other excesses? One could similarly call the clay animation sequence gratuitous, but it was brilliant! It seems to me that these H&amp;K movies contain some serious messages on drugs, race, and other social issues rolled up with the crude humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drifted into its stoner world along the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Harold &amp; Kumar franchise is beginning to show signs of wear and tear, yet it still packs fun and laughs because of its actors and the lively, upbeat material. That's not to say the material is always shining, in fact, in terms of writing, this is probably the raunchiest installment in the franchise yet. Which doesn't mean it is the funniest. This may be the least funny of the series, yet this seems on the same level as Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, an inferior but amusing sequel.Being faced with the third installment is always an iffy place to be. Especially when you see it end. You try and think to yourself whether or not a sequel will be made. Here? I'm honestly not sure. I don't want there to be, but there are a few set ups which make it seem like they are considering it. No sequel will match the humor the introduction to these characters brought us. It was erected from the simplicity of the story and the extreme likability of the characters.John Cho and Kal Penn, who took a leave from his position at the White House, reprise their roles as the stoner duo who have now been out of contact for six years. Harold is a successful Wall Street banker, while Kumar is busy sitting on his couch with his buddy, smoking pot, and waiting for the next random hookup. Harold is married to the love of his life Maria (Garces), and her side of the family, including her father (Trejo), is coming over on Christmas Eve.Maria's family is made up of thugs with tattoos and heavy muscles. Her father loves Christmas and cherishes it because when he was young he never had a respectable celebration with his family. When Maria and her family leave to attend a Midnight Mass, Harold is left in charge to decorate the authentic Christmas tree. Kumar comes over, and the duo accidentally burn down the tree (think hard, and the way they do it will come to you).Harold and Kumar now team up to try and find a new Christmas tree for the family before the family comes home. Joining them for a brief amount of time on their adventure is Harold's friend, a new father with a child and Kumar's buddy who is hellbent on having sex with a young virgin. The baby jokes almost completely destroy the film with her inhaling marijuana smoke and cocaine. The result isn't laughter, but a cringing factor that can easily destroy a comedy film.Thankfully, those two "characters" are abandoned while the real stars do what they do best. Wander around aimlessly, falling into comedic traps that are sometimes funny and sometimes not. Somewhere along the way in the second film, Harold &amp; Kumar morphed into a strange, comedic fantasy rather than a straight forward comedy.There was a gag in the second film about a child with a severe birth defect giving him only one eye, and very many scenes in this film involving fictionalized events such as a baby crawling around on the roof after getting mixed in with cocaine and the certain appearance of a jolly character. We begin to question why did the filmmakers feel the need to incorporate such far-fetched elements in a comedy. I believe it just adds to the phrase "stoner comedy film." As far as the 3D aspect of the film, it's there but not necessary. It looks better than a lot of 3D films I've seen over the years, but the extra ticket price is absurd for a film like this. One thing that incredibly aggravates me about this film is the fact that it is what I call a "3D abuser." This is the reason why 3D is a lose-lose for a movie; if you incorporate too many 3D elements in the film (IE: throwing things at the audience or having an opening credit sequence devoted to using the extra dimension) it will look awkward and out of place by the time you watch the 2D DVD. If you don't put the dimension to use and don't utilize enough, the film will be criticized for even using it in the first place. A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas, when titled something like A Very Harold &amp; Kumar Christmas on DVD, will look awkward and very, very strange on a 2D disc.But numerous pluses continue to put a smile on my easily pleased face. The presence of Neil Patrick Harris, the use of the two leads to the fullest degree, the excellent claymation sequence, and the touching ending show just what the franchise has long been about. Heart and hilarity. As much as I loved the first film and have a soft spot for each sequel, it's time for a good thing to come to an end. The series has just about overstayed its welcome, and another sequel could very much put an unwanted stain on the fabric of the franchise, like so many filmmakers feel like doing to franchises now.A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas is good, pre-holiday fun. It's not as downbeat and as miserable as Bad Santa, yet it doesn't have the pleasing plot of a Christmas classic. It takes its R rating, embraces it, and is proud of the way its traveled. After all, adventures to White Castle, Guantanamo Bay, and a search for a giant Christmas tree in the span of a few years is what I would call a long odyssey. An odyssey that should dock and deport before it goes into uncharted territory.Starring: John Cho, Kal Penn, Neil Patrick Harris, Danny Trejo, Paul Garces, and Bobby Lee. Directed by: Todd Strauss-Schulson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the Best of the Stoner Comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, Harold and Kumar bring it with more completely original ideas that made me laugh like a maniac several times throughout the movie. These guys once again prove that anything can be funnier if you add weed and nudity. And the fact that Kal Penn can still make these movies and maintain a respectable reputation at the White House is hilarious enough as it is.As good as this one was, however, it didn't really live up to the expectations that were set by "Guantanamo Bay". Maybe it's because when I saw that one, it was in a packed theatre at 10 pm with a bunch of stoners laughing their guts out at every single joke. As unappealing as that sounds (I wasn't stoned during this movie), it's those types of things that make movies THAT much better if you ask me. Laughing my butt off with 30 or more people, including a few random 14 year olds who needed to pretend they were with me in order to get in (true story) just wasn't the same.Something that really bugged me was how NPH was barely used in this one. Although his picture actually made it poster this time, he wasn't really in it as much as I hoped. Come to think of it, many of the old jokes from "White Castle" and "Guantanamo Bay" weren't used at all.And whether or not it was the theatre I went to, the 3D was disgraceful. I almost suggest seeing the 2D version: your eyes won't hurt, you'll save a few bucks, and you really won't miss anything.But even though it may not have lived up to the previous ones, Harold and Kumar prove once again that as far as epic stoner comedies go, they can't be beat. This one left me sore from laughing, and with an itch to see more (even though, once again, I wasn't stoned). I strongly suggest you get a big group to go to this one; the more laughs around you, the funnier this movie will be.And of course, there's nothing like getting into the Christmas spirit a little early. Especially if you celebrate Christmas like these guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is inevitable that a film will be benchmarked against its predecessors, if they exist and particularly, if they have excelled. For those wondering, this hits a middle ground between both 'Whitecastle' and 'Guantanamo Bay'. A travesty though that it seemed to pick the worst aspects of the two previous instalments. It didn't push the limits of offence like the first and became a watered down, lame excuse for a stoner comedy. It fell prey to some of the flaws of 'Guantanamo Bay' by throwing in emotion and other 'mushy' themes which don't befit a stoner comedy. Most of all though, it made you feel as if it has been rigidly structured, choreographed almost. It lacked the spontaneity and instinct you come to laugh at.After 'Guantanamo Bay' disappointed cult followers of the first, the pledge was to make the third of the trilogy more in the vein of the original; raw, R-rated hilarity playing on stereotypes and being unafraid to venture into 'touchy' topics and treating them with light heartedness. What has been churned out is something more refined, like an urbanised, commercial 'Harold and Kumar' film, which ultimately, being harsh I admit, came across as a cheap takeoff on the franchise. Kal Penn really didn't take the bull by the horns as he needed to and has done previously. Kumar seemed more vulnerable and Harold more assertive which changes the complex of the chemistry and made the pair more conservative than adventurous. The amount and involvement of other old and new characters makes the film more than just a Harold and Kumar Christmas, but they all contribute negligibly. The one saving grace was Neil Patrick Harris. He seems to garner unanimous love from everywhere these days but his ironic real self mocking act is truly the icing and shows he is so respected and popular, not to mention superb in this self fictionalised role. If you want something true to 'Harold and Kumar' style, scenes with him will satisfy you. Yet, in spite of being the one consistent factor, he was but a guest star.In the end, it was hard to decide whether a kid consuming and getting high on drugs was funny, wrong or just plain daft. Oh yeah, and by the way, it was in 3D. If that really matters anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harold &amp; Kumar Jump Back on the Shark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the nicest qualities of the H&amp;K series is that though it's over-the-top in specific scenes, they never go too far. Sure, there's raunchiness, but only in certain spots. And in this day and age, while every "gross-out" comedy is trying to out-perform the previous film, this franchise knows where the line is, refuse to cross it for the simple sake of crossing it and allow the jokes, writing and acting take center stage. Applaud from this viewer.While the newest installment, A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas is actually the weakest of the three, that doesn't mean it isn't still a lot of fun, hilarious in spots and its one of those rare movies that starts off good and unbelievably, gets better as the movie progresses.The first half is chock-full of gimmicky 3D and though it appears as if they're trying to make a 3D-Overkill statement, it's so much that I'm glad to see them ease up in the last half and make way for a good story. Despite the same ole buddy-movie/"I'm getting too old for this sh*t" plot, it was still enjoyable with the reliable portrayals from both Kal Penn and John Cho.The movie takes place years after Harold &amp; Kumar's second adventure to Guantanamo Bay and the boys have split up. Kumar's somewhat content at not moving forward ? if anything, he's getting worse and Harold's all grown up and happily married. Well, there wouldn't be a movie if they didn't get back to the misadventures they're known for.Instead of craving White Castle or avoiding the law, they settle on replacing a Christmas tree in order to not upset Harold's Machete-staring Father-in-Law.That's the easy explanation. The fun is following these duffuses around New Jersey/NYC and giving away anything (more) would be spoilers. Suffice to say, if you liked the other two, there's absolutely NO reason you wouldn't be pleased here.While the movie's recommended, I would also recommend ? no demand ? that you see it in Read 3D. 50% of the movie is that gimmick and so, watching it in 2D, you would be losing half of the entertainment.And now, bring on Harold &amp; Kumar Part 4:20.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Good as the First Two Predecessor Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you seen the first two movies and expect it to be the same comedy and shenanigans Harold and Kumar get themselves into from getting high or from racial profiling then don't see this movie. If your new then you probably like it for being a standalone Christmas, family movie. First of all the story sucks Harold's Christmas tree catches on fire and they have to find a new one, very basic. Different from going to different escapades from a variety of incidents involving getting high or being chased by a protagonist/racists. It felt like a b-grade Christmas movie in a rental store that nobody would want to borrow out, too much attention was involved to the 3D that they just couldn't bother writing scenarios for the movie. It felt boring through the scenes seeing objects fly towards you like confetti, eggs, cocaine, honey.What it should of focus on was stereotypes and comic relief that gets them in a problem and they somehow get out of it. It felt like it was also lacking jokes that the writers were scrapping from the bottom of a barrel to find any. That they had to have a baby involved such as getting high on marijuana but after that took it a step too far with cocaine. There's no stereotypical jokes or shows Harold and Kumar trying new stuff out. The character development was lacking even for Harold and Kumar it felt like they had no bond between them because the creators had to bring two other boring characters such as Todd (with a baby) and Adrian, one for Harold and one for Kumar feels like they needed one white card each. The Ukraine mafia was too slapstick and didn't chase Harold and Kumar around like they were with the CIA.Rosenberg and Goldstein had a short part and one was converted to Christianity, why not Islam or some other religion that's just typical for a Christmas movie. The only thing funny in this movie was the claymation of Harold and Kumar, Neil Patrick Harris (as funny as always) and the waffle robot which seemed to replace the imaginary marijuana bag of Kumar's fantasy. Also Harold having his genitalia stuck to a pole and scolded with hot coffee. Just saying that I recommend to just skip to those scenes or off youtube clips you don't need to see the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good but not compared to the second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the 3rd installment of the harold and kumar series and let me tell you it is not as good as the second one. It is definitely funny and has its moments but the second one is still the best.This movie takes place many years after the second and harold and kumar are no longer friends. Harold has his own life now and kumar does nothing but get stoned. So a strange circumstance brings them together again and then kumar screws up big time (The whole reason harold stopped hanging out with him in the first place) Then they have to go all over new york trying to fix kumars mistake.This movie was not bad but after seeing the second one nothing could really beat that. This movie is definitely worth seeing if your a fan of the series don't get me wrong but don't expect it to beat out the second one its one par or maybe a bit lower then the first. Enjoy people</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These movies get weirder and weirder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall the first Harold &amp; Kumar movie being unlikely but having, if not one foot in reality, at least a toe or two. But this time around the whole movie is like a druggy dream sequence, so if you don't care for a string of utterly ridiculous occurrences you might be put off with this one.Fortunately, I like silly and ridiculous if it's done well, and this is done very well. The movie is wonderfully offensive, and some things, like the increasingly stoned little girl, are wildly, inappropriately hilarious.While I saw this on TV, this is a movie I think I would have liked to see in 3D, because it is apparent that they did a lot of entertaining, throw-stuff-at-the-camera stuff that's pretty clever, even in 2D. For the first 15 minutes I was thinking, how many times can these guys go to the well, and I'm not sure I feel we need any more of these, but truthfully, if they make another one I'll watch it, because they're just very funny movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Great Raunchy Holiday Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a franchise I'm glad has managed to continue on despite it's limited premise and misfire of a second film (sorry?GUANTANAMO BAY was weak and we're lucky they produced a third film). For whatever reason, I don't mind coming back to the adventures of Harold and Kumar. I guess I just enjoyed the first film so much that I keep hoping the next will be as good as the original. They never are, and probably won't be, but this was still a great attempt. A VERY HAROLD &amp; KUMAR Christmas is better than the second movie but still fails to recapture the original sense of adventure of their first quest to White Castle. The movie is set six years after the previous movie. Harold has moved on to a successful career and married his beautiful neighbor from the first two films, Maria; Kumar has been booted from medical school and spends the majority of his time stoned on his couch with his spastic and totally unfulfilling new friend Adrian. As if his life wasn't painfully stagnant enough, Vanessa returns to inform Kumar that she's pregnant with his child. Mind-blowing for poor burnt-out Kumar, who's never before really felt he had to accept responsibility for his life. As if by fate, a mysterious package arrives at Kumar's apartment for Harold and he sets out to deliver it. Long story short, his visit to Harold ends with Harold's father-in-law's beloved Christmas tree burning to the ground, and the duo are brought together on Christmas Eve on a new adventure.To be honest, I doubt we'll ever get another Harold and Kumar adventure as fun and fresh as the first one. But as long as they don't try to rehash the original and cash in on what made it so fun to begin with (ahem?GUANTANAMO BAY), then I think there could still be some life left in the series. I think what I enjoyed most about the Christmas movie was that it didn't follow the same formula so closely. I realize the Harold and Kumar movies are always going to be about the two of them finding themselves in a ridiculous situation and encountering wacky shenanigans in trying to accomplish their goal (in this case, replacing Danny Trejo's Christmas tree), but the last movie played it a little too safe in copying the best bits of the original. This movie breaks out from the mold just enough to feel fresher while retaining the best elements of the movies that came before (e.g. of course Neil Patrick Harris is back?death can't stop the NPH). Just as the first two movies utilized fantasy sequences, Christmas has it's own in the form of a Claymation adventure. I loved it! It was the funniest bit in the film. What's Christmas without a Claymation special? Except in this case our "heroes" are escaping from a 100-ft tall flesh-eating Frosty the Snowman. There's a lot of laughs in the movie and the Christmas theme hasn't softened the humor at all; if anything, it's just made it better.John Cho and Kal Penn haven't lost an ounce of their awesome chemistry and continue to play perfectly off each other. Cho is still the level-headed straight-man and Penn is the oblivious stoner, but they're characters have each grown up a bit since their escape from Guantanamo (well, mostly Cho's). With these two in the lead, I don't know that I'd ever get tired of Harold and Kumar. Of course Neil Patrick Harris is back for his obligatory cameo and his explanation for how he returned from his death at the Texas brothel makes for a hilarious cut-away. After his too-brief appearance, he insinuates that he'll see the titular duo in the fourth movie and I'm really hoping he's right. Sure, the H&amp;K movies fall into a formula but as long as the screenwriters/directors do their best to change things up the best they can, there's still hope. Christmas is a really fun movie and actually maintains a little bit of sentimentality that comes with the holiday as Harold tries to appease his father-in-law (a hilarious cameo from Danny Trejo) and Kumar tries to rise into his upcoming role as father to a child. So if you're a fan of Harold and Kumar's continuing antics, there will be plenty to like here. It shows that there might yet still be some life left in the series for a fourth film a couple years down the line. I suppose the next might feature their children in H&amp;K: The Next Generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas (2011) - Grab Some Weed, Get the Christmas Spirit, Bring NPH to the Party, and We Will Begin!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly have never seen the previous Harold and Kumar movies, but from the media, I hear that the first movie made audiences crap their pants laughing, while the second movie didn't make the audience laugh that much. Now, our crack-buddies, Harold and Kumar, have released their newest hit, "A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas". First of all, I was in a bored mood while watching, so I didn't have the power to laugh that much. But that didn't stop me from laughing my head off with this movie. This movie is set years after the second movie where Harold, played by John Cho, is now a married businessman who tries to win the respect of his Mexican Christmas-obsessed father-in-law, portrayed by Danny Trejo from 'Machete', while Kumar, played by Kal Penn, is still an irresponsible wreck awaiting for the next high. They both team up to help replace Harold's father-in-law's Christmas tree after the other got burnt up. These two guys share a friendly chemistry, and watching this on-screen duo makes me laugh so much. Yes, this movie is filled with jokes that are crude and offensive, and most of it involves weed, priests, nuns in the shower, a baby accidentally getting high, and an annoying but lovable Waffle-Bot toy. But apparently, all of that was funny, well except the joke about the baby getting high. But, Neil Patrick Harris stole the whole show in every scene he's in. Although he was only in one short piece of the whole movie, he totally delivers the laughter. Also, I didn't see the movie in 3D, but I can tell with all the craziness flying at your face, the 3D might have been awesome. I pretty much enjoyed this movie from beginning to end, but sometimes my laughing was weak, and it was really hard to laugh at the funny moments. So, characters that were likable, a plot that twists the laughing bone, fun laughs throughout, an awesome role from Neil Patrick Harris, and you got 'Machete' playing the "a-hole" father-in-law. This movie also had a good heart that talks about friendship, standing up for yourself, and doing what you love doing to make one happy. Also, the movie's 90-minute running time flew by so quickly, and all you get was a fun time. But in either way, this movie does entertain audiences that search for R-rated weed humor, only involving two guys named Harold and Kumar. They haven't changed a bit, I'm just saying. "A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas", in my review, "a fun and hilarious buddy picture, no weed required".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh there are so many many bad reviews to this movie. Yes, they are all correct. Its not well made and its highly offensive.But I think they have all totally missed the point. That is exactly the idea of this movie - totally improbably and crazy and crude. What do you expect when you go to see an action movie - action. Use the same parallels here too guys. If you don't like movies like this (American Pie, etc), then avoid this.Feedback - simple - It was fun and it was great to see Harold and Kumar in action again.The reviews say the 3D was good. I saw it in normal 2D. It was good even without 3D.Caution - Though this might look like a Christmas movie, its not appropriate for children. Not even a whole family viewing. It is for adults.Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has some funny moments....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>but once you get to the third film in a franchise the newness has worn off, so it just isn't as good. Plus, I didn't get to see it in 3D, and it probably would have been cooler.In this movie, Harold and Kumar aren't that close any more. However, they are brought together by a gift for Harold delivered to Kumar. Things happen and Harold's Christmas tree burns down and it is very important to have one for his wife's family. So, most of the movie is about them and their adventures as they look for a replacement tree. Drugs are involved as well as the Russian mob, and of course, Neil Patrick Harris makes an appearance and it was funny. Then they through Santa in and that part was a little too silly. The claymation part was funny with the kid and squirrel.FINAL VERDICT: Fans of the franchise should like this, it just isn't original any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Continuing the time-honored tradition of 'Harold &amp; Kumar'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The two most lovable stoners in movie history return in "A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas," which somehow continues the series' impressive balancing act of clever humor, crude jokes, stoner gags and heart.When you look at the franchise's three biggest stars ? John Cho, Kal Penn and Neil Patrick Harris ? it becomes clearer why the movies work. All three of them have gone on to be successful in all manner of films and television shows, a testament to their acting ability. If they had been written and portrayed as shallow, obnoxious stoners, this Christmas special would've been direct-to-DVD and recast with no-name actors.This third adventure takes place six years after "Escape from Guantanamo Bay," and our dear friends have stopped talking to each other because Harold has grown up and Kumar has not. Their paths collide once more, however, when a package for Harold arrives at Kumar's apartment. He courteously brings it to Harold's new house, where they reconnect and discover it's a giant joint, and they accidentally burn down Harold's father-in-law's (Danny Trejo) beloved Christmas tree.The search to replace the Christmas tree before midnight mass is on, and it takes the duo and their replacement best friends Todd (Thomas Lennon) and Adrian (Amir Blumenfeld) on less of a wild journey in terms of geography and general weirdness, but one with plenty of wacked-out sequences from claymation drug trips to NPH's recollection of his time in heaven to an R-rated riff on a classic "A Christmas Story" gag.With all the 3D pandering and psychedelic trips (every drug imaginable gets play time), "A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas" was meant to be experienced on the big screen (or a 3D LED set), but its meta jabs at the medium help ease the multitude of slow-motion shots that hurt the pacing of the movie when viewed in 2D.As a fan of the series who is not a fan of the marijuana (in the using sense), several scenes remind the sober viewers we're not high enough to watch this movie, but enough of the jokes are clever as opposed to simply balls-out. I've always found that the hallmark of the franchise is never that each installment is a laugh fest, but that it stays grounded while occasionally funnier than you'd guess it would be. This is of course thanks to Penn and Cho, whose chemistry continues to be the bread and butter of the series. That, and the reliably delightful appearance of Harris.In spite of the many examples the film puts forward that give us an opportunity to shrug it off as immature and stupid, it finds ways of being charming. How you can find yourself rooting for a waffle-making robot not included in the film for any logical reason is testament to what Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg have created.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<fullReview>Movie ReviewBam! Write out of the screen! Are those 3D nipples? Yes they are! This movie review is going to be on s very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas. This movie is not for the very serious non funny people of the world, it's for the pranksters and "that's what she said "kind of people out there. It starts off in their usual dope smoking slump, only one was in that this state, and it was Kumar.Harold finally got his stuff together, house, wife all of it, but now he has to get his father in laws approval of the family, Christmas time comes, he is setting out to prove he is worthy. This whole time , Kumar still hasn't got job , or a life , just drugs and a girl that he loves , but he can't seem to get it together. Then Kumar comes into the picture, and Harold takes 10 steps back in this process by burning Carlos family tree.Harold's problems keep mounting up, searching for a tree, and Kumar seeming to get in the way of every move. Running into some old friends on their way, aka Neil Patrick Harris, they keep plugging at trying to reach Carlos satisfaction of approval, and Kumar just getting his act together with a girl he loves. Having to go to a party was one of those how did this happen, kind of moments, but they got through that obstacle. Of course some drugs got mixed into the equation during their journey.Towards the end the two meet up with the man himself,Santa. Finally reaching the end, Harold straps on a pair, tells Carlos what he thinks of him, and what he thinks of his daughter, and it all works out, he is a member of the family. Kumar tells his love what he thinks of her, how he is going to change, how things will work out, and she approves and it works out, they all have a huge Christmas party all together, all happy, all coming to together at the best time of the year.This movie was one of the best Christmas movies I have seen yet. Finally I see a movie that really makes the inner part of me, what I really am, laugh. It's so funny; if you have a personality at all you would have to laugh at this movie. This movie being one of the 3 Harold and Kumar movies I think it is the best of the three, even though Guantanamo bay was pretty hilarious. I hope my movie review helps you better understand this movie, and make you want to watch it. Yes you too Jenson! It's pretty good, I give it a 9 out of 20.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Round Three and the Duo are Half-Baked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much has changed since Harold and Kumar escaped from Guantanamo Bay. Harold (John Cho) landed the role of Sulu in J. J. Abrams' acclaimed Star Trek reboot (a character he will revisit in 2013). Kumar (Kal Penn), having smoked weed with George W. Bush in Escape From Guantanamo Bay, became an Associate Director for the Obama administration. And Neil Patrick Harris, whilst furthering his womanising image as the philandering Barney Stinson in How I Met Your Mother, publicly came out and announced his engagement to David Burtka.Sadly, what has also changed for the modern-day Cheech and Chong, is the standard of jokes, scenarios and secondary characters.Gone are the punctuated, episodic scenes which defined the first two films and saw the duo jump from situations as memorable as racing a cheetah through the woods, attending a bottomless party, hitching a ride with the boil-covered Freakshow, and sharing a bed with a red-neck cyclops-baby. In their latest adventure, Roldy and Kumar get tied-up by Russian gangsters, hallucinate claymation-style, and inadvertently become dancers in a camp stage-show, but each new scenario seems more tired than the last, and lacks the originality of both predecessors.Gone are the comical-yet-convincing minor characters like the racist Homeland Security Agent (Rob Corddry), the infatuated Male Nurse (Ryan Reynolds), and the helpless Interpreter (Ed Helms). Questionably weaker ones replace these: Kumar's new-BFF, Adrian (Amir Blumenfeld), overstays his welcome, as does Harold's father-in-law (an unexpectedly pedestrian Danny Trejo), and wimpish friend (Thomas Lennon). Sadly, even returning characters, such as bickering Jewish-stoners Rosenberg and Goldstein don't bring the laughs like they once did.The movie picks up a few years after the duo escaped Guantanamo. A bearded Kumar ("Like Ryan Gosling in The Notebook") has been dumped by Vanessa, and Harold, now sober, has settled down with Maria. Having not seen each other in years, the two are reunited by a mysterious package, which sets in motion a grand scheme to find the perfect Christmas tree ("Koreans have killed his mother and now his tree. Christmas is ruined").While Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg return as writers, the relatively unknown Todd Strauss-Schulson directed this instalment of the current trilogy. The film doesn't look quite as appealing or inventive as previous entries, and the exploitive 3D hampers the whole affair and slows down the story.Neil Patrick Harris appears after a particularly dull period, instantly drawing laughs as the resurrected, crack-addled, and now publicly 'gay' NPH that everyone has come to know and love. If only he were in it for longer.A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas is generating a multitude of positive reviews and looks set to become their most successful outing to date. However, as a big fan I was surprised that 3D Christmas did not build upon its former, as Escape From Guantanamo Bay did with Get The Munchies. Aside from a few moments of genuine hilarity, this was not the sharp, laugh-a-minute writing that helped the first two transcend the hapless stoner-movie genre. Scenes are far too rambling and unfocused, losing all energy as a result.It might be time for the boys to shut their bong-holes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a lot better than I was expecting. It's dirty, raunchy, hilarious and will put you right in the Christmas mood. You don't need to re-watch the first two movies to understand this new one. They spoof the claymation genre as a tribute to the classic Christmas specials we grew up with. They give a dirty twist to that infamous scene from 'A Christmas Story'Harold and Kumar aren't hanging out anymore and have new best friends with new lives. When Kumar receives a package meant for Harold, he takes it to him, and that's when the chaos begins. Throughout Christmas Eve night, they must find the perfect Christmas tree, deal with the Russian Mafia, befriend a robotic waffle-maker, and ride with Santa Claus in his sleigh. If you love dirty raunchy movies and Christmas movies, this is the perfect blend for you. I highly recommend A VERY HAROLD &amp; KUMAR 3D Christmas!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless film for watching with your Buddy's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first watched Harold and Kumar go to white castle, i basically relived my crazy adventures with my friends. The second one basically said all i wanted to say about politics, and i quote George Bush was right, " you don't have to believe in your government, you just gotta believe in your country." He nailed it. I just got back from seeing The third and i gotta say, it was freaking amazing. Harold and Kumar as always told it how it is. For example, one scene Kumar sits on Santa's lap and a parent yells in protest, Kumar responds, " don't worry, your son will get his chance to rub his rump all over Santa's dick in a moment... Isn't that basically what u take ur kids there for, besides, do you even know and trust that santa guy? The movie took a different turn by making the friendship split up, with drew me in because I'm a fresh outa high school grad and i wonder if my life and relationship with my friends would change. But the movie gave off such a positive vibe about that subject that it relaxed me enough to realize i should just enjoy all the moments with my friends, and not worry about the future. Religion is mocked but again Thats something that happens all the time. I believe in god and all that but i just shrugged it as a laugh and moved on. The movie reminded me why i love the characters, and made me feel like the holidays were happening right now. Take it as just a movie, have a good time, talk about it with friends and you'l enjoy it. But if u go with a female, you should probably have them step out for the Neil Patrick Harris scenes LMFAO! Go and see this if you have seen the others, and in 3D while your on that good stuff, and trust me the money you pay will be worth it. Enjoy! :) (one more thing, Im a film student that appreciates films, so i know what I'm saying!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas (2011): Dir: Todd Strauss- Schulson / Cast: John Cho, Kal Penn, Neil Patrick Harris, Danny Trejo, Thomas Lennon: Christmas and pot smoking seem to be the holiday theme in this festive third outing featuring the Asian American Kumar and Chinese American Harold. The pair have gone separate ways with Harold now married and big on wall street, while Kumar is still his regular self living in an apartment and given the news that his girlfriend is pregnant. When an ominous package addressed to Harold lands outside his door, he delivers it only to end up burning the Christmas tree down that Harold's strict father- in-law brought. This simplistic setup is followed by numerous adventures to find a tree where they are hunted down by drug dealers, get a baby high on cocaine, and even accidentally shoot Santa himself. The humour is extra offensive this time out but features terrific 3-D elements including a sequence done in claymation. Director Todd Strauss-Schulson is backed with the same innovation that sold the first two films. Cho and Penn are still appealing as they find themselves again entrapped within strange subplots including one involving a waffle making robot. Neil Patrick Harris turns up in a great musical number although his vision of Heaven is offensive. The play on his sexuality is well placed. Danny Trejo as the grim father-in-law is given a background voicing his anguish. Thomas Lennon is very funny as an associate of Harold's whose baby gets stoned high. Colorful low blow holiday comedy about reconnection. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most memorable Christmas comedy of the past decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas was originally released four years ago, I was kind of disappointed with it. Being a huge fan of the first movie and having enjoyed the second one well enough, I had surprisingly high hopes for this one given that it was an R-rated Christmas comedy, something that is not particularly common. Upon first viewing, I was left with the feeling that the movie was just more of the same. Harold has to stand up for himself again. Harold and Kumar get chased again by guys who are after them. Harold and Kumar run into Neil Patrick Harris again. I laughed enough, but I didn't think the film was anywhere near as funny as the first two.Having now seen the movie a few more times since,I can't say that all the repetition bothers me anymore. Yes, the repetition some of the repetition is obvious and unnecessary, but not nearly to the degree of 90% of other sequels. Truly, the one real major story problem in the movie is that for a film with Harold &amp; Kumar in the title, the duo spends a bit too much time apart in the first act. The focus on Harold and Kumar's respective roommates is a little frustrating at times, especially considering how intentionally annoying the roommate characters are. When Harold and Kumar do finally reunite, the film really picks up speed, and remains quite consistently entertaining throughout with lots of memorable moments. Some of the highlights of the highlights include Jake Johnson as Jesus, the claymation freak-out sequence, and any scene with Wafflebot, maybe one of the dumbest yet funniest things ever captured on film. There's such a great energy to the proceedings that even when a scene isn't laugh-out-loud hilarious, it's always pleasant/enjoyable to watch.One of the more interesting aspects of each Harold and Kumar entry is how different the tones of each installment seem to be. Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, while featuring a scene in which the title characters ride a cheetah, was fairly realistic for most of its running time. Harold &amp; Kumar Escape Guantanmo Bay was pretty much a full-blown cartoon, and over-the-top to a fault. A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas has perhaps the most interesting tone of the trilogy. The film takes Harold and Kumar's friendship seriously with real heart, yet at the same time has fantastical elements, such the inclusion of Santa in the finale. Despite all the raunchy elements and occasional comic gore, the tone genuinely seems to capture the tone of an old holiday special, one that is definitely not for children. The tone of this movie alone makes it fairly unique as I can't think of any other comedy with a similar feeling to it.Obviously one of the main selling point was that it was originally presented in 3D. There are few comedies that are in 3D, and I must admit that the 3D was the best part of seeing the film in theaters. The filmmakers obviously had a blast making fun of the gimmick of 3D while exploiting its very nature. Some of this is quite funny. The Bobby Lee scene alone always makes me laugh more than it probably should. Occasionally though, the 3D technique comes off as distracting at times when watched in standard format. This doesn't destroy any scenes entirely, but it does stick out like a sore thumb on a handful of occasions. The overall film itself at least has a distinct visual style even without the 3D aspect, which also helps gives the stoner sequel more atmosphere than the lowbrow material probably deserves.I highly doubt there will ever been another Harold &amp; Kumar flick as John Cho and Kal Penn are both probably too old to play these characters, not that such a fact would stop me from wanting to see a fourth installment. Cho and Penn have made Harold &amp; Kumar the best comedic duo of the modern era As a final chapter for the characters, A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas is a satisfying conclusion, and is the most memorable Christmas comedy of the past decade. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel guilty giving this film such a high rating. After all, its heroes are two immature stoner guys, and the film has gratuitous nudity, drug use and violence. And the plot is very shallow -- it revolves around trying to find a new Christmas Tree for Harold (John Cho) because his estranged best friend Kumar (Kal Penn) accidentally destroyed it. That's it! But like Will Ferrell at his best, this subversive Christmas movie is wickedly funny, and not afraid of breaking taboos, such as depicting a baby getting (accidentally) stoned on marijuana and cocaine, and depicting Jesus holding court next to topless women at a bar in 'heaven'. Penn and Cho are simply great comic actors. They're the Odd Couple - - Kumar more shambolic and Harold uptight and trying to be upright. Much of he humour comes from Harold pointing out the absurdity of every situation they get into, and Kumar trying to bluff their way out. Also like a Will Ferrell movie, all the supporting actors are excellent. Neil Patrick Harris gives a hysterical turn as a 'straight' actor pretending to be gay to give himself more credibility. Harris is clearly enjoying himself immensely. As in previous Harold and Kumar movies, there are a lot of jokes about a wide range of races, but it's kept light-hearted and isn't mean. The only quibble I'd have is that too many women in the film are stereotypical semi-nude bimbos. They're not given enough scope to be witty or smart. But otherwise, along with Bad Santa, I hope this film becomes an annual staple on my TV!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone's favourite stoned morons return for a third round of mayhem in A Very Harold And Kumar Christmas. John Cho and Kal Penn just never seem to tire of these two lovable idiots, and as long as the hilarious dynamic of their friendship and increasingly funny antics stick around, neither will I. I actually found this one the most enjoyable of the three flicks, and tied with the second one for the funniest. It's insanely colourful, populated by weird and wonderful actors I wouldn't have thought to see in these movies. Harold, that lucky dog, is tying the knot with his sexy girlfriend Maria (Paula Garces) and couldn't be happier. There's just one problem: her vivacious Latin clan, led by blustering Mr. Perez (Danny Trejo, amusingly more at home in silly comedy than his usual brand of pulpy action) who doesn't like Harold one bit. When Kumar burns down the beloved Perez Christmas tree with a lit joint, he and Harold are propelled on a whacky adventure throughout New York City to find another one, and get into as much trouble as humanly possible. They get a three year old girl high on both weed and coke, get on the wrong side of ruthless Eastern European gangster Sergei Katsov (Elias Koteas has to be seen to be believed), encounter Santa himself (a scuzzy Richard Rhiele), star in their own drug fuelled stop motion version of their lives and barge into a magnificent Christmas special film set, starring you guessed, Neil Patrick Harris, who has a ball with his most disgusting antics of these movies thus far. A fun, dirty, wicked little Christmas romp as experienced by its perpetually ripped protagonists, who provide much of its deranged charm. Watch out for cameos including RZA, Patton Oswalt and an adorably perverted robot that serves waffles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The shift to family oriented movie makes the crazy comedies lost their sting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story goes back to the first movie's recipe of having a certain object as the final goal, in this case the Christmas tree. The story still develops as the previous movies did, quite unpredictable, with all those very crazy stuff of comedies. In a way, this doesn't bring anything new to the whole series. Also there seems to be a significant shift of orientation in this movie towards the more family movie genre. The movie shows a lot of family values. Even the final goal is about family acceptance. But I don't think this move paid off because it instead contradicts the crazy comedies the series has been known for. The acting overall is just as standard, and a little lower compared to the previous movies. Kal Penn and John Cho doesn't really develop the relationship between their characters further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Hail Neil Patrick Harris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has read more than a few of my reviews will have noted that I love Neil Patrick Harris. I enjoyed watching him "Doogie Houser MD" when I was younger, and then I enjoyed his work on TV Movies such as "Not Our Son", "Sudden Fury" and "Stranger In The Family" whilst I thought he was the stand out character in "How I Met Your Mother" and one of the main reasons for the shows success.And it was based on Neil Patrick Harris appearing in this movie as the reason I watched it. I'm not a fan of Kal Pen in general, and the Howard and Kumar movies have always been something I could live without seeing. However it was on TV today, so watched it. Whilst Danny Trejo adds a bit of quality to the proceedings, the first hour or so is tough work, but then Neil Patrick Harris turns up, sings and dances up a storm, and brings some serious laugh out loud moments, however once he exits the movie again feels poorer without his presence.Truthfully without knowing Neil Patrick Harris was in it, I never would have watched it, and knowing he would be turning up was all that kept me watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The guys have gone their separate ways years ago. Harold (John Cho) is a wall street suit married to Maria (Paula Garcs). Her father (Danny Trejo) insists on a real Christmas tree. Kumar (Kal Penn) is still a weed-smoking slacker. Vanessa (Danneel Ackles) drops by to inform him that she's pregnant with his child. Then Kumar receives a package addressed to Harold. It's a giant joint which Kumar lights but Harold refuses. The Christmas tree burns down and everybody goes on a quest to replace it before Harold's father in-law returns. Harold has his uptight friend Todd (Thomas Lennon) and Kumar has his loser friend Adrian (Amir Blumenfeld).The guys still have great chemistry. That's why I want them to reunite earlier. I get the constant joke early on of them joining people other than each other. At some point, I don't care about that joke and I rather have the reunion. The under-current of the movie is about babies and family. There is nothing funnier than a coked up baby. I laughed every time. Blumenfeld is a little too whiny and annoying. On the other hand, Lennon is hilarious. In the end, it's about Harold and Kumar, and they're great together. And of course, there is the one and only great NPH.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harold and Kumar need a new joke book. Pretty much all the material here... about drugs, sex, religion, race... has been done before, in both their two previous pictures and in other 'adult' comedies... only better. The couple of exceptions are a scene where one of the hapless duo gets his genitalia frozen to a metal pole... have to say THAT'S original (Shame it's more cringeworthy than humorous, though). And a sequence set entirely in claymation while they're completely off their heads, which is inventive, if not really hitting the funny bone dead centre.Oh, I almost forgot... there's some added 3D moments for those who are 'lucky' enough to watch it on that format (I didn't). But honestly... if you miss out on seeing a doobie flying towards you, who cares? Neil Patrick Harris returns for his traditional cameo... we find out he faked his own death, faked being a homosexual and he HATES pancakes. ZZZZ. Moving on. They knock Santa Claus out of the sky, find out both of their partners are pregnant and celebrate Xmas by having a puff outside. How touching.Not destined to go down as a seasonal classic, I fear. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These movies just keep getting better and better. It's not that the story is any less ridiculous or raunchy, it's that the actors have gain experience. When the series started, both John Cho and Kal Penn were virtual newcomers, but now they've been in some big films and TV shows. The pair are much better actors than they were in the first film and are better equipped to pull off the ridiculousness. In their third film, Harold and Kumar have actually been estranged for a while. When a mysterious package shows up for Harold at Kumar's apartment, the two are brought back together and are forced to work together to solve a problem. Everything you saw in the first two films and everything you've come to love about Harold &amp; Kumar are back, including THE Neil Patrick Harris. There aren't many surprises here, by now you basically know what you're going to get with these films. What is new, is the Director, Todd Strauss, who actually does add a few interesting things to the film. Harold and Kumar is a lot of laughs, in a ridiculous story, filled with drugs, tits, and alcohol. If you didn't like the first two films, you won't like this one any better, but for what it's worth, I dare you to watch it and tell me you didn't laugh out loud at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comic genius of utter crap?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christmas came early for me this year. I didn't know there was a third part to the franchise, so finding out about Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas made my of October. That said, I watched it on the fourth of the month, so? This particular installment of the Harold and Kumar series takes place over an entire day just before Christmas. After Harold and Kumar's last adventure, Escape from Guantanamo Bay, it seems the duo had become estranged. Since then Harold has grown-up, given up the stoner life, and become a respectable citizen. Then, out of nowhere the good ol' Kumar shows up and burns down Harold's Christmas tree with a massive joint. Harold desperately needs a new tree, but finding one is not as easy a task as it sounds. Their adventure begins.What ensues during the quest to find this tree is either comic genius or just utter crap. I propose it is solid mix. First, there is a toddler that gets high on at least three types of drugs. Then Harold and Kumar themselves get drugged, drugged into a random "claymation" sequence in fact where they are almost killed by an Abominable Snowman. Then, they almost get killed again, this time by some gangsters.Thanks to the veritable array of ethnicities in the film there are some hilarious race jokes that come across nicely, but the highlight of the film must be when Harold and Kumar have a run in with "America's Sweetheart" Neil Patrick Harris.

		<shortDescription>A new holiday classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holiday films are much like Christmas sweaters and holiday albums by has-been recording artists sold next to the cash register at the Hallmark store: best avoided. I made an exception for "A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas."The newest film in the series picks up several years since the boys escaped from Guantanamo Bay. Harold (John Cho) is all grown up as a big- shot Wall Street trader with a fellow Korean-American as his loyal assistant (Bobby Lee, reviving his bit part from the first Harold and Kumar film). He's finally married to Maria Perez, and they live in a beautiful suburban home. Kumar, however, is still the immature boy he has always been. The epiphany he had at the climax of "Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle" has worn off, and we learn he has failed med school. Or rather, he failed a drug test. The two haven't seen each other in two years, and have replaced each other with newer, lamer friends.The story starts with Kumar (Kal Penn, Assistant Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement) finding a mysterious package addressed to Harold on his doorstep. He drops it off at Harold's house. The estranged friends open the package and find a gigantic joint inside. Kumar naturally lights it up and accidentally sets the Christmas tree on fire. This is a problem, you see, because Maria's father is Danny Trejo (Machete), a frightening Mexicano with a scarred face and a Christmas tree sweatshirt. He is fanatical about Christmas trees and already has a very good reason to hate Koreans.The two set out on a journey to replace the tree before the Perez family returns from midnight mass. They have run-ins with a pair of black Christmas tree salesmen, Ukrainian mobsters, Santa Claus and Neil Patrick Harris (Starship Troopers)."A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Chrstimas" is a worthy continuation of the series. The production value has increased greatly since the first film, and it makes good use of the 3D, using the same cheesy gimmicks as early 3D films from the '50s. True to the holiday-film genre, there is even a (cocaine induced) claymation sequence.While better than "Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay," the third film in the series doesn't have the fresh feel of the first. For example, in the first film, when we saw Doogie Howser snort a line of coke off a stripper's buttocks, it was shocking and funny. It has simply become expected the third time around. The movie is still funny, but the jokes are no longer new, and the laughs don't come as quick as the first film."A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas" may not be the holiday classic that "A Christmas Story" is (although there is a shocking scene that pays homage to the 1983 comedy), it is worth seeing for anyone who enjoyed the first two films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third addition in the Harold and Kumar franchise is one not to be missed. The duo are back with their raunchy jokes and their love for pot. I dislike 3D greatly, but I admit 3D was used very well with this movie. I was very surprised with the clay-mation scenes because I did not see them coming and they were funny.The third film in the franchise takes place around Christmastime. Harold and Kumar have grown apart over time but their fates are drawn back together when Kumar receives a package that was meant for Harold. Harold is having Maria's family over for Christmas including her menacing father with a fetish for Christmas trees. Kumar comes over to deliver the package and accidentally destroys the tree. Now the duo must get another tree before Maria's father finds out.The acting is pretty good as we should expect. It's nice to see Kal Penn and John Cho back in these roles after a three-year absence. They may have outgrown these roles but they still deliver the laughs. I love Danny Trejo just for taking roles like these. He's one menacing dude! Of course, Neil Patrick Harris is the man. Enough said! Overall, thisis a very funny movie. While we still see the raunchy side of the duo, we now see that they have a heart. It's probably because it's a holiday film but still that's one of the reasons why this film works and doesn't grow stale. I loved the clay-mation and the 3D gimmicks. This may have been the only film I enjoyed in 3D. Maybe this and Avatar. This is almost a perfect end to the Harold and Kumar trilogy. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

Danny Trejo is brilliant in his role as well. And of course NPH back wherever God takes him is a riot as well as the biggest sleaze in the seven seas.The plot is pretty lazy but i guess thats the general idea. The writer is Jon Hurwitz not to be confused with Mitchell Hurwitz who created Arreseted Development and is a genius sadly unlike Jon so don't expect too much there. I predicted the final moments of the film which made me laugh and explains a lot about the logistics of Christmas eve.You can see from the addition of major action sequences that the budget has been upped dramatically.This being said there are some shameful product placements but they make them fun and the 3D effects bring it all home and you can almost smell the wacky tobaccy wafting towards you.All in all a fantastic off beat Christmas/stone film and it seems there is already plans for a 4th. Im excited. You should feel these nipples. I give it a 7.1 out of 10 for a decent 3rd film especially as I feel the 2nd was average at best.</fullReview>

I'm sorry to say, the world "hilarity" does not apply this time around, because most of the jokes just fall flat. Just because this is a Christmas movie, and not a road trip movie, doesn't mean it can't or for that matter, shouldn't be hilarious. And even another Neil Patrick Harris cameo can't save it. A couple highlights: A musical number with Harris, and the scene (reference to "A Christmas Story") where Harold gets his penis stuck to a pole. Other than those two scenes, there's really nothing to recommend it. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the 'stoner comedy' may have fallen out of favour, Harold and Kumar have managed to keep it alive. Four years after their last movie, they're back with the third film in the series.'A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas' retains the elements which made the series so funny: lots of smoking, getting high, self-referential moments, unbelievable shenanigans, a waffle-making robot and a hilarious cameo from Neil Patrick Harris! They also poke fun at the Christmas movie conventions, Kal Penn's time in the White House and the use of 3D, with objects flying at the screen.The plot isn't anything too original: Harold and Kumar have lost touch and Harold (John Cho) is under the thumb of his scary father-in-law (Danny Trejo) and takes responsibility for decorating their beloved tree. When Kumar goes to return a package for Harold delivered to their old flat, chaos ensues and it's a race to replace the tree before Harold's wife Maria and her family return from midnight mass. Arguably the film's highlight is the NPH cameo: now a superstar thanks to 'How I Met Your Mother', he skews his real-life personality in a heightened version of himself (his relationship with David Burtka is revealed to be a sham to cover his womanising) and has a lot of fun with the role. If you're a fan of the previous films, then you'll know what to expect and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the second film, but inferior to the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle deservedly became a cult classic in 2003, because besides its references to the "stoner" culture and the irreverent humor, there was a solid basis of sincere friendship which humanized the main characters, and avoided them to become simple caricatures making stupidities under the influence of marijuana (among other drugs). And on top of that, the chemistry between actors Kal Penn and John Cho was absolutely perfect. The sequel Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay was moderately entertaining but mediocre, because its disproportionate and surrealistic humor ended up sacrificing the dynamic between the main characters. So, I had low expectations before watching A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas, because its trailers suggested a repetition of the febrile and unbridled style of the second film, instead of the "character comedy" from the first one. Fortunately, that expectation ended up being only partially true, so I ended up enjoying this third movie more than Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, but less than Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle.The screenplay of A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas attempts to gradually increment the level of the main characters' adventures in order to bring some rhythm to the narrative, but when we lead to the cameo of Jesus Christ and Santa Claus' surgery, it's already too late to ask for any coherence or realism. However, co-screenwriters Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Scholssberg made the good decision of basing all those ridiculous things on the existing relationship between Harold and Kumar, something which brings a human touch to their vulgar adventures. Leaving the most absurd moments aside, A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas rounds on the re-discovery of an abandoned friendship, and in that aspect, Cho and Penn took their performances seriously. In other words, what I liked the most in this movie was the honest expression of loyalty and friendship between the main characters.The irreverent and politically incorrect humor is exactly what we can expect in a Harold and Kumar movie, so in order not to ruin the best moments of A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas, I will mention that I approximately laughed 20% of the times, I smiled a 50%, and the remaining 30% produced a slight irritation on me. Something which starts well but ends up tiring a little bit is the satire of the 3D format...even though some of those jokes would have worked better watching it in the cinema. Anyway, I can give a moderate recommendation to A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas because it managed to keep me entertained, even though I would have preferred less surrealism, less exaggeration and more humor based on the interaction between the main characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb Comedy gem... and one of my favourites of last year... Huh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put this is the best Harold and Kumar movie EVER! You will never look at Christmas the same way that Rare Exports will never have you look at Santa the same way again (even more so than the bong smoking Santa featured in the movie).This basically is the stupidest movie of last year... THANK GOODNESS (I'm an atheist - me saying Thank God is weird) this doesn't try to be any more than what it is (eg, Ted). An example of the stupidity is when Harold and Kumar imagine they're clay-mated and are being chased by a giant killer Snowman killing everything in it's path with a jolly Christmas song over the top... So if that isn't your sort of humour then please, do not watch this movie.The basic plot is that it has been 8 years since Guantanamo Bay, Harold and Kumar have stopped being friends for 2 of those years. Harold gets a package that was meant to be delivered to Harold. As Kumar gives Harold the package he opens it only to find out that it's a "joint". Harold throws it out only for it to go back in the house and burn down his Christmas-obsessed father-in-law's Christmas tree. After that just sit back, relax and let the insanity (like Ukranian gangsters, killer Waffle-bots, Giant killer snowmen and drug-addicted babies) do everything else for you.So please, don't expect anything more than what it is (my rating is based on what it is - If I believed that this is better than Stalker I'd probably kill myself) just watch it with no intellectual thought at all and you'll be fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disgustingly awesome in 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) are back with a unpolitical correctness vengeance! In events following the Guantanamo debacle Harold turns foul and becomes a wall street yuppie focused on family. Having cut off ties with Kumar he leads a life far detached from the beer pong glory days and now focuses on preparing the perfect Christmas for his wife's Mexican family (with Danny Trejo as the unforgiving father-in-law). Meanwhile Kumar is in disarray with his true love having left him for being an eternal child, only to show up again and pronounce that she is pregnant. Their worlds are about to collide and take a spliff-filled crazed twist when a mysterious parcel addressed to Harold shows up at Kumar's apartment...Gloriously vulgar and obscenely intelligent toilet humour are the traits of Harold and Kumar, the best comedic pairing in modern movies since Cheech and Marin. With a legacy that is bound to be legendary the duo break all the rules possible, offend Jews, blacks, Asians, Mexicans or gays by stereotyping, but somehow manage to come out with a crudely warm, heartfelt movie that conquers prejudice with the use of the absurd. The highlight of this Christmas special is the brief cameo of Neil Patrick Harris, miraculously recovered from being murdered by prostitutes in part 2, who channels laughter to the verge of tears while dancing, prancing, massaging and whipping up waffles. Another must see is a short claymation sequence with a killer snowman.A fine addition to the franchise, even if some of the jokes do go overboard and irritate more than they amuse. Nonetheless most of these are without out two main protagonists, who are relentless in amusing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started watching this movie expecting a lot of laughter. Overall it didn't disappoint but there were a few instances where there was no logic. The first half of the movie was entertaining and time passes just like that. Harold wants to make the Christmas memorable for his father-in-law but as Kumar comes to Harold's home to give him a present sent in Harold's name the Christmas tree accidentally gets on fire and the entire movie revolves around that plot. But after sometime i had to strain myself to sit all the way till the movie gets over. There were no twists and turns. For a religious person certain scenes may be irksome but after all it is a comedy movie and we shall take it for granted. Overall the movie will not disappoint provided you don't keep your expectations high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone who knows me knows I'm not a big fan of comedies. But when it hits it hits big with me. The first installment in this semi tired franchise was a movie that hit. They followed it up with a mostly unfunny sequel and now here comes the latest installment with a holiday twist. This time around the title characters are reunited after not being friends for a few years because Harold has decided to grow up. He is now married to Maria and they are trying to have a baby and Kumar is of course still stoned out of his mind and has pretty much nothing going on. After a freak accident that leaves a treasured Christmas tree from Harold's in laws destroyed. Their adventure begins trying to find a tree that matches and have it home in time for Christmas. Inspired hijinks ensue from a drug addicted baby, a claymation sequence, Neil Patrick Harris and a awesome little creation called "wafflebot" to less successful Christmas goop like a criminals daughter trying to loose her virginity, santa claus being shot and a crude ode to Christmas story. But all in all it's a successful enough installment to merit a recommendation. The film also sports a kinder approach than the other films with messages about friendship, family and growing up. Far from being perfect the film fares much better than its lame predecessor but not as good as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything that made the first two films unexpectedly good - now pointing at you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold and Kumar are two young Americans who swear, fornicate and like pot. (Geez I could have made that even briefer by just saying 'Harold and Kumar are two young Americans'.) Now we find revisit them six years after their last escapades. Harold is now a successful and Maria are married and trying for a child ? nice one Harold. Kumar has broken up with and is still slobby, lazy and decidedly non-driven. The once inseparable pair have gradually grown apart.Perhaps in an attempt to fill the respective voids that they each feel after the loss of the other, both have new 'best buds'. Harold the over keen and totally dorky Todd (Tom Lennon), Kumar some new stoner dude.The plot isn't the point of this threequel. But if you MUST know Harold and Kumar reluctantly team up with new buds in tow to find a replacement Christmas tree so that Harold can please his Father in Law (Danny Trejo) who is spending his first Christmas with them.Along the way expect drug use, beer pong, Ukrainian gangsters and tripping babies.The point of the film is that it is in 3D, so at various times we can witness the following items fly past, over or toward us: smoke (natch), eggs, joints, baby Jesus and? wait for it, semen.( Yep, bring your folks to this one.) Patton Oswalt plays a mall Santa in an unfortunately all too short cameo, Neil Patrick Harris is once again back to play an alternate NPH, and as always chaos reigns.A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas is everything you expect ? i.e. nothing you could rightfully expect ? and nothing you don't ? i.e. good taste, low key, well crafted jokes ? but it's all too stupidly funny to bother hatin' on it.Suffice to say if you liked Harold and Kumar in 2D, you'll like them just as much in 3D.Final Rating ? 6 / 10. I saw this last night and now only one sleep later can hardly remember it, in saying that I would be just as happy to watch it again tomorrow. (But I'm not shilling another twenty on it fellas.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A VERY HAROLD AND KUMAR Christmas the green light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stoner roommates Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) have moved on since THE ESCAPE FROM GUANTANAMO BAY. Harry aka Harold is now a successful investment banker and married while Kumar has been rejected from medical college after failing a drug test. Kumar who still lives in the old apartment is basking on the high road of life whilst a few hours' drive away Harry is welcoming his extended Mexican family into his home for Christmas. Harry's father in law brings along with him a bus load of relatives along with THE perfect Christmas tree that he has grown himself for many years. On the other end of the line Kumar receives a parcel that is addressed to Harry and takes the task on him to deliver it personally to Harry. Kumar who has not forgotten the good times they shared walks up-to Harry's front door and before we know the duo sets the prize Christmas tree ablaze! Now we can't celebrate Christmas without a tree can we? What's worse is how do we celebrate Christmas once you burn your father in laws Christmas tree? Harry is in a bit of a Yuletide pickle and Kumar steps up an offer a puff!There is a lot of crossfire on A VERY HAROLD AND KUMAR 3D Christmas, fans of the trilogy love it and the others don't. However there is certainly some extra attention the motion picture attracts about the not so subtly written herb-fest and certain portrayals of Jesus Christ etc. Allow me to simplify it more. Director Todd Strauss-Schulson is very fortunate that the movie is based on what it based and it's made in the United States and not in the middle of the earth! I am a fan and I enjoy the Schulsons' version over the prison break sequel. In fact it certainly steps up from the sequel HAROLD AND KUMAR ESCAPE FROM GUANTANAMO BAY and hands out trashier comedy with an impeccable focus on trashing the 3D technology that lazy directors use just to sell certain motion pictures. With flying ping pong balls, cocaine and medicinal herbs thrown in your face Schulson goes all guns loaded with destroying 3D and reducing it to its deserved state. 3D is merely a tool used in a movie and it's isn't the other way around. Even Zeus would agree! In retrospect with movies such as HALF BAKED and PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, this HK picture actually takes a step back in the entire business of rolling and puffing, instead it skips on to the events that occur surpassing the ignition state. However there is a substantial amount of cocaine thrown in your face during odd intervals and even prescription medication induced by juveniles. It may come across as a lame attempt and a cheap hit to work up a laugh on certain layers whilst surprisingly it may work if indeed one is in a higher state of consciousness. Palpable as it is and has been over the years HK wasn't and will never be for the intellectual viewer nor critic who whose hunger for exploring hidden subtexts within a plot written about illegal drug abuse. There isn't a message passed along the grapevine, there aren't any hidden morale to this stoner flick comedy. Instead HK is all about riding the EAC just like mister turtle did in FINDING NEMO. If one is looking forward to this weekend to kick back and just toss your shoes off your feet so it lands in different directions in your living room, grab a bowl of popcorn and rest your legs on the coffee table in front of you or even on your over weight Labrador and just have a good laugh I do give confidently give A VERY HAROLD AND KUMAR Christmas the green light!Title: A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas Directed by: Strauss - Schulson Starring: Kal Penn, John Cho, Thomas Lennon, Amir Blumenfeld and Neil Patrick Harris Rated: R Rating: 06/10 90 minutes</fullReview>

Both of the lead characters are likable as they were in the preceding two films. Neil Patrick Harris makes his usual comedic cameo in this one as well and delivers. A good supporting cast and I really enjoyed Danny Trejo as Harold's father in law good laughs and good fun.I enjoyed this one a lot more than the sequel but that's just my opinion I will definitely enjoy this one again during the holidays.As stated earlier a good amount of laughs in this one only complaint was that it could of been a little longer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watch this if...previous Harold &amp; Kumar films were appealing, but don't expect a Holiday Classic. Provides tons of laugh out loud moments, but isn't a movie I will watch every Christmas.Acting/Casting: 6.5* - Pretty much standard for Harold &amp; Kumar. Penn and Cho are very good as usual and the supporting cast is solid as well. I love Elias Koteas as the mobster and Trejo is great as Maria's father.Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 7* - As the previous installments, the movie flows well and is goofy and well put together. Again, I would to have liked to see a larger Christmas theme, but it is still very well done. I didn't see it in 3D, but there well some scenes that I would venture to guess were very cool.Plot/Characters: 5* - Harold and Kumar are no longer friends and extraordinary circumstances (finding a particular Christmas Tree) during Christmas happens to bring them together again. I thought the plot was good, but I think it could have been better. The characters are there to make this a must watch every Christmas, but I didn't think the plot went that route.Entertainment Value: 7.5* - I will admit to being entertained and I found myself laughing out loud many times throughout the movie. There is a ton of comedy and the movie does keep you engaged. I would recommend to others if they ask me about the movie.My Score: 6.5+7+5+7.5 = 26/4 = 6.5Email your thoughts to filmwatchinfool@gmail.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Six years have elapsed since Guantanemo Bay, leaving Harold and Kumar estranged from one another with very different families, friends and lives.But when Kumar arrives on Harold's doorstep during the holiday season with a mysterious package in hand, he inadvertently burns down Harold's father-in-law's beloved Christmas tree.To fix the problem, Harold and Kumar embark on a mission through New York City to find the perfect Christmas tree, once again stumbling into trouble at every single turn....Coming from the Uk, The franchise isn't really as big as it is over in the States, but that doesn't mean hat it's not funny.The second one missed the point of comedy, and it was too self aware of its own stupidness, hence it not being that funny.This one knows that it's going all out, but keeps the stupidity down to a minimum (clay-mation aside), and the film is pretty intelligent when throwing the 3D in your face in every extreme possible.Funnily enough, just when you are thinking 'where are they going with this?' the story kicks in, and the film moves up a notch or two.The narrative is great, and although the film does veer toward beyond stupid, it keeps it just on the right side and makes it all the more funnier. The sub-plots are very involving and the two leads are as funny as always.Don't take it seriously, and enjoy the best Christmas film of the year</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3D ruined it from being better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've seen the first two Harold &amp; Kumar movies, you know that the humour comes from just how outrageously over the top they are. The same rules apply to this one, but it just doesn't work as well as the first two. Don't get me wrong, there are still some very moments in it but ultimately it falls into the shadow of the original two. I think the thing that ruined this slightly was the extremely stupid use of 3D. I like 3D, but when it's done right. Just making things fly straight at the camera ruins the moment for me and I think that was why I didn't enjoy this one as much. When they weren't doing the obvious 3D, I had a very enjoyable experience, but 3D did not work for me. Saying that, what did work for me, and work well, was the Harold &amp; Kumar humour that I expected. Seeing a toddler high off a good mix of marijuana, coke and ecstasy wasn't something for everyone, but it works in this film. NPH as a twisted parody of himself was excellent, definitely the best scenes in the movie are when he's involved. Nice to see the cast from the old films back again. Overall, if you're a fan you'll still enjoy it, if you didn't like the first two you won't like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'A VERY HAROLD &amp; KUMAR 3D Christmas': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The third of Harold &amp; Kumar's stoner buddy adventures is a Christmas tale, which was released in 3D in theaters and it's all too obvious while watching it on video in 2D as well. John Cho and Kal Penn return to their most infamous roles and Neil Patrick Harris returns for yet a third cameo as well (even though he died in the last film). Series creators Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg return for writing duties for the third time also and Todd Strauss-Schulson makes his feature film directing debut at the helm. The movie is the weakest of the three but still has enough good moments to please most die-hard fans (I think). It's been three years since we last saw Harold and Kumar escape from Guantanamo Bay but it's been six years in movie time. Harold is now a happily married successful Wall Street businessman and Kumar still lives in the same apartment he and Harold lived in and still spends most of his time getting baked, especially since his girlfriend Vanessa (once again played by Danneel Harris) dumped him. After getting a visit from his ex-girlfriend, who tells him she's now pregnant, Kumar decides to pay his old roommate a visit. Harold has been trying to have a kid of his own and has his in-laws over for the holidays. His father-in-law (played by Danny Trejo) has expressed how important the Christmas tree is to his family and their culture at Christmas time and it's Harold's job to decorate it while his wife (Paula Garces) and her family are away at midnight mass. He wants nothing to do with his ex-best friend anymore but when Kumar shows up and accidentally burns down the tree they of course end up in another crazy adventure together. The movie is once again very hit and miss but this time a little more miss. It's still pretty random and unpredictable at times but this time around there's a lot more sappy mentality to it as well and a little more cheesy male bonding (maybe just a little too much). It has a few surprisingly crude over the top moments but it also has some really insensitive blatantly prejudice moments, like protesters reduced to stereotypes, and once again the two hero stoners of the film act nothing like real stoners. This is routine of stoner comedies of course but as the world becomes more and more aware of what marijuana really does to people, and more importantly what it does not do, a movie full of inaccurate prejudice stereotypes like this seems a little too dated and unnecessary. It's always been the point of the stoner comedy to show viewers what they think a stoner looks like rather then what one really does but maybe it's time to change that!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SILVr6aykQ</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D ChristmasIt makes perfect sense that people would want to get high on marijuana during the holiday season: Christmas is pure munchie heaven.Unfortunately, the stoners in this comedy are too wrapped up in their search for a Christmas tree to enjoy a stuffing sandwich on gingerbread. After receiving a package addressed to his estrange chum Harold (John Cho), Kumar (Kal Penn) heads to the suburbs to return it.However, the gift leads to the destruction of Harold's father-in-law's homegrown tree. Now, the duo must put aside their differences in order to find a replacement and save Harold from his in-law's wrath. Along the way, the pair converge with old acquaintances (Neil Patrick Harris, Eddie Kaye Thomas, David Krumholtz). The third instalment of the green-budded buddy-comedy, Harold &amp; Kumar still have plenty of potshots in their bong to deliver the giggles.Besides, the red-eyes that accompany smoking weed are very festive.

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best 3D stoner Christmas movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2004, we were introduced to Harold and Kumar, 2 stoner buddies who end up getting in tons of outrageous shenanigans trying to get to White Castle. In 2008, we watched as they escaped Guantanamo Bay and try to clear their names, obviously getting in more shenanigans. Now we have them trying to save the Christmas spirit, and you guessed it, the shenanigans ensue. "A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas" may not have a deep story, but the simplicity of it all makes it so much fun to watch. I don't know about you, but I think a movie where 2 beloved stoners try to find a Christmas tree for a certain angry Mexican step-father, played by Danny Trejo, makes for quite an entertaining and engaging movie. But we don't see a movie like this for the story, we go to see the gags, jokes, and what not. For the most part, the film-makers know how to make you laugh or put a smile on your face.I laughed quite a bit during certain jokes, whether they were references to other films or a racist joke, and don't worry, this movie has a lot of those, but the way they were executed was pulled off quite nicely. Even though some of the humor comes off as a bit forced, I found the majority of the film to be clever, witty, amusing, and very funny.Do I need to bother talking about Kal Penn and John Cho (Harold and Kumar)? Let's face it, these guys steal the show in every single H&amp;K film, and that's exactly what they manage to do again here. Kumar is the typical stoner while Harold has grown up, but once the story kicks in, we're back to the good old times. Since we've grown up with these characters, the situations they get into are always interesting, and a bit random at times. Neil Patrick Harris is back and delivers yet another great comic performance, but it's the 2 stoner buddies that steal the screen presence from anyone else.As for the 3D, I was surprised by how good it was. The film obviously is self-aware of the whole "3D jumping the shark" idea, but it takes that idea and uses it in ways you can't possibly imagine. Seriously, you will never guess some of the things that will pop out at you, and I liked that, because the whole film is basically a carnival ride of fun and surprises that you don't see coming. Overall: "A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas" manages to deliver everything we expect from a movie titled as such, and even manages to pass by with impressive 3D, which I didn't think a raunchy comedy could pull off so well. Some of the jokes aren't very funny, but the ones that do work are a joy to watch, no matter how offensive or disgusting they are.Harold and Kumar are as likable as ever, and as simple as the story may be, it's actually quite an engaging one.If your a fan of the franchise or you like your Christmas movies with raunchy humor and weed galore, then your sure to like this one.</fullReview>

I guess this movie has got this much hike because of its 3D effects.. But for those who watch it without 3D its just another Harold and Kumar's raunchy comedies. (But, again with less comedy) This movie's story line is again unlikely and at times totally ridiculous, it's a total cut up comedy. You get the sense that the actors were having fun while they were filming. I laughed (and moaned) throughout the entire movie which I think is kind of the benchmark for this genre. Even said that I wish this movie lived up to the previous parts...All in all the movie was pretty kool, and I did have a good time...watch out for that egg throwing scene...;)STORYLINESix years have elapsed since Guantanemo Bay, leaving Harold and Kumar estranged from one another with very different families, friends and lives.

		<shortDescription>Daft but funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold and Kumar are characters who have been in previous movies: I have caught bits on TV but have never seen one all the way through. However, I know that they are stoner buddies who get into mishaps. I'm not sure that I needed to know any more, because I think I picked up what was necessary as this movie progressed.This one starts on Christmas Eve. Harold (John Cho) has put his stoner past behind him and, married to Maria, has adopted a very conventional lifestyle with a view to trying to ingratiate himself with her father (Danny Trejo, trading on his bad-ass screen persona). Specifically, he is put Kumar (Kal Penn) behind him, because Kumar is still deep in weed, which fact is responsible for the various mishaps they went through in the earlier films. When a package arrives at Kumar's apartment for Harold, and Kumar takes it to him, the immediate result is the burning down of the Christmas tree brought by Maria's father, followed by a panic stricken search for a replacement which, itself results in a number of prejudicial predicaments.I don't want to say more because, notwithstanding how idiotic this film is, some of the more unlikely idiocies are pretty funny. I'm not normally a big fan of movies which promote the stoner philosophy, but this one does make it equally clear that it results in bizarre and often negative things happening.I really enjoyed this daft movie. It was very funny, it had some worthwhile things to say, and it did fun things, very knowingly, with 3D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6.5/10There is no point in over-analyzing a movie like this, because it is what it is. A likable bromance movie that delivers ongoing laughs.The original cast returns to bring us a movie that lets us relax, enjoy our buddies, and help us forget about our daily life. The 3D aspect was not as bad as people say. It was extremely redundant, but yet so is the plot. Although it was entirely unnecessary to be shot in 3D, I ended up really enjoying it. The plot is very similar to the first, in regards to the fact that they spend the entire movie searching for something, and this is where the fun begins... NPH returns and is at his enigmatic best. The scene with his real life partner and crack cocaine is priceless. He also hints at a fourth H &amp; K, which I would welcomely receive.The movie was the most enjoyable Christmas movie I've seen during this holiday season (except of course Elf), and I'll definitely whip this out next year.SO to finish... if you're a fan of the series, than the Christmas special definitely does it justice. It follows the exact same formula but was not tiresome (cough cough Hangover II). Although many of the jokes are crude, and the scenes which bring a child towards drugs definitely push the barriers, the movie itself is extremely likable.:- See with a bunch of mates when you feeling like doing absolutely nothing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glad I did not watch that in the cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first watched that movie about 3 months ago i thought it was okay, originally i was not going to right a review. But recently just finished watching H&amp;K 1 and 2 (because its been ages since i watched them and i don't remember a thing), and decided i have to write this review. Obviously i am very disappointed in that movie primarily because i WAS expecting a Harold &amp; Kumar movie. first of all i noticed the director of this movie Todd Strauss(someone i haven't ever heard of before)who only made shorts before this movie (#WTF), why didn't they stick with the director of the previous one? Escape from Guantanamo was a great movie sequel so naturally i was expecting the same with this one, well , i was wrong. now while watching this movie i thought of a lot of things wrong with it, while it looks like a H&amp;K movie it doesn't feel or taste like one, and heres why, the previous movies were completely unrealistic but in a way that doesn't ruin the plot like kumar with the bag of weed and the cyclops in the basement and thats just what i remember, this one is a completely realistic movie so u may call it H&amp;K3 but it could be any other movie with two different actors as far as i am concerned. the prequel followed a distinctive basic story line from the first movie and put a twist on it. (EX: they both stumble upon strange people and stay as guests etc..) and these fundamental events was for me a H&amp;K signature. I did enjoy the movie but only when i think of it as a standalone. so my rating is bad as they did call they movie H&amp;K. this movie ruins the H&amp;K series and it will probably be the last. In addition the story itself is flawed and i hate it. Kumar and Vanessa broke up REALLY?! after all what happened in H&amp;K EFGB. i find it hard to believe that the writer and producer actually watched the movie before making this one. I am sure that anyone who watched the first 2 would recognize even more flaws and differences. If you want to enjoy this movie don't watch the previous two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>feels more like a spin off or Christmas special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To give the movie credit, it's still a good 3rd movie and fans of the first two films will enjoy this one as all your favorite characters return. Though in a way if feels rather disjointed from the first two films as it takes place years after the second one and we find out that Harold and Maria got married and moved away while Kumar is living alone and still trapped in his old life. But classic "Harold &amp; Kumar" circumstances bring the two back together on Christmas Eve as they race against time to save the holiday from disaster.I give the movie credit that it's still a very funny film. One thing that surprised me though is the lack of race and marijuana jokes that the first two films devoted their humor to. Most of the humor in this movie comes from either the 3D effects or having way over-the-top stuff occur. The baby getting high on drugs just seemed weirder than Santa Claus existing. The first two films kept the REALLY wacky stuff in dream sequences and tried to ground itself in reality as much as possible. This film just goes ALL over the place with different characters which is why it feels more like a spin off than an official 3rd movie to me.Again to this film's credit, it's still a good funny movie for fans of the franchise and a great film for Christmas in general. Even people who have never heard of "Harold &amp; Kumar" will get a kick out of this movie. The humor and heart in the story is there and it's rare for a 3rd movie in a comedy franchise to stay this consistently funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even close to G-Bay..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>H&amp;K Escape from G-Bay is my favorite movie of all-time, right behind Not Another Teen Movie. I waited for this movie for a long time, often hearing rumors of a third movie. Finally, I got a chance to see it and man was I disappointed.It was terrible, the 3-D effects really ruined this movie. It's almost as though they spent more time making the 3-D effects than the actually writing. I even thought the background music was terrible. As good as the first two were (I thought the 2nd was the best) I expected a lot more, thus the reason I have given it 2 stars. If I had never seen a H&amp;K film, this would be around a 5 or 6, but on the scale of the other two films, 2 stars at most.By the way, this is my first review on this site.. I wouldn't normally write a review for a given movie, but because of my emotional attachment to the G-Bay, I had to give warning to other H&amp;K fans. It SUCKS!</fullReview>

The film left me feeling bored and made me feel like i had wasted my money and should have just waited for it to appear on the telly at least then i could have switched it over. I love to watch previous Harold &amp; Kumar movies because this part is crap :( If you like the first and second one , stay away. If you didn't stay away. If you liked the first film this one will do nothing but upset you Hope next part will be better. Don't waste your money on this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything makes no sense in the movie.

		<fullReview>Looks like stupid Christmas Movie, but shows how bros can overcome estranged obstacles.... with Cannabis! (*+other lucid substances) Plot revolves around a prideful home grown tree that goes up in ablaze and out a window. Thus epoching onto a wild trip and how they got there. With a cast including Rza, Amir Blumenfeld (College Humor), Patton Patton Oswalt, Danny Trejo, a adored Christmas roving robot, Thomas Lennon (Reno 911)and that little baby girl... Sh*t got messed up!The Movie also manages to speak on real life affairs of Kal Penn working at the white house, Neil Patrick Harris's same-sex relationship, and John Cho's angry mob on wall street.3D was especially effective when smoking and other gags but good without it.Adding on to the iconic Christmas tale genre, "A Very Harold &amp; Kumar Christmas" is definitely a stoner cult classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Christmas Wish? No More 3D!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is coming from someone who never seen the first two Harold and Kumar, and didn't even know who they were until they said their names on screen. A lot of my friends bash me for not seeing a Harold and Kumar movie, but I went into this because I had friends who helped make the movie (they had a miserable experience, mind you) and it looked pretty funny. Sure enough, it was!It didn't start out well for me, as the film was basically establishing the characters and to try to wow me with the 3D. The 3D in this film tries very hard to jump out at you, especially when Kumar is smoking weed, but sometimes I just feel it wasn't necessary. The film was good enough without it, as 3D is nothing more than a gimmick. Although I applaud the filmmakers by making the 3D worthwhile (although at times they look like cardboard cutouts), the film could hold its own without it.The film pits Harold and Kumar at odds with each other as they lead separate lives. However, one day Kumar delivers a package to Harold, but slips and falls and the two meet up again. However, the package is a huge joint and Kumar smokes it and accidentally sets the Christmas tree on fire which would anger Harold's step dad (played by Danny Trejo, who once I saw his first appearance in this movie, it all went uphill from there). So they end up on Christmas Eve night searching for a new tree and all the misadventures that happen to them. Things like Russian mobsters, babies getting high, and end up at a Christmas show hosted by Doogie Houser (who is really funny in this movie) all pretty much adds up to hilarious hi jinks. The movie was pretty stupid, and I may have lost a few IQ points watching it, but I did have a good time. I still think it was odd for it to come so early in November. I guess a A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Thanksgiving didn't sound quite as effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Are we having a conversation or are you watching A Christmas Story?" 6 years after Guantanemo Harold (Cho) and Kumar (Penn) are no longer the friends they used to be. On Christmas Eve Harold's in-laws stop by with their prized tree. When Kumar decides to surprise Harold with a present things go wrong fast. They duo now only have a few hours to find a new tree and get back home before the rest of the family. I have to admit that I thought the first one was funny and didn't like the second one that much. I didn't have high (get it?) expectations for this one going in. There are some movies like "Inception" that make you think. Movies like "Margin Call" cause a debate and make you feel strongly one way or the other. Then there are movies that you just watch, laugh and stay entertained all the way through. This is that type of movie. Nothing amazing or original but this is a funny movie that you can just watch and relax when you do. Overall, better then the second...and yes NPH is the best part of this one too. I give it a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After its huge success in its first outing, Harold and Kumar didn't work well to continue their brilliance. Their second part was a dud and so is this one. The script is decent but what the stupidity they show with them high on weed is waste. I know that's the whole point of the movie but it MUST be funny. The fun was missing out of the stupidity and hence what we found awesome in the first part was obviously not there.Both the actors do a good job and the 3D bit was quite amazing, I must say and you will crack up in some of the scenes.

		<shortDescription>A very lacking, but energetic 3D Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** out of (****)Having not watched Harold and Kumar's predecessing stoner extravaganzas, I went into this one completely blind. Not knowing their motive or intention, it was blatant from the opening shot of the trailer of what it was. With the generally favorable critical reception, as well as feedback from fans, this film just didn't stack up. I feel the film spent too much time going over-the-top and pushing the envelope, that it couldn't have just sat back and let the chips fall. This is an especially difficult title to review because I want to recommend the film because it has its moments, but I feel as if its energy could've worked its way into the script. Harold and Kumar are pretty much up to their old tricks yet again. Except, Harold is now married and has strayed away from his substance use yet Kumar has a more immature perspective by resorting to his weed. Inevitably, they're involved in their stoner pratfalls.Now with such a commercial and carefree title, this is an obvious one you don't watch with half a brain. It packs in the most politically incorrect jokes its little heart desires while saying "F.U." to every prudish, overly-sensitive audience member. Do I fall into that category? No. I actually smirked here and there. Some of their crude and stereotypical gags were pretty clever. But the humor here is just not original. The humor just outstays its welcome, which is the most major strike a film can have against its self. The acting? Harold and Kumar are likable in their roles. Their bromance is perfectly panned out. The direction? In all honesty, this department brought the film down a notch for me. The director, to me, pushed boundaries but didn't go the route I expected it to go in- moreso wanted to go. After hearing all these snobby critiques, you're probably sitting dumbfounded wondering, where's the 3D review? You'd pretty much be an imbecile at this moment to be ignorant to the fact that if the 3D is right for you or not. Its all just a huge gimmick- but that's pretty much the point here. The 3D, for what it does, gives the film some brownie points. You haven't heard of too many 3D stoner movies. Christmas themed ones at that. But, the question I'm sure most are asking. How was the gratuitous T+A? You'll get your fix of boobs, vajayjay, penises, butts, etc. Come to think of, some of the obligatory actually coincides with some of the events the characters undergo.All in all, Harold and Kumar packs a sufficient enough resolution, some smirky moments here and there, and will provide your dose of T+A, but what was once boundary-pushing and fun, feels kind of stale now. The 3D is a brownie-pointer winner, and yes folks, it does score points, but, think of it this way: You order the FATTIEST, GREASIEST burger from a fast-food eatery joint and to make the taste even more processed, you throw in a milkshake in for good measure. This is a very lacking, but energetic 3D Christmas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A funny, highly irreverent and politically incorrect movie with a Christmas theme to boot! Nice! I haven't enjoyed a Christmas themed movie like this since "Bad Santa" and that is a freaking classic! What does racial humour, nudity, sexuality, fat blunts, flying cocaine, a doped-up baby, a bong hitting Santa, Kumar, Harold, Occupy Wall Street, graphic violence, Catholic priests chasing an altar boy, a family of Mexicans, a faux versus a real Christmas tree and a pretend-gay Neil Patrick Harris, or NPH as he is now known, have to do with actual Christmas? Well everything and nothing! If you want to piece together this messed-up-higher-then-hell puzzle, then watching "A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas" is the key to it all! I'm not saying this is a perfect comedy or anything, it does have its shortcomings and not-so-funny moments, but all in all a good time is to be had! Be forewarned, lest you have a very thick (fore)skin and can take a joke, this movie is not for the faint of heart or easily offended, because that is the aim and intent of the movie. If you are somekind of Cromwellian puritan zealot more attuned for life in the 1600's, then I'll counsel you to stay at home and watch "Paul Blart: Mallcop" or "Seinfeld" episodes on an endless re-run loop, because this movie is NOT for you.On the up and up, I found the movie to be fair, in that it tries hard to equally offend as many people as possible! "Queen Laquiffa" indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 3D is a gimmick, but the extreme &amp; foul humor usually works and astounds the audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1999, American Pie had its main character violate a warm apple pie. In 2003, Billy Bob Thornton portrayed the most offensive, self-destructive, and felonious Santa anyone has ever imagined. Now, attempting to grab the mantle of the most provoking and/or distasteful movie ever is A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas. There are topless angels hanging out with Jesus, naked, lesbian nuns lathering each other in the shower, and a baby who imbibes so many illegal substances it will probably will not sober up for the next decade.The 3D in the title is a gimmick. It is not subtle and it is not there to emphasize action sequences or dazzle the audience with its spatial abilities. It is there to assault the audience. One character, while obviously hawking a brand name mentioned 3D television set and all of its revolutionary gee-whiz characteristics, points at the audience to remind them early on that "You are watching this in 3D!" Harold (John Cho) wonders aloud if the whole 3D shtick is already pass. The movie responds to that quickly with a scene designed to astonish the audience and make them feel better about the extra dough they just spent to rent their 3D glasses. Eggs are thrown in slow motion, someone pees on a windshield, a more solid form of fecal matter is splashed across the side of a vehicle, and to achieve the bodily fluid trifecta, a 3D ejaculation sequence finds its way towards the audience. Plot is secondary to the 3D onslaught. Once again, Harold and Kumar (Kal Penn) find themselves on a specific mission; this time it is to replace a Christmas tree to appease an angry father-in-law (Danny Trejo). The vast majority of the film keeps that particular plot line in the background so it may focus on more immediate sub-plots and situations to incorporate more 3D wizardry. There are Russian gangsters, Santa Claus himself, and yes, Neil Patrick Harris as Neil Patrick Harris. Even though there is a constant barrage of every substance imaginable being hurled at the audience in the third dimension, it is usually effective. Kumar, still getting by in life with his preferred herb, blows smoke at the camera which produces a very interesting effect in 3D. Harold and Kumar also have more depth to their characters than Cheech and Chong do. They significantly expand on that stale one joke theme of being high all the time mainly because the situations they find themselves in are much more life threatening and outrageous. The situations do not always work though. There is an unfortunate claymation episode and a ridiculous musical ensemble which is only there to showcase Neil Patrick Harris. However, the humor, the shocking set-ups and pay-offs the character relentlessly dodge, and the overall extreme and foulness of the whole mess frequently work. I slightly recommend this film even though I recognize Harold and Kumar are not making fun of 3D or commenting socially on it; they are cashing in on it. Look past the gimmick, and you will find the next film to wear the badge of most extreme comedy; at least until the next disgusting comedy rolls out to take its place in the next year or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harold and Kumar grow up... not too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas" is surprisingly funny. Granted the movie is very stupid, but it is periodically hysterical. Note that the 3D adds nothing to the movie, seeing pot smoke blown in your face is not cool. Admittedly, Kumar's nun shower fantasy in 3D is nearly cool. Seeing older and not necessarily wiser Harold and Kumar back together retains a certain fondness. The last Harold &amp; Kumar movie was really awful, particularly in retrospect. Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg's screenplay is absurdist mash up. Our heroes are drugged, though not self medicated, which results in seeing Kumar's Claymation penis?wasn't expecting that. Later Harold has a hilarious Johnson "Christmas Story" moment albeit prosthetics?I think. Director Todd Strauss-Schulson runs lean at about 90 minutes with a manic energy that finds its focus toward the end. The movie is stoner incoherent at times. You have seen the trailer: The dudes accidentally shoot Santa Claus, who comes crashing to the ground from his sleigh on Christmas Eve. Amazingly, it is an integral part of the story.At times Hurwitz and Schlossberg seem to be repackaging "The Hangover" with Harold's new best friend Todd (brilliantly bland Tom Lennon), who has his daughter Ava (Ashley and Chloe Coss) in tow for the quest. Ava experiences the second hand effects of every recreational drug known to man, and flourishes. Hard to figure if this is hysterical or just plain disturbing? You have to be patient with Strauss-Schulson. Although wildly incoherent and ridiculous, "Harold &amp; Kumar 3D" is about true friendship. John Cho and Kal Penn make this work, because of their genuine chemistry and partnership. Cho's Harold is the solid one. Penn's Kumar is the cool one. They respect each other and play authentically in position. In spite of itself we pull for Harold and Kumar. After all it is a Christmas story.We catch up with Harold and Kumar about 6 years after Guantanamo. Harold (Cho) is a thriving investor at a Wall Street firm. Unfortunately, this makes him a target for protesters. The use of 3D propelling eggs is amazingly dumb. Harold is married to the love of his life, Maria (beautiful Paula Garces). They live in a great house in the suburbs. Harold is stressed by the in-laws coming over for Christmas. Maria's Father (fierce and funny Danny Trejo) vehemently disapproves of Harold. As part of the family tradition Mr. Perez (Trejo) brings over the Christmas tree that he has been growing for 16 years. Harold and Maria are also heated on starting a family.On the other hand, we see Kumar (Penn) scoring some weed from Mall Santa. Kumar is reveling in loser-dom. He never finished Medical School. He smokes dope, eats waffles, and watches TV. His ex-girl friend Vanessa (charming Danneel Ackles) is pregnant. His current best friend is geek Adrian (pleasantly self-absorbed Amir Blumenfeld). Adrian convinces Kumar to come to a Christmas party so he can have sex with the hot girl (Hilary Anderson), he met on line. This is a weird storyline here. Turns out that her paternal relationship is deadly; however, the fact that she looks 16 years old should have been a red flag. Given the jokes, I wonder if that was missed context. Anyway, Kumar receives a mysterious present for Harold at their apartment. Not having seen Harold for a couple years, Kumar decides to deliver the gift to Harold's house. Invariably, Kumar ends up burning the Christmas tree to ashes. Harold is dead when his Father-in-law returns from Christmas Mass, unless he replaces the tree.Thus, the bizarre adventure begins. The dudes along with Adrian, Todd, and little Ava must find a Christmas tree. They are drugged, fend off the Russian mafia, shoot Santa Claus, and reunite with Neil Patrick Harris as Neil Patrick Harris. Kumar asks testosterone overdosed Neil, "Aren't you gay?" He is also not dead, i.e. last sequel. Harris is awesome. He really has fun with the evil self caricature. He is amazingly talented, singing and dancing in a spectacular Christmas musical number. The quiet charm of "Harold &amp; Kumar 3D" is its self referencing and deprecating humor. A street protester calls Cho, "Sulu". A woman lies that Penn's Kumar worked for the White House. There are some cheesy and gimmicky 3D montages that add little. However, when Cho and Penn are together as Harold and Kumar, they are hysterical and the movie works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Harold &amp; Kumar Demoralized Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those typical movies that gets a high rating from IMDb users merely because of the female nudity, drug use, bashing of Christianity, etc, the typical things most IMDb users are fond of.The story is basically nonexistent because it's basically about nothing. What you read in the description of the movie is basically the whole story, there is no further story development.The genre of the movie is not just comedy, it's fantasy as well. Don't expect anything realistic. In the near future a movie like this is most likely going to be labeled a "children's" movie. That's how the movie feels at first sight, from the title to the poster to the story; but it's not, it's even damaging for adults to watch this nonsense.Drug abuse is portrayed as completely normal and fun. Should a movie about "stoner buds" portray drugs as completely normal and fun for them or for everyone? There is a difference about depicting drug addiction being normal for drug addicts and depicting drug addiction as normal.Women are portrayed as complete out-of-control sluts who will have sex with just about anyone and anything and as much as possible, anywhere. Even the religious women are portrayed as being unable to control themselves sexually, even when men are not around. Add some more Christianity-bashing and you have got your typical Hollywood movie.In a world where drug addiction is normal, religion is for retards and women are complete sluts, what is considered abnormal? That's when "offensive" becomes merely only good for shock value. In a decade or more this movie will follow other movies of the same categories suit, such as Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey (1991). Back then such movies were "interesting" to some people, but they don't stand the test of time. They only push the limits of demoralization. What makes Beavis and Butt-Head (the show (1993/2011) or the movie (1996)) or Dumb &amp; Dumber (1994) work, for example, is that the idiocy of the title characters is not presented as "normal", it's only presented as normal to them. South Park (1997), on the other hand, focuses on the world around the characters and exposes it as being abnormal. Harold &amp; Kumar does neither. Imagine that in the movie Dumb &amp; Dumber everybody is just as "dumb" (except for Christians, which are portrayed as the dumbest), what would the purpose of the movie be? It can only shock and push the limits of demoralization (especially through offensiveness) and that's exactly what Harold &amp; Kumar does and as if that isn't bad enough, the movie further adds fantasy to the mix. It doesn't work and in the future, when everything that is portrayed in this movie will become reality (in as far as that is possible), this movie will fail to interest those like the ones who have enjoyed it today.What's next? Children using drugs? Oh wait, Harold &amp; Kumar already got that far. So what's really left to portray as normal? A movie in which raping animals or children is normal? That's the only thing that I can think of. What will then be next? Portraying murder as normal? Adult cartoons have already gotten that far. See, movies like Harold &amp; Kumar are already running out of "material" to "normalize". It's a dead end "genre" that should be avoided like a plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you call someone who's crazy about drugs, sex and cursing ? You may call him pathetic or creepy. I may call him A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas ! This is exploitative movie, and worst than the worse exploitative movies ever. At least exploitative movies weren't made with millions, in 3D, or sold worldwide ! There is nothing serious to talk about. Because the writers of it did a story with thin plot, made a meaning about returning to your old pal, then immersed it in a movie chock-full of filth. All the kinds of filth.The list contains : A foul language, with the F word being said, in the most hellishly tedious ways, for every 10 seconds. Doing drugs; marijuana, weed, and coke. Sex with various activities. Tons of male and female nudity. Nasty stuff; like urine, feces and possible semen. Even violence with someone having a big bloody hole in his head. So it's not only filth; it's filth with extravagance. And the question here is; when and how does filth become entertaining ???????????Hollywood is a merchant; namely a huge establishment which if discovered that shooting air is profitable, then would hire Oscar winning directors to shoot it, and get to sell it internationally. So I'm sure that a considerable number of viewers, all over the world, has become in love with this hideousness. Therefore Hollywood used to produce it diligently, no matter how conservative persons like me would refuse that, calling it a mean way to make profits, or a vile excuse to make a movie ! Maybe it's aimed at every stoned Harold &amp; Kumar out there, or the ones who secretly love being them, or the ones who want to forget their troubled complicated life (like the ones in the movie who were protesting "Down with Wall Street" !), or simply the spoiled teens to indulge their twisted lusts. However, the movie this way sounds and feels like a real drug. Heck. At times while watching it, it sounded and felt like I was having obnoxious drugs, among squalid people ! The 3D is annoying, and a new way to sell the Harold &amp; Kumar joke for a third time. John Cho and Kal Penn do nothing but smocking weed, getting nude in clay animation, and saying the most awful words you may ever hear, for hundreds of times.. Didn't they get any board with saying F**k and Pe**s FOR ALL THE TIME?!, rather didn't they have any conscience to scream "What a cheap way to make a living that is !!!". Yet, I was deadly sick by Neil Patrick Harris. Does needing fame and money mean whoring yourself to this degree? In less than 10 minutes appearance, he got into all the kinds of filth, summing up the movie as a colored dunghill ! Now to despise this movie wrathfully, you have to mediate on how it frankly enjoys drugs. Look at the running gag of the kid who has drugs all the way, Neil Patrick Harris who begs, in nauseating and totally free scene, for the lovely coke, and a last message, by Kumar's lover to him, of "don't stop smocking weed" !!! This is like despicable propaganda for being a drug addict. Now this is not exploitative, disgusting, or else; this is a crime done under the name of art ! A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas is purely and heavily made trash. Selling it as a buddy comedy about the real friendship is like selling morphine as candy. It's as ugly, immoral and harmful as doing drugs. Or, in lighter words, like eating out of a garbage can. Well, Hollywood has turned lately into a brat teen who's crazy about drugs, sex and cursing. And I won't let him force me to love his pathetic and creepy pleasures.Some day, Hollywood will look back at itself in regret, asking "What have I done" ?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good has the first one, but better then the second one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This time Harold(John Cho) is happily married to Maria(Paula Garces), and Kumar(Kal Penn) is spending much of his time getting stoned out his mind. And it's Christmas time, a special gift brings them together again, they have not spoken in years. But you know when Harold and Kumar get together again, you'll know what is coming, adventure and misadventure.The first Harold and Kumar is a comedy masterpiece, but the second one was trying to hard to be has good as the first one and it failed. But this one was alright, not good, but alright. It's always good to see John Chow and Kal Penn, those two are a great team. But gags went too extreme, and that his what killed most of it, cause the extremeness of some the gags was not needed. Neal Patrick Harris is always good as he keeps popping up here. This movie to me is what I think you should see one time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Really, Really NOT Funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a prude, but come on. What did showing specific body parts have to do with making the movie funny? The entire movie had no real theme, except to promote over-the-top acceptance of blatant use of drugs (ecstasy, cocaine, heroin, marijuana, whatever) and sex as the main theme of all the jokes.I see a ton of movies, but I came out of this one thinking it's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I just felt sick and unhappy that I had even wasted my time and money watching it. I've been disappointed, but this was like . . . Ugh!And by the way, even though it's R-rated, there were 3 10-year old boys completely alone in this showing, which was obviously inappropriate. (What thoughts must they have been processing from this movie?) Theaters don't enforce these ratings all that well, and curiosity makes the younger kids want to see these titles even more, so how many more youngsters will see this movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well executed 3D madness... that could use fresher jokes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been 6 years since Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) escaped Guantanamo Bay. The two best buddies have grown apart. Harold is a rising executive, married and off the wacky tobacky. Kumar, on the other hand is spiraling toward rock bottom. A mysterious package and a quest to find the perfect Christmas tree will reunite them for another crazy night.If there is a surprise to A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas, it's the 3D effects. Over the past couple of summers we have been bombarded with 3D. Director Todd Strauss-Schulson knows Americans are getting fed up with the "technology". So what does he do? Make one of the few films that truly necessitates a 3D presentation by spoofing the very technique. Every scene has a properly rigged exploitation of the 3D, and by going into slow motion it's easy for the audience to digest.Neil Patrick Harris returns as the mythical womanizer version of himself. Don't over think his impact on the story; Neil is here to offer laughs. Unfortunately the novelty of seeing squeaky clean Doogie Howser in this manner has been long lost. That's the problem with this series. A joke just keeps running. Take for instance the young child who repeatedly digests drugs, albeit by accident, throughout the film. The more it happens, the poorer the taste.Despite every effort to attack religion, there's some worthwhile lessons crammed into A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas. Harold and Kumar are forced confront loyalty, responsibility, aging, and manning up. It's also worth noting that this is the only mainstream, non-white comedy series that doesn't rely on race. Granted, there's plenty of gross-out and narcotics humor, but the race card spends most of the film in the deck. Every comedy should be funny, and A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas does not quite get there. Sure there are plenty of jokes, well executed 3D madness, even clay animation, but the end result is merely a better outing than the last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Great, Now a Toddler Has to Get Stoned?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Has it come to this? A 3D stoner comedy? "A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas" spends almost all of its eighty-nine minutes shoving this process down our throats, as if we didn't already know it was nothing more than a gimmick concocted by fad-frenzied filmmakers. In the course of this movie, we will have to watch as eggs, a ping pong ball, human fists, a claymation penis, a cane that shoots confetti, a winking baby Jesus manger doll, broken glass, a charred Christmas tree, blood, a gigantic joint, and of course, marijuana smoke assault our field of vision as they come flying off of the screen. We will also see freeze-frame shots of a tooth, which came from the mouth of a man getting punched across the jaw, and semen in mid-ejaculation. I wonder: Do you have to be high to laugh at this?Here is a bad movie made even worse by the fact that it simply didn't need to be. 2004's "Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle" was irreverent, raunchy, and insane, but because the filmmakers actually worked to make the characters and the plot engaging, it had a certain wacky charm. The same cannot be said about 2008's "Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay," which was more scatological and reached way, way too far as a satire of racism, terrorism, intolerance, and patriotism. Now that we've reached the third chapter in the series, what was initially amusing has devolved into an awkward mix between contrived sentimentality and pure juvenile goofiness. There's nothing innately humorous about Santa getting shot in the head before smoking from a candy-striped bong. And I don't care how much of a prude you think I am ? under no circumstances is it funny for a toddler to get high on pot, cocaine, and ecstasy. Absolutely NO circumstances.It has been two years since Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) have last seen or spoken to each other. The former has since gotten married to the love of his life, Maria (Paula Garces), has moved into the suburbs, and has abstained from pot in the hopes of having a baby. The latter has dropped out of medical school and spends all day in his filthy apartment getting stoned. It's precisely because of this that he has been dumped by his girlfriend, Vanessa (Danneel Ackles). She is not, however, out of the picture, and of that, I will say no more. On Christmas Eve, Kumar is delivered a mysterious package, although it's actually addressed to Harold. The two reunite, and then it becomes the same old, same old ? just one disastrous thing leading to another.The long and short of it is, Harold accidentally burns down a Christmas tree provided by his father-in-law (Danny Trejo), who, along with the rest of the extended family, is visiting Maria for the weekend. He loves Christmas, but like all fathers-in-law in movies like this, he thinks Harold isn't good enough for his daughter. Anyway, while Maria and her family are away at Evening Mass, Harold and Kumar frantically search the city for a replacement Christmas tree. Along the way, they will cross paths with Ukrainian gangsters, drink spiked eggnog and have a Rankin/Bass claymation hallucination, and stitch up a blood-spurting hole in Santa's head after Harold accidentally shoots him out of the sky. Oh, and they will have another unlikely run in with Neil Patrick Harris, now the star of a Christmas stage show.But wait a minute. Wasn't Harris shot to death at a Texas brothel after branding one of the prostitutes? See for yourself how he got out of that one. Anyway, we learn that he remains a egotistical, drugged-out sex maniac. And that whole gay thing? Merely a front ? a way to feed into his addiction to women and crack, however the hell that's supposed to work. He shares one scene with his real life partner David Burtka, who, according to the film, is just as straight as Harris and has a wife and children. I at one time wondered how the filmmakers would continue this running gag, although now that I've actually seen it unfold, I find that it didn't much matter; it would have been a tired joke no matter what direction the writers took it in.When we're not watching the title characters go on their desperate escapade, we're enduring frivolous subplots, most notably the relationship between Kumar and Vanessa. The others involve broad caricatures, including Kumar's sex-starved friend, Adrian (Amir Blumenfeld), and Harold's friend, Todd (Tom Lennon), who constantly looks like an idiot because he censors himself. He carries around his infant daughter, who ends up being exposed to not one but three types of drugs and is at one point so wired that she crawls around the ceiling at breakneck speed. This must have been a sadistic urge on the part of the filmmakers, one that should have been suppressed. "A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas" is an unfortunate example of quantity over quality. It's a franchise pusher, an unnecessary sequel to a movie that was decent enough to stand on its own.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some funny scenes, but bad news..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is truly sad the continual downwards path Hollywood has taken. Unless you want to fill your mind with garbage and the f'word every other second, i highly do not recommend this movie. Not only is this movie filled with sex, nudity, cursing, and drugs; but on top of that, the way they mock Jesus Christ is utter disgusting and blasphemous. I'm a 17 year old teen, you'd think I'd love a movie filled with sex, drugs, and cursing.. no, movies like this really make me realize more and more how evil the world really is. I really don't want to seem like some goodie tooshu white-boy religious prick, because I'm not. Lol, I'm just trying to inform you guys to look out for yourselves. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Awful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thirty minutes into this disgusting and stupid movie, all I could think is, "what next?" Every gross bodily function and vulgar reference had been made. Fun had already been poked at Jesus Christ. The only thing missing was Neal Patrick Harris showing up French kissing and pretending to be a straight guy. Oh, then hold on a minute.This is not an age or generational thing. TMG will laugh at almost anything that is funny no matter how vulgar or irreverent. I did laugh hard a few times early in the movie. But once a film degenerates into masturbation scenes, drugging a two year old and singing F word laden lyrics to her, ---about all that is missing is something as horrific and unfunny as a guy like Dany Trejo ejaculating onto a Christmas tree. But then wait a minute... Yeah, it is that bad. TMG does not tolerate any film which depicts, makes fun of, or glorifies child abuse. I was frankly surprised to find that Nicolas Cage was not starring in or producing this film.And then we have the cameo of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Now this, I was amazed at. How on earth do you edit in such a scene at the last moment to a movie about two perverts stealing a Christmas tree? The connection I made was that two perverts stealing a Christmas tree is what the Occupy Wall Street movement is all about. No? In the pleading words of John Goodman, "Am I wrong here?" It was the only message I could find in this movie.I willingly confess to not having seen the earlier episodes of the Harold &amp; Kumar franchise. I do not intend to either. I have read reports the earlier two, Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle (2004) and Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay (2008) are funnier and less crass, but such is hardly a ringing endorsement to waste two hours of your life or your money. This 3D fiasco in prime time will set you back $28.00 for you and your date. For $1.25 you can rent an even worse piece of trash on DVD like Bucky Larson by Adam Sandler.And parents, don't be idiots and let your 2o year old college drop out take your thirteen year old to see this film. It is inappropriate for people of any age. Note: the 3.0 P factor is probably misleading. Men peeing on cars and throwing feces on car windows, not to mention closeup footage of a penis on a frozen pole (and more) probably deserves a P factor squared. With so many good films out there to see, why waste your time or your money?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Concerning the Occupy Scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will not support this movie. I have come back from the midnight premiere of Harold and Kumar 3d Christmas, the reason I bring this up is because of a politically minded scene in the beginning of the movie regarding Occupy Wall Street.The movie mocks the movement by depicting it as an angry riotous group of about 20 protesters who fling poo at cars and that want to eat the rich.While it is the nature of Harold and Kumar to offend all, this scene seems to have a more insidious nature and resembles the picture major news companies have tried to paint of the movement plus embellishment.Most of the movie is shot in New York while Christmas decorations were up, meaning the movie was basically shot in entirety before 2011. this would mean that the scene most likely made its way in a matter of weeks ago, since it onlyThis requires prompt attention, as they are using pop culture to disenfranchise our movement. Pop culture is the main former of public opinion, we need to react and we need to react now.I doubt this is the work of the directors, but a result of some bit of payoff to use the 3rd Harold and Kumar movie against Occupy.I repeat, time is precious and every minute matters. Take the scene down or else. I Will advise anyone and everyone to not support this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Harold and Kumar knowing that this series of movies can get sometimes gross with their humor. You get the point. But this time they went too far. Making fun of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, the Holy Baptism, and, Heaven is seriously not cool. Did I mention that showing religious icons as a background in a party/orgy is also not attractive? In case the above are not enough to deter you from seeing that movie consider that showing an infant doing drugs and a male reproductive organ on screen should be considered inappropriate for all ages. Moreover, the plot in this movie is totally predictable and the characters lack any particular interest. For example, did anyone understand why NPH was in that movie? Seriously, does anyone think that his role added anything to the movie? As poor as it gets overall</fullReview>
