		<shortDescription>Good, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anthony Hopkins gave an impeccable performance. However, the material he was given to work with was not as good as Silence of the Lambs. In fairness, perhaps there was no way it could be. In SOTL, he was somehow more foreboding, more of a sort of superhuman monster; in Hannibal, he's more accessible, a guy you meet on the street. Maybe it was impossible to maintain the mystery of Lecter that we saw in SOTL because of the risk of doing a rehash. I'd give the overall Dr Lecter character a 9 of 10 in this film, vs. a 10 of 10 in the last one. Not quite as good, but still very good.Starling's character, on the other hand, fell flat in this film. In SOTL, Foster perfectly portrayed Starling's flat surface with a turbulent depth; in Hannibal, there was nothing under her surface. Foster's Clarice evoked feelings of sympathetic grief, Moore's Clarice evoked nothing. I do not necessarily blame Moore, this could be due to writing and/or directing. Obviously, though SOTL focused mainly on Starling's character, Hannibal focuses on, well, Hannibal. Still, that's no excuse for what was done to Starling. Her character gets a 3 of 10.The story was much weaker in Hannibal than in SOTL. It almost seemed like an excuse to present us with the characters, rather than a story in and of itself. Still, it had no other major flaws, so it gets a 6 of 10.Now, there's another category I'll call the shock factor. It's different than ordinary gore, it's... creative gore. The sick, disgusting depravity we expect to see and like to see in this type of film. I can't go into detail without spoiling it, but I'll have to say it goes even beyond what I expected. Do not watch this film if you are squeamish or dislike gore. There isn't a lot of gore in the film, but what there was, was... concentrated. Shock Factor, 10 of 10.Overall I give the film an 8 of 10. Very well done with a few weaknesses, well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot to chew on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people were disappointed or flat-out disgusted by Ridley Scott's follow-up to "The Silence of the Lambs." I can certainly understand their disgust, but I preferred this to its Oscar winning predecessor. It had been a long, long time since a movie made me turn from the screen in genuine horror, and I didn't believe it was even possible. "Hannibal"'s deservedly controversial climax took me by surprise. It may have been revolting (okay, it was very definitely revolting) but so few movies these days have any lasting impact and I appreciate that this one did. And it is, after all, about a cannibal, is it not? At some point in a series of films about a man of Lector's inclinations, we should see him at work. Of course, the horror of the climax is effective because the rest of the film is so good. Hopkins, a little chunkier than the last time we saw him in this role, positively exudes menace especially in his final confrontation with Pazzi (an excellent Giancarlo Giannini whose sad eyes make him the most sympathetic character in the film). Then there's Gary Oldman's Mason Verger who is so contemptible that he never elicits sympathy no matter how he suffered at the hands of Lector. And Julianne Moore is an improvement over Jodie Foster who I have always believed was overrated.But the best thing about "Hannibal" is the atmosphere in which Scott and his team envelop the story. A cloud of dread hangs over this film, and beautiful Florence, Italy, though still beautiful, appears haunted by Lector's very presence in the city.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this film a lot, but of course it suffers - as all sequels do - by comparison to its predecessor, in this case 'Silence of the Lambs' The main reason for having a sequel at all was to showcase again the character of Hannibal Lecter, a monstrous creation everyone wanted to see more of after the first film. It could have bombed badly therefore if writer and actor had let us down by failing to catch the magic again. It was after all a decade after the original was made. But they don't, and Anthony Hopkins turns in another delicious performance as the man with the evil intent cloaked in inestimable, menacing charm.Julianne Moore drew the short straw in having to re-create the Clarice Starling role that had been so memorably played by another actress. She does well in my opinion, but inevitably we keep thinking 'where is Jodie Foster?', and this lends her portrayal a lack of credibility which is entirely unfair. Gary Oldman's Mason Verger is suitably loathsome and manages to make Lecter seem almost like the hero in their battle of wits. If there is a weak link, Ray Liotta's Krendler seems a bit misplaced.The direction deserves special mention. The lush, beautiful settings are mocked by the horror of what is happening in them and the perfectly-selected atmospheric music stayed in my mind long after the film had ended.Once again, the film lacks realism, but as with the original, it doesn't matter. Of course things like this don't really happen - but so what? It's a film. Get over it! I was prompted after seeing it to read the books, and the right decision was made in changing the ending of this story from that written by Thomas Harris. We were subsequently treated to another look at Lecter in a decent prequel movie, 'Red Dragon,' but I will not be alone in hoping that some day we will see yet more of him in a further instalment. Unlikely I suspect - but not impossible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much More Than Brain Food</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to go against popular opinion on this one. Most people hate this film; I love it....well, 95 percent of it, anyway.The shame of it is that most people only remember the last 10 minutes, a totally gruesome scene in which the top of a man's head is cut off and he's fed a morsel of his own brain. Of course, it's disgusting and I don't find it easy to watch, either.However, the first two hours of the film offers a feast, if you'll pardon the pun, for the eyes and ears that is not revolting except for one other three-second shot. This is one of the most beautifully-filmed movies I've ever seen. Scene after scene is just jaw dropping and features some of the best shots, outside and inside, of Florence, Italy, you could ever imagine. Ridley Scott is known for his stylish direction and that is certainly the case here.The dialog is fascinating, led by Anthony Hopkins' famous "Hannibal Lecter" character, whose vocabulary and intelligent sarcasm and baiting are clever and entertaining to hear. Unlike "Silence Of the Lambs," there is little verbal crudeness in this film, very little profanity at all. On the third viewing, I played this with the English subtitles on, so I could catch all the dialog.This was a much lower-key film than it's famous predecessor, which probably disappointed a lot of people who prefer a lot more violence and f-words in their crime movies.Although Jodie Foster performed well in the role of FBI Agent Clarice Starling, I preferred watching and listening to Julianne Moore play the part in this film. A "sleeper" here, too, was the great performance by Giancarlo Gianni, as the greedy Italian lawman, who winds up paying a huge price for his avarice.Like "Godfather III," this is a very unjustly-criticized and overlooked third installment of a famous film trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pleasure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal is a pure pleasure! While a little unevenly paced (the beginning was a bit slow), David Mamet and Steve Zallian have done a good job of telling the basic story Thomas Harris gave to us - and, incidently, the book was incredibly underrated by critics whose thought processes seem to have been damaged by too little quality literature. People have complained that it took ten years for Harris to write it - well, read it! It is chock-a-block full of mythology, astronomical and religious themes that weave their way throughout. The threads never break. The movie would have had to be eight hours long to even begin to explore the depths plumbed by Harris in the book.Anthony Hopkins is, as usual, brilliant! Julianne Moore was sexy and strong. Giancarlo Giannini was outstanding and Gary Oldman creditable. My only complaint with casting was Ray Liotta, who just didn't have "it".Having seen this movie three times thus far, I will say that watching it is like peeling layers off an onion. You see more and more with each viewing - little treasures and nuggets that you find almost by accident. The first time I saw it, I left the theatre not really knowing what I thought of it. Then I found myself smiling. I did like it. When I went back again (and again!) I liked it more and more.Gory? Not really - and I consider myself pretty sensitive to gore. I have seen far worse. The story does have violence in it, and I think Ridley Scott, while depicting an integral part of the story, handled the violence tastefully (if you'll pardon the expression).Is it as good as Silence of the Lambs? No. It's DIFFERENT from SotL. In Silence we had a caged monster whose intensity was extremely focussed. Here, we have a monster who is on the loose in a great big world, free to indulge in his passions. Hannibal Lecter's essence has not changed. He's merely in a different situation.My only disappointments were: The changed ending. This was the major one. I realize the critics lambasted Thomas Harris for the ending in the book, saying "Clarice would never have done that", but Clarice was the child of Harris' imagination. The author is god, and if god says a character will do something, who are we to second-guess?The length of the movie. It could have been a little longer and more focus could have been put on the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice - specifically, his obsession with her, and the time they spent together after the fiasco at the Verger Estate.It was also too bad that Mason Verger's sister, Margot, was written out of the script.All in all, though, I thoroughly enjoyed the dark humor and the adventure. Hans Zimmer's score is magnificent! This is a really good film - not a great film, but a really good one. Don't go into it expecting to see another Silence of the Lambs. It's not - and I don't think anyone has ever tried to claim that it is. Expect to see a weird and wonderful love story and an adventure! (It's just too bad about that ending!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its very good, so see it on the big screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven`t been affected this much by a movie in years, so that must be considered good value for money. The controversial gore scene towards the end made myself, and the majority of the audience, flinch, scream and nervously giggle simultaneously (a feel good/feel bad movie rolled into one!).Having never read the original book I took the film at face value. It is beautifully filmed by a talented director and crew, and features lovely Italian location scenes which contrast with the grim plot. The acting is mainly excellent. Hopkins character appears creepier due to him beginning to resemble a kindly grandad, who suddenly turns and eats your brain. Julianne Moore`s excellent Clarice vaguely reminded me of Ripley, the star of Ridley Scotts masterpiece Alien. At worst, the rest of the cast were well above average.The film had me captivated with its style, twisty plot, acting and gore. I found myself slightly rooting for the baddie Hannibal at some points, something I haven`t experienced since my empathy for evil Alex in A Clockwork Orange. If people find the deaths of some characters predictable, then maybe Scott has directed well in projecting Hannibal`s approach and morality.This is the sort of big budget horror film movie-goers have been waiting for, so go see it on the large screen before its too late! Okay, it is not the same as Silence, so what? Ten years have passed and things have changed. I`ve heard the book is better. Well, I may now read it, but in the meantime I have enjoyed an excellent, thought provoking Film Of The Year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't come close to the quality of the original, but Anthony Hopkins's performance saves the movie. *** (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HANNIBAL / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French: Some movies are born to inspire sequels but "The Silence of The Lambs" is a movie that does not need a sequel. The Academy Award winning thriller earned ubiquitous critical acclaim, therefore a continuation is nearly incapable of living up to its standards. To make things worse for the highly anticipated sequel "Hannibal," the original film's director and main star bailed out, leaving Ridley Scott ("Gladiator") and Julianne Moore ("Magnolia") filling their places in the credits. It is hard to imagine how this movie could possibly succeed. But the exceptionally beautiful filmmaking, strong performances, intriguing story, and moody atmosphere provoke more nail-biting moments than most thrillers these days. The story of "Hannibal" does not compare with "The Silence of the Lambs." It replaces tension-filled sequences of psychological terror with scenes featuring some of the most grotesque images and realistic gore to ever make its mark on the big screen. This film relies heavily on the shock factor of such extreme graphic violence, although such content is never excessive or relentless. It has perfect timing. The sheer presence of Anthony Hopkins, in another horrific and career defining performance, often creates enough terror for several movies. "Hannibal" knows that and frequently gives the character more freedom than he had in he first film. But I am not so sure that is a good thing; is it more terrifying listening to Hannibal Lecter discuss his disgusting actions or to actually see him perform such disturbing behaviors?  The film takes place ten years after FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster then, Julianne Moore now) interviewed convicted mass murdering cannibal Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) while searching for another disturbed killer. Present day: Clarice is involved with a drug bust shoot-out that leaves many dead. Justice Dept. Official Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta), is about to punish her when she gets a call from a the unrecognizably deformed surviving victim of an attack by Lecter. His name is Mason Verge (Gary Oldman), a wealthy recluse who asks that Starling be placed back on the case of the Cannibal, who has been on the loose for ten years.  The movie investigates a lot more than Clarice's experiences with Hannibal Lecter. The script actually consists of two separate stories, one detailing the revenge scheme of Mason, whom is still angry with Lecter after he caused the removal of his face and partial paralysis. The other takes place in Italy, where an inspector named Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) is out to claim a multimillion dollar reward for providing authorities with proper evidence leading to the arrest of a local, who turns out to be none other than Lecter himself. Obviously this man does not know what he is in for, and ends up losing his cuts for the money?literally.  Parallel stories are always interesting, but are easily sidetracked with certain characters and or events. What keeps this movie intriguing is the consistent focus on Lector; everything in the story seems to revolve around him. Then again, "Hannibal" is also quite pointless because it solves nothing. Without giving away the ending, I will say that we are once again left pondering about Lecter. Most any movie that provokes thoughts is worth seeing, but "Hannibal" forgets the first film, takes a stand on its own, and once again sets us up for another unnecessary follow-up. The most apparent conflict many audiences with have with "Hannibal" is the absence of Jodie Foster. Julianne Moore is most definitely a capable and challenging actress, and plays the role of Starling with exuberance and clarity. But Foster is simply better in the role and we miss her dearly. Anthony Hopkins saves the movie; the actor is so intense and grisly in his subtle and classy manner, he once again qualifies as an award nominee. Thank goodness he returned for the role; without Hopkins, "Hannibal" would be nothing but underdone carnage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad, bad Hannibal! No sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Hannibal SPOILERS* Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is back... for a travesty of a movie! Now he's in Italy, appreciating our food (including people, such as Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini)), but comes back to the States for Clarice (Julianne Moore) and to even the score with a former victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman).Let me tell you, this movie does not deserve to be spoken of along with Silence Of The Lambs and Manhunter, because it's truly, completely, absolutely, totally BAD.I mean, the scene near the end with Ray Liotta's cranium being opened and him forced to eat part of his brain sautéed? WTF? Then, why the HELL was everybody so annoying (including Clarice)? And why did the story keep going nowhere? I suppose that this is the 'teen' chapter of the Hannibal series; terrible, stupid, gory for gore's sake and totally embarrassing.Don't watch it, especially if you love any other of the Hannibal movies (SOTL, Manhunter, Red Dragon, Hannibal Rising).Hannibal: 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wistful thinking is fun. So if I ran my own studio and this was brought to me, forget that it's a sequel to a lucrative property, so carries expectations, I would have the whole writing team fired and off the lot by lunch. I would especially have Mamet fired, because he's not a dumb guy. Actually, the problem is they have to work from a terrible novel by a hack author, so everyone including Ridley and the actors seem jaded by the choices they have to make."But, hey it's a movie about a guy who chews off victims' faces, quit being a dunce". Not quite, my friends.These films are about twin worlds, the cop world of reason and the killer's world of urges, hidden self and powerful intuition. Clarice straddles both, is damaged herself, that is the main thrust, so is able to solve the case in a way that both unfolds and redeems her darkness. The guy eating liver with a nice Chianti doesn't have to be the center.Manhunter exemplified this can be done as evocative introspection; our anchor was in the second world, and it was spending time in this world that deepened our perspective for humanity and reason (and also conveyed the protagonist's soul, since the actor couldn't). The urge was for a normal touch that stirs deep.Silence placed the anchor in the first and turned the second into a lurid caricature that verged on camp and b-horror. Because the film was not rooted in the world of images and intuition, it had to rely on Foster having good dramatic presence. She did it just barely, but the film was much less cinematic. Her urge was powerful but never conveyed with the camera. The killer's was about 'transformation' but squarely rooted in the sexual. He was reduced from the center of a rich world in Manhunter to a human camera (). So here comes Ridley in the third installment. The poor guy is working by far from the worst script, even worse he's building on Demme's template instead of Mann's - had to by that point, the novel after all was written with Demme and Foster in mind.The whole thing is lurid and cheap this go round. The urges are all base outside Lecter (sex - money - power - revenge). You will know it by how sloppy is the scene of Mason Verger's hallucinated memory (and really everything about this man).So three sinners, all three righteously punished in increasingly hellish ways and Lecter has turned into a melancholy avenging angel slash fatherly mentor figure slash aged but suave lover. He's everything stereotypical about having a cultured taste. He's filmed around Florence to have lots of attractive scenery counterpointing the vileness, another lazy effect.The Christ symbolism is just the tackiest thing. They might have had something with Lecter as Dante's Satan gnawing at the three traitors, but the portrayal doesn't match, and besides, Inferno is naturally the most crude portion of the text. There's nothing worthwhile to build from it anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Typical Hollywood Serial Killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yup, they did it again. Between the sanitized ending: agent Starling became a cannibal in the book but is an unconvincing righteous crusader in this turkey (an essential and main theme the author uses throughout his books is what makes a truly great detective is their ability to think and be somewhat of the same cloth as those they hunt) and the miscast Julianne Moore who really stinks up the scenes with her phony flat floundering; Hollywood has killed another serial. Sir Anthony gives a fine performance with the flawed material he was given and Gary Oldman and Ray Liotta and some others are all excellent but they cannot keep this vessel from missing the mark completely. Once again the Hollywood execs involved with this have kept their jobs by hiring all the "right" people, so even if it had bombed at the box office they could claim they were not responsible because they hired all the "right" people. Unfortunately not enough of them were the right ones for this specific job. Besides one of the essential leads being a terrible and inappropriate choice, Ms. Moore, the integral story changes were idiotically formulaic, essentially burning all the bridges for thought the author had built and that had been kept intact in "The Silence of the Lambs" movie. Did Mamet REALLY write this? Or is he just the writer of record and it was destroyed by too many cooks (other writers) fooling around with the recipe? Why does Hollywood always do this? If a theme is "too dark" or "too depressing" do a different film for chrissake. Don't destroy the heart of something to make it more palatable for the bland masses. Hey I have an idea, instead of Dr. Lecter being a serial killer let him be a man who likes to eat lots of CEREAL. Yeah, that way you can make this into a cartoon for kids on Saturday morning too! Think of the marketing possibilities, tying it in with Cheerios or how about LIFE cereal? Wow, maybe the studio execs missed their chance to REALLY cash in. Shhhh, very quietly now, don't repeat this, otherwise the remake they do because they're all too cowardly to try a real new theme but instead rehash proved "box office" that they "rewrite" for the masses will be worse than what I just said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't write many reviews here but having treated myself to watching the DVD of "Silence of the Lambs" the previous night, i thought i'd watch "Hannibal" again tonight. Now i first saw H at the movies on it's release, i wasn't overly impressed but i actually bought the DVD when it was released as i felt i may have missed something. Well after my third viewing this evening i have to say i've wasted nearly 6 hours of my life on a movie that has absolutely no redeeming features. I will never view it again. The scriptwriters when faced with a selection of some of the most unpleasant characters ever submitted to film resorted to some extremely lazy options. It's like they said "OK we have to make Hannibal the anti hero here, but he maims and kills quite a few innocents, any ideas? Well we could make the Italian policeman corrupt, make him shop in Hannibal all for the sake of a few bucks rather than going through the correct authorities, yeah that would work. How about this Verger geezer, he was mutilated by Lectors sadism and now wants revenge.I know lets make him a paedophile, brilliant. Oh and just for kicks lets turn Clarice into a dumb broad who makes one stupid decision after another, man we've nailed it, surefire hit." I cannot fathom how anyone gets anything out of this film, i enjoyed Silence and Red Dragon and to a lessor degree Manhunter, they were all intelligent to at least a reasonable level. Hannibal is schlock horror and has nothing bar beautiful cinematography in it's favour. Of the many, many DVDs i own Hannibal is going right to the bottom of the stack and will never see the light of day again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Comparison, All Movies are good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have witnessed some atrocities of cinema. In the past couple of years, it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity. Hannibal was not an exception. I wasn't expecting much, when I went in to see the movie. The book was ridiculous, and the saying, "The Book is always better than the movie" did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash. But what I came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison. Usually, when I see a terrible movie, I find myself more amused than anything else. Sadly though, I could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a film that Hannibal is. The movie was filmed with promise, I guess. It had Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, and Gary Oldman. And for directing, there was Ridley Scott. There have been movies with significantly less talent that have been tremendously better. There was so much I would have cut from this film that I doubt anything would have remained. It was pathetic. The storyline was so ludicrous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it. What's worse is that the book was even crazier, and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included, which is sad in the case of a movie where***SPOILER AHEAD*** Ray Liotta's brain was being cooked in pieces. That scene more than any other made me want to cry, because it tarnished its predecessor to such a monumental level. Silence of the Lambs was one of my favorite films of all time. But Hannibal was a two hour plus joke. This movie should only be watched, if people want to learn how not to write a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the deal is done. Saw it. Liked it. However.....not nearly as good as Silence. Very different effect is achieved by this film. It does almost play like an elite form of slasher movie. Like Jason with class and an education. I like Jodie and I see why she really didn't want this role. There's not a hell of a lot for Starling to do. Let's just say this- I liked it for what it is. As a stand alone film. It works on some levels. I think 2 1/2 is a good rating. I can recommend it. I even liked it. It just pales in comparison. And one can't help but compare. The characters all seem a bit shallow. Even Lecter. Some parts of this film are sooo over the top, I have to accept them as dark humor. The main thing I remember about Silence is the overwhelming feeling of dread, of sadness about the events in the film. "What does he do, this man you seek?" "He kills women." "NO, that is INCIDENTAL." Now that exchange instilled horror in me. There's just nothing like that in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies of 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has churned out yet another garbage that's wildly overhyped and underwhelming on a first-time viewing basis. Hannibal is bad, terrible, inept, lame, droll, idiotic, contrived, laughable and utterly atrocious (no pun intended). Minor spoilers follow...This movie has huge logic holes - more than any Bruckheimer/Bay movie - or for that matter - any movie that exemplify the indulgence of Hollywood exaggeration. It's a slick Hollywood production designed to cash in on Hannibal Lector mania, directed by "so-somber-he-takes-this-way-too-seriously" hack director Ridley Scott and produced by a hack Italian producer with an inflated ego whose credo is "doesn't matter whether film is s**t, money is good".I can't get over the fact that acclaimed screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote this tripe adapted from a lame and pretentious book by a good-novelist-turned-hack-author Thomas Harris. David and Steven - well-known and immensely talented screenwriters - wasted their effort on a poor screenplay in exchange for fat paychecks. Another factor in the disappointment of this film.There are too many ludicrous scenes to list that are laughable in clunky execution and poor logic e.g. Starling/Pazzi cell-phone in the midst of Lecter pursuit that turns up Inspector Pazzi as the victim. Not to mention laughably bad dialogues delivered by Tony Hopkins with a smirk and Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta and others who cannot act with the straight face. Hopkins gives the true meaning of "scenery-chewing" along with hammy acting by Gary Oldman as a deformed psychopath bent on exacting revenge against Lecter.The gore effect is good, but only serves to repulse rather than provide suspense which is notably absent from Hannibal. The predecessor - Silence of the Lambs - is more believable with tension and suspense. Suspense is what made Silence of the Lamb work as a spectacular mix of psychological horror and thriller, not to mention superbly written and tensely directed. The "brain dinner" sequence is so laughably fake it borders on self-parody.The ending is kinda blatant and idiotic - are we supposed to believe that Lecter is still a menace to society with the last shot establishing his glittering eye glaring at you? Ooh, scary... </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not so much a movie as a corporate offensive with the single goal of (what else) milking a franchise literally ... to death. OMG. Look at the talent in front of, and behind, the camera. Seriously. There are enough big names here to start another Hollywood. Ridley Scott, at a stage in his career (before Prometheus, for example) when his name was essentially a brand of its own. Screenplay by Mamet? How often does THAT happen? You have to believe that, to hook him into this project, a convoy of Brinks trucks carrying large, non-sequential, bills was somehow involved. Gary Oldman, one of the most accomplished character actors of all time. And of course they could not do the film without bringing back Sir Anthony, again, one of the greatest actors of the era, and at a stage in his career when his name as well was virtually a guarantee of quality (before the Odin-sleep, for example). What could go wrong?Here is what went wrong: 1. They could not get Jodie Foster to do the part. This reviewer is incredibly naive, a genetic issue, and would like to think it was because her "Spidey sense" warned her of what was come, but more likely it was a about money. Instead, viewers were "Bewitched" (a reference to the way they swapped out the husband in the iconic TB show) and had to make do with Julianne Moore, a middling actress who, never, not even on her best day, captured the gravitas of Foster. 2. Hopkins was getting a bit old to play Hannibal, mid-60s by now, but to his credit he did handle himself remarkably well, and moved with the grace of a younger man. 3. The big error, the one that will go down in the history books, the one that will be taught in Film Schools of the future, is the ending. They did not simply change it. They butchered it. Almost as if Hollywood itself was saying to the book industry, look pal, you are toast, we have seen the future and it is all about portable devices, Google glasses, and electronic media. No one reads anymore. If we change the ending, who will know...?Well this reviewer, for one. In the book, Hardy, a strange writer who likes challenging his readers, suddenly decided that Starling and Hannibal were meant for each other, like Fred and Ginger, and had them hook up at the close, and toddle off into the sunset. NOT MAKING THIS UP, READ THE BOOK. This was too much for a Hollywood production team who first and foremost wanted to make back the money they had advanced for the aforesaid Scott, Mamet, Hopkins and Oldman. So they basically filmed a different movie.Which explains the low rating, and the sad feeling most fans of the original (Silence of the Lambs) get whenever you mention this sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The replacement of Jody Foster by Juliane Moore was not the brightest idea to start of the movie. Although her start was very promising, telling of the local police. But unfortunately this was her only good scene in the entire flic. The tone of the movie (usually set by music and light) was awful. No suspense in this movie, the only reason why it is doing so good is the promise that it could live up to part one.A very disappointed viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is very little to recommend in "Hannibal": the plot is threadbare or otherwise full of holes, the parts are equally thin, and the violence is treated in celebratory fashion by Scott. What's the point? Is Lecter now a hero because he kills/eats only bad guys? The only thing going for it is the gorgeous photography of Florence: but one can better savor such scenes by watching the Travel Channel. This is a grotesque film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The weakest film to feature Hannibal Lecter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel to the seminal Silence of the Lambs is a mixed meal. At times gripping, thrilling and beautiful, at other times it is confusing, slow and clumsy. One of the best parts of the film is Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, he IS Hannibal and whilst not as menacing, intelligent or as complex as he is in 'Silence', he is none-the-less one of the film's stronger points. The lack of return of Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling is one of the film's weaker points. Julianne Moore tries her best but doesn't have the emotional vulnerability and connection with Dr. Lecter that Foster had. Also, Julianne Moore slips in and out of the old West Virginian twang that played such a surprisingly large role in 'Silence' far too noticeably. This is not one of Director Ridley Scott's best films and the direction is not the reason why. The film looks fantastic, the city of Florence in particular becomes a gruesome and macabre setting for the grisly proceedings. Several scenes in particular had me feeling quite nauseous, although possibly in part to blurring motion rather than the events in the scene. The film, adapted from the novel by Thomas Harris follows a very similar narrative and the story idea itself is simple and effective. One of Lecter's victims wants revenge. Simple, powerful and eerie, an unrecognisable Gary Oldman (seriously) plays Mason Verger. A single- minded wealthy man who had the misfortune of crossing Lecter's path.The main issue I have with the film is that it's surprisingly heavy handed. In this, at time it appears that Lecter is a redemptive moral story instead of a brilliant serial killer. His relationship with Starling again is too subtle, the fondness from Silence is still present but it's not as a awkward or as powerful as the scenes between Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. The ideas of corruption and redemption are further weaved around an idea of romance. Something that was hinted at but never as explicit as it is here. So instead of a brilliantly complex psychological thriller with well crafted characters and razor tight scripting, you have a slightly clumsy, pseudo religious horror film. It's not bad per se, but it pales in comparison to films in the series both older and newer.Read further reviews at: http://thegiff.typepad.com/film_flare/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't believe the hype, Hannibal is a truly drab piece of garbage (I hope not to offend garbage). Like the extremely mediocre 'Gladiator', 'Hannibal' is a perfect example of style over substance. While I loved Ridley Scott's 'Alien', 'Blade Runner', and 'Thelma and Louise', his new outing is senseless w***ing. The plot is very stagnant (like a sagging erection) and failed to put my friends and I in any state of suspense. While 'Lambs' gave off an extremely creepy claustrophobic vibe and a lurking sense of evil (Hannibal's scenes revolved around very restricted space that only hightened the tension) the "sequel" let Hannibal roam around free as a lamb. Starling in the 1st film was an eager, clever girl but here she is just depressed and one dimensional Did he have any motivation in this picture? I think not. Did this movie scare me? Not in the least. Instead Scott goes for laughter that is very "look at how outrageous i am....how crazy and gore infested my celluloid images are". Like Roger Ebert (whom I can feel is full of crap quite often) said 'this film is a gore fest that wishes to be great art'. Oh that's rich!!!! I wish Lecter stayed retired forever or maybe he should have became a bus driver or what not. Blame a bad script, direction cuz I think the actors are capable without a doubt. Just watch and see if you can find motivation behind the characters actions (Hannibal = 0% Starling 1% -capture bad dude, or kiss him?- Verger 1% -torture bad dude even though the audience doesn't completely know why he felt such anger towards me.......). This is a film that's aware of it's funniness (like the putrid, insipid 'Fight Club') despite being humorless. Sure the look of the the film is excellent but afterwards you may want to jump off a cliff. Wait for cable or the $1.99 bin. RATING: 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horrible, Wicked Amoral Movie Made to a High Standard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are somehow supposed to identify with everyone's favorite erudite cannibal, Hannibal Lecter. Clarissa Starling has been hung out to dry by her superiors for a drug raid that got violent. A raid, that she disapproved of, where 4 violent criminals were killed off, one of them being a black woman crime lordess who had her baby when she was shot dead, while she was shooting at Clarissa. Never mind, the baby was unharmed and the raid was executed without her approval and against her orders. It was compared to Waco by the news and her superiors, why? Were 80 odd cultists burned alive after a long siege? And this in a Mamet, no Zallian screenplay. One of her bureaucratic tormentors, played by Ray Liotta, is a future victim too. In ten years since her debut, she has learned to be really rude and nasty, especially to her coworkers and superiors, no more nice little small town girl.Hannibal, after the "Silence of the Lamb", has escaped to Italy where he is living the artsy fartsy good life doing some sort of appraisal work. He is being tracked down by a Mason Verger, a degenerate, crippled, disfigured ex child molester who is super rich. You see, Verger was Hannibal's only victim who lived and he is so super rich, he has a palatial Virginian estate and his own highway to it.The story shifts gears and goes over Italy for more artsy cannibalism and gore. Needless to say, Hannibal increased his body edible count. Of course, all his victims have some sort of defect of character, far less than Hannibal though. So we are supposed to identify with Hannibal like Clarissa does again. She helps rescue him from some justified vengeance and get even more people killed, including Verger. But ex-child molesters are more heinous than cannibals in this world. This is because they have bonded in some Platonic love and ampathy so that Hannibal sacrifices part of himself to spare her, after doing in her bureaucratic tormentor in a real medically sadistic scene.There is nothing enlightening or satisfying in this installment. I compare this to "Natural Born Killers" in its glorification of charismatic but utterly depraved killers. At least NBK was so over the top it was hard to take seriously, as this film aimed at. I mean, with Mamet doing the screenplay and Sir Ridley Scott directing, plus a huge budget, what are we supposed to make of this? Are we, the public and audience, so depraved that we should invoke sympathy for a depraved killer cause his victims are less than innocent and he has intelligence and a taste in Renaissance art? I hope not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scott &amp; Hopkins: Shame on You!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scott, Hopkins, Warner Bros., Harris: Shame on You!!! After spending 650 Pesetas, and one afternoon in the bad taste company of Hannibal Lecter, I cannot hold my peace: This movie is, regarded as meta-comedy maybe acceptable as a bad joke. If 'Hannibal' is supposed to be taken seriously as an entertaining and thrilling piece of celluloid, I need to get rid of my anger and disappointment immediately: The movie is, in spite of Ridley Scotts estetical maneuvers, a disgrace in all meanings. It is totally predictible (many movies are, so this flaw does not make Hannibal uniquely bad per se, but one could expect the sequel of one of the most thrilling movies of the 90ees to perform in just remotely the same way), and lacks characters one can identify with, not to say feel sympathy or empathy with. Example: Just the beginning makes the skin crawl. The setup is so, so predictible and not even a bad police-show worthy. We see Starling take the good old confrontation with the local police before and operation is carried out. Pleaaaase! We then already know that everything is going to be messed up by the local police, and that Starlings badge eventually is going to fall. Not a bad setup, if You consider the perspectives of her pursuing Lecter on her own. But that doesn´t happen. The movie never really gets of, never gets exciting, and the characters are so out of focus that You lose interest in who is bad and good. No one really are. So eventually You lose interest in what´s going to happen next. The characters are all bad persons without excuses, and worst of all: They do not evolve at all throughout the movie. 'Hannibal' is the most speculative, bizarre and perverse display of greed in the big moviemachine of Hollywood, YUCK!!! I´m sure that Hopkins, Scott and the rest of the involved are walking hand in hand all the way to the bank with a big grin on their faces. Instead of maintaining their integrity as serious artists, they have all displayed the worst case of 'prostitution' to big-bucks-box-office speculation by joining up to take part in this bizarre, meaningless and bad, self-reflecting joke. Please Mr. Harris, let Lecter disappear forever, and stop speculating in bizarre books designed for the exploitation of the boxofficepeople, and get back to the spirit and wit of 'Red Dragon', please...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having worked for a number of years with acutely psychotic patients and the criminally insane I get the deepest belly laughs over the way Hollywood portrays "psychotic" criminals and the horror and revulsion the movie watching public drums up when they see Hannibal Lecter. I didn't like either Hannibal movie, but this one was particularly stupid. I can't believe Anthony Hopkins allowed himself to be conned into repeating that character performance. Julianne Moore made a big mistake also. She definitely lowered herself doubling for a main character in a "sequel" (Jody Foster). She's far too good for that. And, what was Ray Liota thinking?! To get back to the psychotic thing, Hannibal's aggression, quickness, strength, agility and handiness with sharp objects resembles an evil comic book superhero, not a crazed psychiatrist or an insatiable cannibal. Even less credible is the conduct of his victims. They are easier to kill and put up less fight than a 3,000 year old mummy. It is pure BS that only the movie going public could keep from laughing at. All I can say is that its a good thing Rocky Balboa never had to get in the ring with Hannibal Lecter! I couldn't bear watching Hannibal making coleslaw outta Rocky! Actually, the movie wasn't terribly bad until the RSHE, that is the RidiculouslyStupid Hollywood Ending. RSHE is common in most Hollywood products and this one was no exception. To be fair, Hannibal ended pretty stupid, but I've seen stupider.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointingly relies on a series of gory set pieces rather than consistent suspense or dramatic development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being held accountable for a botched drug arrest that left 6 dead and great media coverage, FBI Agent Clarice Starling is sent away to follow up on new information regarding Dr Lecter from one of his past victims ? the disfigured Mason Verger. As Starling works under the demeaning supervision of Agent Krendler, Lecter begins to taunt her with letters from an unknown location. Meanwhile in Florence, Inspector Pazzi begins to suspect the identity of the new curator, while Verger places a $3million reward for anyone who will bring him information leading to Lecter.The sequel that everyone wanted to see and that got lots of headlines for it's gory content was not something I was very bothered about seeing. Although I think Silence was a good film I was a bit surprised by the sheer volume and degree of praise that was heaped upon it. However I decided I would give it a go when it finally came on television and I pretty much got what I expected ? a gory film that trades on blood and it's title character without a great deal else of real value put in with it. The story is very condensed from the book (so I'm told anyway) and is basically boiled down to a handful of events that will deliver the shock and gore if that's all you want ? but that's not all I wanted. I needed a lot more in fact and I have a better appreciation of what made the first film a much better one than this.For one thing the whole film lacks suspense ? by which I mean real suspense and tension, not just the suspense as we await the imminent arrive of the next gory scene. The plot is a little bit daffy at points and this may be done to it's slimmed down nature ? certainly I was not drawn in so much as merely standing by watching it. The film also asks a lot of us; it asks us to understand the relationship dynamic between Lecter and Starling even though it shows us very little here ? almost like it is expecting us just to take it on face value and remember Silence without it carrying anything through. Also it asked us to like, even support, Lecter ? an idea that I found wholly unappealing. There is nothing wrong with having a monster as your 'hero' character or of focusing on the dark side of humanity but here the film practically revels in the gore, almost forgetting all else. It has made Lecter such a comical character ('okay-dokay'?) that it doesn't really know what to do with itself when he is off screen. The fact that it doesn't do anything with this dark beast other than stare lovingly at him is a problem for me and just supported the idea that the film was out for gore.Even the cast seem to realize that this film is nowhere near the caliber of Silence and they all seem to have their tongue in their cheeks with their performances. Hopkins seems to relish the chance to overplay in a big payday for him (the film could happen without Foster but not without him). His character is so much more played for fun than in Silence and this damages the tension, but Hopkins seems to be enjoying himself nonetheless. Moore plays it totally straight and doesn't have much fun ? she is good but she doesn't stand out even if she does replace Foster well. An unrecognisable Oldman also hams it up but keeps his character just this side of silly ?Ivanek supports Oldman well but is obviously eclipsed by the latter's showy role. Giannini is good in his minor role and is lucky to escape the script's excesses; sadly Liotta is not free and his performance towards the end matches the absurdity of the plot in his regard.Overall this is a big fancy horror movie but it is far from the standard of Silence. It lacks real bite (sorry) in terms of tension and excitement and it replaces it with a series of increasingly gory set pieces. If all you want is superficial delivery then this is worth seeing as it is enjoyable as a gory horror but it is no more than that and fans of the mood and atmosphere of Silence Of The Lambs will feel a little cheated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don`t know if it existed in the novel of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS but the impression I got from that film was that Clarice Starling was very uncomfortable in the presence of men . This character trait is totally ignored in HANNIBAL as the film opens with Agent Starling asleep in a police van surrounded with men and as the film continues we see that the Clarice Starling of this version is a strong willed and assertive woman at odds with the timid insecure girl of the 1991 film . I guess some people may say this is character development but I`d call it a lack of internal continiuty and I wasn`t too happy with the way the character was underused either.Julianne Moore made little impression with her portrayal of Starling though that`s through little fault of her own because it`s always the most difficult job of an actor playing a role made famous by someone else , and as I said Starling is sidelined in much of the film . But still I would have liked to have seen Jodie Foster return to the part . As for the other actors Hopkins is competent but by no means spell binding , Liota gives the impression that a robot played his role throughout the film and not just in * THAT * scene , Giancarlo Giannini is good , but Gary Oldman absolutely steals the show as Mason Verger playing the role just the right side of camp complete with some great make up .As for the other aspects of HANNIBAL Ridley Scott directs with an almost operatic touch , and I mean that both figuratively and literally . You really do get the feeling watching this that Scott`s ambition in life is to do a remake of AMADEUS with Hopkins in the role of Atonio Salieri . But the one major flaw with HANNIBAL is the script by Mamet and Zaillian . Again I have little idea of what the novel is like since my entire knowledge of it is confined to what I`ve read about it on this site but a couple of screenwriters with their great track record should be able to produce a satisfying screenplay no matter how poor the source novel . Here they fail , especially with the ending which is riducously over the top . But it was probably a good idea to omit Verger`s lesbian sister as this would have made the film descend into a camp joke</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Downgrade In Quality, Hannibal Is A Bloated Sequel That Revels In Excess Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brimming with meticulously designed set pieces, making terrific use of its exotic locations &amp; capturing each moment in extensive detail yet marred by its fractured narrative, contentious character motivations &amp; more emphasis on violence, this follow-up chapter to the 1991 horror masterpiece is a good-looking but heavily bloated sequel that revels in excess gore but lacks the same level of commitment in storytelling.Set 10 years after the events of The Silence of the Lambs, the story of Hannibal follows its titular character who's now residing in Florence under a disguised identity and has evaded capture all these years. FBI agent Clarice Starling, on the other hand, is having a hard time after she's disgraced for a botched operation. But their paths cross each other once again when Starling is hired by Lecter's only surviving but heavily disfigured victim, Mason Verger.Directed by Ridley Scott (the mind behind Alien, Blade Runner &amp; Gladiator), Hannibal opens on an interesting note but it also feels a whole lot different in tone &amp; feel of its bone-chilling predecessor which is acceptable considering its timeline but the interest soon fizzles out as the plot progresses at a slow rate and whatever unfolds on screen isn't captivating enough. Written by Steven Zaillian, the story spends so much time jumbling its different characters that there is no proper characterisation.The technical aspects in any Ridley Scott film is usually up to the mark and Hannibal is no exception, as evident in its carefully carved set pieces, gorgeous photography and correct use of colour tones &amp; lighting. Editing completely misses the mark here as the slow pace &amp; bloated length only hurts the film. Visual effects team puts in a nice touch, mainly with the violent content, while Hans Zimmer comes up with a score that combines various elements and manages to work only in bits n pieces.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Ray Liotta &amp; others, and their work is all over the place. Hopkins returns as Lecter and does well for the most part but his contribution is inferior to his last effort. Jodie Foster opted out as Clarice Starling so we have the next best thing in Moore who infuses her own ideas into this character which work, Oldman easily digs into the skin of Verger &amp; plays him from inside out while Liotta doesn't get to do much.On an overall scale, Hannibal is a definite step down in quality when compared to The Silence of the Lambs and lacks everything that made it so great. People who like excessive violence &amp; gore are in for a treat and so are the followers of the cannibalistic serial killer but the film just doesn't stick together like its predecessor did, feels much longer than it is &amp; is also boring at times. Definitely not for the squeamish for there's plenty of disturbing content to be found here and also not hurting the legacy of that Jonathan Demme classic, Hannibal is still worth a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best possible sequel, but it serves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some years have passed since the events of The Silence of the Lambs and Dr. Hannibal Lecter has been laying low, hiding from the long arms of the FBI and those that he has hurt in the past. Likewise Clarice Starling, played this time by Julianne Moore, has moved on, but now she has been disgraced by a drug bust gone wrong and thus it is time for these two old enemies to meet once more.Hannibal is a serviceable sequel in the Hannibal Lecter trilogy. They got Anthony Hopkins to reprise his role, which automatically makes the film worth checking out, and it is very interesting to see him on the loose, mixing with the high society, in his natural element so to speak. Lecter is still easily the best thing about these films, and Hopkins's suave menace has not gone down in the slightest.It's a shame they couldn't get Jodie Foster to reprise her role as well, but Julianne Moore is an okay substitute as a leaner and meaner Clarice. Plus, as a compensation gift, we get Gary Oldman as Mason Verger, the only one of Lecter's victims who lived through his ordeals. Very good role for him and he absolutely delivers.What doesn't work so well, unfortunately, is the story. Especially the fact that this time there is no battle of wits, like there was in the original or in the upcoming Red Dragon. Clarice and Hannibal don't face each other nearly as much as they did in The Silence of the Lambs and anyone else in the film is nowhere near their equal. Plus the whole tone of the film is more of an action thriller, which is an ill fit for these characters. It doesn't ruin the film, per se, but it is a problem, at least for me.Still, it's worth checking out if you liked the original, but don't expect it to be as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of talent and film. Thoroughly ruined by Julianne Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cant think of anything good to say about this utterly unbelievable film except of course Anthony Hopkins. Ray Liotta and Gary Oldham's characters are pointless and their immense talents wasted. But the rotten cherry on top was a terribly cast "Clarice" played by Julianne Moore. Her one dimensional, stoic and unlikable "tough guy" personality doomed this film from the beginning. My closest comparison is Patrick Stewart vs William Shatner playing Star Trek's Capt Kirk. Shatner being multi dimensional, likable, smiles, and even occasionally vulnerable and flawed. Stewart being the polar opposite. The plot is stereo-typical Hollywood. Any good film has a very strong "bad" character, force or entity. Despite his atrocities, Lecter's character is still virtuous and charming. Unlike "Silence", which clearly has that hate-able villain "Hannibal" painfully lacks one. 3/10 stars for its lack of direction, meandering and pointless plot and the fore mentioned utter unbelievability. Kudos and integrity points for Jodie Foster walking away from this big paycheck / bloated whale of a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild boars, a man with no face and a nearly superhuman cannibal fugitive... this movie should have been called "Horrible" instead of "Hannibal." Take a perfectly good psychological thriller franchise and run it into the ground dug out by the over-the-counter sensationalized shock-horror motion pictures, and you have Hannibal. This movie uses the same subplots and horrific visuals that Silence of the Lambs used masterfully to convey suspense and horror and instead achieves only cheap gasps and smirks. Startling characters with over-done makeup, dungeon lighting in benign environments, and extravagant mansions and other unbelievable settings place this movie far out of the reach of Silence of the Lambs, a movie that planted a seed of fear in the minds of every viewer and allowed that seed to root and flourish with masterful storytelling, character development, acting and proper use of visuals. The tangible idea of a "serial killer next door" from Silence of the Lambs is completely washed out in Hannibal. If you watch this movie and want to enjoy it, don't compare it to Silence; don't expect a plot that lingers in the depths of your own fears, merely watch it with your brain removed and placed on the seat beside you (spoiler not intended).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misses the point...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMHO, Hannibal the book (it's original title, if you're interested, was "The Morbidity Of The Soul", which I think is much better) was the best book of the series, but this film misses the point completely. Scenes like the brain eating at the end were done in COMPLETELY the wrong way - for shock value - when hello, people, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY. In the book, after the meal Lector scrapes the leftovers from the plates into Paul Krendler's head to "help clear up". Similarly, the death of Pazzi was done in a shock-horror rather than an amusing revenge-thriller type way. In the book, Lector pushes Pazzi off the balcony, then stops and waves to watching tourists. Again I say: IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY.I'd like to reserve particular condemnation for the producer's decisions over Oldman's Mason Verger (Oldman himself is blameless). Verger was always a character that should have been done with CGI and animatronics, not with some half-assed goopy makeup. He doesn't look like someone whose lost their face, he looks like someone who's had seriously amateurish plastic surgery! Also, the casting of Krendler was so off (both from the dictates of the character and the description of him in the book) that I'd like to eat Ridley Scott's brain myself. I doubt there's enough to fill more than a crepe, however. I can understand editing out Margot in a film already this long, but the way they've solved the plot holes her removal leaves is horribly underwhelming.What Ridley obviously didn't get was that the whole point of Hannibal was to concentrate on Hannibal Lector himself (nuh!), and get inside his mind. This could easily have been done - I was very disappointed there were no scenes within Lector's "Dream Palace", given that it was such an easy and obvious visual metaphor. The movie started in the wrong place (with a shoot-out that is of only peripheral relevance to the plot and should have been done in flashback), had it's middle in the wrong place (following Pazzi around was completely pointless as it was obvious even to those who hadn't read the book he wasn't going to capture Lecter), went on too long (with the pointless sequence where Starling follows Lector around the shopping mall, amoungst other things), and ended badly. Aside from obviously redoing the brain eating, the end should have been like the book, with a attempt to resolve Starlings "issues" and a sort of slowdown to a dreamlike pace instead of attempting to provide one last scare (as it actually does). None of this happens in the film, so their relationship remains one of predator vs. prey, and is as interesting as that entails. The last bit with the brain packed lunch is truely rubbish as well.</fullReview>

If you want to see it, wait for the video/DVD, because it's not worth the pretty penny you'll pay to see it. It was a very long story that could have been told in about 20 minutes. Also, if you want to see anything gruesome, you have to wait for the ending of the movie, and if you want to see more gruesome, watch the Silence of the Lambs once again. Hopkins played his role very well once again, and the Jodie Foster look-a-like did a very good Jodie impression, but it just wasn't as gruesome as it was portrayed by the trailer. I can count the killings on my fingers, and for a serial killer, that is a pretty small number.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Lecter : gentleman psychopath ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Manhunter and "Lambs" did make an effort not only to concentrate on the fascination for evil and morbidity and really tried to construct an investigation, a plot, something of a certain solidity. Its successor (and last episode of the Hannibal series in chronological order) is nothing but a work of blood. Moreover, even if fascination does work on me, I cannot grant an ounce of realism to the Hannibal character. Forgive this incongruous comparison : Batman is able to do justice because he's neurotic, traumatized by the murder of his parents ans wealthy enough to develop his arsenal on his war on crime ; I could believe in Batman in reality. In Lecter, I cannot. In the pictures, he shows a high sense of refinery in the arts, music and paintings ; he despises those he considers vulgar and low. Yet, the persona of Clarice Starling did manage to reveal his sociable side ; ambiguous love story ? I don't think that even Thomas Harris knows himself. Harris just made an important effort in creating a paradoxical man/monster. What puzzles us is that he's cultivated and capable of the most atrocious crimes of flesh at the same time ; in brief, he's not like the real life serial killers. Is he really a serial killer by the way ? What motivates his murders ? His personal freedom when he butchers those who hold him prisoner, but the others ? On what bases does he kill ? Despise for rudeness ? Bordedom generated by the petty tales his patients tell him ? Simply a hobby ? Even the story of his childhood remains superficial in answer to these mysteries. Hannibal Lecter is just a romanesque serial killer, exactly as James Bond is an idealized secret agent capable of speaking several languages and of many other things. This absence of credibility really makes it impossible for me to enjoy this film. Norman Bates or Leatheface are far from exaggerated, next to him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal (2001): Dir: Ridley Scott / Cast: Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta, Gary Oldman: Barf bag film that begins with a pointless scenes that has nothing to do with the rest of the film. Clarice is demoted to a desk job until she is contacted by Mason Verger. He is in a wheelchair and has no skin on his face. He plans to feed Hannibal Lector to wild boars and assigns Clarice to track him down. Many predictable developments follow including a brainless investigator who is murdered because common sense eludes him. Ridley Scott is a superb director as proved with Alien and Blade Runner but this hardly measures up to those successes. Anthony Hopkins demonstrated great skill as Hannibal in The Silence of the Lambs but here he is reduced as a slasher film monster. Julianne Moore hardly replaces Jodie Foster as Clarice because she renders the character unlikable. Ray Liotta plays Clarice's partner whose function is to argue. Gary Oldman as Verger is a role introduced as a child molester whom Lector took on as a client in therapy. That is where his condition began, and making him a child molester only excuses the screenwriter to permit Lector to commit an applauded murder, which works against it. Giancarlo Giannini plays the air head inspector whose head is so empty that it must have left Hannibal greatly disappointed when examining it. Pointless puke gross mess that should be tossed to wild boars. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The problem was be a sequel of a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that talks mostly about Hannibal, of what he is, how he acts, what he feels. From this point of view, this is a nice movie. At last we can see Hannibal in the real world, free to act as a fugitive might be free. We can see his mastery and genius. There's the whole emotional component about Hannibal's relationships with others, with the people he meets. It's an extremely complex character and a very charming one. It's one of that villains that terrify you because they're so attractive. He is so fascinating and clever that he is able to attract the sympathies of all even if his manners leave a slight sensation of dangerousness and mystery. It's the kind of man I could fall in love with just to ending with him eating my tongue. Anthony Hopkins did a great job with Hannibal in all the movies he plays as him. His face, his piercing gaze and all his charme are reflected in the character. There are some moments in the movie where Hannibal is very frightening because of his magnificent interpretation. His icy calm and the little smile when he attacks someone, not a smile of a mad man but something like true satisfaction and happiness. It's a character that makes you cheer for him. For me was like that. I was on his side from the beginning. And I know I'm not the only one, like I'm not the only one who wanted to see a deeper relationship between Starling and Hannibal. I found myself wanting morbidly to see the two of them together, something that would be insane at least, but I could not help it. If you've read the book, you know what I'm talking about.The biggest difference, for me, between this movie and his predecessor, not counting the absence of Jodie Foster, was the different kind of tension it has created. This, in my opinion, is the main reason why people didn't like this like The Silence of the Lambs. In the first movie the tension was completely a psychological matter. The feelings were created by the obscure nature of the movie, from the dark spaces and silent and from whispered words. From the ambiguity in the relationship between Starling and Lecter, from the great emotion that was created when the two characters were on the screen together. There was not a big action component in the movie. It was all darkness and psychological tension. In this movie they tried to add an action component that, unfortunately, went to defuse psychological tension. And another fundamental thing that is missing is the ambiguity in the relationship Starling/Hannibal. In the first movie, the two of them got closer each other in some way and, they had a mental contact in a certain sense, a strange sort of affection. I don't know how to describe it, but you could feel it while watching the movie. In this movie this thing is missed at all. He tries to get closer in some way, but she is a wall. You can say that this is because of her experience, and her new maturity and this can justify all the matter objectively, but not emotionally for the audience, o for a part of them. I'm not saying that I wanted a true sentimental relationship between the two of them, and I think that no one wanted to see in openly. The great thing, the perfection of their relationship was actually in its ambiguity that had left space to the audiences fantasies without forcing in any direction but leaving the possibility of imagining. In the first movie this balance was perfect, on the contrary in this one all was lost due to her coldness, which has left many viewers dissatisfied. And then came the end. Create a great end, I think, was not the most simple thing to do. They've decided to put a wall between Starling and Hannibal, so, the kind of final they did was the only possible. Having Hannibal taking another decision would ruin the idea (I) we had of him. But it still leaves unsatisfied. I have to say that, if they had taken other choices, finish the movie like the book would have been dangerous, always for the matter of ambiguity. When I was reading the book, I've desired an end similar to the one that indeed was, but was the very fact of desiring it to make it special. In fact, when then the end arrived, I realized that I didn't want it to end like that.Now, despite all the paragons between the two movies, in this one there was the right balance of action and dialog and the tension never goes really down. There was some moment when I came up with exclamations like "HOAA!!!". For instance, when Starling received the letter, or when she called Pazzi and find Lecter answering the phone. Or when Hannibal met Pazzi and his wife after the play. In that moment something came to me, a feeling. Because of this I can't reject this movie, because i make me feel something, and, at the end, I think this is the purpose of a movie, or anyway, this is the reason why I watch a movie. I also enjoyed so much the flashback sequence about what happened to Mason. I love the way the scene was shoot and the colours. It was very creepy. I was also pleased of the interpretation of the italians actors, in particular about Giancarlo Giannini, an actor I always loved.So, the movie was well structured and enjoyable if you think at it like a single movie. The problem was that you could not do that because this WAS a sequel and was inevitable a paragon with the first one. He missed Jodie so much and missed the relationship between the character even more. He suffers his condition of a sequel of a movie that made history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I quite liked the Silent of the lambs and I really liked the Red Dragon. Naturally, I was hoping this to be good, but I was truly disappointed.Most of the cast is doing good job, the movie looks and sounds good, and the story is quite good. The main problem is that the script is awful. The movie is full of plot holes and it is really hard to believe the story because of the constant stupidity and unrealism. There is some excitement built in many scenes but it is killed almost instantly because of something ridiculous. There is the same dark atmosphere and tension as in the Silent of the lambs, but it just doesn't hold up. It seems that the whole movie was designed to have few nice scenes, but the writers/director didn't have any idea how to tie them up. The movie jumps from one situation to another without fully ending each situation.The intelligent and morbid Hannibal from the other movies is replaced with a lucky snob with so many talents that makes Superman look like an invalid. Hannibal is just going around without any problems although he is been chased by the FBI, local police and some bounty hunters. It is just ludicrous what he can do without getting caught! He could like walk right into the White House and take a nap at the oval office while the president is having a meeting there. There are no intelligent schemes behind anything he does. Hannibal just does what ever he wants and always happens to be in the right place at the right time. The whole thing is like watching the three stooges trying to capture oiled superman in a serious and grim movie.The movie isn't boring in traditional sense. There's a lot going on, but since there is no interest in what ever happens, it gets dull to watch very fast. For a movie lasting over two hours it's not a good feature. Overall, this could have been a great movie, but the constant surreal stupidity destroys the whole potential of this rubbish movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needs more Mamet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott directs "Hanniball", a film with at least three sections. The first involves FBI agent Clarice Starling's (Julianne Moore) hunt for the monstrous super-villain, Hannibal Lecter. She battles corrupt and sexist FBI agents and cold, hard bureaucracy. This portion of the film is absolute crap, heavy handed and poorly written.The film's second section takes place in Florence, Italy, and involves Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi's (played by the great Giancarlo Giannini) investigation into the disappearance of a library curator, whose job Hannibal Lecter inherited. This portion of the film is strong and deserves to be made into its own film. A noirish tragedy about ego, pride and greed, this section has Pazzi trying to apprehend Lecter all on his own, desperate to win the 3 million dollar bounty on Lecter's head.The third section of the film stars Gary Oldman, a wealthy man who survived one of Lecter's attacks (he's horribly disfigured) and has dedicated his life to capturing and torturing Lecter. Like the curator's of the second act, Oldman is obsessed with collecting monstrosities. Again, this portion of the film is ridiculous, absurd and poorly written.If "Hannibal" doesn't work, it's nevertheless another interesting experiment by screenwriter David Mamet. All Mamet's scripts are highly self-reflexive con-games. Here we seem to have a film about intelligent, cultured taste, or rather fine art. In this regard, the Italian section of the film is explicitly about "curating" or "safe keeping" fine art, in this case linked with European cinema. In contrast, the first section is typical commercial, sexist, Hollywood action fare, which juxtaposes nicely with the exquisiteness of Italy and the gory B-movie horror section in which Gary Oldman resides. The film then ends with a wonderfully demented, beauty-and-the-beast climax, our monster mutilating himself to preserve the Starling's beauty.6.9/10 ? Terrible, but there's a great short film in here. Call it Rinaldo Pazzi vs Hannibal Lecter and stick it on a DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wrote about HANNIBAL when it first hit TV, but having just seen it again, I figured it's worth a second visit. This time around, Hannibal Lecter (a sadly aging Tony Hopkins) is being pursued by a victim who survived Lecter's loving ministrations but is badly disfigured (an unrecognizable Gary Oldman in a flamboyant role that does not do him justice). FBI agent Clarice Starling (a miscast Julianna Moore) is in serious trouble over a bad shootout, and is being hounded by a lecherous Feeb named Krendler (Ray Liotta, also oddly miscast). An Italian detective (the wonderful if very old Giancarlo Gianini) is hot on Lecter's trail. The action swings from Italy to America. The book was a hastily written disgrace, for which I have never forgiven the author. The movie is a loose adaptation of the novel and is maybe a notch above the book in quality. What director Ridley Scott is good for is creating atmosphere. The movie is a bit slow-moving but this actually plays in its favor. Lots of shadows and eerie lighting and odd angles abound. The violence and gore are extreme for a non-horror flick, although maybe we should view this Hannibal as just a nattily attired and coiffed Jason Vorhees or Michael Myers. He kills folks brutally and nastily. Highlights, for those so inclined, include brain-eating and a close encounter with a pack of 500-lb., long-tusked, man-eating hogs. Gorehounds may feast. All others beware. This is not SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and Jodie Foster is sorely missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many deviations from the original source material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****SPOILERS FOR THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE!!!****** I just finished the books, after seeing both Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal in movie form beforehand. I've mentioned this in some of my other reviews beforehand, but let me say it again: I HATE movies that deviate from the original source material! I'm tired of seeing it ALL the TIME, and it's quite nearly reached the point where if Hollywood refuses to do justice to the books they're adapting, then I'll no longer see adapted movies.All right, on to the movie. Anthony Hopkins does an incredible job as Dr. Hannibal Lector again, with only a handful of changes I could have suggested. As does Gary Oldman, playing Mason Verger - what a pleasant surprise! We got a new actress playing Clarice Starling, since Jodie Foster is...well, if you've read up about this movie in the message boards, she refused to play in Hannibal because she didn't like the ending. How terribly arrogant. Luckily, however, we got a competent actress as a replacement.The movie admittedly did drag in a few places, but overall was pretty good until it hit the part where Hannibal escapes from Mason Verger's barn with Clarice. Right there is when the movie begins to deviate from the book ending, and it begins to slide downward into mediocrity. Let me count the ways: - Hannibal's psychological manipulations of Clarice are cut.- It was immediately apparent that Clarice was turned into some flighty creature while at the dinner table, as opposed to the utter poise and self-confidence she displayed in the book.- In the book, she ENJOYED eating Krender's brain. In the movie, she fell from the table in drugged horror, which begun the whole bit where she tried to catch Hannibal but he ended cutting off his own hand to escape her handcuffs instead.So basically, by deviating from the book, the ending was turned into easily-forgettable, typical Hollywood fodder. This movie could have positive *shone*, becoming a controversial movie for the ages along with its predecessor, Silence of the Lambs. Instead, it attains a relatively low rating on this site, all because of arrogance and cowardice.I gave this movie 5 stars for the excellent performances of Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman (Along with an honorable mention for Julianne Moore). Also, the movie was pretty good right up until it hit the halfway point, so perhaps it could be viewed as half the number of stars for half a good movie.</fullReview>

Nevermind that the movie featured Julliane Moore for the part of Clarice, thereby replacing the incomparable Jody Foster, but is anybody else as perturbed as I am that a lunatic cannibal is on the loose? This movie was a bit romanticized by having Hannibal come back to America, where he is a wanted felon, to come to the aide of Clarice. I was somewhat excited to see that he had been captured and was probably going to suffer severely for his crimes, but that excitement quickly turned to disappointment and disgust when the heroine came to his rescue (albeit it was for his arrest). Hannibal is a social misfit and a perverse killer worthy of the most horrific punishment, yet he is able to slip away time and time again. I would have been much more delighted if this movie ended with his capture and, preferably, his punishment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Film Not as good as the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finished Hannibal the Novel a little while ago and it was a pretty good read although not as good as Red Dragon or The Silence of the Lambs.So this came on TV last night and I decided to watch it to see if Ridley Scott had done a reasonable job with the source material. I have to say that this film was very slowly paced and lacked the excitement and suspense of both Hannibal the novel and the previous films -Manhunter and The Silence of the Lambs.For me the best part of the novel was the part in Florence when Pazzi had to get Hannibal's fingerprint using the Romanian Gypsy's. This part was cut down heavily in the film.Also Mason Verger's sister Margot was a major character in the Novel and she was completely left out.I thought that the ending was badly altered, the ending in the novel was far more satisfying and made much more sense. If you have yet to read the novel,I would recommend it, it's a lot better.This film felt very rushed, I think it could have been better planned. Perhaps they where under pressure to get the movie made quickly.I believe it performed even better than The Silence of the Lambs at the box office but then it was bound to after the long wait and expectation. It's a pity, a missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute disappointment for Thomas Harris-fans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Thomas Harris,I read all his novels at least 5 times and Hannibal's the book I really love the most.Therefore the movie was my biggest disappointment and I really don't get it why some folks here give it a nine or even a ten.Either their demands are very low or they haven't read the book or both.Even if I hadn't read the book I'd still consider the movie as absolute average and I'd give it a five. The creepy,mysterious atmosphere from the novel doesn't appear one single time in the movie,when I saw it first in the cinema I even fell asleep.Why was Margot Verger, a very important character, totally omitted? Why was Barney shown as a dumb ignorant whose only ambition is to earn money? And most of all, why was the psychological process Starling went through in the end,caused by the drugs Lecter applied to her,descended? Not to speak about the fact that the ending was omitted,too,and totally changed? Well, the reasons why Jodie Foster refused to play Starling again are well known and I accepted it,although like surely many others I'm very disappointed 'cause I identified Starling with her.For stories like Red Dragon,The silence of the lambs or Hannibal that possess such psychological depth, it is very important to identify with a character when they're adapted for the screen,but as the Germans say, that's "snow of yesterday". Ridley Scott did some incredibly good movies but with this one he doesn't live up to his name. Jonathan Demme had exactly the right feeling for the plot, the characters and their relationships towards each other in The silence of the lambs, he should have done Hannibal,too.My only comfort is that I've seen the movie only two times,it's long ago and thank god for that reason I'm able not to see the scenes from the movie when I read the novel. I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why "Silence of the Lambs" was a better movie:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just read the long comment that shows on the main 'Hannibal' page, written by an Australian that liked 'Hannibal' better than 'Silence'. While his comment was well written, I couldn't disagree with him more. I have read all of Thomas Harris' books, most of them at least twice, and really love his writing style and the characters he brings to life in the 'Lecter' books. There is no doubt whatsoever that 'Silence' was a better adaptation; it is scene by scene the same as the book. From the actors portrayal of the characters down to the dialogue, it's almost identical. It even won the Oscar for best screenplay adaption. 'Hannibal' on the other hand, is an atrocity as a movie. From the downgrade to Julianne Moore as Starling, to the blatant changes and omissions to the story, it's a sad thing that the beautiful movie hidden inside this book was never discovered by Ridley Scott and crew. Even Gary Oldman couldn't save this one. I'll spare the details of the numerous errors in judgement of whoever "adapted" this book, and convey my frustration with just one example: Verger's muscle-bound lesbian sister doesn't even exist in the movie!!! She was a major player in the story, from an awkward sexual scene with Barney to the fact that SHE KILLED VERGER... and to just omit her character completely? I won't even start on the butchered ending. That's Hollywood I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this Hannibal?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the silence of the lambs we meet Hannibal, a very charming and rather demure man, a man of obvious class, good breeding, and good...taste.He is very polite and as Clarice exclaims at one point he would think attacking her to be "rude", characteristics of a mindless killer?, I think not.In Hannibal we see a new lector, a brutish, rather beast like man with no qualms about who he kills or why, he simply kills to kill, unprovoked, unlike in SOTL when he kills the guards that were so rude to him, and it is implied that he kills doctor Chilton, a man who treated lector like a child, or a dog, which is in itself a provocation, think about it, would you let someone talk down to you on a 24 hour basis making your life a living hell and not act?, I'm guessing not.I want the old lector back, not this mindless killer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains spoilers While not as good as the first, Hannibal was definitely a very interesting movie. It was very well shot and contained many interesting subplots. The film doesnt suffer much from the lack of Jodie Foster as Julianne Moore does a good job as portraying Clarice Starling 10 years later. While the film has its share of creepy and definitely memorable moments, it unfortunately may be remembered more for its outrageous and sometimes disgusting gore than anything. Guttings, a person tearing their own face off, throat slashings, ravenous pigs, and even a person's brain being eaten are some of the highlights of this movie. I think this film has been unfairly panned by many people. Its major downfall is how people compare it to Silence of the Lambs rather than on its own as an individual movie. I'd give this movie 7.5 out of 10, worth seeing for fans of the original, anyone who likes horror movies, or anyone else who is curious or wants to see this movie. However this is NOT for people who cant tolerate gore or nasty stuff</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tacky in it's best moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 3.4 (out of 10)Director Ridley Scott and screenwriter David Mamet apparently want 'Hannibal' to be the artistic horror thriller. With that kind of talent behind it, it's amazing how little substance comes out of this lengthy bore. However, they do spill a lot of blood and guts against exotic locals and an often beautiful atmosphere. The premise is a promising and frightening one. Hannibal Lecter, having escaped at the end of Silence of the Lambs is now the proverbial genie out of the bottle. He walks openly among high society and tortures those that cross his path with charm and finesse. Because author Thomas Harris knows that the public can't get enough of the charisma of this cannibalistic serial killer he switches roles on us. This time it's Hannibal hunted by his only survivor - a disfigured character just one of the many macabre oddities the movie has cooked up. Others involve pigs and the much talked about frying pan scene. The latter of which, revolving around Ray Liotta's crooked cop, is eye-popping in the simple shock of seeing how far the movie is willing to go. It's creepy, it's gruesome, it's sadistic, it's tacky but I have to say I've never seen anything like it on film before. Which is always good. However, beyond that one scene, the creative look of new villain and the terrific performance of Anthony Hopkins (in a role he should have down pat anyway) - the movie is 2 hours of filler. It relies on shock value that is completely lacking in suspense or tension. It focuses on Hannibal's soft spot for Clarice Starling, but is remarkably hollow. ?Hannibal' lurches around with Mamet's dry script hinting here and there that something is about to happen that it never delivers. Julianne Moore's take on Clarice is also surprisingly thin. Moore is one of the finest character actresses in the business today including movies like 'The Big Lebowski' and 'Cookie?s Fortune'. Here she sleepwalks, giving a performance out of a B-grade slasher flick. Instead of being the be-all and end-all of our Hannibal Lecter saga the movie feels like the 2nd act of a larger story with an ending that leaves it open for a 4th trip to the well. Ok, I know there isn't a lot of detail to this review. Probably not a lot to get out of it other then a few buzz-phrases and my general tone of boredom and disappointment without any real purpose - but that's how the movie itself is. It doesn't give me a lot to work with. All atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well it was pretty gory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part I didn't really like this movie. I just went for the heck of it, cause I didn't care for Silence all that much either. This one has Lector being pursued by Julianne Moore in the role done by Jodie Foster in Lambs. A previous victim out for revenge against Lector is also pursuing him. Hopkins is rather good in the role, but all in all I just didn't enjoy the plot all that much. The best part about this movie was the gore. For an R movie this one was rather gory, but I am guessing since the director made the Oscar movie Gladiator just the previous summer and it had Sir Anthony Hopkins in it the ratings board my have let quite a bit slide. It is no secret the ratings board plays favorites, heck I think if Spider-man was pg-13, Star Wars should have been too. Lucas though has some influence. All in all a gory movie, but I expect more from a big budget Hollywood movie besides gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-filmed geek show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible spoilers. This is a very disturbing movie that goes absolutely nowhere, adds nothing to the characters of Clarice Starling or Hannibal Lecter, features some terrible dialogue, and ends with a cruel joke that makes Hannibal considerably less likeable rather than a clever twist that makes him more appealing, as in the final scenes of The Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. The film essentially follows two separate storylines, one involving an Italian detective in Florence trying to catch Hannibal for a reward, and the other involving Clarice (now played by Julianne Moore in a low-point of an otherwise amazing career) and her personal journey to catch her old friend/foe. I found the scenes in Florence fascinating; Giancarlo Giannini is great as the aforementioned detective, and I genuinely felt for him as he misguidedly attempts to take on an unstoppable killer against his own (and Clarice's) better judgment. Also, Ridley Scott again achieves an amazing look for the film through timing the color a little off and interesting choices with cinematography, as he did in Gladiator and Black Hawk Down. His Florence is a gloomy, tragic playground for Hannibal, who makes the most of his freedom in a very tasteful city. Like in Gladiator and Black Hawk Down, however, Scott loses all sense of substance or suspense in favor of style. Gladiator worked as a mindless action film and Black Hawk Down as an utterly engrossing visceral battle experience, but Hannibal is not scary or suspenseful, which it probably should be. Instead of crafting actual suspense by hiding the gore as Jonathan Demme did in Silence and Brett Ratner did in Red Dragon, Scott throws effect out the window and underlines the gore. I'm sure at least one scene in this film will become the stuff of legend, and I had heard about it well before I actually saw the film. But the scene is effective only because it is disgusting, and for no other reason than that. As in his earlier (and best) work such as Alien and Blade Runner, Scott works best with grand operatic settings, such as the extraordinary sequences in Florence. But once he enters smaller spaces, such as FBI offices, train stations, and dining rooms, this film falls apart. Mamet's script doesn't help much either; the scene where Ray Liotta talks about why he thinks Hannibal is a "queer" is completely gratuituous and mindless, trying to force us to dislike this guy in order to justify the ending. Hopkins is great as usual, and fans of the Hannibal Lecter character will certainly get a cheap thrill out of seeing him on the loose. But the film is ultimately a failure, especially when you consider the deft use of Hannibal in the far superior Red Dragon which came out a year and a half later. The director of Alien and Blade Runner overshadowed by the director of The Family Man and Rush Hour? Ouch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After ten years this is the best they could do!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** *Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * good * * * * * Brilliant WARNING *SPOILERS* After ten years and a good deal of hype the long awaited follow up to Director Jonathan Demmes oscar winning psychological thriller 'The Silence of the Lambs' hit cinemas across the world. This time around however the project would be helmed by british director Ridley Scott.Best known for his strong visuals in such movies as Alien, Bladerunner and Gladiator one would have wondered how he could go wrong. The story it self was quite simple and would not need a director more capable of telling a more substantial story.The story involves FBI agent Clarice Starlings (Now played by the more glamorous Julianne Moore after Jodie Foster passed on reprising the roll) quest to hunt down the psychotic Dr.Hannibal Lectre who had escaped police custody in prequel some nine years earlier. He is now living under an assumed identity in Florence, Italy. She however is not the only person out to find Lectre.Evil millionaire Mason Verger(Wonderfully played by british actor Gary Oldman), a former patient and victim of Lectre's want's revenge for what was done to him. A child molester, Verger mutilated his own face when Lectre made him take an illegal substance.He then went on to feed the remains of his face to his dogs.This act left Verger on a respirator.Verger plots to have Lectre captured and then fed to a pack of hungry hogs.What revenge could be any better than that for a cannibal.Sadly Vergers plan of revenge is better than what can said for the film. The film also deals with Lectre's obsession for Starling and his attempts to get in touch with her while she at the same time is trying to track him down.This all ofcourse culminates in the film's unsatisfactory climax.The result of changing the ending from what it was in the book.That ending saw Starling being brainwashed by Lectre and becoming his lover.It's little wonder fans of the original novel were not pleased with.It is after all hard to swallow(forgivr the pun) that Starling would allow her self to be manipulated into becoming Lectre's lover.Not only that but a cannibal to boot. Up till the film's climax it is a slow turgid movie that unashamedly turns Lectre into a anti-hero rather than the full blown evil psychotic genius that he really is.He only kills when threatened.Like in the scene where he disembowls an italian policeman above the streets of Florence.The poor cop was attempting to shop Lectre to the american authorities in exchange for the reward money for his capture.Lectre even tells the officer that he won't be paying a visit on the tragic mans wife.Makes you think he can't be all bad, does it? The film does have the odd redeeming qualities.The performances in general are fine.Anthony Hopkins ironically improves on his performance this time around.He's less deadpan and strives to down play the roll of Lectre.The roll this time is more demanding after all and does not see Lectre confined to a cell for the most part of the movie.The sad thing is we never get to see what happened in Lectre's past which made him the monster that he is.Lectre's past was after all coverd in the novel. Anyway, as for Julianne Moore, she does a fine job as Clarice Starling.She on the other hand is not a patch on her predecessor Jodie Foster.As good an actress Moore is she can do nothing to erase foster's well deserved oscar winning performance from our heads.Moore is also too glamorous and attractive to be the 'pure white trash' that Lectre described in the prequel. There is great support as well from Gary Oldman who spends virtually the whole film under layers of make up.He clearly seems to be enjoying himself in the role of the sick degenerate baying for Lectre's blood.It's hard for me to believe that he is not a bigger star than he is.Not only that but he crimminally has never been nominated for an oscar. Ray Liotta is also on hand to lend sold support as well.He portrays the crooked FBI man who unknown to Starling is aiding Verger in his hunt for Lectre.Liotta, a great supporting actor is great as he usually is and is at his slimey best. Scotts direction too desrves high marks.It cannot really be blamed for the faults that centre mainly on the lacklustre script.Scott does everything to use the italian settings of Florence to his advantage.It can truly be said that Scott has a great eye for visual detail.You only need look at his previous films to notice that. Sadly the film lacks any real pace or tension and we never really care about what will become of Starling or Lectre.The film actually could border on offensive as it seems to glorify what Lectre is.I did get the impression at times that we were suppoised to be rooting for him.paticularly in the scenes whre Lectre has been captured by Verger's men and is tied to a cross to await his fate.After all, Lectre did nothing but give Verger what he deseved. In the end Hannibal is not the promising sequel it could of been.If there's anything that makes it worth watching is the films denoument.This contains one of the most jaw dropping scenes in film history and actually had me laughing.It was worth seeing in my local multiplex just to hear the reactions from the rest of the horrified audience. If you have not seen any of the Lectre movies then I would not recommend this.If you wan't to see a good Lectre film then watch either Michael Mann's prequel to 'The Silence of the Lambs' Manhunter with Brian Cox portraying the good doctor or it's 1991 follow up.In my opinion they are far better film's.Robs Rating:* * (Below Par)</fullReview>

What is left is Dr Lecter turned into a scary ghoul who makes the audience titter in nervous appreciation/anticipation, gore to mask the lack of content, and longuers and confusion in place of narrative cohesion.The novel reads like it was written to be made into a movie. But it does not translate. Without the explanations of the novel, the issue of pigs from Sardinia et al appears ludicrous and contrived. It assumes you have read the novel.If you want a gore fest then it serves it up well enough, but it has too many holes in the plot (how did Lecter get in and out of the USA?) and belies belief and reality so that anyone looking for the intellectual challenge and stimulation of Silence is left sorely disaffected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What a disappointment!" This was the phrase uttered by my companion the second the end credits for "Hannibal" began to roll. It was disappointing, watching "Hannibal" is like seeing a reunion tour of your favorite band and realizing that they have not aged well. (this metaphor uses "The Silence of the Lambs" as the original band than "Manhunter," the first Lector movie,)In keeping with this comparison Julianne Moore would be the new guy in the band that cannot hold a candle to the member that she replaced. Jodi Foster's Agent Starling emotionally vulnerable, smart, and vivacious; Moore is an ice queen, an android programmed to act, that seems to be going through the motions. Not only that but the character is less interesting in "Hannibal" Starling plays the victim at every turn, even the old "turn in your badge" routine followed by setting out after the crook on your own plot devise is used here.Lector is just as interesting but less likable than he was in "Lambs." In "Lambs" he was a James Bond villain (charming, intelligent, hyper-civilized, with an insatiable bloodlust) but in "Lambs" he could only charm, insult and escape. Now that he is free he is the same character but one that is capable of acting out all the evil he wishes. Now rather than charming the audience he is repulsive to them, repulsive to all but the most sadistic audience members, the type that would enjoy a snuff video in their private moments. Hopkins, who is mesmerizing in almost everything he does, seems to be doing an impression of his performance in "Lambs" rather than embodying Lector as he had.Director Ridley Scott's films lack any semblance of emotional warmth, they also have an "anything worth doing is worth over doing" philosophy about them. The former quality keeps his films from being truly great (exception "Alien") but the latter has managed to if nothing else keep his work from being boring. This film is no exception. The build ups are well done but the payoffs are irresolute; they are too gruesome to be taken seriously and are too explicit in their depiction of human suffering to be viewed as black comedy. One can either blame Scott for ruining a macabre masterpiece or thank him for giving this mess a reason to be watched. I'll do the latter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The serial killer is a rather predictable figure. Reliable psychological profiles have repeatedly pointed the way to pathetic, inadequate individuals who can never hope to recover any semblance of self esteem, instead turning their self-hatred upon society. Not so the eponymous anti-hero of Ridley Scott's Hannibal. This wise-cracking rogue is never short of a Bond-style quip as he dispatches his victims, justifying his own actions by claiming he prefers to eat the rude, whereever possible. And despite being on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list, he is somewhat casual about avoiding detection, his only concession being a wide-brimmed hat and the habit of wiping his glass in restaurants so as not to leave any prints.10 years have passed since Lecter escaped, and the young, dour, ultra-professional yet utterly lifeless Special Agent Clarice Starling is now an older, dour, ultra-professional yet utterly lifeless Special Agent. Where once it was possible to understand her severe countenance in the context of youth and eagerness to succeed in a male-dominated environment, it is now clear that Starling really was just a mopey old cow after all. With no friends in the FBI or any apparent social life outside of the office, it really isn't difficult to understand why Clarice's exasperated colleagues make her take the fall for a failed drug bust, relegating her to the decade-old Lecter case in a bid to keep her in the basement and off the streets.Meanwhile, an Italian detective is on Lecter's case. He has rumbled the true identity of Florentine museum curator Dr Fell, and wants to claim the $3,000,000 reward on the sly in a bid to keep his beautiful young wife in clover. He puts the private citizen offering the reward on Lecter's trail at about the same time the FBI uncover his whereabouts, and er...that's it. After taking up an hour or so of screen time, this sub-plot reaches a dead-end, having literally nothing to do with the remaining aspects of the story.So we catch up with the figure offering the cash........surviving Lecter victim Mason Verger, the grossly disfigured and wheelchair bound successor to a large family fortune, who is planning to feed Lecter to a pen-full of man-eating pigs. Starling steps into the fray, and we head towards a repugnant climax in which one of Starling's FBI enemies gets his come-uppance.By this stage, however, you'll be hard-pushed to care what happens to anyone in the story. The film is a big, gory mess, which Scott's elegant direction and Julianne Moore's feisty Jodie Foster impression can do nothing to rescue. As for Hopkin's depiction of Lecter.....whatever happened to the sinister, terrifying figure of Silence of the Lambs? He has morphed into the same character Hopkins played in a dozen other films...the urbane, refined man of a certain age, albeit one who has an unusual recipe for pan-fried liver.Never mind where Lecter is pitching up next.....if they go ahead with plans to make another sequel, I'm leaving the country.</fullReview>

Whereas Silence of the Lambs was suspenseful as it was terrifying, there is no real suspense in Hannibal, just increasingly bloody scenes that seem to be there to top the last bloody scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the worst 'credible' movies I have ever seen. The plot was way too slow, and the acting was horrible. Shame on Anthony Hopkins for allowing himself to be part of such a piece of garbage. What worked about Silence of the Lambs was the viewer's wish for Jodie Foster to catch Buffalo Bill. In this one, I didn't like any of the characters and wanted to see EVERYONE (except maybe Agent Starling--who I wished would just go home) eaten by the pigs. It lacked the psychological dialog between Hannibal and Clarice that was so vital to Silence of the Lambs. The only point of Hannibal was that he's a sophisticated person who also likes to kill people. There were no surprises, no chills, no screams, and no excitement. Boring and stupid was all this movie was about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sequel is not a patch on Silence of the Lambs. The plot meanders along without really building up much tension and as a viewer I felt totally ambivalent about what happened to Lecter or Starling - I didn't care about either of them. What a wise choice Jodie Foster made to not be involved in this one. It could have been much better if it had a decent storyline instead of 3 sub-plots masquerading as one!!! The ending is also predictably unsatisfying. All in all not worth watching except for Ray Liotta eating his own brain - I suppose that at least in terms of gore this was a memorable scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anthony Hopkins, Ray Liotta, Gary Oldman and Julianne Moore are four of my favorite actors. But even they could not save this movie from itself."Silence of the Lambs" was a great psychological thriller, exploring the developing relationship between a brilliant (but imprisoned) serial killer and a young FBI agent. Yes, it had its gory moments but they served their purpose. "Hannibal" is nothing but a gore-fest...the film makers seemed hellbent on grossing out the audience more and more with each scene. By the end, I was almost sick to my stomach (and I've seen some gory movies).The characters are severely underdeveloped and flat. Ray Liotta's character is 100% jerk, Gary Oldman's character (a survivor of a Lechter attack) is a nothing but a disfigured, vengeful rich guy who's very hard to feel sorry for. Even Clarice Starling herself is robot-like...she doesn't show the abject fear we saw in "Silence." Maybe it's just because she's a hardened FBI agent now, but it's never really explained.Skip this stomach-churning piece of junk and read the book instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal, fails in comparison to Silence of the Lambs.The story picks up seven years after the first film. The notorious Dr Lecter is still on the lam while a disgraced Clarice Starling is still haunted by her experiences with the cannibalistic psychiatrist.A new character is introduced in this entry - Mason Verger is the only surviving victim of Lecter. Mutilated,crippled and unbelievably rich, he hunts Lecter down, relishing the day when he will have his revenge.This rundown is undoubtedly promising and make no mistake it could have been a great film, certainly on par with 'lambs', but the way the director literalises Thomas Harris' fourth novel is dreadfully unimaginative and utterly repellent.Gone is the distinctive black humour of Harris' characters, Hopkins' as Hannibal blurts out the cannibal puns with such a wearisome monotony that it wears out its welcome soon after he first appears. Verger was a complex and serpentine character with an implicit attraction to his lesbian sister (she is cut out of the film) in the book, in the film he is a one dimensional villain, devoid of any flesh - both literally and metaphorically. Gary Oldman does well with what he is handed. Moore stepping into the shoes immortalised by Jodie Foster is dealt the worst blow. She is an incredible performer and the character of Clarice needed to go through a catharsis of sorts, im not opposed to a new actress in the role - she is just given nothing to do but run around and look erotic but hardened at the same time.The main quibble that I had with Hannibal was nothing to do with the performers or the fact that the first film was going to be difficult to live up to it is the sledgehammer mentality with which director Ridley Scott enacts the story. This is the man sci-fi buffs hail as the master after 'Alien'. In this film he relied on darkness, spiralling corridors and the infinity of space to act as a method of scaring the audience. Maybe he doesnt have the same items to work with, but surely he could assert some subtlety.I have no problem with violence but he seemed to go on and on with it, the more garrish and horrifying the more he wallowed in it. This was an inane move and ultimately it softened the impact.Hannibal is a different film lets get that straight, Jonathon Demme showed restraint in the first film, choosing to minimalise the violence somewhat. I see absolutely no reason why Scott had to go back and retread certain scenes in the first film that Demme chose to leave to our imaginations. Not only does it demonstrate his utter lack of vision, but it appropriates the enduring image of 'Lambs'. This treads the fine line between art and plain vandalism.The beauty of 'Lambs' was the ambiguity in the relationship between the two principles. I see no reason why it has to be so defined in this film, although it is worse in the book. In any case it serves as yet another shock tactic that fails miserably.Overall the film has definite moments, but rather than the scenes of sheer overkill, I will remember Hannibal as the film that could have been but never was!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay--let's just forget about SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.This movie was never going to come close. It wasn't designed for that. It was meant to cash in and make the suits who put in their money rich--period.Hopefully in the process it would entertain the audience but really...Who Cares. It was destined to have a big opening and THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. Right?So let's forget that the movie completely betrays the characters.Let's forget that the movie is, to quote Mr. Gibson, "Boring as a dog's ass."Let's just forget.It's the last 15 minutes of this flick we need to ponder.It's seems the principle players all ran for cover after reading the book--finding the original ending a tad too much. So it was altered to please those involved but alas only Sir Anthony was left standing.My question--Who drew the line in the sand? I mean really--the ending to this mess was such a train wreck of excess I have a real problem understanding at what point someone said. "Whoa...WHOA! This is too much!"I have to admit the only thing I enjoyed about this flick was the ending and had the WHOLE movie stayed in that spirit we would have had another SHOWGIRLS on our hands. The joy! The shear fantastic joy! But no. Hell, no. Ridley had to take himself seriously and that was a big mistake. And had he kept, in addition, the original ending....We would have been in MOMMIE DEAREST territory. Drag queens and cultist everywhere- unite! But I guess Mr. Scott wanted to be taken serious again. (He's an artist ya know.) He can't make crap! After all he's Oscar caliber talent. But then again so is Adrian Lyne...oh, well.So my advice. Chow down on the popcorn. Chug down your Coke. Set your alarm to go off in 110-or-so minutes...and wait for the squealing of the pigs. The glorious shrieking pigs! They usher in the the real beginning of the film...and the ultimate end of any possibility that this film was ever designed for quality. Thinking of pigs...I feel a little like Ned Beatty.Where's my cigarette? I've been screwed.</fullReview>

The doctor is now at large in Europe, pursuing his own interests and savoring the scents and essences of an unguarded world. But, Starling has never forgotten her encounters with Dr. Lecter, and the metallic rasp of his seldom- used voice still haunts her dreams. Mason Verger remembers Dr. Lecter, as well, and is obsessed with revenge. Verger was Dr. Lecter's sixth victim, and though hideously disfigured, has survived to rule a vast financial empire. Verger soon realizes that in order to draw the doctor out into the open, he must use someone Lecter cannot resist as bait: Clarice Starling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A totally different beast from the "Silence of the Lambs".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hannibal" takes everything that worked perfectly on "Silence of the Lambs" and tosses them overboard. And the film still works. Gone is the claustrophobic look of "Silence" that created tangible tension. Instead, in "Hannibal" Dr Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is free to wreak havoc and spell doom for the people of Florence. The change of scenery is welcome and extends the movie's scope as well as working as an allegory of how far-reaching evil can be and how quickly it can spread.Also gone is the serial killer plot mechanism that drove "Silence" so successfully providing the film with focus. Well, "Hannibal" doesn't need that, because by now we've met the characters, we know their way of thinking, we've witnessed their malice and their heroism. Their interactions are no longer in a professional context but rather a personal one. There are two story lines: one concerning the exploits of a free Hannibal Lecter living across the ocean under the alias of Dr Fell (or is it Dr Hell?) and another following the attempts of a Lecter former-patient-turned-victim to arrest him and bring him to justice (or some man-eating boars). The two separate story lines soon merge and all hell breaks loose.Finally, gone is Jodie Foster along with her paternal figure Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). In her shoes steps the able Julianne Moore and she doesn't disappoint. Her Clarice Starling is entirely different from Foster, more battle-scarred and urgent as the role requires (after all 10 years in the F.B.I. can turn you into something like that). Furthermore, gone seems to be morality. The austere but loving authority figure of Crawford is replaced with the sleazy, backstabbing misogynist Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta). As for the villain of the piece, Lecter certainly isn't he. And that's because his surviving victim, filthy wealthy child molester, faceless Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) fulfills the role remarkably. Verger may be a victim but he is not victimized. He is a heartless, vindictive, manipulative sadist, living only to torment, his only redeeming quality being his dark sense of humor. As for Lecter's nemesis in Florence (or is it vice versa?), Inspector Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) only cares for Verger's bounty on Hannibal's head, obstructing American justice by scheming to deliver Lecter to the deranged billionaire. The performances are excellent throughout, with Hopkins towering over everybody like a colossus. "Hannibal" puts him dead center, unlike the periphery of "Silence" and proves that Lecter is a superhuman, an all-devouring Leviathan, a metaphorical pinnacle of uncontrollable evil. By contrast, Verger's choice of evil seems to be conscientious. Gary Oldman, Julianne Moore, Giancarlo Giannini and Ray Liotta all shine, even when their roles are somewhat one-note. All in all, Ridley Scott's "Hannibal" is an atmospheric and tasteful grand guignol, with its delicious over-the-top tone working as a study in the nature of evil. A worthy successor to the "Silence of the Lambs".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misunderstood masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott oddly took the job to direct this perfectly crafted sequel to the Oscar award winning Silence of the Lambs. After being located in Florence, Hannibal returns to America and attempts to make contact with disgraced Agent Clarice Starling.While not following Harris' novel to the letter and omitting a main character, Scott directs an atmospheric follow up. With David Mamet's meaty, intellectual screenplay there's plenty to like about Hannibal. There are terrific performance's nobility by Giancarlo Giannini in a subtle and memorable take on Insp. Renaldo Pazzi. Unrecognisable, Gary Oldman is astounding as Mason Verger, the heavy disfigured paedophile and Ray Liotta replaces Lamb's Ron Vawter and is on form as a sleazy F.B.I Agent, Paul Krendle.Nurse Barney returns in a larger role, and of course Anthony Hopkins is back in his iconic role as Hannibal Lecter. Hopkins is given more to do and is out of his confinement (much to the announce of some film critics). Although possibly striped of some mystic, Hannibal is far more dangerous and interesting here, mingling with the general public and stalking his prey. They only thing I feel is distracting is the casting of Julianne Moore as Starling, and that is only from a continuity point of view as she delivers a gifted performance.Blade Runner's director Scott makes every shot interesting and this coupled with John Mathieson cinematography is first-rate, particularly in the Florence set ups, and US exteriors. Veteran musician Hans Zimmer's score is mystical and heightens all that is taking place on screen.An overlooked, misunderstood and fantastic film, that is a wonderful experience to watch.</fullReview>

Sometimes the film focuses on Lecter's murders, sometimes on Sterling's frustrations, sometimes on police's effort to catch Lecter and sometimes on Verger's sick conspiracy. There is no suspense, thrill or threat in "Hannibal", but instead we only get shocking scenes every now and then.

So much detail was left out in the interest of including as many action scenes as possible. Ridley Scott did this story a grave injustice. The very thing that made Silence of the Lambs a huge hit was the tension. This book had even more tension that Silence of the Lambs, which made me look forward to its release with great anticipation. I was SO disappointed. It was a butchered version of the book story without any redeeming qualities. The acting was... I don't want to say poor, but it was insufficient to overcome the terribly butchered script and ridiculous directing. Character development... on pre-existing characters, mind you, as this is a sequel film... was horribly inconsistent with the prior film.Just read the book. Do NOT waste your time with the movie.

		<fullReview>When I saw "Hannibal" when it first came out, I found it quite fascinating (although not any kind of masterpiece). Ever since "Red Dragon" came out, I've talked with many people, and they said that this one turned Hannibal Lecter into a character from a slasher movie, thereby weakening it. Well, I don't think that I would have put it like that. Granted, they make him a lot nastier here - but no less likable - but I didn't derive that his actions strayed from his persona as a pathological cannibal.Anyway, the plot has Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) disgraced after a botched mission, while Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is living a sedate life in Florence, Italy. Neither one knows that Lecter's former victim Mason Verger (an unrecognizable Gary Oldman) is plotting revenge. But nothing is to turn out as anyone expects.I will say that some aspects of the movie are a little predictable. First and foremost is Clarice's boss Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta). He's a chauvinistic pig - pun not intended - and anyone who knows violent movies knows that the creepy characters don't get off easily. You'd better believe that Paul doesn't get off easily. I guess that the one skin-crawl-inducing scene gives "Hannibal" the feel of a slasher movie.As for the whole part about whether or not it was acceptable to cast a different person as Clarice, I'll say that Julianne Moore did a good job. She made Clarice seem more depressed, even nervous, but never weak.So, it's a worthy movie. Although I will say that "Red Dragon" is a little better. And I think that most people agree that there needn't be another sequel.Also starring Giancarlo Giannini.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror I've Seen In Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "Hannibal" pushes the viewer over the brink- for those of you that are sensitive to these type of graphic horrors. The movie had backbone and was known for disturbing a lot of people. Hopkins returns as the 'psychiatrist gone mad' Hannibal Lecter- a man who is not only known for eating his victims, but using their minds as tools and weapons against them. Lecter ends up on the run and Clarice Starling (played by the ever so dynamic Julianne Moore) is sent on a manhunt to find the cannibal at large. The manhunt takes her to the artistic city of Florence, Italy where Hannibal is running amok. There is another catch to the film. It seems that there is another individual who is hunting Lecter and wants him more than the Law. His name is Mason Verger and he was a victim that survived an attack from Dr. Lecter several years prior. Mr. Verger is also a sadistic psychopath who wants cold and hard vengeance for the attack. As a director of low budget films and independent screen writer of short stories etc., I look at movies mostly from a directors standpoint. I break down the film's technical aspects as well as how it was directed and how it was written. I look at how the film impacted me first and then how it hit critics and then the viewers. Because of these tools, it is almost impossible to shock me. Hannibal beat the tests. Hannibal, to me, revolutionized the visual effects field of realism when it comes to gore- other films followed. I'm an artist / painter- been one since I was a kid. I know all about lighting and special make-up effects, so I put a film under close scrutiny. Not only does the film rate a 10 for realistic effects on all spectrum, all technical aspects (lighting, sound, directing, editing, music, acting) fits to a tee- like a glove. The film's artistic merit not only lies in the visuals and audios, but the way it was written- like an opera of horror, not to mention the artistic implications of historic locations and poetic dabbling giving examples of Dante's Inferno crossing and placing itself in the 'macabre' section of horror. "Hannibal" not only is a visceral ride through graphic violence, but an artistic ride through excellent locations, excellent music and cultural expansions. There are reasons for the demise of the people within Hannibal's grasp. In my opinion, you have to be a philosopher and artist with a knowledge of some religious texts- this movie is not for the simple minded. But that's what makes "Hannibal" such a rare gem- you cannot digest the movie in one sitting- you have to see it several times to understand its multi-dimensional avenues. Ridley Scott did a stupendous job- more than he got credit for. I don't usually watch psycho thrillers but this one is unlike any I've ever seen. It's an original- a trend setter for imitators. The final punch from the film that made me give it a solid 10 was the fact of how unpredictable it was. It's real and possible and "Hannibal" is a wake up call for the people that think the world is a happy apple pie. See it if you dare and read the book if you dare.</fullReview>

This is the more "action-like" Hannibal Lecter film(whereas 'Silence' is the psychological, and Red Dragon is the half-cooked thriller-wannabe), as there is plenty of shooting, chasing and a fair bit of killing in the movie. Ridley Scott makes very good use of slow-motion shots, and utilizes quick cuts and some intense editing to keep shootouts and chases (somewhat) exciting and (occasionally) interesting. The plot is pretty good, but it just seems a little like it was just written to give the Hannibal Lecter fanatics a chance to see the good doctor in action, rather than tell an important story about him. The pacing isn't particularly good, and the film can be almost unbearable on repeated viewings. The acting is good, Hopkins is great, as always, and Julianne Moore is surprisingly good as Jodie Fosters replacement in the role of Clarice Starling. Both Ray Liotta and Gary Oldman are great as well, but that's too be expected from them. It was nice to see Liotta play a character so far away from the gangster-types he usually portrays. Oldman's character reminded me of his character from The Fifth Element; something in the way he talks, I think. The characters are well-written, credible and diverse. The effects are great; how they turned Oldman's face into that disgusting skin-less... mass... great. Ridley Scott understands horror(as evidenced quite clearly in one of his first films, Alien), and he scares the audience pretty good, through gory scenes, where only a few of them are overdone(the "bowels out" sequence was a little ridiculous... how did he cut through all that clothes with one quick cut from the knife?). The dialog is mostly well-written. Any fan of Hannibal Lecter will enjoy most of what he says, does and pretty much all of the scenes that even hints at him. All in all, a decent enough film, but too poorly paced and very little of interest to anyone not interested in Lecter, or who's not a very big fan of any of the actors. I recommend it to big fans of Ridley Scott and any of the main actors, and any fan of Hannibal Lecter. Fans of The Silence of the Lambs might want to check it out, too. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Poor Sequel To "Silence Of The Lambs"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having enjoyed "Silence Of The Lambs" several years ago, I looked forward to the eventual opportunity to see this much-anticipated sequel. Frankly, I wish I hadn't seen it. It spoiled my good memories.Where "Silence Of The Lambs" was a taut psychological thriller in which the relationship between Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter was the most fascinating aspect, "Hannibal" contains virtually none of that suspense. It emphasizes violence over psychology - gratuitous violence; the gorier the better it seems. Only once - in the last ten minutes or so - does the Hannibal/Clarice relationship get explored in an interesting way (I won't say what happens here, but it bumped the movie up maybe one point in my estimation.) The rest of the movie is little more than a somewhat high-brow slasher movie. Very disappointing.Performances were passable; nothing more. Anthony Hopkins reprised the role of Dr. Lecter but didn't seem to bring either the same depth or the same energy to the character that he did in "Silence." Julianna Moore struggled valiantly with the role of Clarice Starling, but - her efforts notwithstanding - Jodie Foster was sorely missed. The most ridiculous performance (or at least the most ridiculous character) was Gary Oldman playing Mason Verger, a former patient and mutilated victim of Lecter. His appearance at the beginning of the movie appears to be for the sake of shock value alone, and the character manages to add nothing more than a cartoonish quality to this movie.My advice? If you loved "Silence Of The Lambs" stay away from this nonsensical sequel. They have virtually nothing in common save a couple of the same characters. This will only tarnish your good memories of the original.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very poor sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is quite poor, especially the last hour.Now what worries me, is not that this film got made, not the waste of talented actors, not that Ridley seems to want to turn every film into a pop video. The worrying thing is that some people, on this list, thought this film was great, one of the best films ever made.How is that possible. It's not the worst film in the world, but lets be honest, it's very poor. How can you ignore the absolutely ridiculous plot; Italian's speaking perfect fluent English, even at home, the non-existent Italian Police force. Why did Mason seek revenge, when his wounds were inflicted on himself. why would Hannibal even visit this man anyway. Why did the FBI show next to no interest in capturing Hannibal.Knowing the link between Lecter and Clarice, the FBI would have guarded her house, they would have also watched the Airports.The beauty of the first film was how Lecter was very clever in getting what he wanted through intelligence and psychology. In this, he is superman, he able to do what ever he wants in full view of camera's and public without anyone stopping him, move from country to country, place to place, without explanation with the grace and charm of Rambo.Ridley, as in Gladiator, produces some nice artistic film shots, accompanied by atmospheric music, but unfortunately to no end. All the slow motions and beautiful camera work don't match what's happening in the non-existent story.I haven't read the book, but from what friends tell me, it is even worse than the film, so why make it into a movie. Ah, the only reason Hollywood makes a film, especially a sequel, money.Very disappointing amazed that anyone thought it was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like I said in the title dont waste you money or time on this one. The slow moving plot leads you to nothing. Julianne Moore does a horrible Clarice Starling. The climax of the movie is the phone call from Dr. Lector to Starling. This does not do justice to a great book written by Thomas Harris. We did not see the old Dr. Hannibal Lector we all came to love in Silence of the Lambs. Overall the making of this movie was horrible and I was sorry that I wasted my time and money on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I've been giving a lot of thought ... towards eating your wife."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So says Anthony Hopkins to a man whose wife has found him charming. Yes, that's right, Hannibal has started doing gags. A double entendre, sort of like Carry On Cannibal. And, while this recreation of his '91 role isn't quite the ultimate distillation of camp that reviews may have led you to believe, we're surely just two sequels away from Hannibal vs. Jason.WARNING: REST OF REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS. ONLY READ IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILMEasily the weakest of the Lecter trilogy, this follows on from Manhunter and the infamous Silence of the Lambs. Manhunter (6) was a brooding, low-key, though never intense, thriller, with all the hallmarks of a TV movie, despite striking direction. William L. Peterson impressed as the FBI agent, though Ronny Cox failed to get a grip on Lecter (or Lecktor as he was known in that particular picture). While Manhunter may have flirted with the mainstream, it never got into bed and had its babies the way Silence did. Jodie Foster's non-return to the Starling role for Hannibal makes it easier to accept Manhunter as part of the franchise; if Starling can be portrayed by two actors then Hannibal can be as well.For Silence of the Lambs (7) Jodie Foster received top billing, something which Hopkins' performance ensured wouldn't happen if they appeared together again; though both won Oscars for sterling work. It's a wonderfully observed performance, managing to stay just the right side of ham, and, crucially, unlike Cox's rather listless Lecktor, Hopkins maintains unwavering eye contact throughout. Initial viewings may disappoint with what turns out to be a relatively minor role for Lecter, though his nine scenes are still six more than Brian Cox had. Some unusual casting sees Chris Isaac and Roger Corman in minor roles, though the only real sticking point is Anthony Heald as the institute boss, who gives a performance too fey and silly to really fit in with the surroundings. Finally, the film opens and closes with the gentle sound of bird song. A nice touch.And so this takes us to Hannibal, the outright proof that less is certainly more. Hopkins appears - after an absence from pretty much all of the first half an hour ? almost constantly. A mere eight blinks were permitted for his debut in the role; here he blinks a total of fifty-six times. In fact, so unstudied is the part this time around that he comes across more as his role of Richard Nixon or that advert he did for Barclays, rather than an insane genius murderer.This being Ridley Scott, the direction is of course well above average, though a little too overstated for this sort of thing, as is the subject matter. Everything inherent within Silence is here dragged out of the subtext, a spotlight shone on it and flogged to death. Julianne Moore does reasonably well in recreating Starling; so much so that after seeing her befreckled appearance you almost forget that Foster actually had dyed black hair when she played it. The undeclared love, or mutual dependency, of the two in the prior film is here expanded to a full-out romance, Lecter even drafting a love letter to the agent. His teasing of her Southern origins now seems childish and forced, while the singular plot narrative doesn't really go anywhere. In Silence they briefly touched hands; here they practically date and actually get a full-blown snog before the runtime is up.The classical and religious references are here overblown and silly (Look out for Hopkins in "crucified" pose), while the characterisation is now so twee he gets to say things like "Ta-ta!" and "okey-dokey!" OKEY-DOKEY??? Can you really imagine Hannibal Lecter saying "Okey-Dokey"??? You don't have to ? you can see it. Twice.While you sit through the film and realise this is a series that has now disappeared into hopeless self-parody you can hang on to the fact that it's still mediocre... at least until the final scenes. Perhaps inspired by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Lecter serves up one of the most bizarre dinnertable sequences in movie history. Less Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, more Guess Who's Dinner, Ray Liotta sits around cracking jokes and one-liners while his skull is opened and his frontal lobes are served up for deserts. Or perhaps that should be just deserts, as Liotta is a very slimy boo-hiss villain throughout. Hopkins dutifully chows down on fried brain cells with comic intent, making it not food for thought, but thought for food. The special effects used to create this "severed skull" look are extraordinarily good, but highlight the film's proclivity towards excessive gore. Not only that, but it's just too silly, too smug, too self-congratulatory.If this was a stand-alone film then it would be worthwhile. It's still by no means a bad film, but following on from its predecessors it cannot help but feel like a betrayal. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An initial disappointment that gets better with time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If "The Silence of the Lambs" is a thriller played liked a character-study, then "Hannibal" is a character-study played like a thriller. This isn't a good point, or a bad point (it goes both ways), but it's the most clear observation I could make out when I watched this film again recently. Another realization I came to was that, despite not really liking it on first viewing, this is actually a very good movie - one more deeply creepy, violent, and sad.The plot lies more or less on the same level as the previous film. Hannibal is now free, Starling is disgraced after a scandal with the FBI, and an old victim of Hannibal's contacts her with a proposal to trap him once and for all. Things go awry, chaos ensues. The performances are just as brilliant as the original, and that goes a long way to helping the (slightly over-the-top) story stick together. The thing is, it's a completely different movie, which is probably why I and many others didn't like it upon release. Gone is the tension of the first movie, replaced instead by a much more potent sense of paranoia and dread - mostly down to Hannibal's new found freedom. Also new to this movie is the blood and gore that it's so infamous for. It did feature in the original, but not like this. This is an exceptionally violent movie, and features one of the sickest, nastiest scenes in the history of mainstream cinema (you know which one I'm talking about).Unlike other movies, though, the violence means a lot here. Sure, it's gross and icky and what have you, but more than anything, the nastiness reveals a lot about its characters that the original film didn't touch on. Unlike the original, this isn't a film that particularly likes Hannibal - here, he's not the endearingly-creepy movie-monster, but he's an utter psychopath. This is bound to put some people off, but it feels like the natural thing for this film to do. Does it go too far? Possibly. Some things never need to be shown, but it's all integral to the film's vision so it gets a free pass... just about. As for the film being a drama played like a thriller, that does mean it loses the probing character-based drama of the original. Starling's story in the original is so raw on screen that it practically bleeds - this film deals with similarly prickly affairs, but never really addresses them. The knock-on effect is that it ends up being a less involving film, but a more exciting one. Again, this isn't really a good point or a bad point, but it's more just a point of comparison. Don't come into Hannibal expecting the virtuosic drama of the original.What ultimately saves Hannibal (the reason I've given it an 8) is the grand, darkly romantic vision it commits to. It's a sweeping, perfectly orchestrated film that feels as if it's what could have been made if film existed at the height of the romantic era. The sets are some of the most lavish to ever grace the crime-thriller genre (most of it is set in Florence), the music exists solely in the realms of opera and classical, and the plot, flawed as its logic sometimes is, hits every note with an intensity lacking in most crime movies. It's all fantastically realized.In the end, it's not the perfect sequel to Silence of the Lambs. Some may find it too gory (yours truly included), and that's a fair comment. The plot enters a territory that will probably aggravate some, and that's also a fair criticism. If you can come into it realizing it's a different film to the first, however, you may ultimately end up finding a lot to like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is beautiful, it's decadent and yes, it's gory (but not as much as the puritans say). But it's witty, romantic and perhaps "gothic" also.There are philosophical and mythological subtexts. There is something archetypal in this film. Ridley Scott uses totally different approach than Jonathan Demme and it is a good choice, it is very European movie.If you like Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schopenhauer and Ladislav Klima and if you are open-minded (no pun intended) you will enjoy this arty dark thriller about the circles of hell in human thoughts (and deeds).What should I say more? Try it without prejudices. Maybe it's strange and over-the-top, but it works. I love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly, awful, boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a pretty big fan of both Manhunter and Silence, I really did look forward to this movie. Even with probably unrealistically high expectations, I was totally unprepared at how truly awful this movie ended up being. I'd suggest it was almost singularly the result of truly bad writing. The plot was convoluted without being interesting, turgid while failing to explain major plot developments, and gruesome without having much of a point to it. Both Silence and Manhunter had a basic theme--and that was the tactics and strategies employed by the police and by the killer, and how they maneuvered; while at the same time telling a story about serial killers--the violence in those movies was compelling, but deployed deftly to maximize the impact. With Hannibal, what you get is awe inspiring architecture of Florence and Washington D.C., perhaps the best use of Union Station I've seen, and really well done acting. But it all can't save this garbage. There are gaping plot holes--e.g. when Agent Starling easily breaks into Mason Verger's massive estate without so much as seeing a guard. The guys a billionaire and doesn't even bother to guard his property? The much talked about gore at the end is laughable and stupid--and manages to be boring too, since we've already been treated to scene after scene of blood spurting everywhere. You hear a lot about egotistical actors demanding rewrites--this is one where any of the major actors should have done just that until they were given a decent script. All of Ridley Scott's panoramas and clever film school techniques highlighting Florentine architecture and sculpture can't make up for the total lack of foundation for this movie. Instead of a taught spellbinder, we have Hannibal Lector listening to Bach and killing people, Clarice Starling in one long pout, and Gary Oldman hissing through about three pounds of makeup on his face. Do yourself a favor an rent Manhunter again, even without Anthony Hopkins in the Hannibal role, it's head and shoulders above this garbage. There's more film quality in the finale of that movie with "Ina Gadda Davida" blasting than in this entire shame of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but extremely lacking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal picks up 10 years after the events of The Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal escaped, and he is now hiding out in Italy, continuing his cannibalistic crime spree there. A former victim of Hannibal, Mason Verger, has hired a police detective to track him down and capture him, so he can have his revenge. Meanwhile, FBI Agent Clarice Starling has been disgraced due to a botched operation. When she receives a note from Hannibal, she begins trying to track him down. This movie is nowhere near as good as Silence of the Lambs, but it has its moments.The first thing wrong with this movie is that the style of film making and storytelling is vastly different. Whereas the first film managed to be disturbing, yet not excessively gory at the same time, this movie is more about the gore. It was a bold psychological thriller meant to make you think. Ridley Scott made this movie as a slasher movie, with scenes of gratuitous gore where it isn't necessary. He turned Hannibal from a highly intelligent sociopath to a highly intelligent serial slasher. It is nice to finally see Hannibal Lecter as the main antagonist, since the first two films had him confined to a cell helping the FBI with the capture of other serial killers. However, those stories were much more interesting than this one. This movie comes off as far more boring than the previous films.The acting isn't as good either. Julianne Moore comes nowhere close to portraying Clarice in the way Jodie Foster did. Foster made it her own character, whereas Julianne Moore desperately tries to copy Foster, and fails miserably. Ray Liotta is terrible in his role. Gary Oldman is mildly entertaining as Mason Verger. As for Anthony Hopkins, he's still a great actor, and he does good in this movie. However, he seems to have lost that creepy voice that made Hannibal memorable. Now he just speaks with his normal accent.Overall, this movie certainly has its moments, and I'd recommend it to people who liked Manhunter and The Silence of the Lambs, but be warned...It's nowhere near as good.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The least interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen all four Hannibal Lecter movies and I have to say that they are all watchable. Unfortunately this one the least of all because the only good reason to see 'Hannibal' is for Anthony Hopkins, but even he is less interesting than in 'The Silence of the Lambs' or 'Red Dragon'. The first movie made, 'Manhunter' (the remake was 'Red Dragon'), was a good thriller and had the advantage that there were no real expectations.But back to 'Hannibal', a movie where Lecter is not imprisoned once and may be that is why some of the fun is missing, the fun that came back with 'Red Dragon'.Or may be it is the fact that there is no real villain. The movie is called 'Hannibal' and he kind of is the real hero, of course together with special agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore). We have Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) who survived Lecter but not without its price. He is searching for Lecter and since he only wants revenge you can't call him a real villain. We have no Buffalo Bill or Tooth Fairy here.Or is it Jullianne Moore who is not as good as Jodie Foster as Clarice? I don't think so. You get used to her in the first act of the movie and she plays how Foster could have done it. May be it is simply the plot that is not as good as 'The Silence of the Lambs'.The movie tries to hide its weak points by putting more gore in it and it gives some scenes that will make this movie definitely not for everyone. That is too bad, and in my opinion not very necessary. because for the fun of Hopkins this movie could be a nice evening for a lot more. I had fun, but not as much as I had with the other Hannibal movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre adaptation of a mediocre book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some times when too much just doesn't work. Considering all the talent involved in making "Hannibal", the results should have been excellent. Perhaps the biggest problem was with the source material. Thomas Harris did not hit a home run with his third novel dealing with Hannibal Lecter. The plot was convoluted, completely unrealistic, and almost completely obscured by the author's attempt to dazzle the reader with how much he knows about Florence, Italy. The script was re-written fifteen times. Three endings were filmed. Jodie Foster and Johnathan Demme backed out amidst the chaos. The final result has none of the magic of Silence of the Lambs or even Manhunter. Hopkins is still there, and he's a thrill to watch particularly during the scenes in Italy. Hopkins was originally skeptical of portraying Lecter once again, but it's amazing what $15 million will convince a man to do.The story picks up a few years after SOTL left off. Lecter has settled in Italy while Agent Starling is busy fighting crime with the FBI back home. An Italian detective finds out Lecter is working in a local museum and plans to hand him over to an old victim rather than arrest him. The former victim (a grossly disfigured Gary Oldman) is a wealthy sadist confined to a wheelchair on his sprawling estate. His plan is to feed Lecter to a pack of wild pigs that have been specially raised for just this event!!! Yes! It's amazing what those rich sadists will come up with when they're looking for revenge. After the detective fails to capture Lecter in Italy, Lecter heads on back to the USA to apparently try and hook up with Agent Starling who he has a thing for. Starling is trying to capture Lecter and prevent his former victim from murdering him. As you can see, the plot is ripe for any criticism one wishes to throw its way. The action plays out well in some scenes, but poorly during the latter half hour when it mattered the most.A big problem this film has is with its moralizing attitude it takes with Lecter. We are actually supposed to care about this brutal murderer of god knows how many people. We are supposed to sit and either laugh or cheer when he feeds Ray Liotta's own brains to him. The rich man trying to kill Lecter is painted as a man who would be better off dead himself, so we'd better hope Lecter gets away! The book is even more guilty of this moralizing by detailing Lecter's difficult childhood and pointing out how he only kills people who are "rude". Overall, it just doesn't work when your main character is an evil murderer. With SOTL and Manhunter, we had a serial killer on the outside who needed to be stopped. This film acts like things are fine and dandy with Lecter on the outside.Julianne Moore is a fine actress, but she's badly miscast here as Starling. It's nice to see Ray Liotta working again, but this part really did nothing for him, either. This film was obviously a mess from the get-go, but I'd blame Thomas Harris more than anyone else. He gave us a novel that just could not be made into a very good film.5 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hypnotically Sensuous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Demme made a great film the first time around. He used talented actors to project a feeling of evil and defilement, primarily sexual. His film supported the actors.Scott has greater ambitions -- he is the star, and the magic here is in the filmmaking rather than the acting, even though this crew of actors is even better than the last go round, Normally actors are asked to play to each other, the audience or the writing. Scott asks them to play to the fabric of images he is weaving. This means that the primary characters -- if sufficiently talented -- can project past their lines, a projection that persists from scene to scene. Crowe did it in `Gladiator,' and treasure Moore does here.Scott's coconspirator in this is Mamet who is the most intelligent screenwriter alive. Mamet doesn't have the chops to direct in this manner himself, but this team is unbeatable. This new investure in texture allows Scott to take the movie in a different, richer direction than the first film. Here, the seduction is of fine taste -- understandable extremes in the quest for ultimate quality. Lector is not so evil here, but a man of taste and intelligence, one who plays by his own rules and who doesn't shy from repellant exotica. This is supported by the brilliant exploitation of Florence and in fact all things Italian as far as their maniacal commitment to taste. So rich.In the original, Lector inherited the sexual perversity of the parallel story, and hence became an evil beyond. In this version, the real evil is in the rich and powerful -- the demented millionaire and the crooked government officials. In this case, the focus of evil is moved from Lector -- he even takes revenge on the bad guys.The result is much creepier than the first film could ever be, because you are seduced into understanding Lector. And that's damned frightening. In the last few months, I saw Mamet (`State and Main') and had complaints about his lack of virtuosic camera, and saw Scott (`Gladiator') and wished for writing as good as the vision. Here we have it.Only two comments about the actors. Hopkins is ruined. `Titus' did it, and in fact he pledged to quit films after that. He was asked to do something multidimensional and couldn't deliver. (Something Jessica Lange did handily in that film, and which Ms Moore is known for.) Here he is weak. It doesn't matter so much until the end scenes, but then it is clear that there's not much left in there.Julianne isn't asked to carry the film, but there is one place where she and Scott could have done better. Lector remarks on her jogging after having observed her. `I traveled far to see you run.' But when she was running, it was about the deadest part of the film, made so by lush work before and after. This one scene they could have made the center of the film. (Think of "Run Lola Run.") They decided to move the center to Union Station instead. So they should have changed that pivotal line to evoke the chase sequence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by Ridley Scott's "Hannibal" given that the movie is based on the horrible book which I more than dislike. I see a writer as a God - he creates by the power of his imagination the new worlds and populates them with his creatures. Once, he created the world, he should give his characters free will; they should act by the logic of their personalities not by their creator's sheer caprice. What Harris did in "Hannibal" is unspeakable - he just showed his fans how much he despised them. Actually, he did two things wrong - the ending and his attempt to explain Hannibal, to look behind the mask. The film comparing to the book has several redeeming values: visually, it is a stunning work of a great director. I am yet to see Florence, the celebrated City of Flowers as dark, dangerous, and anti-tourist as in "Hannibal". Second, the movie did not try to "explain" Hannibal, to get inside his head and understand him. Harris attempted in the book to give us the reasons why Hannibal was what he was - it was weak and laughable. If he chose to present Hannibal as some sort of supernatural creature with almost animals' instincts, he should've left him as an eternal mystery. The best description of Hannibal belongs to Clarice. When asked, "Is it true what they're sayin', he's some kinda vampire?" - she replied, "They don't have a name for what he is". And finally, the film avoided the literally vomit-inducing, absurd, irrational, obnoxious slap in face book's ending - for this alone I think "Hannibal" is a very decent movie and a lot of fun.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I was underwhelmed on my first viewing, the sheer terror and mesmerizing emotion in The Silence of the Lambs seriously got to me when I watched it again. This sequel is inferior in every way, with even Julianne Moore giving one of her weaker performances as Clarice Starling. The story, which is about a victim of Hannibal Lecter's using Starling to lure Hannibal out so he can exact revenge, lacks the bite of the original. Ridley Scott does his best with the thin material he has to work with, there are undeniably shocking and memorable moments and the film boasts 2 tremendous villainous performances. One is, of course, from Anthony Hopkins and the other is from Gary Oldman as the man trying to catch him although Oldman should have appeared more. The psychology and tension from TSOTL is gone, leaving Hannibal with only a collection of gross-out death scenes to scare viewers, but those gradually become tedious. The film is far too slow-paced for its own good, and in the end it's all highly anti-climatic since nothing that much actually happens and the conclusion, in many ways, settles nothing. It's a shame to end the Hannibal Lecter story here (There's never been a continuation of the story) and if you want a worthy successor, check out the surprisingly solid 2002 prequel, Red Dragon. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a sequel to "Silence of the Lambs": This time, Hanibal will need the agent Clarice Starling to get rid of a powerful enemy. Directed by Ridley Scott and written by David Mamet, this film has a cast headed by Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore.Its one of the most interesting thrillers of the decade and brings again to the big screen the iconic Hannibal Lecter. However, there is no love like the first and, so, this film is never able to rub shoulders with its predecessor, despite the remarkable quality it has. It's a good movie, entertains the audience, leaving them quite uncomfortable and causing some chills especially in the stronger scenes. This is also a warning for sensitive people: this film has several shocking scenes.The script is quite reasonable but its very predictable and only heats in the end, in the only scenes which can create real tension, in which the public is in anticipation of what will happen. Julianne Moore looks like it hasn't adapted to the role of Starling. The work of the actress is cold and devoid of depth. However, I don't know if that was a casting error or a writing error. The special, visual and sound effects, although discrete, are competent. The makeup also deserves congratulations, especially because of the appearance of the character Mason Verger and some more shocking scenes, where the skillful hand of the makeup artist was valuable. The soundtrack, by Hans Zimmer, is also very good and fits perfectly to the film, making it much more dense than it really is.In short, its a good movie, despite failures. Its worth seeing it, mainly for the pleasure of reviewing Anthony Hopkins, again in one of the most famous roles of his career. Unsurpassed, the actor gives the necessary support to the film. He really has made the difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gory operatic nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This follow-up to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS seems to be an either love it or hate it film. I'm sad to say that I fall into the latter camp, as while I found some of HANNIBAL moderately entertaining, as a whole I found it to be too long and too uninteresting to get excited about. I'll make it clear from the start that I've never read any of Thomas Harris' books so I can't comment on the link to them...Director Ridley Scott - now a hot property once again thanks to the success of GLADIATOR - injects his film with some lovely photography of the city of Florence, plus some impressively stylish scenes of action such as the opening shoot-out, which has to be one of the most realistic I've ever seen; in the cinema you can almost feel the bullets whizzing past you as the gunshots explode from the speakers and gravel flies into the air on screen. After this great start, not much seems to happen for a long time, which was my first inkling that something was wrong with this movie.When Lecter finally makes his screen appearance after what seems like an age, we find he's taken up a new job as a museum curator and seems to be a happy, law-abiding citizen. His only crime is to stab a would-be pickpocket in the crotch with a knife in a confrontation on the street, but otherwise he's just a normal-looking guy. Only when Lecter is cornered by policeman Pazzi and the employees of Mason Verger does he turn nasty - very nasty indeed.After lots more talk and plot development (so much goes on to make this film feel like an epic) we come to the a series of extra-gory scenes. The impressive use of CGI here is very good indeed, and highly realistic, making for some unforgettable images; it's a shame that the effects go far beyond the boundaries of taste and become mere gross-out moments. Otherwise, HANNIBAL's generally disappointing. Hopkins seems to relish his return to the role of Lecter, and manages to be scary in a couple of instances, and is the best actor in the movie. Julianne Moore, though, isn't really given that much material to work with and fails to be very expressive at all as Agent Starling; she seems to keep the same blank expression on her face throughout while delivering all of her lines in exactly the same way which makes her character seem emotion-free. In fact, I would go so far as to say that she's bad, a surprise as previously she's been impressive in her movies. Gary Oldman lets his makeup do the acting, but gives a great lisping voice to his character of the crippled Verger. Liotta is his usual snarling self; enough said. One more actor of note is the Italian old-timer Giancarlo Giannini, who really inhabits his crumpled detective Pazzi and makes him a fleshed-out, likable and believable character so that his death is all the more disturbing.There's something wrong with this movie that I can't quite pinpoint. It may be the dialogue, which somehow doesn't ring true, and sounds like it's been written down on paper instead of spoken out loud by real characters. Whatever it is, I felt myself coldly detached for the entire film so that I couldn't get excited about anything that happened, really. Although it only lasts for two and a quarter hours as well, those hours seem to last an age with the pace dawdling between action. Although the gore is plentiful, there are only a couple of minor jolts to be had, so on the scare-factor level this just isn't in the same league as MANHUNTER (thinking about that guy with the stocking over his head still makes my blood run cold) or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. In fact it seems more like a comic-book strip with Hopkins as the lovable anti-hero who only attacks when provoked. Nobody else really matters. Altogether, HANNIBAL is a movie that leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth and is no fun to watch in my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed? Yes. Disturbed? Of Course. Ambitious? Definitely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal takes the rules set up by its predecessor and throws them out the window. It trades in the focus and grittiness for something far more depraved and disturbing. The stylistic change sees the film evolve from a harsh cop thriller to a wildly imaginative horror spectacle. It clearly acknowledges what worked so well with the massively successful 'The Silence of the Lambs', yet it twists and turns into something else completely. It becomes something interesting, a sequel to a mega-hit that openly decides to be something entirely different.The film starts roughly ten years after Clarice's first encounter with Lecter. She is disgraced after a drugs bust goes horribly wrong. A lifeline is offered to her in the form of finding Lecter, who is now in Florence masquerading as an art curator and being tracked by Italian detective Pazzi (well-played by the melancholic looking Giancarlo Giannini). The Clarice here is vastly different and not just in terms of actress. She's much wearier and more cynical, no longer an ambitious inquisitive detective. Julianne Moore suffers from, if anything, playing it too safe. She doesn't copy Foster, yet she doesn't add her own touches. She just plays it blandly straight and serious. Of course this isn't Starling's film, but all the same she shouldn't become a dreary addition.We soon learn that Lecter is being hunted down by the wealthy but disfigured and paralysed child molester Mason Verger, determined to get revenge after falling victim to Lecter and cutting his own face off. Verger himself is played with a calculated cunning and subtle creepiness by an unrecognisable Gary Oldman. Characters like him are naturally interesting. He has so little control over own body yet he able to amass a group of men whose purpose is to find Lecter and bring him to his mansion, so that he can be fed to a group of flesh- eating boars. It's an extravagant plan, but Verger works as a diabolical villain and his crazy plan fits the films tone in the grand scheme of things. It just about works because it's that type of film.It's no shock that Lecter is the star and Anthony Hopkins delivers a fine performance in the role that won him an Oscar previously. He keeps it hammy, but he does well to get across that this is an older and more devious Lecter. He slips out of tough situations, tricks people, even managing to ensnare Clarice's conscience, there are layers added to the character which is what any sequel should do. There are some issues with him being free to roam. He loses some of the psychological edge and eerie charm that made him so fascinating. By making him the focal point we almost gain and lose a character. Lecter remains engaging despite this. The character almost develops into a protagonist given the odds against him, but it simply can't happen due to his nature. But it's a testament to his intrigue that we want to see him survive and make it out somehow, if nothing else but to see what his next actions are.Hannibal's unpleasantness knows no bounds and that is part of its strength surprisingly. The film isn't afraid to be very disturbing and really show us the mind-set of these deeply troubled individuals and I really do admire it for that. It's not as psychologically scary as its predecessor but it goes for more upfront scares than ones that lurk in the darkness. The most important thing is most of the gory imagery doesn't feel as if it was done solely for shock value. It is usually set up well and the set-pieces themselves make the gruesomeness feel justified. The film remains engaging throughout, impressive given much of the subject manner, though it undoubtedly loses its way in the last 30 minutes. The first half works brilliantly due to its ever-building sense of dread and because the plot threads are delivered so captivatingly. Then as the film keeps building it appears unsure of how to tie everything up. By the time we get to a man eating his own brain you feel as if the film is really pushing it, just seeing how grisly it can get. The eventual ending feels a little misplaced and it doesn't really offer the closure for the characters that it should. In fairness Ridley Scott, who is a strange yet interesting directorial choice, has done a fantastic job to carry over most of such a bizarre novel and make it coherent. Some of the most out-there aspects are retained so it is difficult not to appreciate his bravery.This is not an easy film to like, mainly because it's not designed to be, and it will undoubtedly be viewed as too distasteful by many. I for one find myself respecting the film a lot. So much so that I am willing to let minor issues slip by and even though the film is flawed on the whole. How a film about a cannibal, a disfigured child molester, a stern FBI agent and all the grotesque imagery that comes with that is constantly engaging is a pretty amazing feat. The film works for me because it's a sequel that isn't afraid to change itself into something else, even if the characters don't always connect and it does lose its way at times. It's made with creativity, dynamism and understanding, all of which shines throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK sequel to the classic best psychological thriller The Silence of the Lambs and also a good movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal (2001) is an OK sequel movie to Dr. Hannibal Lecter movie series. I like this film a bit, the first time I saw it, I hate it and I was really disappointed with this flick. This film in my opinion is a big step down from the classic film The Silence of the Lambs (1991). It is Ridley Scott film and I think he didn't do a terrible job directing this film. The sequel is based on Thomas Harris novel with the same name. Is Hannibal a classic? No! Is Hannibal the best film? No! Is Hannibal a great film? No! Is it an awful terrible movie? No! It is a good, bad film! We have new actors in this movie Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling does a really good job I like her a lot. Julianne Moore also started in a Jurassic Park sequel film The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) as Dr. Sarah Harding. Seriously I like her character Sarah in Jurassic Park II. But playing Clarice Starling I like her less. The only Clarice Starling for me will always be Jodie Foster not Julianne Moore! Jodie Foster should play in this film, that was one reasons why I was disappointed with this flick. Watching the third time in the row, I must say it is an OK film, not a classic but an OK film. We have Anthony Hopkins returning in this film with his character Dr. Hannibal Lecter from The Silence of the Lambs so I am taking this film. Is not my favorite film in the franchise, that would still be The Silence of the Lams, Red Dragon and Manhunter but not Hannibal.Plot: Living in exile, Hannibal Lecter tries to reconnect with now disgraced FBI agent Clarice Starling and finds himself a target for revenge from a powerful victim. I like that Anthony Hopkins returned in this film with his character I liked his brilliant performance. I like the action sequences in this film, the shootouts and wearing a hand guns in this movie. I like Julianne Moore in this movie her character was really well good written. Like she cared everything that happens in this film, she kills like 4 people who are criminals in self defense. I had no idea Gary Oldman was in this film as another villain. He had such a mask and make up on that I did not recognized him. I heard somewhere that Mason Verger was written to had sister but the idea was cut and dropped out from the film. I like that FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) uses a SIG-Sauer P226 as her duty firearm. It is predominately featured in the opening fish market shootout. At the time, the P226 was the standard issue sidearm for the FBI. DC Metro Detective Bolton (Terry Serpico) also carries one, and tips off the Drumgo gang in the fish market by drawing his weapon in view of the gang, despite Starling's orders to hold back. I like the rescue mission Clarice goes back rescuing Hannibal from Mason. I really like that they make a lot of changes in this film from the novel. Like Hannibal and Clarice did not become lovers in this film that was awesome and fantastic! I also like that even Clarice was drugged by Hannibal she still fight him when she handcuff him before Hannibal lock her hair in a freezer and broke the locker, that scene was awesome. I like that Hannibal only kills bad guys in this film and not any innocent people. Things I really don't like: The pacing is to slow at points and the film's tone is wildly inconsistent, the movie is too long for me. Ridley Scott has incredible lousy taste of music. The music theme from Hans Zimmer was terrible in this movie. Mostly I heard was a classic music playing, but where is any good song playing in this film? Manhunter and The Silence of the Lambs had beautiful songs playing in the movie this one didn't. Julianne Moore is no Jodie Foster. Where is Jack Crawford in this film? He should be written in this film, what happened to Jack Crawford? Hannibal Lecter escapes again and Clarice could do nothing, when she was drugged.How the heck did Clarice save her self when she was drugged and Hannibal locked her hair in a freezer and he brooked the lock for the freezer I don't know how she walked unharmed out. I didn't like the hanging the Pazzi out. Hannibal is eating Paul (Ray Liotta)'s brains was gruesome, I almost puked. I like this film, I like Julianne Moore giving her best at acting performance and making a good job. I like and I don't like this film the same time. So the rating for this film I am giving is a 6 out of 10 and I don't agree with critics that it is an awful movie it is definitely not! Hannibal is a 2001 American crime thriller film directed by Ridley Scott, adapted from the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris. It is the sequel to the 1991 Academy Award-winning film The Silence of the Lambs in which Anthony Hopkins returns to his role as the iconic serial killer, Hannibal Lecter.

		<shortDescription>Fine film of a very fine book?EXCEPT for the last 10 minutes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hopkins is excellent, though he does run the risk of recycling the part into cliché. Moore is very good, with an impossible job?standing in for Foster. Giannini is wonderful, as always. Everyone else is okay...though when the bad guys are stupid, they are astonishingly stupid!The problem is the horrible, nonsensical rewrite they foisted on the end of the book. The plot systematically removes all of the people who support and care for Starling, so that the only relationship she is left with is Leckter. She saves him, gets shot, he saves her...and then...nothing comes of it, at least in the movie. (Probably the producers or the studio assumed that the audience would hate an ending in which they ran off together...so they gave us idiocy instead. Or rather just bad writing.) If you think about it, what other possible outcome of their relationship can there be? And what happens to the careful preparation for this ending that the rest of the book/film provides? Nonsense!!It has been revealed that David Mamet wrote an early draft of the screenplay, but it was rejected. Can we speculate that perhaps he preserved the book's ending? (I have no idea one way or the other...)But up to that terrible ending (Leckter chops his own hand off?seriously!!?), it's a decent film. Simplifies the plot too much (I really miss Verger's sister, but guess she had to go...), but A- for the first 90%. Then, I simply have to turn it off!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sequel to "Silence of the Lambs"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although ten years have passed since FBI Agent "Clarice Starling" (now played by Julianne Moore) helped capture the serial killer known as Buffalo Bill, the memory of the psychotic psychiatrist named "Hannibal Lector" (Anthony Hopkins) still haunts her. However, she isn't the only person who needs closure as Hannibal's fourth victim, "Mason Verger" (Gary Oldman) has spent a fortune trying to track him down in order to punish him for the ghastly actions that Hannibal committed upon him. And, as luck would have it, an Italian detective named "Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi" (Giancarlo Giannini) believes he has information concerning the location of Hannibal which--for a price of $3 million--he will gladly point him out to Mason's men. What nobody counts on is the fact that Agent Starling is equally committed to having Hannibal brought into custody and that puts her right in the middle of a very dangerous situation. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this sequel to "Silence of the Lambs" wasn't nearly as good as its predecessor. For starters, Julianne Moore failed to attain the same level of excellence for this role as Jodie Foster did in her Academy Award-winning performance. That's not to say that her performance was necessarily bad?but neither was it that extraordinary either. Likewise, although there were certainly some gory scenes, the suspense wasn't nearly as keen and this also had an effect as well. In short, while this film certainly didn't measure up to its predecessor, I still found it somewhat entertaining and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sequel to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS with Julianne Moore taking over Jodie Foster's part... Initially I thought 'I wish they put a couple millions more in the budget just to secure Jodie returning' because even though I REALLY like Julianne Moore this is probably her worst performance ever.I think the problem is that she has to talk with the same thick Texan accent that Jodie did in the original that she gets so focused on getting that right that she lose her eye on making it sound convincingly as well, a lot of actors/actresses have that problem though.She's fine when she's just reacting, looking around etc but that doesn't help much.BUT the worst part of it is that it's horribly written with awful characters (not awful as in bad people just awfully written, even though yes most of them are awful as wel). A big part of the movie takes place in Italy and the Italian actors are terrible, perhaps because they have to speak a language that they seem to barely know and make that seem natural.And they are trying to do too much with the script taking far too much focus away from Hannibal Lecter and Clairice (Juliane Moore) a lot of the times, especially since she's still in the US in the many Italy scenes.And there's no real suspense either, the little there is is just cheap gross out scenes which granted are a bit disturbing at times but more in a I'm getting a queasy stomach feeling than a I'm peeing my pants scared kinda way.Anthony Hopkins is still decent and the black dress Julianne Moore wears is smoking but that is not enough to save this movie, and I understand why Jodie Foster didn't want to do it... If only Hopkins said no as well, perhaps it wouldn't have been made at all.3.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intriguing but disappointing.A sequel to Silence of the Lambs. After an FBI operation doesn't go according to plan and attracts much negative publicity, Agent Clarice Starling is reassigned. She must now track down Hannibal Lecter, who escaped from her custody several years previously. Meanwhile, Lecter is living in Italy. However, an Italian policeman has worked out who he is. One of Lecter's victims (of sorts), Mason Verger, is also out to track him down...There was no way this was ever going to come close to the quality of Silence of the Lambs. Initially, however, director Ridley Scott does give it a good try. The set up was a bit slow but once things started coming together, the moving was quite enthralling. At no stage does it have the psychological aspects and tension of Silence of the Lambs, but it was interesting nevertheless.The conclusion ruins some of this good work, however. The wrap up with the one foe seems rushed, and too easy. Then the wrap up with the other is drawn out too much and has goriness just for the sake of goriness. Throw in a few implausibilities, contrivances and a very shallow attempt at a psychological or philosophical reason for what is going on and the ending is very disappointing.Good work by Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore (replacing Jodie Foster) in the lead roles. Ray Liotta is a quite hammy as Krendler (or maybe his character was just written very badly - could be both). Gary Oldman is in the cast too, but you definitely won't recognise him...Overall, it's okay, but could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do you follow up a masterpiece like Silence of the Lambs? You don't. You just take it in a totally new direction. Hannibal isn't in prison pondering ; he is free and murderous.This film has far more disturbing scenes, including a character's brain being extracted while alive and anesthetized from pain. There's also a scene of Hannibal feeding someone to the pigs. The romantic element of Clarice's relationship with Hannibal is explored quite a bit. Jodi Foster is traded from Julianne Moore, as an older more hardened Clarice and the replacement does a fine job. Anthony Hopkins, thankfully, reprises his role as Hannibal. It's not necessary and it puts shock over substance at times, but it's still recommendable to passionate fans of the first movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best sequel out there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hannibal" had a really tough task to live up to the expectations of its prequel, as it always is, when the original movie is a huge movie classic, i am talking, of course, about "The Silence of the Lambs". Was it bad? No. Did it make a huge positive impact to the franchise? Not really. Don't get me wrong, it is not horrible, but there some major flaws and obvious inferiorities, when compared to the classic.As much as i hate to admit this, i didn't enjoy Hannibal Lecter nearly as much as when he was imprisoned and seemingly incapable of doing anything. His dominant demeanor in "The Silence of the Lambs" just made him look like a god, he was like an indestructible master of manipulation, here he doesn't lose his appearance completely, but he seems a lot more vulnerable and at some parts i just couldn't believe how easily it was for his rivals to trick him, it just isn't relatable to his character. This film used gore in excess, in my opinion, it wasn't as elegant as its prequel, using gore is not necessarily a bad thing to do, just Hannibal Lecter was portrayed differently before so it does not quite fit. The film had many movie making flaws and illogical actions, that were quite annoying and obvious, but i would like to put that aside, because it was more important to see how the things unfold rather than pointing out the flaws. A huge upset is Jodie Foster not returning to play Clarice, not that Julianne Moore was horrible, it just is not the same, Foster was just loved and praised for her role in "The Silence of the Lambs", so that's a slight downgrade. Anthony Hopkins himself was great as Hannibal Lecter, even though as i mentioned above, i didn't enjoy Hannibal Lecter's character here as much as i did before, i still think Hopkins was outstanding in this movie.Unfortunately, this is another case when the sequel of a classic blockbuster movie doesn't come close to its original. I can guarantee you if there never was "The Silence of the Lambs", just "Hannibal" this movie would have a much higher rating than 6.7, at least 7.5. I admit it is a huge concern for me as well and i base my judgement highly on whether the second installment out shined the first or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disfigured Gary Oldman hunts for Anthony Hopkins and so does Julianne Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hannibal" (2001) is a well-executed neo-noir as one would expect of director Ridley Scott operating with a very large budget. The acting is well-done. I was very impressed with the firmness conveyed by Julianne Moore. She plays a very serious FBI agent, without a sense of humor, who constantly has to be strong to contend with those around and above her in the FBI who do not possess her one-sided dedication. Anthony Hopkins as the cannibal Lecter doesn't raise his voice but he is utterly scary and menacing. Because he's a human monster, the film qualifies more as a horror story than a crime story. This film is definitely not for children. Lecter's twisted rationality and his high intelligence make him an unusual monster who can outwit others. Under pressure, he is calm. He is also discriminating in choosing victims and has quite a high degree of self-control. His relationship with Moore is a delicate one involving attraction, respect and a penchant for showing off his superiority before her. He respects her integrity and steadfastness.In this story, Moore is off the screen for some periods as the sub-plots involving Oldman and an Italian police detective, Giancarlo Giannini, are developed. The latter is virtually a separate story only loosely connected to that involving Moore and Oldman. It arises because Hopkins is living in Italy. Ray Liotta plays Moore's antagonistic boss, and that whole aspect of the story is a cliché in Hollywood crime movies. That part of the story lacks originality. Oldman's part is more creative and linked in with Moore's part. He is unrecognizable playing a rich child molester without a face, having disfigured himself under the influence of drugs and Hopkins in the past. Now he wants revenge and has planned a horrible fate for Hopkins if and when he catches him. This involves the use of huge man-eating boars.As with many horror movies, this seems to lack meaningful themes. They seem designed so that audiences can confront vicariously deep fears, live through them, and walk out of the theater or their living rooms. "Hannibal" (2001) more than serves the purpose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because I've always been a huge admirer of the 1990 motion picture 'The Silence of the Lambs', I gave this sequel from 2001 a try. Well, to be honest, I still regret that decision, because Hannibal hurts the original film 'Silence of the Lambs', which is a perfectly executed thriller.It's not because of the lack of any decent storytelling, since the story is already there. We knew that Dr. Hannibal Lecter escaped from his mental institution in a brutal way, and he was wandering around the earth freely, since he gave Agent Starling a call at the end of the Silence of the Lambs. So it's only natural, that there would be a sequel to that unfinished tale. It's a shame that they didn't put on a better effort, because it could've easily been another masterpiece, as well as a sequel of good quality that actually makes sense, storyline wise, because that's exactly what most of the sequels lack. The chemistry between Dr. Lecter and Agent Starling completely lacks in this sequel, and that's the one thing that made the first film exceptionally strong. Jodie Foster declined to take on the role of Starling for the second time. If she hadn't declined, I think the film would've been a lot better, but still not nearly as good as the prequel Silence of the Lambs. Julianne Moore now takes on that role of agent Starling, and although she tries, she just doesn't fit that role. It's that simple. There's no psychological chemistry between her and Anthony Hopkins in this sequel, so there's no decent screenplay.Now if the plot would've gone a bit more in the direction of Silence of the Lambs, with clever twists and psychology, it actually might have been a bit better, but even that couldn't be accomplished here. There are some strong scenes during the film, mainly due to the terrific performance from Hopkins, who portrays Hannibal Lecter perfectly as he always does. He's still the extraordinary clever psychopath; the only problem is that there's no real opponent for him like Foster was as agent Starling in the prequel. That's a pity. When the film finally seems to get a little better during the slot scenes, they completely drop the ball by actually portraying Hannibal as a complete monster that enjoys destroying other human beings in a very brutal way that can make you sick to your stomach. That's what destroys the Hannibal character in my opinion. He should always have been that sick and twisted, but still, in some ways, admirable psychologist who mentally manipulates people. Right here, they have him cut open somebody's skull and feed the guy's own brains to him. That just doesn't feel right compared to the psychological wars that he fights with fellow prisoners during Silence of the Lambs. That's why this film is a complete disappointment to me. While it actually isn't a horrible film in any way, it's just that it kills the psychological dramatic story that made Silence of the Lambs the success that it remains up until this day. If you're a fan of the psychological twists of the Silence of the Lambs, I'd recommend you to avoid this unsatisfying sequel. If you enjoy watching disgusting horror movies, rather than thrillers that are filled with suspense, this may very well be the movie for you. I've got to give credit to Anthony Hopkins however, since he's the only good thing about this film. His performance is just incredible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Every Other Smart Mouth Review, here's a Few Dining Metaphors. While the Original, Silence of the Lambs (1991), was Gourmet Cuisine, this Sequel is like the Hardly Nutritious Fast Food, Tasteless but Filling.Director Ridley Scott and His A-Team of Actors and Writers Serve Up a Gory Horror Movie that is Repulsive yet Watchable, Although Some Sensitives may Purge. It Derives its Playful Pleasures from Over the Top Violence and Brain-Numbing Dark Displays of Grotesque Goings On.Subtlety is Absent in Every Frame as the Filmmakers Go for the Gut, as in Wrenching. But here it is and After All, it is Definitely Not the Original it is a Sequel for Goodness Sake. It Never Even Remotely Tries to be Anything Like it.Anthony Hopkins is Off the Chart, Out of His Mind, and Enjoying Every Minute of Lector's Descent into Ludicrous Caricature and Julianne Moore is Playing Charlice Starling like the Haunted Depressive that She must have Become after Engaging in Mind Games with the Master. She is Barely able to Keep it Together and On Top of that She is Berated at Every Turn by the FBI and Hannibal won't let Her Forget it. She seems Doped Up most of the Time even Before She is Doped Up with Morphine.Overall, this is Grand Guignol Grossness and Gore. But don't for a Minute Think it was Attempting to be Anything but. Underrated Because most were Expecting Silence of the Lambs 2. How Naive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me it beggar's belief that the average rating is less than 7. It seems most viewers preferred Silence of The Lambs. Certainly Silence has more scary moments and qualifies as horror as well as crime. But Hannibal is something very different. The characters are far more well-developed throughout. In fact Hannibal has a rich mix of characters whereas Silence by comparison just runs through the plot. Hannibal is also more beautiful, taking place in Italy as well as the U.S. Before Hannibal was filmed, I was reading the book and imagining what film music would best fit. In particular the need for classical music to match some of the Italian scenery. And when the film finally appeared, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the score more than lived up to my expectations. There is also dark humour here which was definitely to my taste. (Naughty me!)In regard to the changed ending, presumably in response to criticism of the book, I think the ending shouldn't have been changed and Clarice and Hannibal should indeed have sailed off into the sunset. This might offend the idealists, but idealism becomes dangerous if followed too fanatically. Allowing characters unpredictability is in fact essential to their credibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great or perfect sequel, to the real gorehound conisseur, which is the psycho genius himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A long time in the waiting, this sequel, despite a lot of negative reviews is well worth it. While letting Hannibal cramp our comfort, like getting to close for comfort in a few scenes from his predecessor, here he is uncaged, let loose, where we really learn what this brilliant psychopath is capable of, violence wise, and here it's a fear that runs much deeper than Silence Of The Lambs, and we got the violence factor to show for it. How they even gave Hannibal an MA rating in the first place, escapes me. Seriously the censor board ought to be shot. The scenes involving heavy face disfigurement, body mutilations, disembowellments, flying intestines, whatever, plus the infamous brain scene near it's finale, warrants real strong stomach stuff, the higher bar of violence which has been set here, almost coming off as stylistic, suiting the whole air of the film. Check out the cover for starters. A poster design couldn't of been more better suited. The Silence Of The Lambs, was scary, but Hannibal is bloody terrifying, and that I got that air, prefore to going into to see this with my dad. I knew what I was letting myself in for, and like a great tasting dish, I was very much if scarily appeased, if not daring to ask for more. Julianne Moore, who I think is a great actress, can't really replace Clarice Starling, but she still does one hell of a job. She's just not as good, although I liked Moore's interpretation. Oldman who sets acting standards so high, is fantastic as usual, as a rich, perverted slug, Mason Verger who got what he deserved. He's sent a contract out to kill Hannibal, responsible for his grotesque, facial deformity, while getting sozzled one night with the cannibalistic maniac. Oldman's character is repellent. He's into little boys, one scene involving pigs sickened me. An incapacitated Verger, so filled with revenge, enlists Moore to track him down, where of course, nastier plans are set for her. She clashes with an old FBI nemesis, Paul Krendler (a solid Liotta) after an unrelated sting operation goes horribly wrong, and the young wanted assailant dies, clutching her surviving infant in her arms. Liotta's sour history with her had him trying to crack onto her, but remember, our hot shot Clarice, doesn't get involved. Krendler's nastier true colors come to surface later on, where Hannibal is there to right those wrongs, especially at dinner. Notably the brain scene look shockingly awesome and inappropriate to the viewer as a special din din has been prepared by Hannibal for him and his other much specialer guest. We have a sub plot with French cop who makes Hannibal, and with a big reward on offer, sometimes the price of knowledge can be fatal. I loved how this sequel has come, it maintains a high level of terror and suspense, throughout, not like the remade prequel, Red Dragon, which was to follow, a later, unwarranted. You really know you're about to go in, if unconsciously apprehensive of it, to see some something that will really make those hairs on your wrist stand, or get that heart pumping, and on the big screen, that is exactly what you get, proving, Ridley Scott, like his late brother Tony, god rest his soul, are only capable of making hits. As for Hopkins, he was much more scary, caged, behind those bars, those ten years back, with those beady eyes, drilling into yours. He hasn't lost that menace, but like I said, he's scary because we know what he's capable of, and here he's about to really show us how much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not fully up to par with "Silence of the Lambs", "Hannibal" still was more interesting and more fulfilling then "Hannibal Rising". And if you enjoyed "Silence of the Lambs", then you really should do take the time to sit down and watch this movie as well.There is a nice cat-and-mouse feel to the movie, and director Ridley Scott have accomplished to put together an entertaining movie that does bring into the picture some disturbing mindsets and images from time to time.The characters are right on the money and there is some good character development and growth throughout the movie. And the cast that were in the movie were doing good jobs with their given roles. And while Julianne Moore is no Jodie Foster, she still managed to portray Clarice in a fulfilling way. Needless to say that Anthony Hopkins is, of course, fantastic once again in the role of Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter. I was surprised to find out that it was Gary Oldman who was playing Verger; I literally had no idea and just found out in 2014.There is a nice speed to the movie, in the sense that you are never left bored, and the movie does take you on a roller-coaster; sometimes it is fast and brutal, other times slow and seemingly safe (lulling the audience into a false sense of security). There were some nice enough twists and turns along the way, making the movie not overly predictable."Hannibal" is an entertaining movie and a well-worthy addition to the Lecter legacy. And it is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Silence of the Lambs, was a great suspenseful film that kept you on the edge of your seat for the whole film. Hannibal is nothing like The Silence of the Lambs at all. It starts of slow, the actress who played Sterling is different and not very deserving of this role. It takes about forty minutes for blood shed to ensue, until then it's just lots of running around trying to find Hannibal Lecter. I only continued to watch this movie, because Anthony Hopkins makes a great Hannibal. He's calm and collected which is unusual for a serial killer. The plot was shoddy and it was a bunch of fluff in the film, until finally in the end Hannibal the Cannibal finally became himself. This sequel wasn't needed at all for it's lack of action and suspense that was seen in it's prequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the direct sequel to Silence of the Lambs, where the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is hiding in Florence, Italy, unaware that Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), an old victim of his, is seeking revenge. He he plans to draw Lecter out of his hiding place by using disgraced FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) as bait.Like the previous movie, Hannibal has disturbing and graphic scenes - typical for a film featuring Lector. Oldman makes a great villain and Moore did a nice job as Starling, taking the helm from Jodie Foster. However, in a nutshell, this movie lacks the appeal and suspense built-up we've come to know from Silence of the Lambs. The plot really dragged throughout most of the movie and there as also a lack of chemistry between Moore and Hopkins. It's nothing exciting to write home about. Grade D+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Silence of the Lambs is a cold and gritty crime thriller that is the best in its genre. It is so good, in fact, that it is one of only four titles I have given a perfect rating to, the others being Forrest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption and Breaking Bad. The ending was so fascinating that it demanded a sequel. So when I heard there was a sequel and a prequel I was, of course, excited. Unfortunately, the sequel fell flat and felt bland. First, the positive: Julianne Moore was great as Detective Clarice Starling and Anthony Hopkins revived his role, as Hannibal Lector, masterfully. But no matter how well this movie is acted I cant help but notice the lackluster script and sub par plot. First things first, why does half this movie have to take place in Italy? One of the best things about the original was how it had small settings like the prison Hannibal Lector is in and Buffalo Bill's house. But this movie has many places that are sold as so important but just never grip the audience. All the supporting characters are expendable seeing as how half of them die in an anticlimactic way. Plus this movie feels like it is building up to something big, four or five times only to deflate the excitement. This sequel pays no justice to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's ten years after 'The Silence of the Lambs' (1991) and ten years in the story as well. This time Julianne Moore is playing Clarice Starling. Also the director chair has changed. It was Jonathan Demme's, but now it's Ridley Scott's. The only main player that has returned is Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) is an old victim of Hannibal. With new information and his influence, he maneuvers Clarice to chase down Hannibal. Gary Oldman is obviously suppose to provide the new shock value, but he can't take down the master.This was never going to be good enough without Jonathan Demme and especially Jodie Foster. It grinds along slowly. There's a lot of story to get through and a lot of talking. All of it must be tracked closely. It's not as simple as the first one. In this one, there are different people in different story lines in Italy and the U.S. Also there is too much investigating behind computers. There is only so many ways to shoot that compellingly.Anthony Hopkins is as delicious as ever. Giancarlo Giannini is very compelling as Italian police inspector Rinaldo Pazzi. I'm willing to have Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling, but they keep playing those tapes that remind us that she wasn't in the first movie. Ray Liotta is a bad annoying cartoon of a boss. This movie has its moments mostly with Hopkins and Giannini. But it's not enough to have half of a movie.</fullReview>

Anyway...this is really not a bad movie. The scenes with Frankie R. Faison (Dectective Patzzi) are great. The scenes with Anthony Hopkins (Doctor Lecter) are great. The scenes with both of them are...high class. On the other hand....Ray Liotta is a very un--convincing "bad guy". Gary Oldman (Mason Virger) makes the Elephant Man look like a cuddly toy. He is a little cut up. The scenes in Florence (with Hopkins and Faison) are way above the rest of the movie. Lots of viewers did not like the Ray Loitta character eating his own fried brains ...near the end---I liked it----he was a bad guy. It is a real shame that the movie begins with a regulation shoot-out. In fact...until we get to Florence ...this is pedestrian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed but memorable psychological thriller nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I approached Hannibal with an obvious comparison to The Silence of the Lambs, the Oscar-winning prequel which I consider one of my favourite films of all time. Unfortunately, I found Hannibal to be very underwhelming, it does not live up to Silence, which never fails to chill me to the core.The plot starts ten years after the events of Silence of the Lambs. Starling (Julianne Moore) has hit a low point in her career after a botched drug raid. Meanwhile, Mason Verger (played by a virtually unrecognisable Gary Oldman), the only surviving victim of Hannibal Lecter, plans to capture the brilliant serial killer, who is posing as an academic in Florence, where he come under the radar of Inspector Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini).The major weakness of this film was its inability to really scare the audience. It has its moments, the infamous brain-eating scene is prominent, but I feel that the character of Hannibal was over-exposed in this film, IE you see too much of him whereas in Silence, there was very little which made his screen presence so large. As much as Julianne Moore is a good actress, her portrayal of Starling is far removed from the vulnerability that Jodie Foster brought to the role. The film does have its strengths though. Anthony Hopkins and Gory Oldman are both on top-form as the titular protagonist and the deranged Verger. Ray Liotta is also good as the morally ambiguous Krendler. While it doesn't live up to its predecessor, Hannibal is a shocking and memorable thriller</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It couldn't be easy to write a sequel to a film that's become a classic, that too one that is unique in atmosphere, tone and execution. Ridley Scott follows up Jonathan Demme's 'Silence of the Lambs' with 'Hannibal'. Now when one compares both films, easily 'Silence of the Lambs' is the superior film. Then again, both films are different in terms of tone, atmosphere and execution. It's got a great score and some nice shots of foreign locales but the cinematography and lighting are quite ordinary. 'Hannibal' also has a lot more gratuitous violence and gore than the first film.Where writing is concerned, the story is OK. There are several typically Hollywood moments that could have easily been left out. The dialogues stand out especially those loaded with dark humourChoosing Julianne Moore to replace Jodie Foster is an odd decision as the two actresses couldn't be any more different. Moore is a wonderful actress no doubt but her Sterling is very different from Foster's. Anthony Hopkins 's Lecter here is a lot more 'obviously' monstrous than the subtle, chilling and creepy prisoner he was in Demme's film. Then again this could be argued that the beast is on a hunt now that he's out of the cage. Yet, what stands out most is Hopkins's and Moore's interaction. Their scenes together, their dialogue and responses to one another is quite the treat.Ray Liotta and Gary Oldman are adequate. Giancarlo Giannini is quite annoying.Overall, 'Hannibal' is quite a decent thriller especially when one watches it for what it is rather than comparing it with the prequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Ray Liotta, Giancarlo Giannini and Frankie Faison star in Ridley Scott's 2001 thriller sequel based on Thomas Harris' novel. This takes place 10 years after the events of "Silence of the Lambs" and begins with an FBI operation led by agent, Clarice Starling (Moore). After it ends in a massive shootout, Clarice is contacted by sociopath, Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) from Florence, Italy. He's been traveling the world and currently working in Florence as a phony history professor. Meanwhile, a wealthy man, Mason Verger (Oldman) who is one of Hannibal's victims, exacts revenge on him for disfiguring his face. Clarice eventually meets Mason and learns of his plan. Liotta plays Justice Department Lawyer, Paul Krendler who dislikes Clarice and tries to get her suspended out of the bureau by getting involved with Mason's plan. Soon, Hannibal returns home and gets kidnapped by Mason's men. After Mason fails his plan, Hannibal has plans for Paul and tries to woo Clarice. Giannini (Casino Royale) plays Police Inspector, Rinaldo Pazzi who tries to capture Hannibal and Faison (Manhunter) reprises his role as Hannibal's former orderly, Barney. This is my favorite Hannibal film, I like how he's out and about, Anthony and Julianne are great in it and Hans Zimmer's score is excellent as usual. I recommend this good thriller sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've already talked about Hopkins in my review of Silence of the Lambs, so suffice it to say he is just as evil and monstrous in this film as in the last, if not more so. I was disappointed, as I think everyone was, that Ms. Foster did not agree to reprise her role as Clarice Starling, but Julianne Moore does an excellent job. Frankie Faison is consistent in his role as Barney, the kindly nurse who placed the chair opposite Lecter's cell in the first film, and in this one he is caught by Clarice auctioning off the remainders of Lecter's belongings. Most of the action is around Lecter and his intricate game of chess with Verger, played exceptionally by Gary Oldman, but the three subplots are brought together in the end, and an unexpected end at that. Ridley Scott, the director of such Sci Fi classics as Blade Runner and Alien, does not disappoint, and this film retains all the darkness and foreboding of the former. A must have for the collectors of Hopkins, crime dramas, and horror films. Rated R for gore, violence, language, and horrific scenes that are sure to give any sane man or woman nightmares.</fullReview>

The rest of the cast was equally as good, but the story was a bit odd. Out of the four Lecter movies, this is the one that doesn't really fit. I didn't like the whole overseas aspect, although the manhunt was good. Clarice Starling was a completely different character and it had nothing to do with that fact that another woman was playing her. Juliana Moore did a great job, but Starling, wasn't the same Starling we came to love in Silence of The Lambs.

		<shortDescription>Revolted by the Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I purposefully read Thomas Harris' novels, The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal in sequence in order to gain a better understanding the films. In SOTL I found the film and book to be in great sync with one another, despite what other reviewer's might have said. Hannibal was good, but I say this as I have not yet read Red Dragon. But, I was disappointed at the ending. While I don't agree with everything from the novel, I don't appreciate the dialogue between Hannibal and Starling in the film. It is as if Starling loses her interest in Hannibal simply because she is seeing him do what he does best: KILL. She seems put off by the characteristics in which she is drawn to in Hannibal in the first place. I have always loved the relationship between the two of them, and in Hannibal the film, you miss that. The part of the novel where Hannibal gets Starling to open up about her father, and where Hannibal thinks of Mischa, are important and help us to further understand the actions behind the characters decisions. The film lacks that. I also thought Julianne Moore was a poor Starling. Jodie Foster was perfect. She had the look in her eyes that made you, as a viewer, believe she was almost dazzled by Lecter, as Lecter was dazzled by her. I do not see that with Moore. I also did not like how Jack Crawford's character was depicted, or what little depiction he DID have, in either version (film or novel). In summation- the book was good, the movie was slightly better than terrible. I think SOTL set up a very original and unique viewpoint of the serial killer obsession and draw in our society, and Hannibal let that uniqueness vanish- as well as it did so in the novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is superb, i strongly believe that those that didn't enjoy it did not or perhaps cannot appreciate its finer points. I don't know what people were expecting but i watched this alone and still gave a round of applause when the credits rolled.Its a deep and interesting story because while Hannibal is a killer, and of course a gruesome cannibal, everyone he killed in some way deserved it, and if you've read the books you will know that the trauma Hannibal suffered as a child goes a long way to excuse him. So the films begs the viewer the question as to his morality, and his punishment if any at all. The viewer perhaps will grow to like Hannibal, and so will be presented with many philosophical quandaries as the film progresses, would they rather see him jailed or free, alive or dead?Hannibals interaction with Agent Starling is a fascinating one, wrought with sexual and psychological tension as agent Starling and the viewer both *feel* that Hannibal wouldn't harm her, but you are never quite sure and neither is she.The pace of the film builds up to a climactic finish which doesn't give itself away until the very end. You are always guessing, will they run away together? will he kill her? will she kill him? will she hand him into the police? will he escape? Watch it and see.I would say that this film doesn't hold your hand, there are a lot of finer details which may be unappreciable to those who haven't read the books or at least seen the "dragon rising" movie which explains Hannibals childhood. Many will be dismayed by the end because they think that Hannibal is meant to be a cardboard cut out villain, he isn't, and they're wrong, this is a fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Does Not Hold A Candle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jodie Foster decided not to reprise her role as Clarice Starling in the movie,Hannibal which happens to be the sequel to Silence Of The Lambs.That led to the demise of the film from attaining into becoming a cinema masterpiece.Hannibal is based on the sequel novel of the same name by Thomas Harris. It is the much-anticipated follow-up to the Oscar-winning The Silence of the Lambs.While Foster does not return,Anthony Hopkins returns as Dr. Hannibal Lecter - one of the world's most cunning and feared serial killers.He resurfaces after a decade in hiding to toy with FBI agent Clarice Starling,who was portrayed instead by Julianne Moore. As Starling's career flounders thanks to a drug bust gone wrong, Lecter attempts to elude a greedy Italian police detective who's willing to alert the authorities to his presence in Florence for a price. In the meantime, a maimed but wealthy former victim of Lecter's named Mason Verger,played by Gary Oldman plans to get his revenge on Lecter in a most unusual and grisly fashion. It remains true that Lecter has become an iconic serial killer in cinema and there is no actor who can portray that role aside from Hopkins.In this film,he does not disappoint.The cinematography was also worthy of mention since the movie was shot in Florence,Italy which happens to be one of the great places in the world. It provides class to the film.Also,worthy of mention are the performances of the other actors involved in the film like Oldman as Verger and Ray Liotta as the official the Verger bribes.The direction was also done well by the reliable Ridley Scott. With the reasons mentioned,the movie provides great entertainmentBut what made the movie fall short from becoming a cinema masterpiece? After Jodie Foster passed on the role of Clarice Starling,many actresses have tried to secure the role like Angelina Jolie, Hilary Swank and Ashley Judd.Hopkins tried to make an influence on casting the new Clarice and she chose Julianne Moore.That choice did have some effect on their chemistry as Moore and Hopkins lacked it when communicating together as Hannibal and Clarice.It fell short as compared to Hopkins chemistry with Foster.Another thing about it is that Clarice was known to have become an intelligent woman from Silence has become a vulnerable and tough one in this movie.Although Moore did well in her performance,the new Clarice is far from what the viewers know especially to the fans of Silence of the Lambs. Aside from Moore's portrayal,the movie also fell short in providing suspense and tension in the story.In summary,Hannibal does not hold a candle to Silence Of The Lambs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its been almost ten years and the face of Lekter still lives alive in our mind. The movie has the same psycho thriller environment throughout. The direction is again good but I felt that it lacked a great script. The movie obviously had so much expectations from me and would have from you as well but it don't cross the mark of the silence of the lambs and is a low down. Anthony Hopkins is again brilliant and scary. The movie is creepy in its own way again. Julianne Moore has nicely replaced Jodie Foster. The presence of Hannibal is more and it makes it better. The story was weaker but a rise in gore factor can be seen. On whole the movie is interesting and I've never felt any series having better psycho-thriller environment. Hannibal is definitely creepier than other psychos as without much use of gore he's able to penetrate through the mind. A good sequel definitely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great tale about reality and illusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film with a single character: The Master of Ceremonies. An ambiguous spell and walls of illusion. Subtle exploration of chimera and fall of an era. A special inebriation and columns of words, songs, dreams, love, lies, freedom, hypocrisy and serial murders like shield against terrible future. Nothing real, nothing splendid or ugly. Only the believe in miracle and in art to build another tomorrow. Hannibal Lecter- in a magnificent role- is the almighty puppeteer. Master of show, maker of sins, lenient, sarcastic, cruel, brutal, ambiguous, a vulnerable androgynous god, he is the incarnation of Old Greek anenke. So, the film, cobweb of lights, smiles, blood and promises, good intentions and fear, is not pledge for classical "Life is theater play" or "Life is dream" but for the painful "Life is only refined lie". Gary Oldman and his husband,the charming Francesca Neri,the wistful innocent Ray Liotta, are victims of same illusion who can be skin of reality.Beautiful film. Gorgeous music. Great acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A sequel to the 1991 Academy Award-Winning Film 'The Silence of the Lambs', 'Hannibal', Directed Superbly by Ridley Scott, is a gripping &amp; gory psychological thriller, that also offers an amazing performance by Sir Anthony Hopkins, who returns as Hannibal Lecter.Set ten years after it's prequel, the premise is that Lecter is determined to capture, torture, and kill his only surviving victim, Mason Verger, played by Gary Oldman.'Hannibal' isn't as memorable as it's prequel, because, the sequel is too dark &amp; violent. In fact, this box-office blockbuster is not meant for the faint-hearted, at all. I, truly feel, if lesser violent, it's impact as a film, would have only enhanced.The Adpated Screenplay by David Mamet &amp; Steven Zaillian, is engaging. Ridley Scott's Direction is absolutely Superb. Cinematography is attractive. Editing is fair. Make-Up, deserves a special mention. Art Design is adequate.Performance-Wise: Sir Anthony Hopkins is amazing as the twisted serial killer. The Impeccable Actor once again, leaves you spell-bound, with his portrayal as Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore as FBI Agent Clarice Starling, is effective. Gary Oldman is excellent. Ray Liotta is passable. Giancarlo Giannini leaves a mark. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Hannibal' is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the monumental success of The Silence of the Lambs in 1991 it was evident that a sequel was necessary. In 1999 Thomas Harris wrote Hannibal as a sequel to his previous book. After a lot of rocky production the film adaptation of that novel was released two years later. It was a difficult film to get off the ground because of Jonathan Demme's declining of the directors chair and Jodie Foster's iffy return as Clarice Starling. The producers scored Ridley Scott to helm the film almost by sheer luck and were also able to keep the incredible Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. Jodie Foster eventually declined the role and Julianne Moore was recast as Starling. And so the film did end up getting its release, receiving mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike.Hannibal picks up ten years after The Silence of the Lambs. Clarice Starling's career is on the decline and Lecter has been in hibernation in Italy ever since his escape during the Buffalo Bill fiasco. Starling is determined to regain her reputation by tracking down and capturing Lecter. However, there is another deviant who wants to do the same. Mason Verger, the horribly deformed yet still living victim of Lecter's plans his gruesome revenge, getting in the way of Starling's investigation. And so begins the harrowing search for Lecter, a psychopath ready to come out of retirement and return to the public eye as the fiendishly evil Hannibal the Cannibal.Words like disgusting, visceral, gruesome, and shocking only begin to describe the horrors which Hannibal possesses and displays in two hours of deranged disgust.This is a movie where you have to take it as it is and accept some of the facts. I'm talking, mainly, about certain things beyond the films control like recastings. The absence of Jodie Foster is a major disappointment for the film. As much as I like Julianne Moore, she is no Jodie Foster. The most bothersome thing about her performance is her attempts to be like Jodie Foster, especially in an accent that Foster mastered, but Moore attempted with half-hearted effort. Her accent drops in and out during the film and so does her attitude and persona. I couldn't accept that this character was still Clarice Starling, a character that was played to such perfection by Foster. The films replacement of director was also a bit disappointing. Jonathan Demme shot The Silence of the Lambs in such an intense and harrowing style that I couldn't see anyone else getting right. Ridley Scott turns Hannibal into more of an action film than a suspense. Hannibal doesn't have the same atmosphere as The Silence of the Lambs and I'm not sure that it even tried. It seems Scott went in a much different direction here and it is a direction that is interesting, while not as masterful as what Demme did in his film. But again, these are all circumstances more or less beyond the films control.There are flaws in Hannibal that are within the films control. It has a script that is sharp and sophisticated at times, while also a little ridiculous at other times. I enjoyed the plot of Hannibal for what it was, but I can't deny that it grows more and more absurd as it draws closer to the end. The film tends to focus more on being shockingly gruesome rather than making sense. A lot of insanity is thrown our way as the plot develops and it becomes less and less believable. The film isn't difficult to follow and it always stays rooted in a loose sense of believability, but many scenes are a bit of a stretch, making this film more exploitive than artistic like its predecessor.But despite all its flaws Hannibal is a devilishly entertaining film. Its disgusting and visceral intensity delivers more than enough thrills to satisfy an appetite for sickening violence. I couldn't help but enjoy the film for what it was. I really only figured these flaws in retrospect. During the film I had a great time and was well entertained, albeit horrified. As a Hannibal Lecter film Hannibal is not quite as good as the masterpiece that came before it, but it is so much fun and it allows us to get the most out of the incredible Anthony Hopkins as one of the most fascinating villains of all time. Hannibal is a great watch despite all of its flaws. For anyone with a weak stomach they will surely hate this film, but I greatly enjoyed it as another sickening addition to the always intriguing Hannibal Lecter franchise.</fullReview>

It has an interesting start, but quickly descends into the weird and confusing.

		<shortDescription>Slick, but grotesque; somewhat convoluted and overwhelming the first time, but engaging; mesmeric, but uneven ? Hannibal is wild but watchable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal is a gloriously looking, truly beautiful film about some grim, truly ugly people. It's a confusing juxtaposition that has torn people between hating it and rather liking it; I myself have seen it three to four times over the years but remarkably, remain in a certain state of not being necessarily too fond of it. Whilst the locations of the Virginian outback and the streets of Florence are shot exquisitely, with a mesmeric soundtrack, most of the characters in Hannibal possess a sense of evil; of wrong-doing; of ugliness, and in two particular male characters of a law-enforcing nature, they can possess these attributes whilst maintaining an outer shell of rugged handsomeness. This, as the photogenic female lead has to deal with a public shaming following a chaotic opening gunfight, as inner-demons threaten to feast away at her. The film is one-part chase thriller as the titular character remains constantly on the run; one-part journey of redemption; one-part detective thriller as one man goes it alone in tracking someone down and one-part revenge tale.But there is that sense of pantomime, or melodrama, when Anthony Hopkins' legendary screen character Dr. Hannibal Lecter is revealed as a physical presence for the first time; he turns to face us, the perspective is just to the side of the character of Renaldo Pazzi (Giannini), an Italian police officer, and there is that overly dramatic sense in us knowing who he is but the hapless supporting character not. This is all just before it is revealed Lecter is gunning for a job as a sort of curator at a centuries old library in Florence, and that his predecessor has mysteriously vanished only recently. To a degree, it all sort of works in its own odd little screwball way. Both Harris' 1999 book and this 2001 adaptation seem to warm to the character of Lecter without embracing him, and in titling the film 'Hannibal', the piece moves away from other series titles such as Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs; two headings that were linked to both the plight and internal difficulties of the serial killing antagonist The Tooth Fairy and lead Clarice Starling, respectively.Clarice Starling is indeed back but is played by Julianne Moore, who does a relatively fine job. Curiously, rather than distance itself from 1991's popular and vastly acknowledged work of brilliance The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal makes the curious decision to evoke immediate, somewhat nostalgic, memories of said film in having Starling play back all the old tapes from when she interviewed Lecter. It's an odd reference to the previous film, an early 'getting out of the way' if you like of texts of old. But there's a sense that the film has its own identity anyway, and eventually comes across as being split into two distinct halves; a sequence, of which, at the beginning of the second half that sees Lecter chased around by some mercenaries employed by disgruntled past-Lecter victim Mason Verger (Oldman). They have it in mind to capture him so that Verger may wreck a horrid revenge, and it's an important sequence, a shifting of power as to where the film's chief levels of antagonism will arise. Previously, Verger was rendered deformed after an altercation with Lecter many years ago; in the process made to look a freak on the outside and just as ugly as on the inside when it arises he had engaged in prior acts of paedophilia, but is now mostly confined to a wheelchair; further still trapped within his huge manner house and vast acres of land.The multi-strand approach initially sees Lecter based in Italy, giving away his whereabouts following the sending of a letter to Clarice, who is going through her own crisis of confidence with the F.B.I. following a market place shoot out in which an agent is killed. Starling is again struggling with the sexual advances that come with working within the male dominated world in which she operates, with the film making a point as to capture fellow agent Paul Krendler's (Liotta) glances at her in a meeting very early on while later; his physical position within the room they are talking sees him sit himself on a desk, thus looming over a sitting Starling when criticising those of Lecter's kind in that they have a taste for items of a high art nature and therefore are bound to be somewhat strange.For the best part, the film is a Florence-set pot boiler revolving around Pazzi's attempts at dealing with Lecter who's operating under a pseudonym. The very gradual realisation and plan of action Pazzi puts into operation in capturing Lecter is constructed nicely, director Scott applying a fair amount of menace in having Lecter come across as someone whom may or may not know of Pazzi's plan. Scott additionally applies a variety of long shots at the most heightened of times; a telephone call to the F.B.I. ends with a shot of an entire plaza and that uneasy, mystical sense that someone may by out there amongst the array of busy bodies, observing what he's done; indeed heard the entire conversation if that were at all possible. There's a certain disturbing poetry to most of Lecter's murders in Hannibal, in that each victim evicts some sort of sinful tendency in their aims prior to their demise; be it lust, wrath or greed. It's easier to associate oneself with Lecter in the film as this wondering, loose serial killer but in making those around Lecter so unrelatable, the film rather brilliantly avoids rendering Lecter neither a romanticised figure nor someone we ought to feel natural affection toward. The film is uneven in tone, and pulls out the sort of gross content that sees it severely clash with most of its overall look, but as a pulpy tale of a killer on the loose; a vengeful past victim and a righteous detective on the hunt, Hannibal just about makes the grade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Blood and More Hannibal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal is a follow up to The Silence of the Lambs and actually is a pretty good film. It is more bloody and gory but also it has Hannibal on screen more and that is a good thing.The basic plot involves Hannibal Lector. He is living in another country and the only person to survive an attack from him, Mason Verger, wants to capture him and kill him. Clarice Starling, not played by Jodie Foster but instead by Julianne Moore, gets involved as well.I like this film a lot because you get to see more of Hannibal. Anthony Hopkins is great as him once again, I think he was better in Silence of the Lambs though. Lector does a lot of killing, and conversing. He truly is as gifted a speaker as he is a killer.Julianne Moore plays Clarice Starling in this film rather than Jodie Foster. I strongly prefer Foster, and Moore to me just did not do it for me. So that character I feel was much better in The Silence of the Lambs.This Film has a lot more gore in it than Silence did. Some of it gets quite graphic and this film may disturb some viewers. But the whole film is not a gore fest, just towards the last half an hour or so.The story is pretty good and somewhat easy to understand. I just like how a lot of it involved Hannibal Lector.Overall, I like this film. I recommend it to viewers, just be warned that there are some disturbing scenes towards the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as Silence of the Lambs, but still an above-average thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this one. A tale of revenge on the part of one of Hannibal's former patients, and a tale of redemption for Julianne Moore's Clarice Starling, this film works on these polite levels and more. The setting of most of the film, in Italy, lends a feeling of dramatic tragedy and is well-served by its inclusion in this movie. If the movie has weakness, it may be the dullness of the inter-office politics int he beginning of the film (though, yes, I know that it is an important component in establishing her motivations for the rest of the film). Also, the movie could have left out the unrequited romance between Starling and her FBI boss, played by Ray Liotta. For those who keep score, if I had to rank them I'd say Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, then Red Dragon (a remake of the original Manhunter). Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it's disgusting, and Jodie Foster isn't in it. But apart from that, this is a very good movie.Obstacle n°1 that kept me from appreciating it the first time around is -- yes, Julianne Moore brings a classical beauty (sort of) and her own kind of moral strength to the 'Starling' role. This time it's supercooled woman, not snotty-nosed little girl against the beast. Of the two, the rookie was more likable. In the Lecter-Starling tapes that were re-recorded with Moore, she sounds super-self-controlled -- all reflections on that earlier, more vulnerable self are gone. Pity, because it could have reflected how Starling has changed, and added depth to her character. But hers is not the starring role, anyway -- Mason Verger and the city of Florence outshine, or rather out-darken everything else, including the famous Dr Lecter, M.D. I only would have wished this great villain a better death.Where 'Silence of the Lambs' was unnerving, 'Hannibal' is really straining to the point of nausea. It's not a movie one can easily fall in love with, because it's de-romanticizing the idol Lecter and putting him in the same club as Jeffrey Dahmer. No wonder some people find it disappointing. But get away from Lecter-worship and the image of Jodie-who, forget Thomas Harris's novel, and you'll not be bored. You'll still need a strong stomach, though.</fullReview>

Either way, I suppose it's not that important. This thing is quite entertaining, but pretty much loses me in its grand finale. I know Clarice Starling(a not-so-bad Julianne Moore) is supposed to be obsessed by Lecter but her actions are just downright annoying and naive. I know Lecter always has to win like he's freakin' McGyver or something, but they could have handled it a bit better. This sequel has a lot less of that tensed atmosphere, but tries to cover it up by picking up the pace a little, and there are quite a lot of bodies piling up. It makes things look like a pretty standard thriller, which I think the makers would probably settle for. Okay crowdpleaser, not a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand all the hate towards this movie... I know it's not better or even comes close to the great "Silence of the Lambs" but it's a sequel that tried to explain and explore Lecter's motives. The movie does not centers around another crime to be solved, instead it focuses on the intense relationship between Lecter and Clarice.But this time around there isn't a deep interesting plot, the movie focuses mainly on violence and Lecter's violent conduct. But the character exploration is pretty interesting and should please Hannibal fans.The acting is pretty good; Hopkins OWNS the character while Julianne Moore is extremely solid. Gary Oldman shins as always although we don't see his face that much...you know what I mean.There are disturbing moments that should be remembered for the high violence and gore content but actually fit well in the movie.I recommend this movie only for fans of the Hannibal Lecter character or for those who enjoyed "Silence of the Lambs". Otherwise, you won't enjoy it that much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Lecter Has Returned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thomas Harris is a great author, just as Ridley Scott (The Gladiator) is a great director. Hannibal is fantastic. Another great entry into the story of Hannibal Lecter.Ridley Scott's "Hannibal" is ten years after "Silence of the Lambs", we see a fugitive Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in Florence, Italy, hiding under the name of "Dr. Fell". He is in what he describes as "retirement". Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) has been disgraced for shooting a criminal while she is carrying her child, she soon gets called back on the Lecter case when a disfigured millionaire and survivor of Dr. Lecter's murder spree, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), claims to have new information on Hannibal Lector but is also plotting for revenge. Dr. Lecter returns to America to "return to public life", see Starling and survive the vindictive Mason Verger's plan for revenge.I understand the mixed reviews but I disagree with the negatives. "Hannibal" was a well acted film but I have to say that I was disappointed with the ending. Julianne Moore (The Forgotten) did well but I liked Jodie Foster better in the role. Ray Liotta (Goodfellas) is good in the role of Paul Krendler and Anthony Hopkins (The Silence of the Lambs) has not lost the ability to give you a feeling of terror while playing the cannibalistic psychiatrist. Fans should not be disappointed.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly complicated yet insanely intriguing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing about "Hannibal" -- sequel to the Oscar winning "Silence Of The Lambs -- is that it's a pretty tough movie to sit through. Tough, not because of it's graphic nature, but because of it's overall lack of focus. Ridley Scott's take on Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter can't decide if it's a horror, a romance, a cop-drama or a suspense-thriller. It's got a good balance of all of them, but jumps around far too much, carries too many sub-plots and never comes across with a clear sense of purpose. No statement to be made, just a well-made, well-acted, gorgeous looking film that leaves the viewer, after over two and a half hours spent, wanting more.Anthony Hopkins returns to his signature role, and is spot-on. No fault can be found in his performance here, and you will find that he actually plays the character down a bit compared to the sometimes flamboyant, over-the-top performance he gave ten years prior. Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster as the resilient Clarice Starling, and although the script doesn't allow her character much dimension (no more than what was already established in "Silence Of The Lambs, at least) she does a fine job replacing Foster as a character so ingrained in pop-culture that she was almost impossible to recast. Ray Liotta plays her smarmy boss with ease, while Gary Oldman, completely unrecognizable (especially given that he goes uncredited) plays a very disturbing, very hilarious and very disfigured victim of Hannibal's, offering a generous reward to anyone who can deliver the good doctor to him. The directing by Ridley Scott delivers plenty of atmosphere and memorable visuals, enough so to warrant repeated viewings. Also, the score, by Hans Zimmer, is especially classy and utterly breath-taking. It's the script -- based off of an already sketchy novel -- that the problems stem from. It seems to me, if one is to make a sequel to such a highly regarded piece as "Silence Of The Lambs" -- whether it be in book or movie form -- it should at least have a solid story that holds water. This does not. As mentioned before, the movie can't decide what it wants to be, and the story jumps around so much that by the third act, it's exhausted itself. There are plenty of good ideas in "Hannibal", it's just too bad no one could sort them into cohesion. Regardless, it's got good performances and brilliant direction, so despite the fact that it doesn't live up to it's predecessor, "Hannibal" is still worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal is directed by Ridley Scott, based on the novel by Thomas Harris, has music by Hans Zimmer and stars Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Ray Liotta and Giancarlo Giannini Picking up a few years where Silence of The Lambs left off, this sequel finds F.B.I agent Clarice Starling (this time played by Julianne Moore) in trouble after a drug arrest(which she was in charge of) ended in a shootout resulting in several deaths.Clarice receives a personal letter from the escaped Dr.Lecter(Anthony Hopkins)now living in Italy.She learns he has started killing again and working with the Italian police and the F.B.I she sets out to bring him down once and for all.Although not as good as Silence of The Lambs, this is very creepy and well acted and there's some beautiful photography and locations and a good music score as well.Julianne does a fine job of stepping into Jodie Foster's shoes as Starling(though it would have made the film so much better if Jodie reprised her role.)Julianne's Starling is very tough and she is particularly good in the many action scenes .Hannibal is very gory and graphic compared to the first film, this one shows us why Hannibal was locked up in the first place and how awful his crimes have been and are now. This makes the film just another run of the mill serial killer film, the story loses it's psychological edge and just doesn't feel as creepy or realistic as The Silence Of The Lambs does.There's fine support from Gary Oldman as the disfigured Mason Verger who is the only known survivor of Lector's attacks, Verger hires people to track Lecter down and kill him in revenge. In this case the novel is much better than the film and it does lose something in the recasting of Agent Starling, despite that it's a good thriller and is a very good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Further Exploits of a Hannibal Lecter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ten years after Clarice Starling first encountered the evil Hannibal Lecter, we finally receive a sequel to one of my favorite movies. I'd read the novel right after its release and I become pumped to see the movie when it was finally released in theaters. As I stated, I was a major fan of the first film and the idea of a second movie, centering completely on one of my favorite movie characters, was appealing. Long after his escape in Memphis, Hannibal Lecter finds himself living in Florence, Italy, where he is the running to become the curator for a major library. In America, Clarice Starling has just endured a major blow to her career in the FBI as a drug bust goes terribly wrong. As a result, she is returned to the Hannibal Lecter case at the prompting of millionaire (and one of Lecter's only surviving victims) Mason Verger, who has his own plans for the doctor.The novel was somewhere around 600-pages and had a strong, in-depth storyline...much more than they could ever hope to fit into the average feature film. So a good portion of the book was trimmed for the film, though they left most of the major aspects in place (though some parts were modified from the original story). Even still, by fitting so much into the film, I definitely felt the running time during some scenes. I felt that when the focus shifted to Florence and Italian detective Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini), the film slowed to a crawl for the following 45 minutes. The film's overall pacing seems to speed up and slow down randomly throughout the course of the film. Visually, though, the film is beautiful and done well.This film is missing two major aspects of the first: director Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling. In my opinion, yeah Demme's great, but Ridley Scott is better and it was awesome having him direct this film. As for Foster, I would have preferred to have her reprise her role but Julianne Moore did a good job of filling in the role. Anthony Hopkins returns as the titular character and continues to show why Lecter is one of my favorite film characters. The man is evil, charismatic, and (despite his history of eating people) so damned likable. Aside from Hopkins, the real highlight of this movie for me was Gary Oldman as the disfigured Mason Verger. I don't know what it is about that guy but I love his performances in eccentric roles.I loved the blend of grisly violence and elegant sophistication in this film. In one scene, you're seeing Lecter's charming side as he wins the position of library curator; later, you're watching as one of Lecter's enemies is hung/disemboweled. You've got to love it. All of these aspects come together to form a movie that's good but not great. It's an entertaining way to spend a little more than 2 hours and it gives you a good feel for the twisted killer, but the film has it's flaws that make it a film I can only watch once in a while because of it's pacing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal, the follow up to Silence of the Lambs, is pretty good. Now, I just have to say, Julianna Moore cannot replace Jodie Foster, but she sure did a good job, and came close to being on par, its just that her character isn't the same because its not Jodie Foster. That being said, the film is pretty good, better than I expected actually. Anthony Hopkins as always gives an outstanding performance. He is so creepy and bizarre, its just great. Ray Liotta also does good, but that actually goes for most of the cast in the movie. Its a great thriller and good follow up. However, unlike silence of the lambs, which was more subtle with the outright violence, this is much more gruesome and cringe worthy, especially one scene (sure to shock viewers). A must see in for anyone who liked Silence of the Lambs or a fan of thrillers. I rate this 7/10. Rated R for Strong gruesome violence, some nudity and language</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The entire film was nearly a masterpiece, but for the weak performance turned in my Julianne Moore. Any of the other actresses considered for the part would have done better. It's a shame, but this film suffered for her presence. The performance of Sir Hopkins makes it worth watching aside from that.Better perhaps would be to watch Red Dragon. Solid performances from both Hopkins and Norton make it a film worth watching more so than this supposed 'sequel' to Silence of the Lambs. That said, any of these movies is better than the later release "Hannibal Rising" which was a terribly acted, poorly produced, piece of third-world celluloid trash unworthy of the "Hannibal" moniker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A whole new approach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Silence of the Lambs" is and will always be one of the best thrillers ever made. To expect from its sequel to be equally brilliant is a bit unrealistic. Almost everything changed in this movie; the only thing that stayed is amazing Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. Here, in very original title, "Hannibal" we've got new Agent Starling (I really like Julianne Moore but Foster was perfect in that role so no actress could replace her), new director, new places and a whole new approach to Dr.Lecter. In first movie, Lecter was mostly behind glass, here he's free to go around the world. He chooses Florence and I say who wouldn't? My favorite parts of this movie are all the ones in Italy where we have one of the greatest Italian actors Giancarlo Giannini in role of Insp.Pazzi. Giannini had the hardest job of the whole cast and he plays his role in a great way. List of familiar faces concludes with unrecognizable Gary Oldman as one of Lecter victims and Ray Liotta as dirty agent. I almost forgot beautiful Francesca Neri, unknown to American audience.Ridley Scott changed Demme on directing seat and I must say that that wasn't a perfect solution. This movie gets lost in its length and in its characters who are not well made. There is really nothing to act for main actors and that is the biggest minus of this movie (when I remember long scenes of Lecter-Starling conversation in that institution). "Hannibal" turns on card of scare. It supposes to be scary Oldman's appearance, Hopkins cutting and killing; serving brains all around or pigs eating people. Well, to me, it wasn't. Solid acting of Hopkins, Moore and Giannini holds this movie from break up and great scenes in Italy just puts it above water. For something more I advise you to look first part again or third one with Norton &amp; co.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enough's As Good As A Feast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When cinema produces an absolute classic like 'Silence Of The Lambs', it's asking a lot to take the material and do something as good, never mind better. Sometimes a sequel actually is superior, as in 'Terminator', 'Star Wars' and 'Aliens'. Something that was missing from the first outing because of budgetary constraints, availability of effects or whatever, can be put into a follow-up and just give it that very special edge. Other times it is a big, big mistake, or just a blatant attempt to cash-in on the overwhelming success of its original.This item appears to fall into both of those latter categories.In 'The Silence' we were spared most of the brutality of Hannibal Lecter. It was either glimpsed, shot at a distance, or implied. But here we get the full monty. There were times when I felt impelled to look away from the screen. It was needless, tasteless and crude.Secondly, the shock value of what wily Dr L could do was fresh and new in the original. We saw this intelligent beastly man doing his stuff for the first time. Here; it was just business as usual, with the graphic excess thrown in to make up the original shock quota.In short, a truly spellbinding classic was reduced to a cheap slasher. Hanny Lecter was seen as no more than Freddy Kruger with arty pretensions. Oh-yes, we got the sweeping, luxurious camera-work, the indulgent, incidental mood-music of orchestral and Gregorian choral tracts. It was suitably dark in that Hammer-like Gothic style. And it was long and slow and tedious in a way that was intended to create atmosphere, but instead demonstrated that Ridley Scott knew there'd be plenty of bums on seats merely because of the movie's title, so he could squander a bit of celluloid to play us along for a little while. It would give us the feeling that we'd actually seen a clever, thoughtful movie instead of a shabby generic cash-in.I missed a few minutes of the ending, in pursuit of a nice cup of tea, but returned to see Lecter's face gradually vignetting on the screen like a malevolent Cheshire Cat, until only his eye was visible before the credits rolled. It was surely warning that we might expect a three-quel should this crap turn over enough wonga.Anthony Hopkins so completely made Dr Lecter's persona his own that a movie about 'Hannibal' could hardly have been made without him. Clearly, he was given an offer her couldn't refuse to do the business again, which hardly does his own discernment credit. Jodie Foster, on the other hand, had the self-respect and good sense not to reprise her role as Clarice Starling. Much more credit to her judgement. Instead, Julianne Moore vainly attempted to fill her 'cheap shoes' and gave as unmemorable and lacklustre a performance as this effort deserved. Ray Liotta was wheeled-in as a spare 'big name' but seemed a little lost in the absence of an entourage of wise-guys. Beyond them the most prominent others were largely misshapen, ugly unknowns, who merely served as side-dishes for Hannibal's grisly menu. If you enjoy good quality movies irrespective of their subject material, then you probably thrilled to 'The Silence' just as I did. And in that case I would counsel you not to watch this follow-up as it rather sullies the memory and uniqueness of the original. But if you ain't so picky, if you're disinclined to care when someone draws a moustache on the Mona Lisa, or if you rate Freddy Kruger as the stuff of Oscars, then you'll probably think this is good, with blood.I didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal in the playground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hannibal" was blasted by critics and moviegoers alike. Mainly their expectation was to see another version of "Silence of the Lambs". Well, those critics failed to see that this is an interesting variant on Hannibal Lecter outside the asylum, with his freedom. I really enjoyed Scott's adaptation and his flair of making Hannibal hypnotic and riveting. The dramatic elements were done wonderfully and as usual Scott's trademark cinematography provided an elegant look while Zimmer's score was beautiful, mature and effectively hammered down.I do admit the flaws in the movie, and in fairness to Scott, his approach was from the script he had to work with and he didn't have the fear of audience to the unknown character since he was already introduced in Silence of the Lamb. So what he did was try to instil terror but more likely came out as gruesome with some of the essence stripped despite being faithful to the book.Hannibal provides a different spin and works on its own making the audience wonder what is to follow from the trails made from the story that eventually intersect at one point. Anthony Hopkins once again provides a stellar performance that he seems to relish it here. Nevertheless, it is a slick and chilling ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Film but A Letdown Compared to the Others in the Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like most people, got into the Hannibal Lecter series from The Silence of the Lambs which I would say is one of the best films of all time. After that, I saw Hannibal Rising which wasn't as good but I still thoroughly enjoyed quite a bit. Then came Red Dragon, the second best of the series in my opinion but still not as good as SOTL. I still haven't see Manhunter but I finally sat down and Hannibal for the first time tonight and I am a little let down to be quite honest. It didn't seem to get it right for some reason and left me wanting more. It's a good movie all in all but I think it could have been a lot better.The story is decent but definitely weak compared to Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. Anthony Hopkins is great Hannibal Lecter, as usual, so no surprises there. Julianne Moore was good, I'm not gonna deny that, but she was no where near as good as Jodie Foster for the role and I'm pretty disappointed that Foster didn't reprise her role because it could have only made the film better as a whole. I also liked the gore in this one and effects. It's a pretty good way to spend a couple hours if you have nothing else to do.If you're a completest like I am, you probably want to see this film to finish the series off and I think you should. Don't expect a brilliant movie but get ready to enjoy a good story with some great dark comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not as good as Silence of the Lambs but better than Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising. I am really disappointed about how badly this movie was received. They used a different director and a different style which makes the movie all the more original. I have read the novel and I was glad about how the adaption turned out. Anthony Hopkins was absolutely brilliant as usual and in this movie he gets a lot more screen time which is something that the Silence of the Lambs lacked. Jullianne Moore was perfect for the role this time because between the ten years of this series of events she had become a different person and Moore does that very well. Saying that Jodie Foster will always be my Clarice. Although the acting was good all round I praise the most, Ridley Scott. He took a bizarre novel and turned it into something amazing. His ideas were perfect and turned this movie into something great. Instead of chills he used thrills. It is a different technique and both work for the Separate movies! Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Of course its missing Jodie Foster. It doesn't feel the same watching someone else hunting down Hannibal Lector. It is also missing that exciting suspense that we had in 'Silence'.This time around we get much more violence then the others. We get blood,guts and cannibalism. Not for weak stomaches.One thing i have to mention is that i loved the ending it was great.I recommend it if you have seen any of the Hannibal movies or have read the books.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Hannibal' for me, was an interesting opportunity to judge the transition from book to film, I can't be considered a regular reader so in this rare instance where I read the novel before watching Ridley's Scott's interpretation, I felt obliged to leave a comment for those who may not have read the book.From hear-say 'Hannibal' reputed to be a major disappointment for 'Silence of the Lambs' fans, Hannibal supposed to have been much less scary and the story much less original or interesting. After viewing, I must agree with both points. Hannibal Lecter, in 'Hannibal', shows a whole new spectrum of characteristics, humor, violence, erotic desire, craving for attention, snob, some of which came forward in SOTL already but surely not all of them, at least not to a great extent. Harris was obliged to round his villain, in both Red Dragon and Silence of The Lambs Lecter isn't the central character, merely a tool handled to catch another creep. This formula worked better, the few scenes where Lecter is shown are very effective: truly scary and disturbing. By giving the cannibal a wealth of screen time and portraying him calmly making dinner or lazily strolling around an art gallery, the intrigue is gone and that perhaps is Harris' biggest mistake when writing the sequel under the pressure of the raving success of it's two predecessors. The almost perfect novel and film SOTL was a finished story. Sure, there were some story lines left open for intrigue reasons but there was little left to tell about Clarice Starling, who was the main character not Hannibal or Buffalo Bill, and Harris just wrote the sequel because everyone insisted (I'm sure his publisher one of them, but also the public in general). This for me, is a sufficient explanation of why the story is very different from that in the first one. 'Hannibal' is a film built around, well, Hannibal Lecter himself as the title clearly indicates. The script was left in the more than competent hands of director Ridley Scott, creator of brilliant pictures like Gladiator and Blade Runner. The script stays very true to the source material, the order of some scenes is rearranged but the gross of them is present in the novel. I was especially pleased with Mason Verger, Oldman delivers a great performance even if he is nothing more than a voice almost the entire runtime. His delivery is the perfect amount of tongue-in-cheek, the black humor and suffering also mixed in. His face wasn't as disgusting as I'd pictured it in the novel, believe it or not, but no make-up artist in the world can match the depths of one's imagination. I feel they could have done more with the exquisite locations in Florence, I wasn't very impressed with the way they chose them. The city is, as most Italian cities I've frequented, perfect for filming locations, beautiful spots all around. Instead, they chose to approach the story more soberly, letting it be a pure horror/thriller and not something that rises above that artistically. The excess of one dimensional secondary characters is remarkable and strange, the Italian inspector, Mason Verger, Verger's physician were all very much cardboard characters, the story would've worked much better if they'd just scratched the Italian storyline out, at least make it shorter and focus more on Verger's relationship with Lecter. This, for me, would've made it much better. They set up Verger as a very intriguing character, a crippled, disturbed but incredibly wealthy man. A smörg?sbord of opportunities there, opportunities left unexplored unfortunately. The film would've also benefited from less graphic gore and more tension instead. Hannibal felt too much like a horror movie, extraordinary horror mind you, but just horror with gratuitous violence and a lot of slashing. This, to disguise, that the story isn't very thrilling or clever, at least not compared to it's prequel. Scott's 'Hannibal' also does a few things right of course, Moore is a different Clarice but she's surprisingly convincing, the bizarre relationship between Starling and Lecter is further explored which is interesting, and the production values are great as can be required of Scott. I'm a huge fan of both Manhunter and SOTL, two brilliant films (if you don't calculate the Miami Vice soundtrack) and 'Hannibal' is just the ugly duckling in comparison. Hopkins looks rather bored playing Hannibal on auto-pilot, only a ghost of the terror he portrayed in SOTL and the film is guilty of relying on fancy trivia like the all engorging pigs and the hanging of Judas, etc. All of this, next to being moderately entertaining, diversions from the weakness of the plot itself.Ta ta,</fullReview>

The characterizations aren't as razor sharp as in Silence of the Lambs, but the Lector character is still crisp, and the villains are less well drawn, and sometimes a little contrived and silly, but they are still there, working against Lector and Starling both. Anyway, I would recommend seeing the movie more than once if you are going to see it at all. At least Hopkins is still his wonderful self and Juliane Moore is great. They hold this movie together.

		<fullReview>I had huge expectations for "Silence of the Lambs", and while it was good, I was a bit disappointed. Having heard lots of bad stuff about this movie, I had low expectation, but they were met, if not surpassed.This movie has a lot going for it. Great directing by Ridley Scott. Anthony Hopkins, as always, does some great acting. And, while Jodie Foster has been replaced, Julianne Moore did such a wonderful job as Agent Starling that I hardly cared (which is saying a LOT, because Jodie Foster was an amazing actress). Just as she did with "The Forgotten", Moore's acting and screen presence greatly enhanced the movie and made it much more enjoyable to watch. Also worth mentioning are the special effects and the art direction, and even the cinematography. All of it was quite a joy to watch, and Ridley Scott held it wonderfully together. Even the really gory scenes didn't seem too pretentiously graphic.Now for the major goof--the script. Gosh, I don't know what happened to it. It starts like any other crime movie--a good deal of action and lots of affected little mysteries and conversation-stuff. Oh, and there's the amusing scene where Pazzi hacks his way onto the FBI top 10 list by typing in a secret password; what really makes it funny is that anyone can visit this site--I found a link inside an online parody of this movie.Then there was the ending. There was some point in the last half-hour where things went off the deep end. As the aforementioned parody put it: "THE FAINTLY PLAUSIBLE PART OF THE MOVIE: *ends here*" or something to that effect. I won't spoil the ridiculous scene near the end, but you'll know which scene I'm talking about. It's so ludicrous it's funny. I wonder how in the world the screenwriters came up with something so randomly, preposterously stupid.The final verdict: ridiculous, a bit inflated, but all great fun. If the screenwriters had stepped up their act, this movie could have been blown-away-amazing. Sadly, this is not the case. So keep your expectations low and have a good, mindless time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an okay sequel; it definitely focuses too much on gore and not enough on story, and though that may make it memorable, it's not rewatchable. I'm not squeamish about gore, but the brain-eating scene disgusted and disturbed me; kudos to the filmmakers for having the balls to show it, but it was a little too much. The story is decent until it goes off the rails at the end; the scenes in Venice are fine, but once the man-eating boars show up, it's a whole new game. The acting is pretty good, with Hopkins given much more to do and Julianne Moore creating her own Starling, rather than just copying Jodie Foster. An unrecognizable Gary Oldman is great as well in a superb makeup job. Ridley Scott does a good job of creating an atmosphere, but he wrecks it too many times with an over-abundance of gore. I'd say it's the worst of the Lecter films I've seen.</fullReview>

Hannibal has a beautiful score but some times the bups are lifted wrong and make some scenes a little odd. Hopkins is Hannibal and returns for another cannibalistic performance. The acting is somewhat dry and falls in parts. Also the story seems to mop around the old SOTL formula, and into a more horrific tone. But this is not a bad thing. It gets away from repeating the same style, but it does have some parts that felt very useless. All and All, Hannibal turns around and tries to be a very unique film but at parts just does not feel right and seems to make me miss the genius tone of the original.

		<shortDescription>Lecter Defined</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is such a rarity that sequels supersede their predecessors in quality. "Hannibal" is one such rarity. "The Silence of the Lambs" introduced us to Hannibal Lecter, but "Hannibal" defines him as a character.Although I was disappointed at first to hear that Jodie Foster was replaced by Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling, Moore was the more favorable, overall, to play the part. Foster was too boyish, while Moore brought the femininity missing from Starling in "The Silence of the Lambs." I cannot picture Foster pulling off the final scenes of Hannibal in an evening gown without seeming lumpishly out of place.The real credit goes to Anthony Hopkins, though. I cannot think of a single actor better suited as Lecter. Hopkins brings believability to the character. His cunning, his charm, his intelligence, patience, dark sense of humor... were all mastered by Hopkins. The ending was deliciously (forgive the pun) gruesome, albeit not for those with weak stomachs.I think the film would have been best if it had been slightly longer and felt a bit rushed in the last fifteen minutes. Character development also fell a bit short with some of the co-stars (Ray Liotta as Paul Krendler, for example.) Yet, overall, a very enjoyable film, and an excellent contribution to the Lecter saga.</fullReview>

The story of the Hannibal is little bit weaker than Silence of the Lamb but atmosphere so much better.Stylish camera movements and unusual angles are amazing. It is the director's film-making style which creates the suspense of the movie not storyline.Finally, Hannibal is visually stunning.

		<shortDescription>Mixed Feelings about this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took ten years but Anthony Hopkins finally came back to the role he said he would never play again. But was it worth it? Well, yes and no.I confess that the only Lecter book I have read is The Silence of the Lambs and that was many years ago. Having not read Hannibal, I cannot really say how the film compares to the book, but the story in the film at least has a kind of "So what?" feel to it. With the exceptions of Verger and Krendler, all characters are pretty much back where they started by the end and no one's really achieved very much.In addition, although Julianne Moore is a capable actress, for me anyway Jodie Foster is Clarice Starling. Since Ms Foster didn't do it, they had to replace her with someone else but it just wasn't the same.All that's not to say I didn't enjoy the film because I did. Any movie by Ridley Scott's going to be well directed and there are a lot of positives also. Gary Oldman makes a very effective bad guy and the idea of breeding man eating pigs was extremely twisted and macabre. Anthony Hopkins was perfect as Hannibal, this time around giving a good insight into what kind of man Hannibal would have been, if those events in his youth had't turned him into a killer. Having said all that, He also delivers the goods as it were, with the killing of Pazzi and the live lobotomy of Paul Krendler.Overall I enjoyed it, although I feel the story needs to be told more and we need another chapter in the Hannibal saga (other than the prequel Hannibal Rising).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i found out that Hannibal Rising was being released, i decided to go back and watch the previous Lector films before it. All the other Lector films have the character in the background but with Hannibal the character finally gets his chance to shine.Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lector, a part he made famous in the previous film Silence Of The Lambs. After escaping he is living under a different name in Italy but when his name is put onto the F.B.I 10 most wanted list, Clarice Starling is put on the case to track him down.the acting in this film is brilliant all round. the cinematography is also good and the film is a very good insight of the way Lector likes to live his life.I'm looking forward to the return of Hannibal lector on Friday</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine film about Hannibal Lecter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer Thomas Harris gave origin to one of the most memorable character of thriller films:Hannibal Lecter.The first time this character was took to a movie was in the adaptation of the book Red dragon for Manhunter directed by Michael Mann.On that film,Lecter's appearance was extremely short but the story rounded on him.The second time Lecter appeared on a movie was in The silence of the lambs,the actor was another(Anthony Hopkins),he was the heart and soul of the movie and he made a lot of fame and it became a very popular character like Jason or Freddy but he was a lot more creepy than them because he was not a fantastic character,he was a person of flesh and bones.The silence of the lambs was very successful with the spectators and with critic and it won five Academy Awards as Picture,Director,Actor and Actress in a leading role and Best Adapted Screenplay(but I think JFK deserved the Best Picture and Director awards).Harris wrote a sequel after that but when he finished the book,it was so graphic and extreme that it had to pass half a decade before a screenwriter made a script which had to conform Universal Pictures.Hannibal(the film)is a fine film about Hannibal Lecter but it's very far away from The silence of the lambs.Almost all the time,the film is about Lecter as a watcher of the hunting against him and with the hunters looking for him.And that's the first failure this film has:with so much hunters,the film does not have the same tension that the relationship between Lecter and Clarice Starling.The second half of the movie is the best where the film finds the necessary hunting's focus and the screenplay finishes on a great ending.For one sight,the level of violence will bother some people but,for the other sight,what other thing can we expect from Lecter?The performances are very fine:Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling is excellent but I'm sure that Jodie Foster would have brought more intensity to the character.Giancarlo Giannini,as detective Piazzi,is also great.Gary Oldman brings a lot of intensity to his character.Anthony Hopkins is not bad as Hannibal Lecter but he's not too good.His performance here is not as tense and credible as the one he did for The silence of the lambs.After Hannibal,another film about Lecter was done and it's called Red dragon.I think both are at the same level:they are fine movies about Hannibal Lecter but both are very far away from The silence of the lambs.Hannibal is a good and fun movie which brought me a good experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal the Cannibal is quite flannel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little disappointed with this follow-up to the excellent Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal is no masterpiece and it was surprising that Ridley Scott had directed it. OK, there are a few gory and stomach-churning scenes, and Gary Oldman's performance as Mason Verger was rather good, but Hannibal is a poor sequel.Hannibal evokes a sense of fear and downright disgust, but not to the extremes of the award-winning 1990 film. Anthony Hopkins retains his sense of evil and dread as Lecter up to a point, but the climax to this film did leave me both pleased and surprised.Julianne Moore took over from Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, and it was a good choice. It was a shame Foster did not want to revive the role herself, but we can feel the same sense of compassion and vulnerability for Moore's interpretation.The main aspect of this movie that pleased me is the cold and subdued atmosphere and surroundings created by Scott. The dark and brooding sense of terror mixed with the stunning images of Florence work together extremely well.Hannibal is an OK sequel to one of the most celebrated thrillers of all time, but if I personally had to choose between this and The Silence of the Lambs, I'd opt for the latter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Useless comment no. 1249</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over a thousand mostly useless and uninsightful comments, that must be some controversy. Bombastic anger, disgust and illiteracy. Reimbursement demands, screams of betrayal, and slagging off more or less all involved, starting with Hopkins and his alleged wages down to the last tea lady on set. No small wonder though, given what expectations "Hannibal" had to live up to, Thomas Harris' excellent and multilayered prose notwithstanding - the last in the Hannibal trilogy of books is by far the most intricate, mystical and revealing, maintaining the entertainment factor of its predecessors but adding a lot more food for thought than either "Red Dragon" or "Silence". Read the book, patiently - it's the real McCoy. To stick to the original - and quite radical - ending should have been an imperative, and this is my only (and serious) complaint regarding the film version.Which, it must be said, manages to hold it together, more or less, all of the usual Hollywood ailments in place - it isn't exceedingly better of worse than "Silence", which had certain problems of it's own. "Hannibal" is more stylish, decadent and moodier of the two, beautifully photographed and quite indulging in terms of artistic expression, most notably editing which is superb. Furthermore, the piercing emotion and controlled, spartan passion of Patrick Cassidy's "Vide Cor Meum" musical extract is applied to great effect, putting to shame Hans Zimmer's sub-Mahlerian score that accompanies the bulk of the film's running time. Hopkins and Moore are adequate but both directed to project a certain amount of aloofness (I would have loved to see Foster again, simply for continuity reasons) - whereas Oldman is substandard in the face of an easy money job, his character reduced to shreds (quite literally!) - compared to the original portrayal in Harris' novel. In the film, his loathsomeness is merely visual. That said, my feeling is that the movie would have worked better had it lasted three hours instead of two - the sheer volume and important aspects of the novel would have been more comfortably accommodated that way, and we would have had a profounder film. Besides, Italians should speak Italian, at least amongst themselves - and those passages should have been subtitled. That would have added to the artistic, slightly "European" feel the film flirts with - is that so much to ask? Remarks have been made about bad English accents by the Italian actors - well, Hopkins' own short venture into Italian declamation called by the script sounds no better, frankly.Whilst by no means outstanding, "Hannibal" is definitely undeserving of the wrath of the outraged average cinema Joe, and certainly not from the "moral" viewpoint. There are far worse and scarier films around - just look at other movie franchises, the genuinely terrifying Austin Powers or Bridget Jones films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal is just like a soap opera, extremely long and boring. Of course there is some inventive gore from time to time, but not enough to wake us up entirely, so we are left floating adrift just like the script itself. Ridley Scott can and did make memorable cinema, but only on one condition - do be given a proper script. I blame Thomas Harris for this extremely busy and incoherent script, featuring characters either extremely poor in nuance, like Paul Kendler (Liotta seems to have been forced to be in this movie) or drained of content - like the infamous Lecter. Well, Lecter's razor sharp perception tool, his wit seems to only work in captivity, because he dribbles aimlessly around in this. The way he gets captured by Verger's men in the parking-lot is truly and plain dumb, especially after being so smug in making fun of Clarice's impossibility to capture both him and his followers. He knew he was followed, was playing around on the merry-go-round and mumbling witty on the phone with Clarice, but when it came to act he went splat, right on the nose. No wonder. Just take a look at Hopkins barely managing to move his old fat arse around. He looks about as menacing in this as the big Saint-Bernard in "Beethoven". Numerous quotes are being recycled from the "Silence" in the desperate hope to recapture the magic, but set in the new context they only add to the already obvious free-fall into laughable.OK, so what's left? Well for some good acting - the character of Mason Verger (unrecognisable Gary Oldman) and Pazzi, the Italian commandatore(Giancarlo Giannini) in the one extremely beautiful part of the movie - Florence, but by the time you get to the ludicrous end you would have already forgotten about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely not as binding as the Silence of the Lambs, but Hannibal does seem to radiate that sense of thrill and fear that fans of the prequel adore. I for one was expecting a bit thicker plot that was a bit more believable but when you're talking of a crazed cannibal that escaped maximum security facilities, being believable isn't always first on the priority list. Entertainment is. Hopkin's is charming as the psychotic Dr. Lecter and displayed more of his sensual desires for Agnet Starling that I felt were put on hold during SOTL. It was definitely pleasing to see that being carried out. Also the gore was much more present which I thought took away from the plot. When you have a movie with such intense gore, you need a thick plot to complement, otherwise it is no better than your everyday slasher, and we all know that Dr. Lecter is much too tactful to be put into the same lower echelon as Michael Meyers or Freddie Kruger. All the same I thought that Gary Oldman did a tremendous job as Mason Verger. So disgusting on the inside and out that you wondered if the boars really got a good meal. Jodie Foster not coming back really put a damper on the casting. There was a certain chemistry between her and Hopkins that cannot be ignored. It was a disappointment nonetheless. But all in all the film was entertaining, chilling, disturbing, and delicious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have never read the book, rent the movie. The movie by itself is well done, genuinely horrible in the best sense of horror-movie horrible. **SPOILER** But (and here's where I had the big problem) the end of the movie was so different from the end of the book that I didn't 'get it'. Harris leads us through Hannibal's memory palace to a specific place... beyond the trite ending of the movie and into the character's psyche. The fact that the screenwriter completely ignored Mischa and Hannibal's plight as children really hurt the movie. There's nothing more fulfilling than being able to understand why, and the screenwriters left us to wonder. I was also disappointed that they ignored the romantic aspects of Clarice and Hannibal's relationship. She was completely compromised: the lover of a monster, no longer with the FBI...completely changed. The absence of these two elements left the ending flat. But as I have said, it is a good movie if you are not biased by the novel. Hopkins is ever brilliant and Julianne Moore does a great job with what she was given. All in all, worth the trip to the video store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It isn't that the film is terrible. Really, it isn't. If you wanted a horror film where the hunt for a wicked genius became all-encompassing and twisted every notion of who's wearing the white hats, rock on. Rent and enjoy. Sure, there's some of the typical sequences where the outcome is obvious to anyone who's ever seen a few formulaic horror films. However, there are also several genuine shocks and twists (such as your first look at Mason's face)that will catapult your pulse right on up into stroke range. That being said, this film ain't really an adaptation of the book by the same name written by Thomas Harris. This film took highlights from the book, basic character sketches, wove several scenes from Hollywood whole cloth and ran the whole mess through a blender to pour out a mass-appeal, watered-down, high adrenaline final product. If you had seen this in theaters, the discrepancy was painfully obvious. As the last scene faded to black and credits rolled, those film goers who'd just come to see the latest horror flick were definitely very happy with what they'd just taken in; those who'd come to see Harris' latest Lecter installment brought to life were rather vocal in their disgust with Hollywood's treatment of Hannibal. Depending on which group you belong to, I can either highly recommend this horror film or tell you to go ahead if you're really heart-set on it but go warily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my view i see, that the biggest problem of "The Silence of the Lambs" sequel Hannibal , is that this is done too long time after the original movie. Also looking how big hit at its time the original was, it doesn't make much good to this Hannibal. Its very hard to make better, almost the same thing again or then it must be seriously different. There these sequels almost all time fail. The cast is not that great either in this one. I mean that , by how good the actors/actresses in their role are. Especially Julianne Moore acting Clarise Starling is too simple and going like wire guided through the movie. These are big problems to make good movie. When i watched Red Dragon it was way more better as movie on its genre by being H Lecter movie. All in all , The Hannibal is not great by any means but its watchable, but being sequel to one of the greatest movies, its too big load to its shoulders to carry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember Silence of the Lambs? Of course you do, and with good reason because it was one of the best thrillers of the last twenty years - marvellous stuff, anchored in a very complete fashion by Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter. These days you have to fight off the revisionists that like to disown the film in favour of Manhunter - the latter being a cult, if dated offering that shows the superior intelligence of those who recognise its marginal pleasures. You see, if something is popular it, by definition, must be resisted because that means that people like you must enjoy it and its inconceivable that you possess the same nuanced critical faculty as the person you're talking to. Thus Manhunter is championed as the thinking man's cult favourite - Brian Cox being an anaemic Lecter is comparison to Hopkin's wry performance but why let the bleeding obvious taint a good story? I mention this only because the same distance that separates Hunter from Lambs, inversely applies to this sequel - perhaps the only movie in history that was informed by a novel that was only written under pressure from Film producers so they'd have something to adapt. Think about the implications of that for a moment. You've written a series of successful thrillers, one of which has been adapted into a multi-Oscar winning movie loved the world over. The book has no sequel and so inevitably you find yourself bombarded by requests to write one. No-one is interested in the book in its own right you understand, its just a template to be translated to celluloid. Someone would write an original script except they have no idea what to do and you wouldn't let them anyway because your anxious to protect your own intellectual property and rake in the $10M advance you're bound to get as soon as you've signalled the intention to whip your typewriter out. The irony of all this, for those of you still reading, is the novel in question was a dud and has an ending so poor (Starling and Lecter fall in love, ahhhhh) that millions have staged Nazi bonfire parties just to offload their copy. The movie producer, in this case Dino De Laurentis, who spent a gazillion dollars on the rights before a word was written is saddled with it and whereas common sense would dictate that your forget the book and devise your own version of what happened next, the deal is done so its up to Hollywood's best (Mamet/Zallian) to refashion this not so hot property into a film becoming of its predecessor. Hannibal's problem is that it attempts to circumvent its wretched source material with glossy direction from Ridley Scott but no helmsman or scriptwriter on earth can liberate anything approaching tension or excitement from the turgid, confused plot. Hopkins, reprising his iconic role, doesn't seem to remember quite how to do it. Stripped of his confinement, Lecter is a much reduced character - a parody of his former self - sounds a bit like him, looks like him but the menace is all gone, replaced by a sort of half-serious, half-kooky echo of the 1990 characterisation. Its not Hopkins fault per say, its just there's not the material there for him to, er, get his teeth into. Even worse is Julianne Moore, a urine-poor substitute for Jodie Foster - lacking the former actresses' intensity. It has its moments - I liked the Florence sequences, particularly Hannibal's "I'm giving serious consideration....to eating your wife" line but these are scant compensations for fans of the previous film. The talent is all there on screen but the source material kills this one at birth - in story terms, this looks as about as good as Mason Verger's face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice sequel, but much inferior to the silence of the lambs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** out of ****I wouldn't become bothered at all if this movie has never been released. The Silence Of The Lambs already showed us everything. The characters that are Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, the great performances of Foster and Hopkins and... Buffalo Bill. Hannibal didn't manage to give us a story in the same level or higher than the Silence's. Hannibal is very less frightening than he truly is in the first movie. (Actually, the first one is Manhunter, but I'm talking about those which have Hopkins in the cast). And Starling, now played by Julianne Moore is also less intriguing.I love the Ridley Scott movies, I won't deny this. But this is one of his few disappointing works. In Hannibal there isn't much character development, instead, the movie takes too much time on characters trying to find clues about where they can find Lecter. Moore listens to past recorded conversations with Lecter in headphones, a cop, played by Giancarlo Giannini, sits in front of his computer, believing that he has already met Lecter in person. And there are other secondary characters, partners of Giancarlo, who do whatever must be done in order to catch Lecter. And, also, there is a guy named Mason Verger, played by Gary Oldman.The movie, itself, is based on a plot where Verger wants Lecter captured in order to torture him, like he never could believe, because of a personal vendetta. This is a good story, but no match to the silence of the lambs. I wasn't too shocked either about the brain scene. For me, at most of times, what really counts for a scene to be shocking, is that there must be suffering. When Liotta has his head cut open and eats his own brain, there's no suffering at all, only gore. This might be nasty and shocking too, but not as shocking as Catherine Martin trying to climb that well, screaming desperately, or Marvin Nash, the tortured cop in Reservoir Dogs, when he's groaning like hell.Hannibal is a nice movie to watch, not a bad sequel at all. Its only problem might have been that it simply is a sequel to one of the most successful movies ever made, a best picture motion picture, and it's hard to get to the same level, but it's worth watching it, anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those viewers who really enjoyed getting creeped out by Hannibal Lecter's inhuman characteristics and cerebral linguistic ability in the Silence of the Lambs, don't go to see Hannibal. If you are a Nightmare on Elm Street fan, and love Freddy Kruegers jovial banter when preparing to kill his victims, you will love this flick. Hannibal Lecter has been reduced from a highly intelligent, sophisticated psychopathic killer to a wisecracking killer with unusual dietary habits. The producers of this film along with the director should be ashamed of themselves for wasting the incredible talents of the top two billed actors in this picture. Hannibal was too funny, Clarisse had a chip on her shoulder throughout most of the movie. The chemistry that Jodie Foster and Sir Hopkins shared in SOTL was missing because of poorly scripted dialog in which the two characters didn't really talk to each other, but rather spoke at each other with their own agenda. This movie wants so desperately to be a Saturday night date flick that it forgets that most of the accolades the first movie received were because the acting was so superb that you left the movie with the creeps instead of having nausea. SOTL was for the most part not graphic in the violence it displayed, however Hannibal takes the idea about visceral gross out to a new extreme. If you like gore, you'll love this movie. If you are looking for an Oscar contender, go check out Chocolat, or Cast Away because the golden Statue doesn't give awards for assuming that the prime target audience of this picture is stupid. The movie cheated from the book in some key ways which I will not share in this forum. Shame on Thomas Harris for contributing to this pulp fictionesque movie that could have been more, he's a far better writer than what this screenplay turned out to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the movie, because there's more to it than the eye can see. It's the elements of Dante that do it for me: the water, the wood,..(signs of hell), Hannibal who actually is the devil and cannot be punished unless by himself and he also does(because he loves Clarice, maybe not like a lover but like a father and the devil cannot love that's why he punishes himself. Hannibal kills his victims but actually if you look to Dante : the devil only punish the ones with sins, piazza is killed because of his greed, mason is punished the first time because he's a child molester and the second time that leads to his death because of his craving for revenge. The acting of Hopkins as Lector I found marvelous, as well as I liked the other acting performances. The camera-work was very good. I always heard people say that there's too much violence in this movie (but of course there will be a lot of violence, the devil will not punish people by kissing them. I'm not that conservative but if you think there's a devil and it's evil then its punishments will be extremely bloody. I found it perfect that there was a lot of violence in it. In all I just like this movie. I don't know if anyone else saw this comparison to Dante. If anyone already made a comment about this movie referring to Dante, then I'm sorry because I didn't know that anybody saw this.</fullReview>

As for this this one, you can tell Anthony Hopkins didn't put that much of an effort into playing Hannible Lecter as he did in the first one. In the original, Hopkins tried to resist blinking while talking to make Hannible more creepier. Little things like that just make the character more believable. Julianne Moore didn't play as good of a Clairice Starling as Foster, but she held up for herself. As for the whole movie, it's just a shame that it couldn't have been done by John Demme. One particularly thing I loved most about what him was what he did with the camera in first one. I loved how he did extreme close ups on Lecter, while you as the viewer have feeling to back away. This one just was not as thrilling as the original, it was more weird, really. Although, I do credit the dinner table scene. Overall, this movie is still worth watching if you're a fan of the original. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was bad for several reasons. The number one reason, is the lack of Jodie Foster. Jodie Foster won and Oscar for her role as agent Starling, there is a reason for this. Without her presence, Anthony Hopkins performance does not resonate. Second reason, Julianne Moore was miscast. I think Julianne Moore is a good actress, but, she was wrong for this part. She looked like she was pan timing Jodie Foster from the original movie. Her accent was forced, and I did not believe in her fear of Lecter for a minute. Third, the convoluted sub-plot with the man with no face. What a waste, why does this need to be in the movie. To show Lecter as a bad man, for gore? What? It was boring. As far as I can tell the only reason they had this part it, was so Lecter could have his face mask put back on. I would have much rather the plot revolve around Starling, trying to find Lecter. Also, how does he manage to fly without being noticed on international flights? He is on the FBI most wanted list. No one ever notices him?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I don't wish to compare Jodie foster and Julianne Moore, I wanted to point out Julianne Moore should have done a better job. It is obvious that the first time Agent Clarice speaks to Dr.Lecter is the first time that her Southern accent is actually noticeable while all the time, previously, she spoke completely differently/normally. The entire movie through, she seemed in mild shock.. or is that just the way she acts... yea, it was a bit like that in Magnolia too...Ridley Scott's direction shows through as the film focuses less on the main character and more on the dark atmospheres and eerie music, much like alien. Anthony Hopkins was good as usual, but it was clear that the awe for his character would have to depend on viewership of the previous movies.However, all in all, the film still manages to be very watchable, although, not up to par with the previous two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Silence of the Lambs,' it is not fairly compared to 'Hannibal.' I am a huge fan of intelligent horror movies, and 'Hannibal' was definitely what I was looking for.Two (?) years after Ridley Scott's Oscar winning 'Gladiator,' 'Hannibal' dominated the box office with an amazing $250M+ gross..... and horrible reviews. It seems that today, critics only like soft-hearted dramas, and warm and fuzzy children's' films; shunning any other genre like a child with broccoli. 'Hannibal,' apart from some explicit gore, and violent themes, was, for the most part, intelligent.Although Jodie Foster was not casted in the sequel to the 1991 BEST PICTURE, 'Hannibal' was still an amazing accomplishment, and a landmark in the film industry. Julianne Moore gives a stellar performance as Special Agent Clarice Starling, despite the confining 'closet' size of her role (great analogy, eh?), and should have been up for a nomination. Anthony Hopkins is just as great as he always is, and always has been, and successfully portrays Lecter as the unnerving sociopath we have all grown to love.'Hannibal''s only downfall was that it was un-decided in being either a horror or a drama. The use of 'scary music', and suspenseful scenes was lacking, and the use of distorted film was sometimes annoying.Rent, nay, purchase this fine film (special collectors edition, not regular) ****/5</fullReview>

Julianne does the best she can with what she is given and i don't fault her for the movie being terrible. as i sat in the theater watching it i thought to myself no wonder Jodie foster passed on this. good for her. she dodged a bullet. the film does no justice to the brilliance that was the silence of the lambs. skip over it and see red dragon. red dragon is much smarter and better paced. edward norton and anthony hopkins have fantastic chemistry in their cat and mouse game. see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic film. Highly underrated and superior to SOTL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right here we have a sequel (or installment) that actually rises above it's predecessors. It sits atop a very short list of worthy follow ups, right along side Godfather Part II, Aliens, T2 and Spiderman 2. Now in no way does this mean that Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs aren't good films, they certainly are. Manhunter is one of the best police procederals/80's flicks ever and Lambs is an excellent Gothic horror film. I myself just feel that Hannibal is one of the best films in recent years and far superior to the film which spawned it. Hannibal is a brilliant film. Like it's subject of examination it is both charming and violent. It has such moments of cinematic grandeur and style that you can barely describe it. It is an odd sort of beauty, quite brooding and melancholy, but beautiful none the less.Performances are fine all around. Hopkins is still menacing, but in a more restrained manner. He exudes more sophistication and grace this time around. He is far less campy than he is in SOTL. Julianne Moore take on Starling shows a far stronger character than Jodie's. Moore really nails the evolution of this character from naive trainee to maverick agent. The supporting performances are also very nice particularly from Ray Liotta (who has the movie's best death scene) as king of all slime balls Justice Derpartement Rep Paul Krendler and Gary Oldman as the film's ravenous and deformed villain Mason Verger. Although completely unrecognizable under pounds of prosthetics and makeup Oldman elegantly oozes perversion and sadism. adding another notch to his repertoire of unforgettable villains. I can't understand why critics and audiences were so taken aback by this movie. The film has been trashed to no end for it's gore, but therein lies much of the movie's appeal: How it handles it's violence. It's like the paintings of Francis Bacon, which I are quite relished and enjoyed by Doctor Lecter. You want to look away, but you can't, the movie has you in it's grip. There are three particularly violent but thoroughly awe inspiring scenes that make you marvel at the level of skill and technique Ridley Scott employs in all of his films. The scenes are those of the Fish Market shoot-out, the Lecter/Pazzi confrontation in the Capponi library, the bore massacre and the dinner scene. All are hard to take in on account of there intense and somewhat sadistic depictions of gore and violence, but they are still quite amazing to behold. This is on account of the movies atmosphere which is abstract and wild. The film has so many styles and moods and methods of storytelling, ranging from tongue in cheek humor, to solemn romance, to medieval carnage and mayhem. Watching it I feel an odd sense of peace within me, like I am being carried away by a great symphony, or a sonnet. Sure the images and ideas are often gruesome and off-putting (for anyone but me that is) but they resonate in my heart long after the movie is over. It's a like the strangest of dreams. The kind of dream that disturbs, yet moves you. People criticize it for being over the top, weird, gruesome and well... silly. I agree with them, that this movie is weird and gruesome, but hey, whats wrong with that? They also say that it strayed too far from 'Lambs'. Again I ask what's wrong with that? When it comes to sequels why must we expect the same thing over again? Re-hashing old ideas is far from exciting. I don't know exactly what everyone was expecting from this movie, but for me it lived up to it's hype. I for one think this movie is worthy of as much praise or more praise than 'Lambs'. It's brave, it's bold, it's macabre, it's sensual, it's funny, it's sad, it's tragic, it's romantic, it's poetic. Simply put, it's a classic. For me it's right up there with 'A Clockwork Orange'. Terribly underrated. It should have swept the Oscars or at least got more attention, other than for being the highest grossing R rated movie up until that time. Ridley Scott has a chunk of good films worthy of Oscars for his direction (Blade Runner, Legend, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down), this is no exception. Hannibal is a classic through and through. 10 out of 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest-to-goodness Hollywood horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HANNIBAL Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSWhile its predecessor THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was more of a police procedural with Gothic trimmings, Ridley Scott's follow-up HANNIBAL is an honest-to-goodness horror movie, one of the most gruesome Hollywood offerings in recent memory. Anthony Hopkins reprises his celebrated role of cannibalistic psychopath Dr. Hannibal Lecter, forced out of 'retirement' in Florence, Italy, after being targeted for kidnap by one of his former victims (the only person to have survived one of Lecter's attacks, now hideously disfigured, and played by Gary Oldman beneath layers of Greg Cannom's horrific makeup), seeking revenge on his old adversary. Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster as FBI agent Clarice Starling, torn between her fascination with Lecter and her devotion to duty, despite the obstacles she faces from her self-serving male colleagues.Beautifully designed (by Norris Spencer, David Crank and Marco Trentini) and photographed (by John Mathieson), the film's labyrinthine script - by Steven Zaillian and David Mamet - is ruthless in its depiction of human frailty and corruption (especially Moore's battles against an inflexible bureaucracy run by fools and charlatans), which makes it difficult to root for anyone other than Lecter, whose contempt for authority is manifested in crowd-pleasing acts of grisly murder. Like the Thomas Harris novel on which it's based, the movie is Argentoesque in both its plotting and execution, and some of the Grand Guignol set-pieces would be comic if they weren't so distressing (the notorious 'banquet' scene is truly grotesque). Unpleasant for some, a visual feast for others, HANNIBAL offers a stately riposte to the ice-cold authority of Jonathan Demme's original, but some viewers may be alarmed by the film's enthusiastic (though never gratuitous) depiction of horror and brutality. Followed by RED DRAGON (2002).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I originally saw Silence Of The Lambs when released on VHS video in the early 90s. This week, I acquired a DVD of SOTL. Despite the so-so reviews I've read about Hannibal, I got that DVD too so I could watch these two films back-to-back in one sitting. I like film series, generally. Hannibal was a well-made film and worthy sequel to SOTL.Julianne does a fine job as Clarice...but...I have a hard time getting past Julie's different look from Jodie as FBI agent Clarice. It's distracting! Seems to me that the VERY LEAST they could've done was color Julie's red hair to brunette as a token attempt to make her look more like the original Jodie actress.I'm SO glad they didn't hire another actor to play Hannibal! Tony IS Hannibal, period, and casting another actor in that role would've been pure sacrilege! Even sillier than casting Mickey Rooney as an Asian in Breakfast At Tiffany's ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Hannibal raised the bar of contemporary film. The screenplay by David Mamet, the cinematography, the music all congregate to making it a masterpiece. It is a Gesamtkunstwerk. It expresses our Zeitgeist in a profound way. Despite the barbarism shown, true to our misguided civilization, it has serenity. Reference to medieval symbolism and savagery was well understood and made vivid - leaving room for thought about our time and how we live. Conceptualization was well defined. I found it far superior to its predecesor. The film has lyrical quality, it is deft in making scenes lucid and lofty. And at the same time, it manages to show brutality in unmitigated reality. The most surprising element of the film is its astonishing level of imagination. It lifts the human experience of dread and despair to high art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film amkes an impact, irregardless of whether you consider it to be a worthy successor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be perfectly honest, I'm a huge fan of this film. I think it is one of the great boundary-pushing moments of our time. While not perfect, I have a very difficult time attempting to understand the denigration of this film by others on this board. I suggest that those individuals read the books. The imagery is disturbing, but not nearly as much as the psychological implications of what is occurring. This film shows Lecter off in his twisted glory, and attempts to give some background as to his personal wants and needs as a cannibalistic and murderous humanoid. Of course it is not as well-played out as the novel. When I read the actual book, I was completely convinced that would be no "Silence" sequel. This was something that would never get approval from Hollywood nor last 3 days once people saw the final few scenes in culmination and disseminated those scenes to others. That stuff is not for everyone, but is was very satisfying for the target audience (me). If you despise psychological terror, why would you see a film like this in the first place? There is more than likely some type of Rainbow Brite video that you can enjoy. This film does not cross genres, much in the same way that scatological porn doesn't appeal to the couples market. This is far darker, far more twisted and far more enjoyable than the first in the series. But it's certainly not something every viewer will enjoy. Name me a movie that fits that category, and please stop talking down about a film that you fail to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed but absorbing thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: *** out of ****. Since it was released in theaters, Hannibal really hasn't been looked at favorably. It opened to mixed reviews from critics and much less audience approval. Well that was bound to happen since it was the follow up to the modern classic, Silence of the Lambs. Regardless of popular opinion, I liked Hannibal. Yes, it's a small step below the slightly overrated Silence of the Lambs but it stands as a solid thriller. It has its flaws and there are areas in which it is vastly inferior to Silence but Hannibal stands effectively on its own.Hannibal can be seen as the "dark and tragic romantic tale" that director Ridley Scott sees it as. I did sense a connection in Silence between the two characters and that connection was even more present here. But the romance can never happen since it's not a mutual thing. Clarice doesn't want anything to do with Lecter, but it's ironic in a way, because he understands her better than any other character in the film. The ending in a way shows what he would sacrifice for her.Ridley Scott films are always notable for their visuals and Hannibal is no exception. Scott and Cinematographer John Mathieson have crafted a strikingly beautiful film. Hannibal is drenced with a dark atmosphere in nearly every frame. Also, the shots around Florence and North Carolina(Verger's Mansion) are gorgeous-looking. The style and Ridley Scott's direction remain the biggest strengths in the film. They keep the weakest parts of Hannibal interesting. The weakest part of the film is an Italian detective named Pazzi's pursuit of Lecter. The problem here is that Pazzi really isn't an interesting character. He's a paper-thin character and the performance of Giancarlo Giannini is pretty uninspired. Anthony Hopkins returns to arguably his greatest role ever. Once again he proves why he really is that great. His performance here is almost as brilliant as the one in Silence. Hannibal is still a creepy individual but he's a little more likable here. Hopkins should be given a lot of credit for making this happen. Seeing Anthony Hopkins in his role makes it a little odd not seeing Jodie Foster in the role of Clarice Starling. No matter though. Julianne Moore is an effective replacement. Ten Years after the events in Silence, Clarice is more stressed out by her job. You can sense how tired she is in the movie. While Moore's performance isn't nearly as brilliant as Foster's was, she does a respectable job nonetheless. There are a couple of meritable supporting performances. Gary Oldman gives an inspired performance as a man who wants to get revenge on Hannibal Lecter. There's a lot of make-up for the role (I had no clue it was him) but its Oldman's acting that allows him to disappear into the character. Ray Liotta is always good at playing unpleasant individuals so theres no surprise that he plays the part like an expert. The most controversial scene in Hannibal is easily the ending. Most hate it and a lot of people think it ruined the film. I am conflicted about it myself. In a way, its a memorable ending (how could that not be memorable in some way) but it feels a little awkward. It's gross but it's also unique. I don't really know what it is, I am not even sure if it damages the film in anyway. Like I said, Hannibal does have its flaws but it's an absorbing film. There were moments in the film where I was so riveted that I thought about rewarding the film a ***1/2. However, Hannibal fell just a little short but that doesn't change the fact that Hannibal is an entertaining, thrilling film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS HEREIN***This sequel borrows heavily from the first movie, to the point where even audio and film from the first movie are incorporated into the plot. In one sense, you could say that this film is a tired rip-off of the first one.Julianne Moore isn't right for her role as Clarice Starling. Her distant, uninvolved acting style, so appropriate for her role in Boogie Nights, is a terrible fit in this film. She has all the conviction, intensity, and presence of a wet dishrag. Where Jodie Foster's marvelously expressive face conveyed every thought and feeling of agent Starling in the first film, Moore's disinterested deadpan is more appropriate for the role of an IRS agent or a bored secretary. Yes the system has drained agent Starling physically and emotionally over the last ten years of her career, but Moore just doesn't have the presence of mind to even make that simple implication believable. She just isn't right for the role; even her jog through the woods (another scene lifted from the first movie) is unconvincing. Gary Oldman as the disfigured moneybags is the polar opposite of Moore. Typically, Oldman's performance is over-the-top, a nightmarish clown of cartoonish proportions, mannerisms, and speech. Is there a name for the Oldman Suck? He does it in every role. Watch closely, because it is how you can discern Oldman underneath all the fleshy makeup: he will pause for a moment in his speech, and do this little clicking/sucking sound with his mouth just before he speaks again. He has been doing this little sound in every role since Sid and Nancy. That aside, you'll never be bored with Oldman in the picture, and as with his roles in the Fifth Element, Lost In Space, and Dracula, he is a fascinating figure. He's good at what he does: playing wacked-out monsters just on the edge of going completely bonkers. If there was ever a man who loved his career, it must certainly be Oldman. Anthony Hopkins is simply brilliant, and it is fascinating to watch the little details that he puts into the character. His voice changes from one scene to the next, from southern drawl to clipped northeastern highbrow. He is a modern-day vampire, an operatic madman, a kindly schoolteacher, with a voice like warm brandy as he goes about his dark deeds with a casual 'okey-dokey'. Where Oldman has the subtlety of a baseball bat, Hopkins uses his eyes, voice, and body movements to let us know we are watching a man of extraordinary intelligence. His face after seeing Verger again is a rare treat; you can see the wheels turning behind his simultaneously warm and icy stare as he admires his handiwork, unafraid of his captivity. 'I much prefer you this way,' he says, oblivious to his fate as Verger promises torture. In spite of Lechter being featured prominently in the film, Hopkins manages to endow the character with the same degree of mystery which he had in the first film. Along with Geoffrey Rush, Hopkins is one of our greatest living actors. Unfortunately, even given the excellent acting by Oldman and Hopkins, the film wallows in its own self-importance. The music swells repeatedly, drumming into our heads that Lechter is evil. Where in the first film much of the violence was implied, and thus more frightening, in this tired sequel we see more of Lechter's mayhem than we care to. Where the ending is supposed to be shocking, it is instead a cheap gimmick, lifted straight from the storyline of a teen horror film. On top of all that, Lechter was laughably easy to catch at the mall. That a man with such advanced intelligence would allow himself to be caught so easily just didn't make any sense and did not match the character. And Mason cutting off his own face with a shard of broken mirror made absolutely no sense at all. For one thing, why did Lechter order him to do it? For another, why did Mason do it? It was a silly and stupid plot twist. And, lest there is any doubt that the film deserves its rightful place among banal mediocrity, the man-eating pigs are only slightly less irritating than the chimpanzee which usually shows up in sub-standard films. I am surprised that the normally thoughtful and careful David Mamet was responsible for such a terrible screenplay. Jodie Foster was wise to steer clear of this stinker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopkins and Moore were great, sequel didn't quite match original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anthony Hopkins made such an impression on me in the original 'Silence of the Lambs' that I have been a fan ever since. He has been good in every movie of his that I have seen, and regardless of what I heard, I also thought all those movies were at least good. There is nothing here to match the scenes where Jodie Foster's Clarice interviewed Hannibal in his cell, though some taped conversations come close. Those could have actually been from the 'Lambs' movie, with Julianne Moore's voice substituted.I didn't think Julianne Moore would be able to live up to Jodie Foster, but she did so well that I wonder if I would have had doubts about Jodie Foster if this was my first experience with the Clarice character. Which it likely wouldn't have been, because I don't like gory movies. The appeal of this movie is not the violence (who would believe such a calm and refined character as Hannibal could do such things?) but the process of solving the mystery, and the process of moving toward the goal, whatever it was, of those who didn't know Hannibal's true identity.There are also beautiful exterior scenes around Biltmore House, America's largest castle, which I have visited twice. I knew what to expect when I saw an exit sign for Asheville in North Carolina, a sign I have seen many times.Some things about this movie seemed ridiculous, but the performance of the two leads made up for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a big (big, big) fan of Thomas Harris' 1999 novel, I literally counted the days to the release of the film and was one of the first on line. Surrounded by a few hundred of my fellow Lecterphiles, I sat for two hours, drinking it in. It was a treat seeing the characters step off the page to walk and talk...but still, I left the theater feeling quite let down. The musical score was sublime. Most of the actors did a fine job. The problem was twofold. First, the ending differed markedly from what was given in the book. No spoilers; if you liked the book you've seen the movie already. If you didn't like the book, you still know what the ending was. Just suffice it to say, Ridley Scott and Stephen Zaillian took a safer route. Kind of like taking the safe route through Yellowstone because you're afraid of getting squirted by Old Faithful.Another objection I had to this movie was the excessive gore. The whole story is supposed to have a dreamy, other-worldly quality, and the rivers of blood and lingering closeups on various no-longer-internal organs is a turnoff that does nothing to aid the story. I'm told the DVD contains many deleted scenes, and this is good, because the theatrical version was choppily edited. I walked away thinking there was so much they could have added to maximize the impact. The sound quality was less than ideal. Even with Dolby, the audience strained to catch mumbled lines. Even those of us who can never quite get enough of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter are rather unanimous in our belief that we've had more than enough of Ridley Scott's disregard for fine literature.RWD4EVR</fullReview>

I am also irritated the story of Hannibal's parents being killed by the Nazis and his sister eaten was not included - the directors of the films tried to make Hannibal seem much more of a villain - a monster rather than a victim - as I believe Thomas Harris tried to do.P.S In case it wasn't obvious - i think Anthony is gorgeous - hence why I wanted Clarice and Hannibal to follow the storyline of the novel in the film!</fullReview>

Anthony Hopkins returns and does a great job. Gary Oldman is very good as the creepy and disgusting Mason Verger. Ray Liotta is also good. I will admit the ending is disgusting beyond all belief but with the exception of the ending I liked this movie. The Cinematography was beautiful in Italy and the scenes in Italy had a certain dark atmosphere that I admired. The Script does not match Silence's but it is a decent script.

		<fullReview>Hannibal is a commendable attempt at a sequel/adaptation, but barely manages to pull through for several reasons.The premise is fairly stable in the beginning, but eventually takes a huge nosedive after the climax(Lecter in America).Despite the unnecessary gore, drastic and awkward change in Lecter's character, and numerous plot holes, i personally enjoyed it.I wouldn't consider Hannibal a masterpiece like it's predecessor, but more or less a guilty pleasure, if anything.Never the less, the numerous quotes, fine acting(props to gary oldman), and beautiful score and scenery gets a 7/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is the good and here is the bad, straight up.*POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*Good:1. This movie is strictly about hunting down Dr. Hannibal Lecter. None of that "Help me find so and so killer Dr. Lecter."2. It does have some Gory graphical scenes.3. The acting is pretty good.Bad:1. They used Julianne Moore instead of Jody Foster for the part of FBI Agent Clarice Starling.2. In Silence of the Lambs, Clarice Starling (Jody Foster) was really "good hearted." She didn't seem so aggressive to killing people. In "Hannibal", she receives a congrats to being the #1 FBI Agent who kills the most people. Not really good thing.3. I didn't like how Hannibal had a soft side to Clarice. This guy is a serial killer who has no mercy on his victims. Yet he is so utterly in love with Clarice its ridiculous.Overall its good to watch for the first time. After that I wouldn't see it again.My Rating: 3.0/5.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..."Hannibal" is hard not to like. Hopkins' chilling performance is both grasping and horrific. Despite bad reviews, Julianne Moore does pretty well (though, of course, she doesn't match Jodie Foster's talent).The real gem of this movie though is Gary Oldman, who plays the deformed (and deranged) Mason Verger, the only living victim of "Hannibal the Cannibal". Oldman plays the cripple with a distinct creepiness that only Oldman could master.Aside from the charm of Hopkins and evil of Oldman, this is a very disturbing film. There are many overly violent parts, including spilling of one characters intestines on a sidewalk. I don't know who likes to see that kind of stuff, but it's certainly not me.Horrific, disgusting, good movie, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie, I found it rather boring, extremely predictable, but on repeated viewings, there is a little more quality to it than I thought. The characterizations aren't as razor sharp as in Silence of the Lambs, but the Lector character is still crisp, and the villains are less well drawn, and sometimes a little contrived and silly, but they are still there, working against Lector and Starling both. Paper tigers though, all of them, you never expect them to be able to win. Anyway, I would recommend seeing the movie more than once if you are going to see it at all</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>entertaining trash (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are presented with "Hannible", the sequel to Jonathan Demme's oscar winning masterpiece "Silence of the Lambs". For this film, we have a superb director and an extremely talented cast starring Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore being directed by Ridley Scott.So whats the problem?The main problem of the film comes from Thomas Harris's source novel. Reading it I could tell that he had the potential for a great story with an exciting plot but got so tired of these characters that he took the easy way out. The film never reaches the depths that its predecessor plunderd into and this film and the book made the biggest mistake of all. That mistake being taking Hannibal out of his cell. Once out of his cell, this character becomes infinitly less interesting. All he becomes is a extremely intelligent killer with a taste for fine arts and rare food. Another problem with the film is that the predecessor was about the exploration of the Clarice Starling character and that is completely gone from this one simply because in the novel from which the film is based, there is nothing to discover. There are some positive aspects to this film.Ridley Scott shows that he is a master of is craft by taking a trashy book and making it something entertaining and at some points such as the "dinner" scene and "kitchen" scene show some depth that elevate the film above its trashy roots. Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore do their character justice by playing them as well as they can depite the scripts limitaions.On another note, I must commend Scott on the ending to the film which is infinitely more emotionally powerfull as compared to the books. Scott also handles the gory scenes with enough class as to avoid typical horror movie "cheesyness". Also, with any Ridley Scott film, the Cinematography and Locations are wonderfull.In the end though, see this film and decide what you think of it</fullReview>

In this sequel to Silence of The Lambs Hopkins still does a great job allthough he is not quite a creepy as he was in the previous film . Julianne Moore takes over for Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling and she does pretty good , allthough I prefered Foster.Unlike Silence of The Lambs the emphasis seems to be more towards violence rather than suspense which makes this one less effective than Silence . Even so Ridley Scott delivers a solid thriller .Hans Zimmer's score is not bad but nothing to writte home about either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Giancarlo Giannini, Ray Liotta, Frankie Faison, and Gary Oldman.Ten years after Clarice Starling caught Jame Gumb, she recieves a letter from Dr. Hannibal Lecter once again. He says that he is in Rome, Italy and greets her well. Clarice meets one of Lecter's victims, Mason Verger, who Dr. Lecter gave him drugs, made Mason feeds his face to the dogs, and broke Verger's neck. Verger survived, in which Lecter is now his enemy. While Clarice is searching the streets of Rome, Verger puts his own plan of revenge into action. This movie was pretty good. Possibly the worst of the Hannibal Lecter Series. That's right "Series", not trilogy. I still include Manhunter. I found this movie pretty Thrilling, but not as much as The Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon. Another good performance from Anthony Hopkins, and Julianne Moore is pretty good. If you loved Manhunter or The Silence of the Lambs, then you'll love Hannibal almost as much.2.5 out of 4. My IMDB Rating: 6.5/10. Rated R for Graphic Violence and Gore, Language, and some Nudity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What An Underrated Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know that the critics blasted "Hannibal" and it's so easy to see why- they went into the theatre expecting to see another "Silence of the Lambs". It's as simple as that. What the critics failed to see is an interesting movie about what Hannibal Lecter is like outside the asylum, with his freedom.I was quite disappointed when Jodie Foster didn't reprise her role as Clarice Starling, but Julianne Moore's performance as the ten year after Clarice Starling is just as good, in my opinion. We are talking about a different Clarice Starling, much different from the one we saw and loved in "Silence of the Lambs". In "Hannibal", she has realized that the FBI's value systems are beginning to get messed up and with her value systems intact, she doesn't know what direction to go to. Julianne Moore just delivers such a great performance. True, there isn't much that she can do with this character, but what she does is still excellent. Check out the scene where she cries after the *spoiler* fishmarket disaster. Check out her facial expressions all throughout the final sequence, where they all have that demonic dinner at Paul Krendler's lake house. *end of spoiler*Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as Dr. Hannibal Lecter with a lot of wit, intelligence, and depth. You see, "Hannibal" is not supposed to be a horror film. It's simply a film that shows what Hannibal Lecter is like outside bars. And it's a very interesting portrayal. We begin to understand the pathology of this character. How he eats people, and he reasons that he is doing the public a service.There is a lot of sexual chemistry going on between Hannibal and Clarice Starling. If you've read the book, you know what happened there, which is probably why Jodie Foster declined to reprise the role.I loved Hans Zimmer's score on this film. The editing is excellent, and so is the cinematography. Hey, we're talking about several sequences that ocurred in Italy, and Italy is such a beautiful place to shoot.I absolutlely love "Hannibal". I love all the Hannibal Lecter movies. But "Hannibal" was a great way to end it. *spoiler* In the last scene, we se Dr. Lecter in an airplane full of Asian people in there. This is a hint that he is on his way to either Japan or Thailand- judging it from his taste.Bon appetit.</fullReview>

The role of Hannibal Lecter was once again played by SIR Anthony Hopkins, nobody could do a better job of it. He was just as creepy and amusing in this movie.You may also think that nobody could play Clarice Starling like Jodie Foster and you would be right Julianne Moore was...much less annoying and in other words quite great.Mason Verger played by Gary Oldman was sick and twisted which is a really good thing. His face was discusting (lit my fire).You must see this film it is well put together and the acting is great, i didn't think it was very gruesome but that maybe because I am quite disturbed.

This movie indeed made me sick to my stomach, so well done, to everyone concerned! But just as much for the idiotic messages and social commentary as for the graphic violence. I don't know about you, but I've had enough of this crap. These people really should all be ashamed of themselves. Watch this again and pay strict attention to whom the movie plays sympathy.

		<fullReview>I liked the way Silence of the Lambs worked, I liked the way Manhunter worked, and rightly or wrongly I came to expect this movie to follow the same path, I was wrong. The thing I liked about the previous two movies was the tension was based on suggestion, we know Dollarhyde bites the lips of Lounds but we don't see it, we know Gumb is making a dress of skin, but we don't see him `harvest' the base product. Hannibal has removed this intelligent suggestion and gone for base action, which is a shame, the psychological thriller far more appeals to me than gore and action.I read the book and was disappointed and I am very glad the director did not follow the ending of the book, I shan't spoil it by writing the ending here, but I was dumbfounded by it's ridiculous supposition.It is a shame that the director chose to step away from the intelligent path the previous movies took, now I wait in anticipation for Red Dragon, although I am not hopeful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Hannibal is a great sequal to the movie Scilence of the Lambs. Anthony Hopkins once again plays an ecellant Dr. Lector. However, the role of Clarice Starling previously played by Jodie Foster was now played by Julianne Moore. Personally I feel that Julianne Moore plays the roll much better. Just like the first movie, this one leaves you on the edge of your seat! Not as much blood and gore in this one but there is some, enough to keep the movie going and make you see how gorey Dr. LEctor likes to make things. This movie is more about the search that Agent Starling endures in trying to find Dr. Lector after he escaped in Scilence of the Lambs. I suggest this movie to anyone who enjoyed the first one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a film for Thomas Harris readers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the first sign of a film being made from the new novel, it was pretty much accepted that it probably wouldn't be as good as Silence of the Lambs, and the ending would almost definatly be changed. Both were right, sadly. I absolutely loved the book, and I thought the ending was perfect, and totally disagreed with people who thought it was too much of a stretch. It is Harris' book, he controls the characters, if you don't like it don't read it. But, somewhere along the lines Steve Zallian was brought in to take the scissors to it. So many important plot points, sub-plots, and characters were simply removed or made shallow and one-dimensional. Granted, there is no way for the 500 plus page novel to be perfectly adapted to film, but so many things were changed for seemingly no reason. Unfortunately, I do not want to point out specifics for fear of spoiling the film for first-time viewers. For the first time (before Red Dragon came out) I was unsure of Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter. It seemed just a little too over-the-top, being more lunatic than cold, calculating sociopath in some scenes. Keep in mind, these are all in comparison with the book. Now, on the other hand, if you haven't read the books, this is a rather good thriller. Julianne Moore gives a pretty good performance considering she had to live up to Jody Foster's legendary performance in Silence. Ridley Scott does a great job keeping the tension high, and presenting Florence beautifully. All cast and crew do a great job, and this is somewhat shadowed by reviews like my own above, but if you don't read and like thrillers, watch and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I purchased a pre-viewed copy at Blockbuster because I had heard of the movie "Hannibal." I didn't know anything about the movie, but, for $4.99 I thought I had nothing to lose.The only interesting part of the movie is when one of the characters is searching the list of Ten Most Wanted people -- Osama Bin Laden was on that list. The interesting thing is that the movie was released several months before September, 2001. So THAT scene was a little strange.Usually I will watch one of my newly-purchased movies and put it on my shelf so that I can show it to friends when they visit. But I never want to see Hannibal again. I threw my copy in the garbage after the movie was over. I have NEVER done that before. As I watched the movie I kept waiting for some "good part" or some part with a little "redeeming value."There was no redeeming value to this movie. Perhaps I should have watched Silence of the Lambs first? Or perhaps I should toss SOTL in the garbage before I watch it? (I have SOTL on my shelf -- un-opened). If SOTL is anything like Hannibal, I will hate that movie also.My conclusion: don't waste your time.Bob in Oklahoma.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good sequel of... Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie in a theatre last year and just bought a 2nd-hand copy of the DVD. And recently I also bought the DVD of Legend and parallels between those two films by Ridley Scott stroke me!Everyone says Hannibal isn't a sequel of Silence of the Lambs, and they're right: SOTL was a crime story and a thriller focused on the dialogue between young FBI studen Clarice and imprisoned Lecter. Hannibal is clearly a horror film where suspense and psychology are minor.But neither mythology nor mysticism. Hannibal is a new incarnation of the Lord of Darkness, Scott's arch-villain in Legend. And Clarice is the new princess Lily. Legend was very much oriented towards cannibalism: one of the trolls (a pig!) was a cannibal as was the green witch of the swamp.Florence is shown either in the morning mist or at night. And there is THIS music, this original piece of opera composed by Hans Zimmer from a sonnet by Dante. Mesmerizing, absolutely beautiful and totally outworldly - yet deeply melancholic and nocturnal.Legend was a dualistic film, yet Hannibal overcomes this view. In Legend, princess Lily faked the sacrifice of the unicorn because she was confident in the goodness and the innocence that had necessarily survived the fall. In Hannibal, Clarice consents to the sacrifice of the not-so-innocent police chief in order to testify that she's beyond judgement concerning Lecter.In SOTL, Lecter entered the intimacy if Clarice's childhood and helped her silence the slaughtered lamb within her soul. In Hannibal's soul, the cry of the lamb, or the unicorn, may never be silenced, but at least he'll know that he'll find in Clarice someone who has accepted him not as a criminal and a monster, but as a man and a victim. The rest is yet to be written... and filmed.So, as a word of conclusion, I'd say that Hannibal belongs to the works of Thomas Harris, Jonathan Demme and Ridley Scott together, and that it is both the counterpart of Silence of the Lamb and the lower and higher octave of Legend.All and all, I rate it 4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend of mine summed this movie up best, referring to why it doesn't have the same impact as Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon: "It's all about the gore."(he used a different word for gore, but it would give away part of the the ending to use it here) and it's true, that is what this movie is ALL about. In Silence we saw a man clearly tormented by his own inner demons to do such despicable acts for such a twisted reason. In Red Dragon, a man's hideous past with his grandmother forces him into a spiral of shame and guilt that manifests in a very bizarre and frightening way. In Hannibal...it's all about the gore. Even the 'villain's'(since Lecter cannot be called the villain, but the lesser of two evils)reasons for what he's doing is filled with blood and gore. His method is full of hideous gore. Hannibal's scenes are all very messy but these movies have always been violent and graphic, but with the other two there seemed to be far more method to it all and it always went into great detail into the psychoses of these men to see why, why they did this atrocious things. With this, it's understood and it's given and there's very little psychology to it. Is it a bad movie? Certainly not. Hopkins gives, as always, a brilliant performance as the cold and calculating Dr. Lecter. Julianne Moore fills the shoes of Jodie Foster playing Clarice Sterling, but simply can't come up with the same look or intensity as Foster could. Still, too many people blame the movie's downfall on her, because she's an easy target(she's NEW and FOREIGN in the movie series! Cue the demonic hiss) but she does an able job. The fault can't be squarely placed on one thing, but a combination of things because no ONE thing in this movie is truly lacking, but nothing is as powerful as the others were. This movie is NOT for the squeamish or the faint of heart, it gets INCREDIBLY messy, but it's worth seeing at least once.</fullReview>

The screenplay, adapted from Thomas Harris' novel was very well written and the art direction was great! I love the way Lecter uses the past and history to tell some stories of genuine horror and to make his victims feel totally creeped out and how he always manages to stay calm and suave. He really is the world's most notorious gentleman.No one else could have done this vision like how Ridley Scott did. He creates the eerie and chilling mood and so does the haunting score. If you were a fan of the original THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, then you must see this film! I know many people found it to be disappointing, but those are mostly the people who have read the book. If you are one of those people that does not want to see the movies because you liked the books and are afraid of being disappointed, then that's fine. Even the author, Thomas Harris has not viewed the films, because he is afraid it would influence his writing. But if you have not read the books, or if you are not afraid of being disappointed, then see HANNIBAL! This movie is awesome!HANNIBAL gets 5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gore, guts, and a hell of an interesting ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While 'Hannibal' fails to live up to its predecessor, 'The Silence of the Lambs' (honestly, who expected it to?), the film is still an enjoyable foray into the mind of a genious, that of Dr. Hannibal Lecter.I haven't read the Thomas Harris novel, so I cannot comment on the adaptation's accuracy to the book. I've heard, however, that the film strays inexcusably from said book. This is unfortunate, but certainly not an uncommon occurrence.Without a doubt, Anthony Hopkins saves this movie from being nothing more than a gore-fest. A similarly stellar performance from an unrecognizable Gary Oldman (as Mason Verger) lends further reason to see this film.Obviously, 'Hannibal' wasn't meant for children's eyes. While 'Silence' gained its suspense through imagination, 'Hannibal' gains its suspense through overt, grisly images. Apparently, this is one of the reasons Jodie Foster passed on returning to the role of (now FBI agent) Clarice Starling. It's certainly a shame that Ms. Foster did not reprise her role, but Julianne Moore does well in her place. Giancarlo Giannini also lends his talents well as Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi.Despite any of its faults, seeing 'Hannibal' is certainly not a bad way to spend a couple of hours. The story is both interesting and suspenseful, albeit less so than 'Silence.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems this is one of those movies whose audience is divided--those who hate it and those who love it. I can see merits in both sides. Jodie Foster was a much better Agent Starling, and not only that, the character was better written in Silence of the Lambs. But Anthony Hopkins is as good as ever, Ridley Scott's direction is superb, and Hans Zimmer's score is outstanding. A lot of the blood and gore is unnecessary however, and seems to dumb down the Lecter character. The idea of him committing these heinous acts is much more frightening than actually seeing him do it. Gary Oldman does the best he can with what he was given, but his character comes off as cartoony, as does the infamous scene with Ray Liota. Giancarlo Giannini does a great job however; his character's tension is practically palpable. Worth seeing I guess, though far surpassed by both Silence and Red Dragon. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible Hannibal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be difficult for any movie to follow up Silence Of The Lambs, but it would have been nice to get a sequel with a little bit of originality or insight. I went into this movie with an open mind (ha!) but came out with my appetite less than satisfied. (ha ha ha ha... ha.)Hannibal Lecter, the criminal genius deliciously played by Anthony Hopkins is now living abroad in Italy, and Clarice Starling, in 9 years has, thanks to Jodie Foster's refusal to be in this film, transformed into a completely different person. Not just the actress is different, either. Clarice now holds the record for the most kills by an FBI agent, according to the Guiness Book of World Records. (I'm not making this up.) The Clarice character has drastically changed since we last saw her, but unfortunately it's not in ways we can believe. She seems hardened and more solemn than before, but Julianne Moore, bravely stepping into Foster's shoes, finds herself in over her head.Thankfully, Hannibal hasn't changed much. To the film's benefit, it is sometimes thrilling to see the charismatic killer free on his own. Thrilling, but not scary. In fact, now that I think about it, this movie is not scary once. Which is surprising, considering it has five times more blood and gore than the original. So why isn't it scary? In Silence, the Lecter character was truly terrifying because of his limitations. The light of evil motivation shining in his eyes was infinitely more frightening than actually seeing him disembowel an unfortunate man in this movie. It's the hint, the suggestion of what he can do that is scary. To see him actually carrying it out is tiring and boring. After all, how many times have we seen a serial killer murdering people? After years of seeing the same formula repeated, it's tedious. In this respect, in Hannibal the Lecter character is reduced to Michael Meyers or Jason qualities, which is nothing short of an insult to Silence Of The Lambs.I haven't even gotten into the plot, which involves a surviving victim of Lecter's killing spree tracking him down to gain his revenge. In comic book form, this might just have worked, but seeing it on screen is almost laughably contrived. It also presents an ethical dilemma that the story prefers to leave completely unresolved. What we have here is one serial killer attempting to kill another. Who are we to root for? Clarice doesn't even seem to have a real part in this one, other than to stand by and witness what's going on. Basically we have our choice between cheering for an insane cannibalistic serial killer and an under-written, faceless (ha ha!) homocidal masochist. A movie so bad that Jodie Foster refused to be in it and Anthony Hopkins publicly voiced that he did it only for the money, Hannibal is basically an art-house sequel to Friday The 13th. The direction and some of the writing is very good, but essentially, this movie resembles a chicken with it's head cut off. It runs around in circles, going nowhere and periodically splurts blood all over everything, before it finally hits a wall and dies.(1/2/****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let it be known that I never appreciated Silence Of The Lambs as much as Manhunter. Not that I thought Silence was a bad film, far from it, but my heart was with the first film, and there I always thought it would stay. That being said, I went into seeing Hannibal with somewhat less than great expectations. And was I shocked to see the best of the 3 films when the credits started to roll. If you can, like some but not all have, make it past the more gruesome scenes and open your mind up to what Ridley Scott and his masterful cast have accomplished here, you are in for a real treat. A film that somehow manages to twist a killer into a hero. A film that, in it's own demented way, knows the difference between right and wrong. A film with heart. I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but Hannibal... yes HANNIBAL... is a special film. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>INFAME!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hated the ending of the book,"Hannibal" but I devoured it because Thomas Harris knows how to write a page-turner. I swore never to see the movie because I think the ending of the book is so bad. However, I decided to lighten up and give the film a chance. Big Mistake! David Mamet and Steve Zaillian do to the book what Hannibal Lecter did to Mason Verger's face. Harris's "Hannibal" is essentially a screenplay in book form. Leaving aside the ending, the book rises to a crescendo of tension and violence. It's a ragout as rich and as tasty as the one Lecter served to his Baltimore dinner guests. But Mason's sister Margot doesn't make it into the film. The gypsy woman who spits on Pazzi's shadow for giving up Gnoccho to "Shaitan"--what a visual that would have been--isn't there. Oreste Pini, the film maker enlisted to record the training of the pigs, is gone. The meeting in the FBI Office Building is butchered (I was looking forward to Clarice busting Bob Sneed for wearing a wire). Clarice's complex relationship with the poor dead FBI agent, John Brigham, could have been developed in a few lines, but wasn't. Ardelia Mapp--Clarice's constant, close friend and sounding board--disappears entirely. The delicious scene where Lecter leaves the opera score with Signora Pazzi to be retrieved by her husband the next day (the REAL excuse for Pazzi's appearance at Lecter's lecture to the Questura in the Palazzo Vecchio) is botched. Pazzi's treachery is what leads Lecter to Mason Verger and back to the United States; not just Starling's pain. The invention of the Starling-Lecter encounter in her home and in the train station are feeble conceits by the writers. Lecter is HUNTING Verger when he's caught by Carlo and his henchmen. So much of the genius of Thomas Harris's book is subverted for the sake of expediency, screen time, ego, and more than a little testosterone. A longer, more measured, more faithful movie--again, leaving aside the ending (the one amendment by the screenwriters that I approve of)--would have been more scary, more engrossing, and would have been a more fitting successor to "Silence Of The Lambs." I hope and pray that Ted Tally has this one on his mind. He respects Harris's intentions and prose and knows where to prune. Mamet and Zaillian carved their initials into the tree and left Ridley Scott to record the damage. FEH!</fullReview>

The film has good acting, f/x, make-up, and plenty of everyone's favorite cannibal, Dr. Lecter. I saw this before seeing SILENCE, and am glad for it. Had I seen the the terrifing original, I would have expected much more. Before seeing this, my older sister (who is a HUGE fan of the Hannibal Lecter books and movies) said she was disapointed by the ending. I also shared her thoughts, but it did not affect the rest of the film. I personally did not consider HANNIBAL scarey (just very gory).

		<shortDescription>The silence is broken but was Hannibal more chilling whilst in captivity?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, you have to give credit to Anthony Hopkins for making the part of Hannibal his own. In 'The silence of the lambs' he managed to scare his audience from behind a plastic screen and strike fear into us all through his beautifully delivered speeches and piercing stare. 'Hannibal' had the chance to build on this as Lecter is now roaming free around Italy. Unfortunately the film doesn't make the most of this and Hannibal Lecter seems for the most part to be more mellow than deceptively calm. Lecter walked freely through the streets but there was no real indication of him being an evil threat to the public, he had no menace about him. There was scope to really build Hannibal into film's most notorious monster but there were only glimpses of how dangerous the character is.The ending to the book that the film is based on is completely different to the film, yet this is understandable as the book's ending is quite unfilmable. This does not excuse the weak ending to the film. Although Lecter cutting his hand off shows his affection for Starling, I got the feeling that she didn't realise this and for me this heavily emotional point of the film was a little flat. In the book Clarice actually responds to Hannibal's feelings and they end up together but to do this the film would have had to have played more heavily on Starling's missing father and Hannibal's dead sister, which is skipped completely in the film. The book sees the characters missing their close relationships and then realising that they don't need the other to fill that place.The direction is fantastically well done and the film beautifully photographed as we've come to expect from Ridley Scott. Gary Oldman is great as the deformed and depraved Mason Verger while Ray Liotta and Giancarlo Giannini do justice to the characters of the book. Whilst Julianne Moore's portrayal of Starling isn't quite as good as Jodie Foster's, she does give a good effort to carrying on a character that was already well known and established. Credit must be given for changing the style of the movie and not trying to cash-in on the already popular predecessor.As a follow-on film to 'The silence of the lambs' this doesn't really work but as a stand-alone film it does quite well. I recommend seeing it if you haven't already done so, as it is quite an enjoyable movie and although Lecter's character seems almost diluted he is still quite capable of delivering a classic line or two (I'm giving great thought to eating your wife).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pale comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read the book Hannibal on release, I was eagerly anticipating the movie on cable... even stayed up late to watch it, and realised that I should have gone to bed any way.The tension between the two main characters was non exsitent, unlike SOTL, Lecter and Starlings on screen relationship was a pale comparison to that in the first movie where Hopkins portrayed the phsycotic Doctor.Many key elements from the book were totally overlooked and omitted in the film, and despite another reviewers comment that the lack of the "sister" character to Verger not being neccesary, I found that by omitting the afore mentioned character, and also some of the personality traits of Verger it detached from the true evil behind Verger's need for revenge, and also did not explain fully his motives, other than that he wanted revenge for some reason.Whilst I can appreciate the need for condensing the original story somewhat, I feel that it was to the detriment of the film in general.Maybe by reading the book first, I spoilt the film for myself, but in saying that, nothing could compensate for the poor performance of Moore as Starling... she lacked the ability to portray the emotional naivety and insecurity that Foster did so brilliantly in SOTL, which was a shame as I felt that there was never quite the rapport between the two characters that was evident in SOTL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as Silence Of the Lambs, but it's a great film in it's own right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's Sequel is more of a dark comedy than the more serious Original, but it's still a terrifying journey none the less. Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lector who as seen in the ending of the original, escape and was about to have an Old friend for lunch. This movie picks up ten years after the events, and finds the old doctor Living quite conformable in Rome. But all that is about to change when a vengeful Ex victim wants to make Lector pay for all that was done to him. Add to the mix is Clarice Starling (Who is played here by the always excellent Julianne Moore.) Who was about to lose her job because of a drug bust gone bad, int'l the F.B.I makes her an offer to reopen the Lector case, and clean her good name. While this was no where near as good as Silence of The Lambs, it's a good follow up because it does go more into the relationship between the good Doctor and Clarice and offers a more in depth connection between the two. The movie is also a visually stunning movie that hits you in so many levels, especially the scenes in Rome where a good portion of the film takes place. Anthony Hopkins gives another scary performance, and yet gives a sense of romantic flare to his character. It's his performance that single handedly makes this film a worthy sequel to the original. Don't compare this film to the original, because they are both two different films all together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Grows On You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: SPOILERS!Hannibal is a movie that definitely makes itself a better view every time you sit down and watch it. I first watched it as an immediate follow-up to Silence of the Lambs (I had just seen Red Dragon, in which Ralph Fiennes does an amazing job, watch him in Schindler's List, a good job there, too, and felt it necessary to watch the other two films). This was a major mistake. At first, Silence of the Lambs felt greatly superior to its sequels, and while it is the superior mystery, it should be known that Hannibal does not attempt to follow in the same vein as Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. These two films portrayed our dear cannibal as a supporting character, in Hannibal, Dr. Lecter is THE main character. In it, we begin to understand and learn aspects of this character that were not explained in Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. We begin to see Hannibal not only as some insane genius behind the glass but as a human with very inhuman potentials, something that we are all possible of, I might add. The best parts come in the negation of the violent rabid doctor images in which a lunging madman comes with gaping jaws, mawing at one's throat or tongue. He kills with an artistic capacity. One event, he hangs a man from the very windows that an ancestor of the victim was hanged also, but adds his own touch, disemboweling the victim to mirror an engraving of the hanging of Judas Iscariot with his bowels spilling from his body. Anthony Hopkins frighteningly portrays this all with great accuracy, but it also comes with his experiences as playing as very intelligent or diligent men (Note: Lieutenant Bligh in Bounty, the movie version of Mutiny on the Bounty). Many people think Anthony Hopkins' performance is overrated, on the contrary I think he does a marvelous job that few others, if any, could ever imitate. He's a masterful artist at what he does. The only qualm I have with his character is his use of "Okey-dokey", it sounds too plain for a character that is supposed to be that intelligent. Now, enough of Lecter and Hopkins.The story seems shallow in its origins. In fact, the entire renewal of the hunt for Lecter stems from the vendetta of a political string-pulling aristocrat who is played by Gary Oldman, a performane that if it were not in the credits and some of the flashbacks would render him unrecognizable, though I've never been a fan of the heavy Southern accents plaguing the Hannibal movies even though I live in Alabama, where I imagine I should be desensitized to it. The events that do occur because of this root, though, makes everything more interesting. Because he has to hide now again from international authorities, having been reinstated to the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted list during the movie's course, he now has to take the drastic actions that prove to be stomach-churning for the faint of heart. And for the gore-maniacs out there, this movie is definitely for you, the scenes of Lecter at work are quite enjoyable. Everyone I'm sure has heard of the famous scene featuring the dinner with Krendler (Ray Liotta) and Clarice (Julianne Moore) near the end of the movie.The last major point I care to make note of: Julianne Moore. At first, her performance doesn't seem as powerful as Jodie Foster's original Clarice, and this is come from the bias of having seen the first movie and developing a sense of being used to a certain actor portray a character. It would betray film-goers if Anthony Perkins didn't reprise his role in the Psycho sequels as Norman Bates, would it not? She does hold her own though and gives a good strong performace, unfortunately, it does upset the character balance. As a strong combative Clarice, she lacks the frailty and vulnerability that Lecter forced upon her. In the first film, she was clearly very intimidated. In this one she was not. Of course, the fact that the movie takes place ten years down the line, with ten years of FBI experience for our Agent Starling, doesn't help this comparison either. The only real way to know would be to watch two Hannibals, one with Jodie Foster and the other as is, or two Silence of the Lambs's, one as is and the other with Julianne Moore. Who knows? Maybe Julianne Moore is the better Clarice? I'm not at judgment to say because both actresses did jobs well done. Rounding off: The most of the cast does a good job. Ray Liotta definitely makes himself a hateable Washington Justice Department slimeball, who gets what he deserves. Anthony Hopkins, I believe, is not overrated. Julianne Moore does not disappoint. And Gary Oldman, as always, delivers a fine performance. The movie will definitely find itself more appealing to those interested in movies that show the killer at work, but also to those of interest in the Hannibal character, now what we need is a movie explaining why he chose cannibalism and murder. At first, I gave the movie a 7 of 10, seemingly a bit high amidst my initial disappointment (remember my fatal error, watching it back-to-back with Silence of the Lambs), but went back and eventually raised the score a notch to 8 of 10. Best suited for Hannibal fans and gore-lovers or anyone with morbid yet open minds willing explore those dark little thoughts in the back of your head.After all, we're all geniuses, aren't we? Hmph!</fullReview>

This is the film to see what he can do best, I only saw the Oscar winning film because of this one. Yes it was indeed good but in the end HANNIBAL is always was the star.Hannibal outgrossed Lambs at the box office and gained worldwide recognition especially to horror fans as well Lambs just didn't. As a matter of fact nobody cared for the Oscar winning film until this film came, don't you get it? What HANNIBAL did was to re-introduce himself being a famous character and his participation at silence of the lambs as well, too much plotting to a film can put you to sleep The more deeper plot you put on a film the more a film gets complicated. Julianne Moore did a good job playing Clarice Starling so as Jodie but this is Starling after 10 years and Hannibal after 10 years since Lambs.

		<fullReview>I'm sorry to go against the flow of almost everyone else who wrote reviews but I considered this to be a horrible film. It was just a slapping together of violent events without much of a coherent story.If Hannibal, the man we feared so much in Silence, were on the loose do you think he would act like this. He seems more of a comic then a killer. The lines that Hopkins had to say were so campy I sometimes broke out in laughter at what is supposed to be a serious horror film.The story was barely passable. The characters just ran about for seemingly no reason and everything Hannibal did seemed to have no drive. There was no inner dialogue so it just seemed as if Hannibal was killing people for no reason. SPOILER. One person even told me at the end of the movie that they knew that the doctor who killed Mason Verger was a bad guy. I'm sorry but the movie didn't even try to communicate how disgusting Verger was. He was a child molester and yet they barely made a point of it. Verger was the ultimate bad guy not Hannibal. END SPOILER.Now that we've covered the horrible story lets move on to the horrible acting. I must say that there was only one of the actors in this movie that I have any respect for (and believe it or not its not Anthony Hopkins). Giancarlo Giannini did a fine job acting in this film and I couldn't have been happier with his portrayal of his character. Hopkins' lines were far too campy to take his acting seriously. Ray Liotta has done better (Goodfellas and Blow). Finally we come to Julianne Moore. I guess all i can say is that she constantly looked shocked. It didn't matter whether she was supposed to be sexy, serious, or even laughing because she always looked shocked. Where was Jodie Foster when you needed her? They should never have made this movie without her.The gore in this movie was also overdone and had no sense of art to it.If you liked this movie then read the book. If you didn't like this movie (for reasons other then the gore) then read the book. If you haven't seen this movie then don't even bother just read the book. SPOILER. The book does actually have an ending (unlike this dreadful waste of good money and film). END SPOILER. So to all you who say that this was good...I weep for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a 6 on my scale. The only thing keeping it that high was Anthony Hopkins. The plot was dull and it almost made me fall asleep at times. I think this movie relied on Gore first, Big Stars second, and plot last. But If you like hannibal lecter youll like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lector has fled from justice in America and is now living in Italy. Will justice catch up with him?One of these films where they should have made a documentary about the making of the movie and dumped the product. For those living under a rock - this is a follow up to the overrated Silence of the Lambs - a Best Picture Oscar winning movie of the 90's. This ploughed a furrow of having a horrible killer for the boys and a strong female leaded for the girls and then using them to produce a cranked-up thriller with star performances.Original star Jodie Foster (Agent Starling) fell away from this movie (she didn't like aspects of the script, although she admitted the cheque would look good in the right light!) and I can see why. This is not really a follow up more a different movie with a different perspective: Lector at-large rather than behind bullet proof glass and Starling seeming to have lost her grip on common sense.What we have here - sadly - is a horror movie with a lot of pretencion!FBI Agent Starling is now in the Guiness Book of Records (no joke) as the agent with the most kills and is banished from the force for shooting a mother (with baby) who clearly shoots first. Julianne Moore doesn't know what to do with the character (when not running and jumping) and decides to play it as a kind of female Clint Eastwood - taking the unjust blows on the chin and not complaining too much.Lector (who is played by an unknown actor called Antony "Call Me Tony" Hopkins), meanwhile is living in Florence as loose-as-a-goose, taking a high profile job, going to the theatre and making guest appearances on the Muppet Show (ok the last one IS a joke - but it is the last promise.) He has even thrown away that silly blonde wig he tried on in the Silence of the Lambs.Other parties are after him too: Including a billionaire (Gary Oldman - but it could be anyone!) with a fully scared face who has had a bad experience (are there any other type?) with the old doctor and wants to get even.Thrillers have to thrill, but all the authors have is old material. The outcast cop who seems lax with her own personal security. The crazy billionaire. The incompetent bosses (one of them is Ray Liotta so KNOW something crazy is going to happen involving him - why else would he be here?) The spooky house. The sudden appearance out of shadows. The killer with a streak of poetic justice - need I go on?I was told this movie was bad before I saw it. I am glad. Knowing this allowed me to think "it isn't as bad as all that" and it isn't. Slow moving yes, but we can only have so much blood and guts in two hours. The finale is the most cruel and horrible in motion picture history - I doubt we will ever see anything so twisted as the "dinner table" scene ever again. Those that don't have a stomach for hospital dramas shouldn't even go past a cinema showing this movie no matter enter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous story (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd have to start off with saying that the basic premise of this film is ludicrous. In this film Dr. Hannibal Lectur is on the FBI'S 10 most wanted list, yet he apparently is able to work as a curator in an Italian art gallery, attend elite parties and give lectures without so much as wearing a false mustache. He is able to kill a police inspector and hang him from a balcony with a ton of witnesses and then somehow leave the gallery without issue (the movie doesn't even bother showing how this was possible) and travel back to America. In "Silence" we actually saw how he was able to trick and evade his captors and the ingenius (though sick) methods he used. In this film, he is able to walk around, go and do whatever he likes without any explanations simply because thats what the script requires him to do without even a remote sense of plausability. The conversations Hannibal has with Starling this time around aren't anywhere near as interesting as the ones in the first film. The whole Starling character seems very flat in this movie and I don't think it was Julianne Moore's fault, the writing is to blame. Since this film doesn't have any of the thrilling and creative moments that the first film had, it goes the easy way and tries to compensate with a gross-out ending that seems aimed at the lowest common denominator.Anyway....the visuals in the film are good (thanks to Ridley Scott) so that gives it 3/10. We've now had "Silence of the Lambs", "Hannibal", "Manhunter"/"Red Dragon"...Enough already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since I saw "The Silence of the Lambs" when I was young, I have been fascinated by serial killers and forensics. I've been to forensics lectures, watched every detective show on television, and read every website on Dahmer and Gacy that I could find. Naturally I was disappointed with "Hannibal", because it was just another horror movie. When I learned that "Red Dragon" would feature Ed Norton, I was ready to get in line!For once, I saw a movie that actually lived up to my expectations, and then some. This movie is as good, if not better than "Silence". The thing I enjoy so much about these type of detective movies is the scenes where you can almost see the "gears turning" as the detective tries to put the puzzle together. If you have seen "Red Dragon", you know very well that Norton's early scene in the hotel room, with pictures covering the floor, fits this description.On top of a very good, suspenseful story, there are flashes of images and camera angles that make the viewer cringe, jump, and stare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not SILENCE, just a black comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal (2001) D: Ridley Scott. Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Giancarlo Giannini, Ray Liotta, Frankie Faison, Francesca Neri, Hazelle Goodman, David Andrews. 10 years after the events of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) is alive and at large, living in Florence, Italy. When FBI agent Clarice Starling (now played by Moore) is reassigned to the case, she and Lecter play cat-and-mouse games. Does not have the style or thrills of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and is simply just a black comedy. To be fair to Moore (who has the thankless job of replacing Jodie Foster as Starling) she delivers a good performance, but then again she ISN'T the same character we knew in 1991. The film is also overly gory and the ending, although true to the book, is disgusting. RATING: 6 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and torture, grisly images, strong language, and nudity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read the book - and not being particularly impressed with it - I had not been in a hurry to see the movie. However, I was surprised that the movie was probably better than the book. The plot was different than the book, i.e. Verger's sister wasn't included in the movie and I thought she confused the plot in the book. The ending was entirely different than the book - and it was a better ending than the book. As a whole, I thought the movie was a 6 or 7 out of 10. A movie worth seeing, but not spending $8 to see it at the movie. Worthy of a rental....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that the buzz about "Hannibal" has finally died down,I can review it properly.Some critics hated it.Others loved it.I hope I can tell you everything you need to know about "Hannibal" without spoiling the fun for those of you who haven't seen it yet.First of all,let's get one thing straight:There was no influence on me.Critics were divided,folks who saw it couldn't describe it...I saw it when it first came out here in Greece.I wasn't disappointed.But I didn't REALLY like it either.It was just another good but forgettable film.I watched it again last night on television.And last night,everything looked different.Perhaps because I saw it with an open mind(no pun intended).There might be some spoilers ahead.I viewed "Hannibal" like a highly intellectual,artistic film and that's the way it should be viewed .It's like a medieval drama, it's a very dark love story that occurs between two people who should never be together.It's not a horror film.It's not the sequel to the "Silence Of The Lambs".It contains many messages and social comments(SPOILER).For example:The sequence in which the good doctor cuts a character's scull open and examines it,is a comment on how we are being brainwashed and forced to believe "facts" by ultra-powerful people in high places.Get it?Also,watching "Hannibal" is a liberating experience.What he says and what he does are stuff that we WOULD like to say and-partially-do.The silence is broken.A truly gob-smacking film is out there for you to enjoy.Just don't try to put it into a category.You can't do that."Hannibal" cannot be classified.He's out there and he's hungry.If you get rude with him he'll...eat your wife,after giving it serious thought!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Underrated Movie of the Last Decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why people make up their minds to dislike a sequel before they even see it, but it seems that making a sequel is often a lose-lose proposition from the creators' standpoint. If it's too much like the original, everyone hates it because it's just more of the same, but if it tries to be different, everyone hates it because it's not in keeping with the original. Geez - just give it a chance. Really watch this movie rather than cynically commenting on it all the way through in your head and you might discover its depth and quality. If you go into this movie hoping to re-experience Silence of the Lambs, you will be sorely disappointed and I would point you to the glut of other serial killer material that followed in the wake of SotL. That's the thing about a great original like Silence - It can't be duplicated. But I applaud Thomas Harris, first, and Ridley Scott, second, for daring to take on this sequel and to change it into something different, but still excellent. Considering the number of copy cats that followed Silence (one of them being, tellingly, CopyCat), I think that Thomas Harris was wise not to attempt to do more of the same. He could have downshifted into a story even more journalistically realistic than Silence was, and that would have been interesting but probably unsatisfying because of its smaller scope. Instead, he chose to ride the wave of serial killer frenzy that's erupted in the last ten years and poke some fun at it by writing an opera, with Hannibal as the star soloist. And Ridley Scott has picked up on that sentiment as well, executing a movie that's not as haunting as Silence but just as satisfying.The cinematography is as gorgeous as everything else turned out by Scott (or his brother, Tony) and the performances are superb. I would have preferred that the Mason Verger character remain the seething monster, on his back in his sick bed, masterminding Hannibal's capture to Gary Oldman's chipper, sadistic codger, but Oldman's performance is delightful in a new, different way. And being different but excellent in a new way is what viewers should ultimately take from this movie. Sorry, but trying to rehash an original when making a sequel is kind of a coward's way out - it takes guts to try something different and when it turns out as well as this film did, it should be applauded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me Hannibal was the best film of 2002. I was very disappointed when it didn't receive an Academy Award nomination or win. Anthony Hopkins made another best performance, a very hard character to act. Moore also did an excellent job playing Clarice starling. The main plot of the story is that we the audience found out where Hannibal has been for the past ten years and what brings him back to us. Mason verger a character that makes you feel sorry for Hannibal for just a little bit. Showing you that there are crazier people with mental problems other than Hannibal. Towards the end is a lot of twist and turns and all the film turns out perfect! This film is right up there with 1991 filming The Silence of the Lambs. Anthony Hopkins is the Greatest Actor of all time pulling out Hannibal every time so well! As we see Brain Cox play Hannibal in 1986 in Man-Hunter he plays him well but, Hopkins puts all he has into this one character making this film one not to be over looked!</fullReview>

This film is a character study to say the least and these characters are not shallow. This is not meant to be a put down but Lambs has more appeal to a simple--let's get this thing solved type of viewer. Lambs was like fast food(I like fast food) and Hannibal was more along the lines of a bistro. Don't go to a fancy food joint with the kids and expect to see Ronald McDonald.

		<fullReview>: Being a sequel to `Silence of the Lambs' and the (very much) under-appreciated `Manhunter' was a tough act to follow. Could Ridley Scott, with a Mamet adaptation of Harris novel do it? No, he could not.Clarice Starling has moved on ten years. For one she's body-morphed into Actress Juliane Moore. For another she's heading up a drugs bust, which goes pear-shaped. Disgraced, Starling is set to work on the case that gave her her fame - that of Hannibal Lecter and his purported reappearance. Is he back? Can she stop him? Are you hungry? Well the movie has a `two halves' feel here. There's a plot element of a detective trying to claim the reward for Lecter's capture while Starling hunts him down. to a plot element where one of Lecter's previous victims is desperate to hunt down Lecter to exact brutal revenge. Neither is all that engaging. Part of the problem is that the previous two movies worked so well because Lecter assisted the detective in hunting down another psychopath through psychological mind games. Here Lecter is the `bad guy' and, while the script has some interesting moments between himself and Starling, there's none of that great sense of the desperate hunt that the previous movies gave us. This creates a lack of tension and excitement. Yes, Lecter is meant to the villain but by now we would have expected him to transcend such an obvious role. The final resolution of the movie seems both familiar and irritatingly unsatisfying.Hopkins has Lecter done to a tee. It is, after all, the role that made him famous. He's the quintessential gentlemen - only this one is a psychopath. He doesn't have to strain himself here and there's a feeling he's doing it by the numbers. Moore is no replacement for Foster - it's like she's trying to be hard to emulate Foster and not letting herself adopt the role. The charisma between her and Hopkins isn't as strong either as it was with Foster and Hopkins, a pity when the movie hinges on it so.Scott is an accomplished director with some great skill and great movies (and turkeys) behind him. As usual with his films, this one is quite dark - lots of shadows, observed shots, etc. The score accompanying it is grand, if not startling (fairly unmemorable). There's a very pretty opening credit sequence, and the finale is quite well shot and framed, etc. but other than that. nothing that stuck in my head.`Hannibal' is a grand little thriller/horror/drama in its own right - it's just that it can't compete with its legacy and so, as a result, suffers by comparison. It will be interesting to see how `Red Dragon' fares against this. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>rating 4/10After seeing "manhunter" and "silence of the lambs" you get ready for a good final part of the trilogy of Harris. But halfway thru the movie i got serious doubts, but you keep watching and hoping the end will make up for it. Well, to me it didn't.In retrospect, i think "Hannibal" is an unbelievable movie, especially the way special agent Clarice Starling handles the case and the ending of it. If you haven't seen it yet, don't bother. The blood 'n' gore level isn't high enough to make it a good horror and the whole atmosphere in the movie is more like a bad opera (is that why they choose Venice as a location ?) than a thriller (i couldn't find one scary part).Bummer from A - Z</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good in parts, plain awful in others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** HANNIBAL is one of those odd films that even though you would never describe it as a good movie, it contains enough strong scenes, plot developments and downright lunacy that you will find yourself thinking about it for a long time. Certainly longer than some of the elements of the film deserve, particularly the criminally insane sub plot which, in case you are not aware (and haven't read the book) is about killer pigs.SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was, I think most critics agree, a defining moment in film, both within the genre (drama/horror) and the industry itself. In particular, Anthony Hopkins performance as the intellectual psychopath Hannibal Lecter was a memorable one indeed, and in my opinion one of the rare deserving Best Actor winners at the Academy Awards (in any year). While I do not apply the same high praise to Jody Foster, who I feel more or less plays herself in every film she is in, her performance was tight as Clarice Starling and she offered a vulnerability to the character which added increased tension to her scenes with Hopkins.When Foster then chose to drop out of the sequel to SILENCE (after, by all accounts, demanding multiple rewrites of the script because she felt Starling was not being portrayed accurately), shortly followed by SILENCE director Jonathan Demme, well. let's say it didn't look too good for HANNIBAL. From my perspective, it looked very bad indeed - I was never an enormous fan of the book, feeling that it fell well short of both RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (the first two books in Thomas Harris' Hannibal Lecter trilogy) and, even though Hopkins was still attached to the project, I felt that HANNIBAL was likely to be a mixed effort at best.And I was unfortunately to be proven correct in my assumptions.HANNIBAL is, as I said above, by no means a bad film. By the same token, it is by no means a good film, and while it has some excellent scenes and Hopkins, as Lecter, is always a treat, I would be hard pressed to recommend this feature wholeheartedly without some hesitation.You will recall from the end of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS that Dr. Lecter was now very much at large, having escaped from his asylum and moved on to "lunch" with Dr. Chilton. In HANNIBAL we learn that not only is Lecter still very much on the prowl, but that he has re-established himself in Florence, Italy, and is the under the guise of Dr. Fell, the curator to be of a leading library.We are also re-introduced to Clarice Starling (now played by Julianne Moore), who has continued her strong career at the FBI (recall that in SILENCE prior to the Lecter case she was much wet behind the ears). This is all thrown into jeopardy, however, when Starling's involvement in a case is perceived by the Bureau (in particular her loathsome boss Paul Krendler, played by Ray Liotta. Krendler is one of those too-frequent characters in movies that has ZERO redeeming qualities, and subsequently is as believable as Santa Claus to a tribe in the Amazon rainforest. Among his lesser qualities include a general hated for Starling, simply because she continuously refuses his sexual advances) as directly responsible for the deaths of several people (including two agents and a mother, albeit a dangerous woman intent on spreading the AIDS virus). Starling is placed on probation (even though from our perspective, technically she didn't actually do anything wrong), and has to hand in her gun and badge.Two new characters are then developed - billionaire Mason Verger, who we learn is the only victim to ever survive an encounter with Dr. Lecter, and Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi, a police officer who lives and works in Florence.Verger (played by Gary Oldman, who later had is name removed from the credits after being refused top billing, the pussy) is now hideously disfigured, and hell-bent on securing revenge on Lecter. How is he going to do this you might add? Well, initially he's going to use all the resources at his disposal to track down Lecter, the pinnacle of which is a three million dollar reward for any information leading to his direct capture. And, finally, when Lecter is within his grasp, he's going to (tee hee) feed him slowly to a well-trained herd of really angry, hungry pigs. No, really. No. Really.Pazzi, meanwhile, is briefly involved in a serial killer investigation of his own - the mysterious Il Mostro, who follows and kills young couples kissing in their cars. Pazzi is drawn to Lecter's/Dr. Fell's library within the process of this investigation, as he is following up the disappearance of Lecter's predecessor. (Subsequently, after some brief Banter between Pazzi and Lecter/Fell, the entire Il Mostro subplot is abandoned, although it does turn up in some detail in the DVD release of HANNIBAL.)However, as his work evolves, Pazzi becomes increasingly suspicious of Dr. Fell, and later discovers Fell's true identity. When he learns of the huge reward for Lecter's capture, he contacts Mason Verger and together they develop a plan to capture him.This, of course, does not go to plan, and after Lecter dispatches of both Pazzi and Verger's hoods, Mason realises that he will need more than a team of half-witted henchman to outwit the uber-smart Doctor. It dawns on him that he needs bait, and what better than the source of Lecter's desire - Clarice Starling. And then, and only then, the little piggies will have some roast beef. Or something. He achieves this by using the charming Krendler to plant evidence that incriminates Starling as potentially having some kind of an affair with Lecter. (A bit flimsy, but the Bureau seemed to buy it.)Meanwhile, Starling has independently worked out the location of the good Doctor, but she needn't have bothered, as Lecter soon returns to the USA, and makes contact with her. In a nice cat-and-mouse scene, Starling and Lecter converse over mobile telephones as Lecter is pursued by more of Mason's hoods. This time, however, they succeed, and Lecter is captured and taken to Mason's estate.Starling, though, is in pursuit, and tracks Lecter and the hoods back to Mason's party. She saves the Doctor from his grisly fate, with Mason himself being the unfortunate appetiser of the pigs, but, ironically in doing so, becomes captured by Lecter. The Doctor takes Starling back to Krendler's boat house, tends to her wounds, and then the two sit down for dinner with the also captive Krendler, who isn't really feeling himself.And that's pretty much it. Now, the review above doesn't really do the good parts of the film justice - it is absolutely beautifully shot, with the scenes in Florence particularly stunning, and throughout the acting is generally above par (although one feels that Moore was kind of going through the motions a little, which perhaps is not her fault; how do you follow an Oscar-winning performance by another actress in the same role?), although Hopkins does appear to switch from calm to ham at a moments notice as Lecter. The film is the worse when he is offscreen, however, and you can forgive the campness of the performance. Oldman is moderately creepy as the grotesque Verger, but the character doesn't really offer any weight or anything to the overall development of Lecter within the series, and as I mentioned the subplot involving the pigs reeks of a poor James Bond villain and should never have been devised (shame on you, Thomas Harris.)All in all, Ridley Scott did a solid performance with direction but it is the script itself that is found lacking. Whereas the books go into detail behind both Lecter's motive and the relationship with Starling, here one is left feeling that whilst Lecter is clearly a borderline genius, the reasoning for his madness is never explained - simply, you kind of feel that we are told that he is "just evil", and that'll do for why he does what he does. Moreover, Lecter's addition to the FBI "Ten Most Wanted" list would, one feels, lead him to either taking a very underground existence or having some kind of facial reconstructive work. He does neither, and you would think that an American taking a prominent role at a major Italian library would draw some attention. Finally, just where does the good Doctor get his resources from? Good taste, unfortunately, costs, but Lecter appears to be have access to unlimited funds. How? Eight years in an asylum didn't leave a lot of time for stockpicking, and you would think that even if he did hide money away in some kind of offshore bank account, it would be limited.The ending was quite weak, I felt, although I did like the interplay between Lecter and Starling at the fridge (particularly his choice of 'cuts'). Ray Liotta was plain awful in the role of Krendler, and as stated the character was SO paper thin and offensive that you just knew he was going to die (even if you hadn't heard about the much publicised, and just plain ridiculous, brain scene.) Lecter plodding away in a boat at about one knot an hour whilst FBI agents were all around was also a little hard to swallow, too.I also felt that the very final scene with Lecter and the young boy was quite disturbing, when analysed, although it is implied by the DVD that this is suggestive of Lecter 'grooming' the youngster with his influence. Still, it left a funny taste in the mouth (not unlike that in Krendler's I would imagine.)All in all, not bad, but a bit of a mixed bag, and overall the movie was hurt by the flaws I mentioned above. Having said that, RED DRAGON looks excellent, and whereas MANHUNTER was a good and underated movie, the early trailers and teasers for RED DRAGON are mouthwatering. I am intrigued to see what Edward Norton - my favourite actor - can bring to the role of Will Graham, but so far I like what I have seen. And with Hopkins seemingly moving back to a more menacing performance as Lecter (as opposed to a camp one), and the inclusion of Harvey Keitel and Ralph Fiennes (who looks very sinister as the Dragon), this should be an acting tour de force.RED DRAGON is released on October 4.RATING: 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silence of the lambs is one of my favourite films because Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lector is truly menacing, it has a believable storyline and an edge of the seat ending when Starling finally confronts Buffalo Bill.Hannibal on the other hand has none of these- the storyline has no clear path and there are too many holes in the plot- such as the fact that being on the FBI`s most wanted list has not stopped him living undisguised for 10 years, even returning to the US to carry on his slayings.I found the gore in the film to be way over the top and unnecessary- SOTL didnt need excessive amounts of blood letting to be a genuine horror film.All in all a dull,directionless and unworthy sequal which seems to have been aimed at the Scream crowd rather than your more thinking movie goer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Ta Ta too far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rumour is that Scott originally turned down this project as he heard the title and imagined that it was another historical epic. More's the pity, as this really is the emperor without any clothes, as the director turns in another classy effort, full of his usual cinematographic skill and care, but a film which is ultimately ugly and unnecessary. This is a series in decline: initially there was the striking Manhunter, featuring an excellent Brian Cox as Lecter; then Jonathan Demme's slightly overrated but still enjoyable Silence of The Lambs. It has been a profitable franchise that just had to continue, and the new film has all the hallmarks of being cobbled together as an excuse to extend a unconvincing course of events even further, while leaving the door open for a fourth installment.Hannibal falls into three broad sections: first the professional disgrace of Agent Starling; then the discovery and trap set for Lecter in Italy; lastly the confrontation in America. Hannibal's presence (as he is now the star of the show) is delayed until quite a few minutes into the picture. Scriptwriter Mamet obviously thought it a good idea and as a way to build up suspense. There's no doubt that there's tension in the air as we await his arrival. It also enables some filling in of Starling's character and motivation. But the opening action scenes are a distraction, the events they portray are never referred to again. By the end of the film it is obvious what they were: narrative padding, deferring the arrival of the main event. Mamet later even has dialogue bathetically undermining the seriousness of what has happened: The Guinness Book of Records congratulates Starling on being the Female FBI agent who has ?shot the most people' - a ludicrous moment.The problem is that Hannibal's insouciant malevolence is almost entirely static by nature. One thinks of the evil he suggests, regularly in situ in Manhunter's prison cell, or Hopkin's usual calm movements as an actor. Hannibal strolls and discourses, never hurries or panics. He is the civilised chef or lecturer, standing or being wheeled out in front of people, leisurely lighting candles or preparing a ghastly repast; what he is not is dynamic. Hannibal is an action picture constructed around a slow moving centre, and the result is mostly dull. Even the mutilated, fish-faced Mason Verger (an unrecognisable Gary Oldman) is unfortunately bed or wheelchair-ridden ? hardly the dynamic opposition required. A chase or two, perhaps more of the manhunt in action for the most wanted Doctor might have leavened the pace a little. Instead, in Verger's watery eyed prosthetics we experience some of the imaginative exhaustion of a series which is feeding upon itself.By far the most interesting part of the film occurs in Italy, where the avaristic Inspector Pazzi (Giancarlo Gianni, in his most high profile film since the cult Seven Beauties (1976)) discovers Hannibal's identity and plots to secure his capture for the reward himself. But, sadly, Gianni's hangdog charisma as an actor notwithstanding (oh why couldn't he have been cast as Starling's boss, and the wolfish Ray Liotta be the Italian cop?) this is a section fatally drained of tension. It is clear that he will meet his fate at the hands of Lector, who is too smart to fall for this sort of mid-film trap; we even know the likely cause of his murder, so heavily is the emphasis on the grisly death of his ancestor. All Pazzi can do is to listlessly plot and smoke until his game is up ? a moment admittedly lightened by Lecter's quizzical ?Entrails in or out?' ? while the gore-starved audience is denied more of the suggestion made by the killer that he would eat the wife.There's a scene in the cult exploitation flick ?Bloodsucking Freaks' (1976), in which a mad doctor gleefully sucks a victim's brains out through a straw. One is irresistably reminded of this at the end of Hannibal, except that the original, Sadean, justification is replaced here by a jokey, gourmet one. For all of Lecter's weird and compulsive romancing of Starling (which by the next installment will no doubt develop into something more reciprocal), the ending, with the cranial work on Krendler (Liotta) is absurd. Liotta, excellently manic in Goodfellas (1990), good in so many other films, looks embarrassed mouthing his goofy remarks, and one is not surprised. Was this kitchen cabinet of horrors really written by Mamet? From lecher to Lecter's leftovers, Krendelr's role is an unthankful one, the actor's usual dynamism restricted to sexist remarks within smart team briefings and enclosed spaces. But Krendler-Liotta still seems more immediately dangerous to Starling than the good doctor ever does, which is one indication of the way that Lecter has been reduced in stature as each installment has progressed downwards. Like Freddy Kruger, Jason Vorhees and Michael Myers before him, familiarity has bred contempt, and Dr Lecter has lost much of the edge as a villain he once had.None of Scott's excellent lighting, or Zimmer's outstanding score, can make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, any more than Hopkin's restrained acting style can make Krendler's brain much of a delicacy to be relished. Moments of true horror, like the man eating hogs, do stand out in the general dullness, but these are too far between to save a film which leaves those who expected better with a bad taste in the mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has little point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Silence of the Lambs gave us a captivating serial killer tale that was smart, intriguing, and exciting. Hannibal on the other hand is really none of those. I have to admit Hannibal does give us decent lead performances, Anthony Hopkins is good, and while Julian Moore doesn't seem to have near the presense that Jodie Foster did she still does a good job with what she's given. I have to say though this movie really doesn't have a point except to show us a lot of gore. The movie is so graphic infact that it's hard for me to imagine how it did not get an NC-17 rating. Maybe at the youngest someone 16 could see this movie, but I don't know how you make a case that someone younger than that should. I felt kind of disgusted after this movie, particularly after the final scene I which won't even bother to describe. I'm giving this movie a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets start with the positives. All those familiar with Ridley scotts work will be unsurprised that the direction of this film is excellent. The flaws in this film are however quite clear. While the silence of the lambs created the sense of tension through what you don't see, Hannibal is far more graphic. Thus, these shock tactics ruins the tension and pails in comparison to the intricate and subtle psycological thrills in the first film.Good, but not as good as people say6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the movies was good, and it will definitely creep you out if you watch it with the lights out and no one else around. Other than that it falls a bit flat. Upon reflection the saddest part about the movie is the constant attempts at shock value and the paper thin plot. No one does anything for any real reason, which is the strangest part, except Hannibal.Also, Hannibal is the only character that is cool, funny, and dare I say, human. All the other characters seem more like caricatures, and Moore was terrible as Agent Starling.This movie got 6 stars JUST for Anthony Hopkins and he is certainly the best part about the film. He makes you forget that the plot goes no where and after 2 1/2 hours the movie was no closer to resolving itself than it was in the beginning. Sadly, Hannibal Lecture is going to be the next Freddy or Jason, lets just hope he continues to be exciting and witty as he has been in these two movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film which is sometimes very gory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HANNIBAL, in my opinion, is an excellent film which is sometimes very gory. I thought that Clarice (Julianne Moore) looked very beautiful in all the dressy clothing she wore -- Especially the fancy, black dress she had on during the time she was at Dr. Lecter's (Anthony Hopkins) house. Also, I really liked the boars that were in the barn towards the end of the movie. They looked really adorable, even though they're wild animals. In addition, if you ask me, the Pazzis (Giancarlo Giannini and Francesca Neri) looked very nice in the attire they wore to the opera. When Clarice yelled, "F.B.I," at the fish market, which is where she confronted Evelda (Hazelle Goodman), I really felt good and smiled. I must say that I absolutely loved the fish market scene! Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that Hopkins and Moore deserve a Golden Globe for their smashing performances as a psychotic serial killer and a disgraced F.B.I. agent. Now, in conclusion, to all you Anthony Hopkins or Julianne Moore fans that have not seen this excellent film which is sometimes very gory, I highly recommend it! You're in for a good time as well as some pure chills and thrills, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, turn down the lights, lock all your doors and windows, kick back with a friend, and bon appetit!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With much anticipation, this film proved to be quite a clunker. Little intrigue, even less intelligence, all that had been expended in the original film was lost in this high gleam, little substance film. Sure, Anthony Hopkins was good, but his character was once again overacted, and the cartoonish quality of Lector seemed to make him less scary. One might beg to differ in part due to the final scene, but that is beside the point. Lector's lack of reality makes him less scary and intriguing, and thus this hurts the overall performance. To say the least, everything else in the film was rather blasé and dull. Julianne Moore was rather dull in her role as Clarisse, and Ray Liotta seemed really out of place. The only actor worth mentioning was Gary Oldman, and you couldn't even tell it was him. Overall, a real dud to say the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The other cannibal movie Silence of the Lambs won best picture and many other Oscars with the Academy saying it was as good as Gone with the Wind. What does that say about the Academy. This Hannibal basically celebrates evil and basically throws in a morality lesson to say that sexism is worse than torture or violent murder. You might catch the line in the movie "Apostle Paul hated women too."We the movie goers recently just seem to be pawns for whatever is the agenda of the month.At least films like Scream don't try an pass themselves off as something deep like this dark gross film. By the way, if the Academy is going to start giving awards to horror films then Night of the Living Dead deserved it far more than this or Silence of the Lambs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near as good as the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the book you learn all about the Dr. Hannibal Lecter. His childhood and the reasons behind him liking starling. It lived up to that title, HANNIBAL. In the movie you learn nothing new about the doctor except that he is living in Italy, thats about it. It's not a bad film, but it's not a great one either ( Like the silence of the lambs was). Here Hopkins is the star of the film, unlike lambs where he was the 2nd star) and yet we do not get to see him until 30 minutes into the movie. For me, he is the main reason why I went to see it, because of him, not to see Moore for the first 30 min. Then when we do see him it's only for 30 maybe 45 seconds, then it's right back to Moore for another section of the movie. From on screen time I would bet that Moore was on the screen alot more that Hopkins. And he is the star of the film, or that was what I thought by the title, it's named after him for one thing.Last but not least, the ending, I WILL NOT SAY WHAT HAPPENS, but that is how they wanted to end it. I liked the books ending and after the movie's one I like it a lot now. They have two fair writers, a great director, a great cast, a year and a half to make it, and an 87 million dollar budget,( 4x what lambs had to make do with, and it's ending was perfect), and that was the best they could come up with all the time they had. No wonder they got Ted Tally to write Red Dragon for them, if you let those two writers write Red Dragon, who knows, they might have Ralph Fiennes, Dolarhyde fly away by growing a set of wings. But, that have been a better ending than what they came up with.Before the ending 10 out of 10 After the ending 6 out of 10YES IT WAS THAT DUMB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, simply awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just watched Silence of the Lambs for the nth time, I am reminded of all the reasons Hannibal is an awful failure. Perhaps it is not fair to compare the two films, however the comparison is inevitable.Silence establishes such a powerful, realistic, bleak tone that would go on to inspire tv and film for the next decade (can you say X-files?). The characters were so wonderfully complex and interesting. The relationship between Clarice and Lector evolved as a sort of dance, each following the other's lead. Hannibal attempts to further this relationship, but becomes bogged down by its own grandure. The tone and style are so grandiose and operatic, that everything else is completely drowned out. The characters have even been so warped that their actions are not their own. I never felt that what they were doing truly fit their character. (The scene in which Lector lures Clarice into the mall with the telephone game comes close, but ultimately seems like a pale imitation of Silence.) Perhaps the biggest problem, though, is that Hannibal never comes across as more than Friday the 13th: The Opera. Whereas Silence scares in a very subconcious reasonating way, Hannibal goes for cheap scares and gory effects. For example, in Silence, Clarice, not the audiece, is shown a photo of the nurse Lector ravaged. In Hannibal, a video tape of the incident is shown, causing a momentary jump, but nothing more. Ultimately, Hannibal is more a creation of the desire to hear Anthony Hopkins utter "hello Clarice...." once more than a realization of a true artistic vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent enough movie if not spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Silence of the Lambs was a dark masterpiece. An outstanding movie with powerhouse performances.Hannibal had too much to live up to, and lacked Jodie Foster's excellent Clarice.While this was certainly a good movie in its own right, it wasn't truly a patch on the original. Lecter, as played magnificently by Anthony Hopkins, is as disturbingly charismatic and intuitive as ever, and remains one of the great movie characters. Clarice, on the other hand, while a valiant attempt by Julianne Moore, doesn't embody the same vulnerability which surrounded her in the first movie. Perhaps Foster was just better, I don't know.The plot is fairly good, and certainly gripping enough, but Lecter never seems vulnerable - this requires a touch of suspension of disbelief. He just seems to always be that step ahead.The gore is a major point publicised about this movie. There isn't a vast amount of it - but what there is is extremely painful looking. The major talking point with respect to this is the ending sequence with Ray Liotta - another review commments that it's ridiculous; absurd. I'd say surreal.You don't really need a strong stomach to watch this - but you will wince in places.Overall a good movie, and well worth renting/buying. Just not the masterpiece the original was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Silence of the Lambs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself as a somewhat of a fan for the Hannibal Lecter- flicks so of course I ended up seeing this very-different-from-the-first-one-movie.Before I saw the movie, I rent the book by Thomas Harris and Steven Zallian's screenplay is somewhat different from Tom's book. In the book, information about why Lecter is such a psycho is revealed, but many violent scenes have been cut out in the script. I have read many reviews about this movie, and about everyone says " Do not watch if you are sensitive " or " Macabre, unwatchable film. Avoid " but actually I don't see Hannibal as an extreme-violence movie. It is like a dramathriller with dark tones surrounding it and the violent scenes are ( almost always )needed to show the current situation.Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar Academy Award for his role as Lecter in 1991, and directors and those people won Oscars, even they. I think Hannibal is a very underrated movie, because it deserves so much better than just to be hacked and slashed off by the movie critics. I personally think that Hannibal deserves those Oscars that Silence of the Lambs got in 1991, and director Ridley Scott does a very good job.Since Jodie Foster, even though 15 re-writes of the script, said no to once again play Clarice Starling of the FBI and was offered a whopping $40 million dollars to do so, the role as Clarice went straight to Oscar- nominee Julianne Moore. She played and dinosaur-hunter in Jurassic Park II: Lost World and also starred in The Shipping News, but this is by far her bast role.Gary Oldman plays multi-millionaire Mason Verger, a psycho that was a patient of Hannibal Lecter. After Lecter forced him to cut his own face, Verger is obsessed with revenge. Oldman does this part very nice, even though you can't see it's him.Italian top-actor Giovani Giannini plays Italian homicide detective Rinaldo Pazzi who gets payed to deliver Lecter, who happens to be in Florence, to Mason Verger. He does a fair job but never comes close to acting as good as Hopkins or Moore.Ray Liotta is playing Paul Krendler of the justice department and after we have seen him playing psychos, it's quite fun to see him playing this cocky, corrupt employee at the justice department.This is really one of my favorite movies of all time, beating Silence of the Lambs, easily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(SOME SPOILERS)I first saw Hannibal when it came out in the theaters. I had readthe book and was really looking forward to the film. I neverexpected it to reach the same heights that Silence of The Lambsdid, but I was hoping for a good companion to that great film. When I left the theater I was very disappointed. Last week I sawthe film for the second time on cable, and it's really not that bad. Infact the first hour and a half are quite good. It's when Hannibalcomes to America that the film does a total nose dive.The film is gorgeous to look at during it's first half in Italy, andHopkins does a good job of giving the audience that subtle feelingof uneasiness that made his performance in SOTL so great. Thepacing feels right and the plot unfolds well, climaxed by a nastydeath scene of the inspector. Then when the film shifts gears andHannibal comes back to the states, the tone, and smartness of theplot just goes away. It felt as if entire chunks of the plot were cutout so the movie wouldn't play too long. After taking so much timeto build tension with Hannibal being discovered and stalked inItaly, Ridley Scott builds no tension at all during the climactic pigeating scene. It just sort of happens. Two things that really brought the film down during the second halfare the characters of Mason Verger and Clarice Starling. The toneof the Verger character never felt right. Am I supposed to fear thisguy or laugh at him? It never seemed clear. The make-up job onhim seemed a little off as well. To be honest, it was hard to look athim and not think of Jim Carrey's Fireman character from In LivingColor. I don't think that is what the director had in mind. Andalthough Juliane Moore is a fine actress she just seems out ofplace in this film. It's not her fault. No one could have replacedJodie Foster. The scene with Hopkins and Moore at theamusement park fails miserably and seems all together pointless. In the controversial final scene I had gotten to the point where I justdidn't care anymore. There is nothing less scary then seeingHopkins dressed like a butler making dinner, even if he is cookinga man's brain. Perhaps it was an outtake from Remains of TheDay.To sum up; very good first half, mediocre second half. And onefinal note, GREAT SOUNDTRACK especially Vide Cor Meum (absolutely beautiful).7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**spoilers**Making a sequel to a film that won Best Picture, Actress, Actor, and Screenplay, is quite a daunting task. Mr. Ridley Scott tries that in "Hannibal". I have to say this again, but the movie does not live up to the book in any way. In the book, Clarice ends up fancying Mr. Lecter, and that is the reason why Jodie Foster didn't sign on to the film, she felt Thomas Harris ( the author ) ventured to far away from Clarice's original character. The film was entertaining, but a tad predictable. The ending was clever, but the book's version was done much better. I can't put my finger on it, but the movie lacked something that the original had. Overall, a good but some what disapointing sequel. Grade: 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>....That is, if you're not squeamish. ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I usually try to avoid expectations when I see a movie, but it was hard with this one, having enjoyed Silence of the Lambs so much, and having been affected by it at a certain point in my life. I had also heard things about Hannibal that, let's just say, were not so good. I was very pleasantly surprised. There is no comparing the two, because they are obviously two different stories, and two very different movies. So much the better. I have not read either novel, so I didn't have that handicap, either. (Which isn't to say that I won't read the books, because I am most interested in reading them, now!)Hannibal is definitely a lot bloodier than Lambs, and that is where I end all comparisons. The violence and blood is used in such a way as to carry the story, not for mere visual or shock value, but to underscore character, and to move the story forward. This is not a kiddy story, or anything you want to put you to sleep. As far as I can tell, Hannibal was not advertised as such.From the start, Clarice Starling's distress is a thread that carries through, and is almost a psychic link between her and Hannibal Lecter - it seems to me that by using the tapes of their previous conversations, the writers are trying to tell us that even Clarice feels a connection to Hannibal that she cannot deny. Sure, that is icky, but Hannibal knows the connection is there, and obviously he's been in love with her from the start. Barney has known it, as he tried to tell Verger. The love story is basically what Hannibal, the movie, is about, and when Hannibal cuts off his own hand rather than harm Clarice, his love is proven.Great date movie, I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit it. I thoroughly enjoyed "Hannibal"! In the grand tradition of Grand Guignole; it rates as a polished, well-crafted splatter movie.Those expecting it to live up to Jonathan Demme's Oscar winning "The Silence of the Lambs", are in for a rude awakening. Do not approach this film as if it's a great successor to that film. It isn't, and rightfully so. But director Ridley Scott shows poise and poetry in his continuing saga of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (once again, played with relish by Sir. Anthony Hopkins), a man we clearly get to understand this time around. Strangely enough, I didn't miss Jodie Foster (even though she was superb in her Oscar winning turn as Clarice Starling), but Julianne Moore did ample good work filling her shoes. They [Hopkins &amp; Moore] generate an oddball chemistry that I found alluring, as well as slightly erotic.Yes, the film goes overboard in its depiction of violence and gore. Those with weak constitutions should steer clear. I don't raise it to the same plateau as it's 1991 predecessor, but on it's own modest terms, it does quite well. Bon appetite!Grade: B</fullReview>

After watching it, there are several problems with this movie.Ridley Scott, while a talented director, was an awful choice to lead this film. Scott (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down) has done his best work, of late, in movies where we need to see everything -- graphically. One of the main reasons BHD worked so well is because it showed a truly realistic depiction of war. We did not need to see the gory details in Hannibal -- the exact opposite. This movie needed a director with Hitchcockian flair. Someone who realized that in a taut psychological drama, the imagination can conceive of far worse images than reality can produce. Mason Verger's face should have never been shown and my imagination could have gone to work. The scene with the boars could have been done with sound effects and shots of the actors in that scene and the final scene could be left to our collective imaginations.The biggest difference between SOTL and Hannibal is that I am given no one to root for or identify with. In SOTL, Starling is woman in a man's world and a country rube to boot. I like her and identify with her underdog status. I never identified with Juliann Moore. She appeared to be arrogant, never has Foster's pluckiness and didn't connect with Hopkins. Go watch SOTL and see Jodie Foster's face when Lecter calls her a country bumpkin in their first seen. Watch her face for her multitude of understated emotions. Moore couldn't do that if she tried.Gary Oldman's Mason Verger sounded like a demented Jimmy Stewart (really! listen to the cadence of his voice) and Ray Liotta mailed in this performance. Hopkins did a fine job considering the circumstances. If this movie had a better-suited director and Jodie Foster in the lead it could have been a more-than worthy successor to SOTL.After reading some of these reviews, I wonder if MGM employees were given a bonus for posting this crap. 3 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal is not as good as it's predecessor, but that doesn't mean it's bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that many were disappointed by the gruesome love story known as Hannibal, but, in retrospect, it really was not that bad. I must admit that the first time around I despised it, also, but when you watch it again and KNOW what to expect, it's not that awful. I suppose the main complaint regarding Ridley Scott's sequel (or trequel, if you consider Michael Mann's little-known Manhunter as the first installment in the series of Thomas Harris movies) was that it was inaccurate in comparison to the novel. But think about it: what movie-based-on-a-book isn't? Jurassic Park was completely different from Michael Crichton's novel, yet it is still acclaimed by critics and viewers alike. I suppose Hannibal is just one of those unpredictable films that takes a little adjusting to enjoy. The second major complaint was regarding the gore: ranging from a scene where a man is hung with an open chest, his organs splashing onto the main square in Florence, to the now-infamous "brain-eating" sequence, Hannibal is certainly hard to watch. Everyone who views the movie should not be able to keep his eyes open, but that was Scott's intention: to disgust us so much that for the first time we realize how horrible Hannibal Lecter really is. In Silence, director Jonathan Demme concentrates more on Clarice and her cat-and-mouse chase with Buffalo Bill; in Hannibal, Ridley Scott focuses entirely on Hannibal and his strange obsession with the FBI agent. This gives us a chance to discover that Lecter is a disgusting and perverse cannibal hiding behind a polite English accent. Sure, it's violent and horrifying; but at the same time, there is a strange sort of artistic aspect to it. Florence, as one would presume, is breathtaking and beautiful. The cinematography is astounding and the music is subtle and effective. To show just how much work Hans Zimmer did on the score, he actually wrote music to put to Dante's Inferno, adding yet another haunting aspect to the already disturbing use of The Divine Comedy in the film. Sorry, Howard Shore, but I think Zimmer has surpassed your talent! And, last of all, I feel obligated to mention the bizarre love story between Hannibal and Clarice: although the ending is completely different from the novel, I find it almost better, since it expresses the extent of Lecter's obsession for Starling. I will not give it away, but I WILL say this: Hannibal is truly disgusting, but ? like the madman himself ? it carries a polite English accent behind it.Overall rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rushed, wrong director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read that Thomas Harris showed up at his publisher and simply pushed it across the desk with a "here it is", I knew that this story was in trouble, even before I read the book (which is before I watched the movie). Thomas Harris is a writer who goes to great lengths to do background research for the books he writes, and as a result he only does so once every 6-8 years (compare that to well-known crime writers who kick out a volume every year). When rushed, like he was because of the raving success of Silence Of The Lambs, the results are predictably unfinished. The movie is based on the book, but doesn't have the time to go to the same lengths in building a back story, and as a result for anyone who has read it, it feels rushed. And of course, the ending is very different and feels like a copout. What didn't help was getting a cold fish of a directory like Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) to do this movie which is basically set in beautiful Italy. What I would like to have more of, is the back story to Hannibal Lecter, his aristocratic background and his youth in the Axis occupied Baltic. Now there would be a fascinating tale, a love story between Hannibal and Clarice. Instead, the movie is simply rushing through the main events of the book, without using the most interesting ones. Mason Verger's sister, easily the most interesting gargoyle of a character after Mason himself, has been completely written out of the movie, as has as was Ardelia Mapp. Having said all that, this is still a very significant movie. It's a must see for fans of Manhunter and Silence Of the Lambs, Harris' other two movies/books, and it's still riveting to watch Hannibal at work. But without working in the crucifiction scene from the book and Hannibal's counsel to Verger's sister, the movie lost a lot. But those are criticisms of what the movie could have been. Still, if you're renting, you could do worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why oh why did they make this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I (like almost everyone else) loved The Silence of the Lambs, I thought it was a masterpiece of filmmaking in every respect. The stupid sequel Hannibal was in many ways an over blown exaggerated gore fest that betrays the psychological drama of Silence and becomes an extremely high budget slasher flick. The movie starts out years after Silence where we find the heroine Clarice Starling in trouble as a somewhat seasoned FBI agent. Clarice has just returned from a botched drug bust and is now in hot water with the bureau. After seeing this movie a few times I have figured out what the biggest (of many) problem it has, Julianne Moore. That is it, this film was doomed the day Jodie Foster turned down the reported 20 million dollar fee to reprise her role. Moore just cant pull off the character that Foster won an Oscar for. Maybe it wasn't entirely her fault, the character is just not as likeable as Clarice used to be. I will show you what I mean by that. In the Silence of the Lambs Clarice is this vulnerable student sent into a situation way over her head and still manages to succeed. She is someone we like and want to cheer for because a normal man or woman can identify with her. In Hannibal Clarice is the opposite, she is arrogant and annoying and has abandoned the innocence she had. Moore is a very good actress but she does not have the "chops" required for such complex characters. The new Starling gets on your nerves because she and Hannibal are the bad guys, the villains the ones that everyone hates, that is the worst part of the movie. Moore is the low light of a movie that does have very good performances. Anthony Hopkins is way way way ultra over-the-top as Hannibal Lecter. He is excellent at being less like Lecter and more like Jason Voohries or Freddie Kruger which I guess is what they filmmakers were going for. But seriously Giancarlo Giannini is outstanding as a greedy detective and Frankie Faison is back as Barney the old prison guard, also very good. Ray Liotta and an unrecognizable Gary Oldman are good as well. Hannibal does have awesome cinematography of Florence and captures the beauty of Italy well. That is all Ridley Scott can do with a horrible screenplay from David Mamet and a sad performance by Julianne Moore. In the end all that is left is an evil old man prancing around the world slicing and dicing anyone he can. What a bloody mess. 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film Hannibal, according to IMDb, marks Ridley Scott's fifteenth directorial film, and also the third and final of Thomas Harris' "Hannibal Lector" trilogy. If you're one or more of the following you should not pass on this film: 1) A fan of any Thomas Harris novel (i.e.: Black Sunday, Red Dragon, The Silence of the Lambs, and/or Hannibal). 2) A fan of any Ridley Scott film (particularly Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise, Gladiator, and/or Black Hawk Down). And/or 3) A fan of a movie that has style, creativity, art, drama, is well acted/directed/filmed, and revolves around a plot you can actually get into rather than pretending like in the film "Blair Witch Project." Hannibal receives 10/10 on all possible standards. Aside from a minor scene of continuity (When Clarice Starling opens the letter Hannibal sends her it his bound together by candle wax, but when we see a flashback of Hannibal writing it, he clearly licks it to seal it... you'll see).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Washington, DC (US) &amp; Florence, Italy, c1995. (According to the Thomas Harris novel) it is seven years after Hannibal's escape from his temporary Memphis holding cell. On record he has killed 15 people. The Film: (A definite improvement over the Thomas Harris novel, on which it is based) Hannibal goes into hiding in Florence, Italy. He is currently on the Bureau's top ten wanted criminals list.Things aren't going so well for Clarice Starling. Until now she has been riding on the coattails of having heroically-and single-handedly-killed Jame Gumb (Serial-killer `Buffalo Bill' from the previous film "Silence of the Lambs."). Her altruistic reputation is tarnished after a botched drug raid.Subscribing to various newspapers and tabloids, Hannibal soon finds out about Starling's predicament and resumes communication with his favorite female correspondent. It seems the young secret agent still has some things to learn about her humble origins and the ruthlessness of bureaucratic ulterior motives.Meantime Hannibal's sole surviving victim, multimillionaire Mason C. Verger, has been plotting his revenge against Hannibal Lector. Mason is a mess. Grotesque face (bad skin grafts do nothing to improve his countenance--Gag!), and an equally monstrous personal psychology have not helped his situation. Hannibal, Clarice and Mason are brought together thanks to the greedy diligence of the Florentine detective, Rinaldo Pazzi, who figures out that Hannibal is living under the name of Dr. Fell, an art historian and connoisseur. So much for the set-up of this film's plot. "Hannibal" is not for the squeamish or faint-hearted. Fair Warning: Don't eat anything heavy before seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comic book sequel to the chilling "Silence of the Lambs", shows us a revamped Dr. Lecter. Sadly, something is missing. Is it tights or an emblazoned "H"? No, it's the original persona. Whereas the arch fiend was repugnantly fascinating, the new version has Anthony Hopkins portraying a pseudo super hero, outwitting and meting out terrible justice to guys we don't like. Just so we know this dire sequel is a "classy" movie, it's filled with fanciful Renaissance quotes and European locations. (Golly-whiz!) The brilliant Jodie Foster is replaced by an icy, unappealing character, almost as annoying as the lead villains. Despite her being a complete turn off, "Papa" Hannibal protects her lovingly and even undergoes a severe physical sacrifice for daring to kiss her! Ah, true love! Incidentally, the talented Ray Liotta of "Goodfellas" fame, is pitifully reduced to a sidesplitting scene which is supposed to be chilling. What a waste of talent and money! .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal is superior to The Silence of the Lambs in many departments. As is to be expected, Hannibal focuses on the most interesting character from the Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal Lecter. We aren't side-tracked on some other serial killer, this is Hannibal's show. The Silence of the Lambs was terrific at creating psychological terror. Hannibal is much more interesting, because instead of a thriller the film is a grotesque love story. The audience gets to be in Hannibal's head a little bit and see all the sick little things that make Hannibal the cannibal.The film is visually striking thanks to director Ridley Scott. Take note of Gary Oldman as the demonic Mason. Ray Liotta, as usual, is in top form. I enjoyed this movie immensely. It's one of the classier horror pictures around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a lot to like about this movie. The sound track and the Florence settings are absolutely fabulous. Anthony Hopkins is still wonderfully creepy extreme. Julianne Moore is good enough to make us (almost) forget about Jodie Foster. The cinematography is exceptional. The special effects are not overdone, and extremely well done where needed. They provide the punch for a few unforgettable scenes. The problem: the story. It just doesn't go anywhere. There is no build up of mystery, no growing suspense. The DVD deleted scenes suggest Ridley was aware of these problems, and just couldn't resolve them. Other glaring problems exist. Hannibal is caught way too easily. Clarice is uninteresting in the extreme in the first half of the movie. The ending with Hannibal and Clarice didn't work for me (I just don't believe Hannibal would be so easily trapped, and didn't really believe the solution he took to escape). All in all, a beautifully made, wasted movie.</fullReview>

But the whole murder mystery really seemed too contrived and uninteresting.

If you haven't seen the first movie, I'm sure it's easy to get lost. But once the real hunt gets underway, the film picks up to a frantic pace. Without giving too much away, I must say that I was honestly a bit surprised by the ending - It really makes Dr. Hannibal Lector a mesmerizing and imposing figure.

		<shortDescription>It looks classy, but it's just empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I sit down to watch a movie I takes away all kind of expectation. Everything. I make my head blank. Sometimes that's not so good, since I miss if the leading character would suddenly get killed to bring chock to the movie. Since I then go "Well, I'm prepared for anything, I don't really have any expectations on this movie". This, of course, also goes with sequels that "has to live up to the old films". First of all, that is a bad thing to say. A sequel, in my opinion, does best when it stays, maybe not far away, but at least on a bit of a distance, so that it don't repeat itself. So, seeing it out of that perspective, "Hannibal" is a fine sequel. It doesn't repeat itself, which would be having Clarice Starling searching another killer with Lecter as a guide. Instead the movie rather brilliantly focuses on Hannibal Lecter, giving it a touch of his class (not the original movie's "dirtyness") and way of life - giving an amount of distance to the fist film. However it doesn't ignore it, Barney the nurse (or whatever he is) and the tapes with the conversations keeps us in mind that this is a sequel. That is how a really good sequel is made. So it's a great sequel. But it's a not-so-great movie.I think Ridley Scott is misplaced. Or, honestly, I wouldn't have thought so, but since I've seen the movie now I say this. When I first heard of this film, I figured Scott to be a great director to make this sequel. But I guess he didn't like doing the movie, because its really empty. The acting is the best thing about the movie. Moore is OK as Starling, since this movie is so different from the original you never really miss Foster, Hopkins is great as usual - but Lecter has gone sick! His freedom must have given him a touch of the classic lack-of-ideas-psychopath-syndrome. The rather imaginative Dr.Lecter has started to, dull enough, killing people instead of eating them (he never takes a bite in this movie) and he has started to give jokes as never before. His humor is replaced by very Hollywood-ish jokes, to be honest; this ain't the same Lecter.I was almost fooled by "Hannibal", because it looks really classy and non-hollywood-ish but I started thinking. I sat down and saw the movie again, and found my suspicions were true. It looks classy, it does, and it also looks like it has a great mix of gore and intellect, but it's just empty. When it's not a repellent fascination of hypergore, it's long and boring, and the same goes for the dialogues. I'd really like to think "Hannibal" as a great film, but it is still just an empty movie, disguised in a classy shell and some good performances. 5/10</fullReview>

There are a few decent sequences- a suspenseful tail, a shootout- but they're basically self-contained, not really having much bearing on the film. Worst of all, most of the scares and "gags" are telegraphed. Basically, this is a few bloody murders (not even enough to satisfy on even the basest "show me some violence" level) and some blah Euro scenery, smothered in an undeserved air of self-importance, and stretched out for 30-40 minutes longer than the simple plot really deserves. This grotesque studio waste would barely be more offensive if they literally burned the money instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Journey with us back into the dankest recesses of the human psyche in Ridley Scott's `Hannibal,' the long awaited sequel to `The Silence of the Lambs,' one of the darkest films ever to be awarded a Best Picture nod by the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences. In pop culture terms, Hannibal Lector has, of course, become the modern incarnation of implacable evil. Not only do his cannibalistic acts represent the ultimate in human moral debasement and degradation, but his seeming indestructibility makes him all that much more horrifying. His escape at the end of the first film served as a perfect setup for this sequel, as we find Lector living a life of seeming `normalcy' in Florence, Italy, just waiting for the proper moment to come out of `retirement.' That moment arrives when Clarice Starling, the FBI agent who helped to save Hannibal's last victim, is suddenly in the news again after an abortive and disastrous attempt to arrest a major criminal ends in the death of a number of her fellow officers. Lector begins communicating with Clarice again, vowing to restart the game of intellectual cat-and-mouse he so enjoyed in the previous film.For most of its running time, `Hannibal' is a pretty enticing thriller. Anthony Hopkins repeats the brilliant work he did in `Lambs,' making this most evil of movie villains both chillingly unreachable and bizarrely compelling. With his clipped diction and often-incisive glimpses into the dark truths of the human psyche, he keeps the audience as emotionally off-balance as he does Clarice herself. Indeed, we understand why she is both repelled and strangely attracted to this man. Julianne Moore, who replaces Jody Foster in the role she originated ten years ago, brings an impressive reticence and hesitancy to this woman caught between her moral dictates and her desire to know more about the evil she is confronting. In fact, apart from this explanation, many of her actions later in the film would be inexplicable unless we were to consider her utterly incompetent at her job. My suspicion is that the filmmakers have something deeper in mind. In addition, writers David Mamet and Steven Zaillan have created an interesting subplot involving Giancarlo Giannini as an Italian detective who uncovers Hannibal's identity and thinks he can outsmart the devilish mastermind, capture him, turn him over to the authorities and make a fortune by collecting the reward money. Giannini perfectly captures the subtle nuances that define this extraordinarily complex character, a man made up of many different, even conflicting moods and motives.So far, so good. But then - inevitably perhaps with material of this nature - the filmmakers cannot resist going overboard into downright incredibility and gruesomeness as the film approaches its denouement. Even those familiar beforehand with the tenor of this story may well be appalled by some of the turns the film takes in its latter stages. In the past, one used to encounter scenes like these only in low budget exploitation films like `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' Now they are being fed ? pardon the pun ? to mass audiences in the guise of slickly marketed `entertainment.' Poor Ray Liotta ? I will never be able to look at him from here on out without seeing him in the condition he ultimately ends up in at the close of this film. It is an image too indelible to ever be completely forgotten and goes well beyond the pale even for a film on this nasty a subject area. Moreover, whereas the first film ended on a note of clever, albeit macabre black humor, `Hannibal' closes with a scene that is simply sickening in its unbridled grotesquerie. Of course, complaining about the level of gruesomeness in a film about a serial cannibal may smack one as a bit of a Pollyanish stance for a knowledgeable viewer to take. Still, the first two-thirds of the film, in which the writers and director exercise an admirable amount of restraint, prove that this material can be even more effective when it is dealt with through indirection than when it is all laid out for us in such grisly, graphic detail. There is much to recommend `Hannibal,' but unless you have a cast iron stomach and a very short memory span, you may well want to skip out before the final curtain is rung down on the scene. That is if you ever want to eat again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Cannibal's Symphony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>9 years after his dramatic escape, Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) is free in Florence with a bounty on his head, placed by surviving victim Mason Verger. Clarice Starling (Moore) enters the fray to help capture Lecter.Almost everyone knows the story of how, the minute Silence of the Lambs became a smash-hit and quintuple Oscar-winner, a fat check landed on source author Richard Harris' desk, optioning a follow-up, and paying an unprecedented million-dollar-per-year fee until he produced said book. Well, after 9 years, the master of lean, tightly plotted thrillers turned in a bloated, 500+ page dark tragedy, full of answers to questions none of us had asked, and afflicted with one of the worst and most non-sensical endings in recent times. Though the long-awaited book flew off the shelves, everyone wondered how this would possibly translate to the big screen, especially given mixed word of mouth and early refusal from 3 of Lambs' Oscar-winners to be involved at all.Superproducer DIno De Laurentis, having been outfoxed on a deal for Lambs, paid top dollar for future rights to Harris' books and characters, and would not be discouraged. With Demme, Foster and screenwriter Ted Tally out of the loop, he brought in Ridley Scott (fresh off Gladiator), Julianne Moore and the odd but impressive writing combination of Steven Zallian (Schindler's List, Clear and Present Danger) and David Mamet. The later two went to town on the bloated manuscript, particularly its ending.So what did all these advance payments buy? The result is predictably dark, Gothic and often beautiful to behold. It is also frequently silly and many story elements do not work. In short, it is a quintessential modern Ridley Scott film, which, given his status as a hired hand here, might seem surprising, and is perhaps a bit unfair. His guidance on the story development indeed represents an objective and significant improvement over the book, and it is easy to see the potential he saw: the atmosphere is almost perfect, and some of the weirder moments are played with a darkly funny, malicious sense of humor. Of course, it is no Silence of the Lambs...The mystery is gone, partly undone by having so much focus on Hannibal himself. Hopkins seems to also have lost the character somewhat, playing him as a charming devil rather than a machine in a man's body, the passionless monster that bewitched us in Silence. Moore also struggles with Foster's legacy, yet when she is allowed to explore new ground, she makes quite an impression. Likewise, the best parts of the film are those that explore unchartered territory, such as Giancarlo Giannini's doomed Inspector Pazzi or an uncredited turn from Gary Oldman as the grotesque Mason Verger. And, somewhere in the background, Hans Zimmer uses a simple window-dressing opportunity to compose an aria that ranks among the finest work of his career.This is not for everyone, and is bound to disappoint anyone familiar with its predecessor. But it has a few solid merits and its mood does set base rules for the superior television show. So if you have a solid stomach and like your fun dark and violent, check it out. For all my misgivings and gripes I did enjoy this film quite a bit in the end... maybe it just made me hungry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must start off by saying that I love Hannibal Lecter. He's such a juicy villain and will probably be the most remembered in history. The Silence Of The Lambs was a fantastic thriller.But, this film doesn't even try to be as good as The Silence Of The Lambs, and I think that people who expected it to aren't too bright. First we've got Ridley Scott, who is known far more for his action capabilities than his classic film making (except Black Hawk Down, which is very good).The purpose of this film was to satisfy Lecter fans and to bring in a good buck at the box office. It succeeds greatly on both.This is nowhere near the greatness of Lambs, but if you like Lecter, you will love this. It's a B movie at best and it knows it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As this movie has received a lot of press attention, in particular the NBC Today show you would have expected better than this. Even during the press junkets, and trailers, the movie looked extremely polished and very slick, however the slickness may be better suited for a record producer or a drug baron, not so much a serial killer.We should not expect a reproduction of Silence of the Lambs, nevertheless the director treated the actors like they were very expensive props in a very expensive looking movie, with little interaction with the audience.They replace actors all the time to play a certain character (i.e. James Bond), and Julianne Moore had to fulfill very large shoes, yet they could have retained some elements of Clarice, yet she should not try to impersonate Jody Foster. The end of the movie was bizarre, not that you can't expect much from Hannibal Lector, but to a certain extent it was uncalled for.If I had seen this movie at the cinema, I would have felt so ripped off, I would have raided the candy store and burnt down the complex. On the other hand the DVD I had hired was the equivalent of a $US 1.50, and you can't could not complain about that. Rating 5.5 out 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it is a shame. Cinema's greatest villain is back, and he's a bit camp to say the least!Hopkins reprises his role as Hannibal Lecter, and Julianne Moore fills Jodie Foster's Oscar winning shoes. Credit due to Moore, she had a lot of work to do, and she does an admirable job, I like her as an actress, and she does well here.Hopkins? Well, I'm not going to be biased just because I'm Welsh, but I didn't go overboard on him this time round. Sorry. He had such awful lines like "okey-dokey" and "ta-ta" to utter! Would Lecter ever say those words? Me thinks not. It spoilt the menacing Lecter we saw in "Lambs", that menace is missing in this film.Yes he can still kill people creatively, and have historical undertones to his killings, but boy should he retire.I'm not even going to talk about the plot, just go and watch the film.Gary Oldman actually puts in a good underrated performance, and the make-up is spot on.To be fair to this film though, it isn't absolute rubbish, there are some good moments to be had - you just have to wait for them to come to you! The ending is particularly effective, and is handled well.Well, that's about it really, I don't want to trouble you anymore with my half-hearted review.See it, but don't expect big things, 'cause to be honest, this is just your average thriller.5/10Enjoy!</fullReview>

I highly doubt it if anyone cannot stand the blood, if you read the book the movie is a breeze. Anthony Hopkins is the only man who can play the part of the intellectual cannibal. Hopkins does it magnificently as in Silence of the Lambs, Bravo I salute him. Julian Moore was not too bad herself. Although I was looking forward to Jody Foster playing the part of Starling again, Moore played the part wonderfully. It was all around a must see film, I have only viewed this film twice but I plan on buying it. Yes it is that good. I just cannot get enough of Hannibal Lecter!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard how gruesome this film of supposed to be, I hadn't figured it would be very good. The Silence of the Lambs was so great because it was not a graphic film, it only showed the results of the violence rather than the violent acts themselves (for the most part). Hannibal is a much more graphic film than Silence of the Lambs, but under the direction of Ridley Scott, it comes off very nicely. So it's not Silence of the Lambs, but how many films can be compared to that original terror masterpiece? My rating for Hannibal: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen this, I just think I didn't waste my time by watching it. I think it's a pretty entertaining movie. Julianne Moore shines; however it'd have been a lot better if Jodie Foster had played Clarice, since she acted in the first one. I really didn't like the fact that Jodie Foster is not acting in this movie; since she was wonderful to star as Clarice in "the silence of the lambs", she made it so great. Anyway I think Julianne Moore was very well cast to replace Jodie Foster's character. I just couldn't believe Jodie Foster turned down this role; I have no idea why she did it, since she won an academy award for best actress in a leading role in the silence of the lambs in 1992. The movie is not as bad as many people said through the comments. I think they just compare it with the silence of the lambs. `The silence of the lambs' was pretty good too. But `Hannibal' kept me in more suspense, so I just think it wasn't that bad. Many people say it was disgusting, yes, sort of, but this is what a criminal can do to others. I think Anthony Hopkins is one of the best actors in Hollywood. I like most of his movies. Maybe his performance as Hannibal Lecter made me follow the movie without disliking it. It was great to see this sequel and I think the ending was quite good and different. I like when Hannibal is on the plane and gave a kid a piece of his food, which was a piece of brain. I also like as he cuts his hand off to save Clarice. I thought he was going to cut Clarice's hand off, but he didn't. It shows us the true side of a criminal. What a different love story! It also shows us that the worst psycho is capable of falling in love with another person.Overall, I don't think this is an excellent movie; nevertheless it shouldn't be entirely dismissed, since it's not that bad 8/10</fullReview>

Julianne Moore though is not as strong in tne role as Clarice like Jodie Foster but she´s no flop either. Anthony Hopkins is superb as usual but he never does a bad role. His acting is that rare kind of perfection that just some of the greatest actors can perform. He personifies Hannibal Lecter completely. This film however has not got the same dynamic thrill and chilling surprise as Silence of the lambs and the play between Hopkins and Moore is not as strong as the scenes with Foster. Anyway it´s a good sequel and some scenes are just to much for some peoples stomach. I give it a 6 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If "The Silence of the Lambs" was a masterpiece of the suspense, of the insinuation, one of the best plots ever seen in a thriller and some of the best character presentations ever, this "movie" is quite the opposite. Hannibal Lecter is a very simplified character, a sort of polite monster -more like Dracula than like a real psycothic, really-. Mrs. Juliane Moore is not as good as Jodie Foster, that's for sure. If you like gory scenes or you're a "Tales from the crypt" fan, you may enjoy the last "scene", where Hannibal cuts a man's head (leaving him alive), cuts off part of his brain (while the guy's still alive), cooks it and serves it to him as food... and the man eats it! In the entire movie there's not a bit of suspense at all.What I said. Do not watch this movie if you like thrillers. Watch that masterpiece called "The silence of the lambs", and leave Ridley Scott alone, for he hasn't directed a good film in a LONG while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie Title: HANNIBAL (2001)Cast: Sir Anthony Hopkins (Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter), Julianne Moore (Clarice M. Starling), Ray Liotta (Paul Krendler), Giancarlo Giannini (Rinaldo Pazzi), Frankie Faison (Barney Matthews), Francesca Neri (Allegra Pazzi), and Gary Oldman (Mason Verger).My Rating: ***1/2 out of **** (3.5 out of 4) Synopsis: After living under an alias in Florence, Italy, Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter decides to hunt down, and reunite with, his old "friend", agent Clarice Starling, whom has recently gotten into deep trouble with the FBI. My Review: The world's most psychotic gentleman is back in HANNIBAL, the long-awaited sequel to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS! Anyone who has ever seen SILENCE... or HANNIBAL knows that no one else can play the sadistic Hannibal Lecter as well as Sir Hopkins. In fact, no one else can even say 'Hello, Clarice..." with such subtle menace or awkward politeness. Sir Hopkins plays Hannibal as the ultimate villain, and has the Academy Award to prove it. Julianne Moore gives a fabulous and heartfelt performance as Clarice. Unfortunately, she has been subjected to many unfair comparisons to the original Starling, Jodie Foster. In my opinion, it wouldn't be right to compare them because they play the role differently. Although Foster was good in the role, Moore did not want to play the role like Foster, nor did she want to. She has her own interpretation. Ray Liotta, Giancarlo Giannini, and an unrecognizable Gary Oldman offer splendid supporting work, each role being just as big and important as the other. Besides Hopkins, the only returning cast member from the original is Frankie Faison, who does a great job as Barney.I think that the romance between Hannibal and Clarice is very strange, yet touching. They could not be any more different, but they are so perfect for each other. Clarice is very loyal, brave, and smart. Hannibal knows this, which is why he respects and loves her.Director Ridley Scott has done a magnificent job at capturing the beauty of Florence. He also has many other interesting camera tricks up his sleeve.Scott, screenwriter David Mamet, author Thomas Harris, the cast, and the rest of the creative/productive staff have all done a flawless job in creating a masterful, scary, and gorgeous film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you still haven't eaten your brain, you will no doubt learn from this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have been warned from the beginning that this film was not a simple follow-up sequel to "The Silence of the Lamb (SOTL)". This was most apparent when we learned that both Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster backed off from the project. And YET, alas it is very unfortunate that many reviewers and viewers disappoint themselves by comparing the two in an unfair manner.In a sense, SOTL was a derivation from the main plot in that Dr. Lecter has somewhat been set aside, while a new character FBI agent Clarice Starling came to the fore. She attracted attention and awards alight (and rightfully so), but we must bare in mind, the story is about Hannibal, the man-eater. We come back to the gore of human nature in "Hannibal". We, as humans, may seek sophistication, and we may achieve. We achieve intelligence, cultural nourishment, physical excellence, depth of insight. And yet, we can still be that gory man- eater. That is why we can't condemn Dr. Lecter, and at the end let go of him. Alas, we even allow him to kiss us. SOTL didn't achieve this much of powerful portrait of humanity. It was after all, a blockbuster film (and a brilliant one, I must add). "Hannibal" had the last say.Although it is not my custom to comment on acting, I must make a note about Julianne Moore. She was brilliant. She was so focused on being Clarice Starling, the ambitious and capable FBI agent, also matured ten years on since the previous case. I thought there was no one but Jodie Foster who could handle Clarice in "Hannibal". I was dead wrong (good thing I don't usually comment on acting). Julianne Moore did not try to create her own version of Clarice, nor did she try to "compete" against Jodie Foster. If JF had achieved recognition, I would say it is only fair that JM should receive the same. After 15 minutes of viewing the film, I found myself saying, "Who cares who's acting as Clarice, she IS Clarice." I am still puzzled as to why JF declined from the role, though...I would have thought this was just the kind of film JF would love to have jumped on to.When you view this film, you are looking into your true self, only if you are ready to admit. The film may not achieve the glamor of SOTL, how unfortunate. The gruesome scenes attracted too much attention and criticism. But mind you, the scenery in Italy and the music, oh they were beautiful! I shall strongly recommend that you sit back and view this one (although I do not recommend having snacks during the film...).And if you still haven't eaten your brain, you will no doubt learn from this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the biggest letdowns of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Warning - Spoilers* Hannibal has to be one of the most overhyped, and underdone films I have ever seen in my life. Fresh off success with Gladiator, which somehow managed to steal some really undeserved oscars, Ridley Scott has taken on an absolute mission of a project, and predictably blown it. In New Zealand, there was a lot of anger and controversy about the strict R18 rating, which only added interest to the film. The presence sounded good, and previews made the film look incredible, and Jonathan Demme said he wouldn't direct it because it was too morbid!! What a film Hannibal was going to be! Well thats what we were tricked into beleiving. Upon first inspection Hannibal is one of those films that starts slowly, and you expect to speed up. Unfortunately, Hannibal starts slowly, and doesn't get out of first gear, until the end, where it gets to about second, and then slides into reverse. Why did i not like this film so much? 1 - Too much hannibal. In Manhunter and Silence of The Lambs Hannibal is in it for about 20 minutes altogether in BOTH films. His eery presence is undeniably brilliant, and only adds to the brilliant tension. In Hannibal, he is free and just pretty much leading a normal life. His presence lacks charisma, and to be honest he is just in it way too much. 2 - The Mason Verger angle. Well okay its not bad at first, but seriously who wants to capture a man and feed him to wild boars? Thats kinda well stupid! 3 - The film is just plain boring. Too slow, not scary, unimaginative, and way overhyped!! It probably wouldn't have been a bad film if it was just a seperate film from manhunter and silence of the lambs. But the point is, it's not, and if you've seen either of the other two, I can guarantee huge degrees of dissapointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the comments posted so far point out the difficulty to adapt Harris' book and eventually to do better than the previous episode. Perhaps those people discovered Hannibal played by Anthony Hopkins, hence they were eager to read the sequel. As for me I remember I read Silence of the Lambs before the movie. Well, I was not so enthusiast and knowing the story I only watch the movie with a distracted attention.The problem is Hannibal was the strongest character in Silence of the Lambs and above all for everything we had to imagine. Thus Hannibal was scarcely shown and Foster's Clarice had plenty of time to gain a foothold in the story wherever Hannibal was not. Now Hannibal is the very center of the movie so Julianne Moore can't do much better than the bland-and-mild agent Starling. What is more she has no such a foil as Scott Glenn to show she is a big girl.The movie is very good for all the dolce vitta Hannibal enjoys in Firenze. I think this is the most effective part of the movie. Actually I had developed a liking for the Italian actor (Giancarlo Giannini) playing inspector Pazzi. It was well developed but the story had to move on.An important point is the 'shock factor' as some early comments name it. Sure it visually shocks, but it's too much for the balance of the movie. I imagine that showing Mason Verger only for his final scene would have been better (and helped save on make-up). Bottom line: for all the dark and slow scenes in Firenze Hannibal deserves a good rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nowhere near Silence,but the best that could have come from the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I loved The Silence of the Lambs. It's one of my favorite movies of all time, with great performances by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins and good direction by Jonathan Demme. Hannibal however, is nowhere near as great, and I guarantee it will not be winning the 5 Oscars that Silence did. It has none of the cleaver suspense or chilling moments that made the first one so great, and while Julianne Moore is a terrific actress (she would probably have been my second choice for the role as well) and does a half-decent job as F.B.I agent Clarice Starling, she doesn't have the warm and sympathetic touch that Foster brought to the role. As for Hopkins, he has some good moments but for the most part is not scary at all. Granted, the story takes place 10 years after the original and finds Dr. Hannibal "the cannibal" Lector trying to live a normal life in Italy, not to mention that in the book it was said that he had plastic surgery to change his looks. So perhaps he has no real reason to act all evil and cunning, but still, isn't that what made the first one so much fun. The story this time has a former victim of Lectors' (played by Gary Oldman under loads of funny looking makeup) trying to capture him and then feed him to a bunch of giant hogs. It's one of those things that sounds ok on paper but looks kind of dumb on screen. But perhaps that's why I was not too disappointed with Hannibal, because I read the book first. And since I read the book first I knew what to expect and therefore could not be completely bummed out when it didn't measure up to Silence. That being said I think this was probably the best movie that could have come from that novel. I say this because of one big change made to the end. The end of the book was not only completely stupid but betrayed everything that we had been told about the characters (before they had a script this was the main reason Foster turned down the project). The film's ending however is excellent, and will probably go down in history as one of the best 10 minutes of pure evil ever to grace the screen. So, check it out for yourself and afterwards be sure to finish off the evening with some liver along with fava beans and a nice Chianti.</fullReview>

Moments in the film like the opera which had very short screen time I thought were works of art by filmakers and a composer working at the top of their game.

		<fullReview>This movie was not as good as the first one. This one is where he is roaming around free in the states. They didnt even have the same detective as the first one. I give this movie 8/10. But this movie did had more blood in it. The movie ended as hanibal lector was feeding a child on the plane a piece of brain. Then the move ended. That part was pretty weird. I looked on the net and it said there will be a third one. And Edward Norton is gonna be the detective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's start by saying that its predecessor was a smash hit. Brilliant work of art, but the fact that it left it open for a sequel, didn't mean that it had to be as lame as Hannibal! No plot,apart from carrying on from the first, boring, I don't even think Jodie Foster could have saved it. Oh well, what can I say, summing up? I want my money back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just not as good as its predecessor....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Hannibal', quite frankly, is barely good enough to be called and average movie. Of course Anthony Hopkins is enjoyable as the title character, but acting is not the problem with this film. Its been said many many times, but what caused the first movie to excel was the relationship between Clarice and Hannibal. The scenes between Hopkins and Foster in 'Silence of the Lambs' are among the best and most intense I have ever seen, not to mention most interesting and dynamic. Its that dynamic that is missing in this movie. I won't go so far as to blame Ridley Scott or even Foster's replacement, Julianne Moore. In fact I generally like Moore's work. No, the problem with this movie completely lies in the script. The script lacks the depth that the script in the first movie had. 'Silence of the Lambs' was and intensely psychological thriller that kept you on the edge of your seat. 'Hannibal' is a mediocre attempted thriller, barely above your average slasher flick. There are things that are supposed to be gross, that aren't. And there is supposed to be suspense created in a chase to capture 'Hannibal'. That wasn't interesting. Oldman's character could have not been in the film, and it wouldn't have made it any worse, or any better. He was just another oddity for us to look at. A few cheap thrills in the place of substance is what 'Hannibal' really is. Oh, and the infamous scene with Liotta at the end of the film, I have one thing to say. It was either:a)absolutely brilliant black comedy that was supposed to have us laughing in some sort of shock, orb)gore done so horribly bad that it completely embodies the mediocrity of the movie...but I'll leave it up to you to decide. Bottom line is this, Hopkins is still watchable. Moore is a fine enough replacement. The only thing the film is missing is substance, and its missing the dynamic relationship that propelled the first one forward and made it memorable. If you want to watch it, go ahead. You really won't miss much if you don't. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HANNIBAL (2001) Rating: 7/10I must say I was a little disappointed with this movie. First of all the characters are pretty weak, more insight into the characters and their relationships with each other would have been nice. And it's obvious Clarice and Hannibal have some sort of weird connection, it would be nice to know the way they really feel about each other. I was also a little disappointed with the lack of gore. I usually wouldn't care if it was really gory or not but everyone hyped the gore in this movie up so much that I was expecting a lot more. It did have two really gory scenes, and God oh mighty, I cannot discuss this picture without mentioning its final 15 minutes, which are without a doubt, the most memorable moments of any movie that I've seen in recent times. Not memorable in a "good" way though. I won't ruin it here, but needless to say, I was seriously repulsed by the scenario which took place near the end of this picture. Truly disgusted! Definitely not for the weak of stomach. In fact, the MPAA should be lobotomized for not rating this thing as an NC-17 (while fluffy T&amp;A fare like Showgirls get the tag). What the hell are they thinking?!? Nuff said. Okay, I've done enough complaining. Now, what did I like about this fairly nice revisiting of an old and really disturbed friend?Well, I may be alone on this one but I thought Julianne Moore was a better Clarice than Jodie Foster. Maybe that's just because I find Julianne Moore so attractive and appealing. Jodie Foster on the other hand I don't find to be that attractive. I know most people think Jodie Foster did a better job, but if the character of Clarice would have been more well-rounded like in the first one, Julianne Moore would have blew Jodie Foster out of the water. Julianne Moore works wonders for Clarice, even with the character being so weak. Throughout the whole movie I kept thinking "Man, is Julianne Moore sexy." And she looked incredible in that black dress, WOW! She also looked incredible in the green pants, black shirt, and jean jacket combo. To put it short, she looked great in everything. Great job Julianne! The film also looked amazing, especially the night scenes. Ridley Scott did an excellent job on directing. It was beautifully shot. And I'm not one for score music but the "Hannibal" score is really well done, Hans Zimmer did a very nice job.The movie did have a few plot holes though. Like how did Hannibal Lector get around so easily without being caught when he's on America's Top 10 Most Wanted list? That would have to be the biggest plot hole of them all. But oh well, the movies strong points makes up enough for it's flaws.Even though I had complaints about this movie and I was a little disappointed, I still enjoyed it. The whole movie was good and Julianne Moore was incredible, with what material she had. Anthony Hopkins did a good job even though his character was also weak. Gary Oldman was completely disgusting as Mason Verger, it was hard looking at him. And Ray Liotta did a good job playing a jerk. The film looks amazing with a good score and good direction from Ridley Scott.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never read the Thomas Harris books and I think that I should if I want to know the real stories of Lecter and Starling. After the visual grandeur of Gladiator, I was expecting a feast for the eyes in Hannibal and I wasn't disappointed. It is a beautiful film from a cinematographic perspective. The locales are gorgeous and the camera work and use of shadows and framing is excellent. But a feast for the eyes means that you're still hungry.After all the teasing between Hannibal and Starling in SOTL, I was expecting real sexual tension, unexpressed and potent, since he was now on the loose and since he's superhuman, could evade all maneuvers to capture him. But when he is physically near her, the screen doesn't sizzle. It's just *blah*. One tiny kiss at the end and then he runs off, to presumably go into hiding in another exotic locale -- Tahiti, maybe? Live it up as a modern day Gauguin? It was just a very disappointing finale to a story which has been building up excitement for 10 years.The performances were good, although Hopkins has lost his edge as Hannibal. That's not surprising since he set the bar so high for himself in SOTL. Julianne Moore was OK as Starling, although I noticed that her accent tended to have varying degrees of Southern-ness, sometimes disappearing altogether. I thought Gary Oldman was the most lively character in the movie and his make-up was stunning.I gave it a 7 for the visual part and for Oldman, but maybe I'm being too kind. I hope the prequel Red Dragon with Ed Norton lives up to SOTL in overall quality.</fullReview>

Director Ridley Scott did a very good job of bringing Thomas Harris' "Hannibal" to life. The production of "Hannibal" is execellent with Anthony Hopkins(Dr. Hannibal), Julianne Moore(Clarice Starling), Gary Oldman(Mason Verger),and Ray Liotta(Paul Krendler), you couldn't have asked for a better crew.I was very overwhelmed with the special effects, it was just breath-taking. To really say too much more would give away some part of the movie. Overall, I was very pleased with "Hannibal", its cast, and the director. It was very well put together and to ask for anything more would make it impossible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HannibalHow many times have I got to say that style over substance is sacrilege?Before his movie-making career, Ridley Scott directed TV commercials. His work, even then, was very characteristic, for Scott obviously had a keen eye for visuals. But that talent does not necessarily translate into good film making. This leads me to point out a common criticism of Scott's films: great visuals, but no character development. This certainly applies to Hannibal.In all of its 131-minute running time, Hannibal seems unable to reveal anything of real value about Agent Starling and Dr. Lector, despite having a decade both in the film and in reality to put it there. The film is nothing but a pleasing menagerie of slow-motion shots, grand scenes, luscious music and costumes. Unforgivably absent are the mental foreplay and psychological terror of Silence of the Lambs. Instead, we're given filler.Its predecessor, Silence of the Lambs, was essentially a stark, static film as far as the camera was concerned. The main emphasis there was on the characters Agent Starling and Dr. Lector. Hannibal, by contrast, works so diligently to globe trot and dazzle us with pretty pictures (sunsets, mist , slow-motion, staging, hue effects, etc.), that the story and characters seem hardly important.The plotting and motivations of the characters are simplistic and formulaic compared to that earlier film. We basically get a sandwich structure of scenes slapped together that don't really make a coherent film. The first slice is the disgrace of Agent Starling and the reawakening of Lector. The meat is nothing but endless back and forth scenes, lightly reminiscent of that awful The Specialist. And the bottom slice is the inexplicable return of Hannibal to America just to "save" Starling, kill a few people, let an unrecognizable Gary Oldman exact his revenge, only, of course, to end with Lector getting away.I'm tiring of writing about Scott's crappy film. The deal was simply slow, predictable, favoring the LCD, and not really worth the effort.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All expectations we had about Silence of The Lambs´ sequel lead to a dead-end when this trashy, overproduced film reached the international circuit and was exhibited in most of the world´s theaters. One of the most expected sequels since Phantom Menace or Matrix 2, part of the disappointment comes from the natural loss of novelty: no sequel can beat all expectations we may have. But this one is really awful, to begin with all the atrocities we are obliged to see: people devoured by pigs, hanged people, ripped people, too many close-ups of Gary Oldman´s horrible mask, and even some guy who´s got his brain cooked, and is even offered a little piece, that he eats, joyfully, and tastefully... Sincerely, Mr. Ridley Scott, our stomach deserves something better: more plot, and less visual cruelty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'Silence' Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Silence of the Lambs was one of the best films ever created, and high expectations were held when word of a planned sequel was put into action- fortunately, 'Hannibal' is a very worthy successor.Sir Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter, the once-psychiatrist who had a taste for his patients, who returns to the big screen. After ten years of hibernation in Florence, Hannibal thinks it's time to re-emerge...That's when FBI Agent Claire Starling (played by Julianne Moore, who replaces Jodie Foster from the original) comes into the picture - she is both frightened and intrigued by Hannibal's return to society, and tries to come into contact with him.The first half an hour or so is great, but is sadly followed by about an hour of story that can get a little boring. Thankfully, after a dull pause, the movie picks up pace and continues into a shock ending until the finish of the film.Acting is brilliant again, special effects are great, but lacks in 'The Silence of the Lambs' suspense which made the first film so damn good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't give a Godda*m about this movie, and you shouldn't either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's garbage, just pure utter garbage. Not 'cuz of the gore, mind you, but for several reasons, which because this isn't a damn school paper, I will state them in list form:1. Utterly disjointed. This friggin movie is all over the place, with no handy dandy subtitles telling you where it is now, except in one measly incident when they cut to Sardinia.2. Clarice is horribly underused. Come on, this isn't Jodie Foster's Clarice, or even the one from the book Hannibal. That Clarice was full of depth and imbued with interesting little nuances here and there. This Clarice is white paint on a backyard fence. No fault of Juliane's though. She was given nothing to work with.3. Hannibal Lecter's character has been transformed into a Freddy Kruger with class. Before he was real. He was a genius. He was dangerous. And he was endlessly fascinating. Here he's diminished; bogged down by too many lame ass "wise"cracks that simply don't fit the character. Anthony, I know how much you hate the profession that has made you so rich, but really this is too much!4.They changed the ending. Now the characters created by Harris do not follow their correct paths as laid down by their Creator. So what you get is not the true Hannibal, and Clarice, but rather Bodysnatcher types that only look, and sound like them, but they're not. *spoiler for book*As many of you already know, in the book, Clarice was finally freed of her father fixation, and dined on the brains of her nemisis. Her character arc was complete. Here, there is no character in the first place. Stephen Zailian botched the job. They should have hired some one with more respect toward the source material. That would have been proper.There are probably more reasons you should avoid this dreadful, needless sequel made quickly, if not cheaply, to cash in on Hannibal's name brand value, and nothing else. WIthout quality, or craft, or passion. It's a nothing little scrap of celluloid that will forever toil in the shadow of it's superior predessecor for it's utter lack of thematic ambition, or courage.Any one can show guts, but it TAKES guts to take beloved, well known characters like Hannibal, and Clarice, and show another side of them with which audiences are unfamiliar with, and may not be comfterable with. This movie is spineless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CU Film Critic takes on "Hannibal."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three different kinds of sequels. First, we've got the goofy `We just made a fairly fresh, hip film that did well at the box office- Let's throw together another vaguely similar film and release it in roughly a year.' Examples of this include `Blair Witch 2,' `Home Alone 2,' and let's not forget `Skateboard Kid 2.' Second comes the `Wow. We made something incredible to last through the ages. Let's make sure that when we put a second one together, we take it as seriously as the first.' This is where we get the really good sequels, like `The Godfather 2,' `The Empire Strikes Back,' and the New Testament.The third kind is a little trickier. It's more like `We made a something that ended up becoming a classic. Let's be so careful in making a new one that we wait ten or more years and end up completely straying from the mood and style of the original.' Fitting into this category, right beside `Star Wars: Episode One,' we find `Hannibal.'I won't try to compare the film `Hannibal' to the novel written by Thomas Harris, because anyone who hasn't read the book by now will most likely feel much less inclined to do so now that it's in convenient movie form. What I will do, however, is compare it to its immediate predecessor, the Academy Award winning `Silence of the Lambs.'Whereas `Silence of the Lambs' was a chilling police procedural and psychological thriller, `Hannibal' is a carnival house of horrors full of quips and one-liners. The terror we got from `Silence' was from its understated, disturbing cerebral nature. If we derive any terror from `Hannibal,' it's due to Ridley Scott's overbearing shock value. Whereas the old Hannibal Lecter was just slightly `off' enough to make your skin crawl, the new Hannibal Lecter has become a caricature. The Joker, maybe. That said, the movie was quite entertaining. `Hannibal' is a lot more fun than `Silence' ever tried to be. Lecter's offhand comments, at times, had me laughing aloud. The film looked spectacular. The Florentine sets are some of the best I've seen. Between this and `Gladiator,' Ridley Scott's got the Italian market cornered. Well done. I loved the opera scene. What was that opera?The acting? You know, I don't think Anthony Hopkins has ever done a poor job in a film. In fact, without getting bored, I could watch Anthony Hopkins do nothing but knit a sweater for three hours. While he wasn't quite the same Hannibal Lecter we met in `Silence,' the acting was as good as anything I've seen. I choose to blame the script for the disloyalty to character. Gary Oldman is uncredited as Mason Verger, a vengeful victim of Lecter, seeking some good-old-fashioned Mosaic justice. Gary Oldman is quite possibly the finest actor of the last twenty years. No complaints here. Let's get down to the real question at hand. How is Julianne Moore? Somewhere in the middle of the film, Julianne Moore's character is given a pair of brand new shoes. I believe these could have been Jodie Foster's shoes, and if so, I enjoyed seeing Julianne Moore do a impressive job of filling them. In fact, I don't think Jodie Foster could have pulled it off. As I said before, this is a completely different sort of movie- Foster would have been out of place. Moore seizes the role and makes it her own- she doesn't try to play Jodie Foster.The rest of the cast? Absolutely fantastic. So, I'm left with a puzzle. How do I feel about this movie? We've traded a mentally disturbing film for a graphically violent one; a scary film for a shocking but fun one. Two completely different films, to say the least. `Hannibal' could easily stand alone as a popcorn thriller. I'm almost sorry that is has to sit in the shadow of `Silence of the Lambs.' `Hannibal deserves a `B-`. You know, I could really go for some fava beans about now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course a film like this must fight the preconceived notions of all those people that saw Silence of the Lambs, and read Hannibal, and heard why Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster didn't want to be involved with this project. Hannibal is a far different film from its forerunner. It does not have the shock appeal of that film nor the tight tension. It does not have the same degree of blood and carnage either. It's purpose is not solely to frighten, but it almost wants us to accept it as art for art's sake. It is just as good as Silence in its own way, and although it would be very hard for me to say it's a better film, I can say it is of equal merit, albeit it for different reasons. Hannibal tells the story of Dr. Hannibal Lector being traced to Florence, Italy by a corrupt Italian policeman. Agent Starling is also back on the Lector case ten years later as a kind of punishment for a "mistake." She is aided by the only living victim of Lector's sadism. From here, we see Lector survive as only he knows how. The story gets in deep with some chases and revenge motifs, but what I found most interesting about the film and the story was that no one innocent dies...I mean everyone in the film that dies was not a nice person. They were either corrupt officials or gangsters or sex offenders or thieves. Hannibal is almost like a vigilante in the film. I found myself rooting for this maniacal serial killer. And that is the power behind the film, as well as Anthony Hopkins's wonderful portrayal, and the artistic direction of Ridley Scott. Melodic opera music pervades the film as we see beautiful shots of Florentine streets and the skyline. The film almost has a dream-like feel to it. Hopkins is very good, not as on edge as in Silence, but more relaxed and in better humour. He utters lines like "Okey dokey" routinely before killing people. The rest of the cast is very good too. Julianne Moore is as good as Foster, but her role is more one-dimensional in this film. I liked her performance if for no other reason than the fact that I didn't have to listen to that artificial Southern affectation Foster did SO poorly in Silence. For me, Foster was not even missed. Demme, on the other hand, was missed for his ability to create scenes of genuine horror and suspense, but Scott does something uniquely different that works. Gary Oldman, virtually unrecognizable in his role, and Ray Liotta are very effective too. The fella playing the Italian cop was particularly good. The film has some gruesome scenes, in particular, a disembowling/hanging and a culinary labotemy. Artistic horror fare!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie is never easy. Not merely because of the gratuitous gore which is pasted liberally everywhere, but because none of the characters are either a) interesting or b) worth caring about. Worst of the bunch is Sir Anthony, who takes his fantastic 30 minutes from Silence of the Lambs and stretches it into a boring treatise on over-acting. It is now apparent why his screen time was so limited in the original: his character can't hold up to lengthy exposure. He needs to be the outside focal point of the story but instead he is right in the middle of it. Too much in the middle.I have heard much praise for Julianne Moore's version of Clarice, but her character is so wooden, so isolated from anything resembling a normal life that when she suffers a setback and is shown doing housecleaning I had to suppress the urge to laugh. Truly, this is her most emotional moment in the film.The story revolves around the two of them, unless you include the ridiculous performance of Gary Oldman as Mason Verger. Wheelchair bound, disfigured, he is not given much to work with, and it shows. The best performance comes from Giancarlo Giannini as an Italian detective looking to cash in on finding Dr. Lecter.The dark humor and irony, so present in the first story, are *much* darker here, assuming you find anything about this tale humorous. The script and direction try to make points with sledgehammer subtlety. It's a mess. I've already written more than it deserved.Rating 4/10. Rent it with in-laws you don't like. Then leave.</fullReview>

I have seen Silence of the Lambs first and read the book afterwards, and hardly saw any difference, so with my hopes up I hired the movie Hannibal. I just loved the book. I totally agree with the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice, and was really disappointed with the end of the movie. Although I think the movie's excellent, I do not agree with the things that happens and the totally off-book script. I do not understand how Thomas Harris could have agreed with it.My ten stars goes to Anthony Hopkins, ho once again shows how a skilful actor he is and always will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THRILLER KILLER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like when people start comparing the original and sequels. Every film has it's own charm no matter if is original or second part of an original story. Of course, if the second part is a bad movie then it is normal, but comparassments between two films and those immature thinking is simply out of the question cause that is an underestimation of director's work. As much as I liked the first part, I liked second one even better. I only like it better cause of technical things like photography, special effects and sound. Anthony Hopkins did STUNNING work again. He is just too clever as an actor. I wasn't that satisfied with Julianne Moore in the beginning but after half an hour she got relaxed and completely turned into cannibal hunter...Giancarlo Gannini was very good too. This is really thriller killer. BUT ENDING..........9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish ambiance with over the top gore..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having heard so many negative comments about the gore in this movie, I was surprised at the stylish ambiance, elegant settings, witty dialog and beautiful sound track - they contrasted well with the horror of the story. There's an interesting subplot of the avaricious Italian policeman trying to collect the reward money so he can keep his beautiful young wife happy (she'd like better seats at the opera next time, thank you very much!) The gore really is pretty much over the top but if you watch TV shows that show actual hospital operations, you can probably handle it. The ending was a surprise in many ways and reveals Lector's apparent feelings toward Clarice Starling, a true FBI "Untouchable." As for the final scene, don't parents tell kids not to talk to strangers (and strange people) anymore? Fast paced and outrageous, let it stand on its own without comparison to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My two cents.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does Hannibal measure up to Silence of the Lambs?No, of course it doesn't.But was it a bad movie?No, it wasn't. At least I didn't think so. In fact, I thought very highly of it. After all, the movie is very close to the book, minus some minor things -- the absence of Margot, Mason's butch sister, being one of them. The ending was drastically changed, which is disappointing, but I suppose there was no way of working it onto the screen. But it still is not a bad movie, and anybody who says it is simply because it is so different from its predecessor needs to shut their traps.Thomas Harris (author of the book) -wanted- Hannibal to be different. ...Julianne Moore, despite popular belief, did not stink up the role of Clarice Starling. I am rather proud of how well she portrayed the character -- Clarice, after all, is not the easiest character to play -- and although she does not even begin to compare to Jodie Foster, I wish some of you would give her a little credit.Also, I don't believe the movie was as gory as people have been saying it is. A splash of blood here and there, but unlike a few movies I've seen, none of the so-called "gore scenes" in this movie made my stomach lurch.Anyway, it is a movie worth seeing, in my opinion. Definitely check it out if you happen to be a Lecter fan. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is unfortunate that for whatever reason, Jodie Foster did not reprise her role as Clarice. Juliann Moore did not do half the job Foster did in the 1st film. Hopkins as Hannibal was still very eerie, but lacked that psychotic, mysterious side of himself, and was way to obvious.Okay, while the scenes shot in Florence were breath-taking, I felt the movie spent too much time building story there. I didn't complain too much...It was beautiful. The photography of the whole movie was genius, and looked excellent. At 2 hours 11 mins...This movie played on way too long. I would have fallen asleep more than once if they would have kept the 35 mins of deleted scenes intact. Yes, I did fall asleep...The beginning of the movie took so long to get going, I was losing interest. The intensity of the first was just not in the one. Moore played a bland, dull Clarice, and couldn't keep up the accent through the whole film. Clarice was supposed to be a little frumpy, unkempt, and not sexy at all...Well, Moore's Clarice was none of these things....Sexy, mysterious and well, dull. The Makeup on Gary Oldman (Verger) was award-winning...How disturbing, macabre and scary. This plot heavy movie crammed so much in, I feel it takes away from the beauty of the first film. So much is thrown at us, we don't have time to digest it all. The ending, while disturbing, was not the gross-out that I had heard it was. Yes, it was digusting, but nothing I haven't seen before in movies. As we all know, this does open up for another sequel, but I don't see that happening. The series would become just another Hollywood product, probably getting yet another actress to play Clarice....JODIE, where are you?Overall, it was not a bad film, but lacked alot of the suspense the first one had. Silly and Over the top at times, it is still shoot beautifully. I am going to read the book, only because I do not think this movie did it justice.7 out of 10</fullReview>

Hannibal took the great stillness of silence and threw it out, the outstanding psychotic minds games between Hannibal and Starling are gone,left in it's place is a really dumb story of Lecter working in a museum in Florence, starling needs to be the main story with Lecter being left in the shadows where he works best, Gary Oldman was wasted, you never ever have a evil second creep in a movie with Lecter, he is the evil one and trying to make people sympathize with him is wrong. 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who ever gave this film bad reviews could not sat down and watched it. I was very , very impressed with nearly every aspect of Hannibal. Firstly, it knocks spots of Silence of the Lambs. it is more scary and more thought provoking . secondly , it is not shot as if it is pandering to the mass audience. It is beautifully filmed and the sound track is perfect to suit the films mood. Thirdly the film is better than the book and how often can you say that about a movie?The book had a strange ending which was almost impossible to put into this film and i'm pleased to say the didnt. If i Had to critisise it for anything it is that i would have prefered The original clarise (Jodie Foster) she seemed more suited to the role. Hopkins is fantastic and even more scarier than before and what about that final meal scene with Ray Liota??!! Chilling!!! Blood curdling brilliance. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is pretty silly. I enjoyed Silence of the Lambs, a film that got most of it's thriller effect out of suggestive scenes. Not very gory (except from some scenes, which, in my belief were only functional, just to illustrate the cruelty of Dr. Lecter) but positively tense. I expected this one would be a rip-off, but I was wrong, it's even worse. OK, maybe you can't compare it with Silence of The Lambs and you should consider it as a whole different film, but that wouldn't change the facts: Hannibal has become nothing more than a splatter movie, wanting to be taken seriously, and splatter movies never have to be taken seriously... The 'shock' scenes are cheap, some of the acting is over the top. Hopkins should have listened to Foster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal isn't quite the caliber of sequel one would expect from a movie like Silence of the Lambs. Of course, it would take almost miraculous efforts to top its predecessor. Hannibal is beautifully done, with exquisite camera angles, shots, and characters. Moore's performance as Clarice is yet again not as good as Foster's, but gets progressively better throughout the movie. To discuss the end of the movie, I was angry with the outcome that was chosen above the one in Thomas Harris' novel. Why couldn't Ridley Scott have let the best part of the novel shine through at the end? The very end of the movie is uncharacteristic and atrocious, making Hannibal into a malicious monster instead of the introspective and classy one many of us hold dear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different kind of movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** First of all: This movie is said to be a sequel to "Silence of the Lambs". I never saw that movie and haven't read the books either.Hannibal is a very different kind of movie. The storyline is ok, the acting (especially Hopkins) is very good and the filming is very very well done. In large parts this movie is very beautiful, both filming and the music which is a big contrast to the last 10 minutes. The violence before the end of the movie does not qualify for a horror movie, which would make Hannibal a thriller, but saying Hannibal is a thriller wouldn't be fare to many thriller enthusiasts who rather wouldn't want to even hear about the ending.The ending truly chocked me although I had heard vague hints about it, and it is the ending that I want to focus on in this review. If you choose not to read ahead because of the spoilers, be aware that last part of the movie is not to be underrated of not being one of the most horrible scenes in movie history and I would advise strongly against young people (-18 or so) and everyone who are weak to blood and bizzare violence.WARNING! - Spoilers - Spoilers - SpoilersEating brains is of course a discusting subject, but feeding a human person with his own brain while still alive and too drugged to understand what he is eating is such a horrible thing that it makes you want to puked. Combined with the graphical ultra realism of the scene, I though I was going to faint for real. That hasn't happened for many years, although I watch A LOT of movies. It is not just the bizzarity of the situation and the visual grue that made me feel sick, but the psychology. Exposing the core of the human being and then partially ripping it away, decimating the very soul and the combined body functions of the person while he is awake but not conscious enough to understand what is happening... there are no words for it. I couldn't have come up with this in my wildest dreams, and despite not giving me nightmares I couldn't sleep very much the night after watching the movie. The scene haunted me for many hours and I still feel weak when thinking about it. I said erlier the scene looked ultra realistic and for you who didn't know in real life some brain surgery has to be performed on a person who is awake (and drugged), but that is in a clinical enviroment and of course doesn't involve eating or talking. It bothered me a lot that the ending didn't tell whether the victim of this bizzare act did survive or not. Removing the scalp and the membranes in an unsterile enviroment would probably be enough to kill the person in question, rather than cutting pieces of the brain, but I'm not quite sure. It probably takes a brain surgeon not to be bothered by the visuals. The very last scene when Hannibal feeds a kid with... well, you know... is also quite discussting and I couldn't help to wonder if that was the agent, and what really happened after Hannibal cut his hand off. Did Hannibal finally kill the agent after the struggle with Denice? Would she let him? Was that possible with a missing hand? Why did Denice go for the boat? There is a gap here. As I said before this is one of the most bothering and horrible (not meaning bad) endings in movie history. Because of it it is totally impossible to rate Hannibal. It is just to much for most people to see wether the rest of the movie is excellent or terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 45 minutes of HANNIBAL are long. Very long. The story does pick up eventually and so does the intrigue. Some very brutal and graphic moments are in HANNIBAL. A good test of stomach strength is in order. Did this long awaited sequel live up to the hype?Set ten years after THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Clarice is having severe problems with her status in the FBI. A living 'victim' of Hannibal Lecter plots his murder. So where is Hannibal? The answer may lie within a cop in Florence, Italy.Hannibal's plotting is far more devious and cunning yet. The mind torture he puts on some of his enemies is equal to the punishment he dishes out. Depending on personal taste, HANNIBAL can be without a doubt an overly boring and shallow movie. But very little seems wrong with this movie. Granted, nothing is really interesting either to say that HANNIBAL was worth ten years waiting for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read the book instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How does one effectively take the complex thoughts of a 'madman' and bring them to the cinema? Not easy. And, for the movie "Hannibal", not really completed. The book "Hannibal" delved into the essence of Hannibal Lecter. The movie summarized it, with a swathe through the deeper story, as a series of bullet points. There was no explanation for the morphology of Hannibal Lecter, how he reacts to the Great Unwashed around him, how he deals with those who offend him, where he retreats into himself, and how close his personal demons are to the surface. Having said this, Anthony Hopkins plays a cooler, less steely psychopath - perhaps the outdoors agrees with him. Julianne Moore takes over the role of Clarice Starling and makes creditably it her own. The scene stealer is the convincing role played by Giancarlo Giannini. If you have not read the book or seen the movie, consider seeing the movie first ... and then read the book for the 'real' story. If you have already read the book, don't get yourself too excited about the movie, the storyline changes don't hang together coherently, and there is too little background to the events. As one example, the final scene is clumsily hacked from a completely different section of the book (a whimsical explanation for this can be found in the Special Features on the DVD) - but why cut and paste this scene? Why not write an original scene? In this transposition, the escape to the Memory Palace from the risky plane flight's personal horrors disappear and we are left with a cold meal that scares me to think actually looked tasty!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a shame that a director takes liberties with an author's work because he does not like parts of the story. If you listen to Ridley Scott's commentary of the Hannibal (on the DVD version) he explains why he changed the end of the story. He did not like Thomas Harris' ending, so he changed it. If he did not like the story that Thomas Harris had written, then someone else should have directed it.Scott not only changed the ending, but completely ignored Hannibal's motivation, the history of his sister Misha, and Mason's sister Margo. Barney's character was limited so much, that his role became useless to the movie.The high points were Anthony Hopkins' performance (a phenomenal actor) and that of Giancarlo Giannini (Rinaldo Pazzi). Julianne Moore was adequate, but no Jodie Foster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some things are better left unsaid (mild spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in December of 1998 when I went to see Gus van Sant's remake of the Hitchcock classic "Psycho" on its opening day, I knew that I was going to hate it. The question was how much. As it turns out, "Psycho" stands as one of the worst movies I have seen in the past ten years. So it was with the same mixed feelings of anticipation and foreseen disappointment that I approached Ridley Scott's "Hannibal" the sequel to the Hollywood masterpiece (what an oxymoron that is), "The Silence of the Lambs.""Hannibal" is indeed a horrible film but, to my surprise, not for the reasons that I had expected. Let me explain. Not only did I resent the fact that anyone would want to make a sequel to "Lambs" when it already has one of the most legendary cliffhanger endings in recent movie history, I also became fearful when Jodie Foster and Jonathan Demme passed on "Hannibal", seeing that as an early indication that "Hannibal" would be a poor and exploitive film. In short, I saw "Hannibal" as a threat to the integrity of "Lambs". Thankfully this isn't the case, as "Hannibal" and "Lambs" are two completely different films, and I can safely view them as two distinct entities. It is to "Hannibal's" credit that the filmmakers involved did not have any pretensions of making a film of the same caliber as "Lambs." Instead they set out to make a farce, which is fine except that the joke is on the audience. After all, who cares about such things as story structure and well-defined characters when there is a great deal of money to be made?!What makes "Hannibal" such a poor movie is its uneven structure. There seems to be one subplot too many and nothing is incorporated into the film very well at all. Worse than that, "Hannibal" is static and boring, up until the last 20 minutes when it suddenly veers off into the ridiculous. Before the over-the-top scenes of man-eating wild boars and the final dinner scene (which are only there for shock value), "Hannibal" doesn't even sustain enough interest to have good camp value.Also, I was disappointed, though not surprised, that the character of Clarice Starling was so underdeveloped. I know it is unfair to make comparisons, but part of the reason why "The Silence of the Lambs" is such a great film is because the audience witnesses the events unfold vicariously through Starling. It is her vulnerability and inexperience that makes Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling not only human and relatable, but also one of the best cinematic heroines of the 90's. Sadly for Julianne Moore (a talented actress who has unfortunately made some dubious choices, i.e. the aforementioned "Psycho"), the Clarice Starling in "Hannibal" is only two-dimensional. At least Anthony Hopkins has more fun in a caricatured version of his erudite madman, Hannibal Lecter.If "Hannibal" does have any saving graces it is its DVD, which is loaded with special features. I watched the making-of documentary on the DVD and found that to be more interesting than the actual film. In its defense, I must say that a lot of talent went into the making of "Hannibal." I particularly enjoyed the bits about the make-up and special effects, as well as Hans Zimmer's beautiful opera score. It is just a shame that this talent was wasted in such a poorly organized film. "Hannibal's" marketing tagline is "Break the Silence." Perhaps some things are just better left unsaid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Minor spoilers.Poor writing, and the sexual pretense of most of the major characters notwithstanding, Hannibal is a well crafted movie, obviously not for the faint of heart, however, its fatal flaw lies in its trueness to the source material. Unfortunately, when the master print is tainted, so to are all the copies from that master.Moore is fine as Starling, yet Starling is a shell of the person she was in SOTL with very little of the vulnerable ambition she once displayed; Gary Oldman gets to do Zorg again, this time from a wheelchair; Tony Hopkins again is fine as the lead (Is he ever bad ?); Giancarlo fits nicely in his role; and the rest save for Liotta play well, its just the pastiche mode of storytelling wears thin after 120 mins and the shock/revelation of the ending does not validate the investment.I'm not the first to make this observation, but I found it to be the most revealing - In Silence of the Lambs, Lecter was truly frightening because of the possibilty he might escape. He seemed ahead of everyone at every step of the way despite being totally restrained - that helped set the tension and mood. Now in Hannibal, he is out galavanting all over the place, one moment he is giving an art class in Florence, the next he is moving between shadows in D.C. even though he is on the FBI's most wanted list; well, the problem lies therein; its just not as scary now that he can move freely among us (and apparently with a sizable bank account to FEED on among other things) . Throughout SOTL we were waiting, wondering, anticipating if Dr. Lecter, who at once embodied pure evil and extreme politeness (a delicious combination), would lash out and terrify us whereas now he is doing it at every turn without impunity.Unfortunately, Hannibal somewhat scars the entire series by appealing to those with an APPETITE for obscenity and yet you cannot entirely blame the filmmakers for all they did was transfer most admirably to celluloid what was on linen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my humble opinion, ?Hannibal' is as good as, if not better than, ?The Silence of the Lambs'. What? Burn him! It is, however, clearly different to it's predecessor in many ways. It's a lot more ? I don't know ? fun. Which is presumable why people don't like it as much. I lie ? people do like it, just not enough to immortalise it as a ?classic'; it's a bit too ?fun' for people to include in their mental top ten movie lists. This matters very little, except that comparisons are bound to be drawn between ?Hannibal' and ?Silence?'.And already I've fallen into the trap of comparing the two. In an ideal world I would review ?Hannibal' on its own merits rather than constantly comparing it to ?Silence?', but an ideal world this is not, and so I will continue?Stylistically the films are very different. ?Hannibal' is just as dark as ?Silence?', but it's a different kind of darkness. It is a glossy darkness. The whole film has a very sleek, shiny feel to it. It would be very hard for ?Hannibal' to share the more gritty, realist appearance of ?Silence?' considering the beautiful European scenery. Julianne Moore plays a different Clarice Starling to Foster ? one that fits the sleek, shiny mould of the film. But enough of all this visually dynamic mumbo jumbo, let's get to the good stuff ? the killings. And this is where ?Hannibal' excels. Not just killings, but gruesome disfiguring as well. I won't go into details, you can watch the film, but it is top stuff. But all the killings in the world could not satisfy me if they weren't done with the impeccable charms of the world's favourite cannibal. Anthony Hopkins plays the part of Hannibal magnificently. In conclusion ?Hannibal' stands alone as a very good movie. Whether or not it's a very good sequel however, I really could not care less.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>free range Lector (spoiler!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Lector prefers the free range rude, Barney explains to Clarice Sterling. Well, for my money, I prefer a locked up in a small cell Dr. Lector. The guy is far more menacing that way. In Silence Of the lambs, Anthony Hopkins portrayal of the cannibalistic former shrink gave me goose-bumps. The way he moved, stood, talked, and watched in his cell; scary as hell. He was a supporting character and only in only four or five (important) scenes, but they were all unforgettable. Dr. Lector was behind bars, yes, but he was in control every step of the way.Thomas Harris, understandably more than a little satisfied with the way his somewhat pulpy book was translated to the big screen, wrote another book, featuring dr. Lector as the main character, on the loose this time as a Freddy Krueger for the 'more sophisticated viewer'. This time, no locked up Dr. Lector screwing with your brains (erm...), but a dr. Lector living and working in Italy. Harris called the book "Hannibal", to make sure nobody misses on the fact that HE is in charge here.We see him on the street, enjoying some wine on the patio. The way he looks, talks, moves...no! Dr. Lector, as one guy commented, looked fit in the first film, but kind of tired in this one. And the fun of the first film was that despite dr. Lector's decadency, he was still wearing a standard prison outfit. We don't need to see the good doctor wearing a 3 g suit to make the point he's so sophisticated; and we sure as hell don't need to see the guy with sunglasses and a baseball cap on his noggin', either.The premise of two people who had such a bizarre relationship with each other meeting again ten years later while ten years actually have passed is intriguing, but it lacks the potential impact it could have had because I didn't feel Lector was quite himself; I know Clarice definitely wasn't. With the right people behind the camera the 'final supper' scene could have been a memorable, emotional sucker punch. It had the potential to become a very disturbing scene. This isn't. Maybe Scott relied too much on the CGI brains effect to do the trick. Alas. Check out Texas Chainsaw Massacre for a great around-the-dinner-table sequence. Too much of this film was hammy grand guignol (Lector being 'crucified' and attacked by hungry wild pigs, leaded by a deformed victim; the spilling cuts-scene and the corny reward subplot surrounding it). Scott's direction didn't help either. During Verger's flashback Scott chooses to go MTV-style with shaking cameras and distorted views and sounds. That really put me off. Dr. Lector having deep conversations about Clarice with Barney? No! That doesn't ring true to me at all! And that 'next generation' ending in the plane? Come on!Jody Foster, Jonathan Demme, Scott Glenn, and Ted Dalle were all making a smart move when deciding not to get involved in this. Hopkins obviously enjoyed playing the character too much to say 'no' and this is by no means a 'bad' film, but please...hold the Red Dragon remake!**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was truly positively surprised by this movie. I thought that the book was particularly bad, little more than an enumeration of shock scenes and cheap thrill effects with very little plot. I found the book particularly disappointing in lots of longish chapters that were nothing but red herrings, I thought it was a bad idea to reveal the cause of Hannibal Lecter's madness and I particularly didn't like the book's ending.That said, I think David Mamet and Steve Zaillian did a good job at rewriting this flawed novel into a solid, albeit not excellent, thriller. I don't blame them, the base material was simply not good enough for being filmed.Contrary to the novel, there is actually a plot, which is not vying for spectacular moments, but develops rather slowly and gradually. Even though this may at some point seem to make the movie appear a bit longish, I think the pace is adequate and well-balanced.(minor spoilers follow) The only thing I missed was Mason Verger's sister; without her, his death seems somewhat contrived; there seems little motivation behind it. The good thing was that Mamet/Zaillian also got rid of Lecter's past and significantly changed the ending, and I prefer this ending very much to that of the novel, which never rang true to me.So the script was good, what about the acting? Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter reprise lacks some of the demonic darkness of "Silence of the Lambs". Since "Silence", Lecter-like characters have become so much of a stereotype that even the original hardly rings true. Julianne Moore as the older, more experienced Agent Starling lacks Jodie Foster's vulnerability; that is understandable given the 10 years that have supposedly passed, but then it was exactly Starling's lack of experience and her vulnerability that made her such an interesting character. So despite a solid performance from Julianne Moore she simply is no match for Jodie Foster. Gary Oldman as Mason Verger is barely recognizable between layers of mask, and nowhere near as evil and mentally disturbed as the character in the novel. With his elaborate make-up he has little opportunity to act or emote, which is a pity.As for the rest of the cast... well, unremarkable.I give this 7 points, mostly for a well-done script by Mamet/Zaillian, who turned a bad novel into a film that made some sense and for solid, but not exceptional directing by Ridley Scott. To come close to "Silence of the Lambs", Thomas Harris should have written a better novel than "Hannibal".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remain Silent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first commence by saying that Ridley Scott is an action director, he naturally excels in this area, it must be in his genes, because the intial shoot out with Starling is evidence of the fact that Ridley has talent. The point is this, this film is a thriller/horror/whatever, but anything but an action movie, the action is a sub plot, a mere distraction from the bigger picture. And to be honest the bigger picture is all mouth and no action.From the very beginning with all the talk of Jodie Foster walking from the picture I was very skeptical. I read the book and understood why she walked. In the book it seemed that Harris hurries his way until he gets to the most graphic parts, which he seems to salivate over. The film has this same feel. The scenes of Florence are beautiful, but that is not enough. It hurries to get to most graphic parts of the film. Hannibal himself, loses his intrigue, they make him 'acceptable' by focusing less on that fact that he is a serial murderer and insane and focus more on the fact that the people he attacks 'deserved it'. He loses the dark intrigue and appeal and even wisodm that had been his trademark in Manhunter and Silence of the Lamds and instead just becomes a gimick, condescending in nature and well wasted. Julianne Moore looks uncomfortable in most of her scenes and I understand why. She is wearing the huge shoes of Foster and doesn't quite fit, she does try though, but it isn't good enough, she is missing that something that Foster had and as a result, the relationship between Lecter and Starling is missing that something that was evident form Silence of the Lambs.Ok. I have heard some people say that this film isn't that gruesome, who are they trying to kid, I mean I am not someone who faints at the sight of blood but this was too much. Mason Verger didn't look as bad as described in the novel. However, the face cutting part, the disembowellment and of course the infamous ending were all TOO MUCH. Speaking as a woman who enjoys her fair share of violence on screen, this was gratuitous and in fact I would be very happy never to see this again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody very well-done, controversy over it's kind of overblown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The comparison between THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and HANNIBAL, beyond the obvious original-vs.-sequel debate, isn't a fair one when focusing on the level of horror and fear attained. HANNIBAL didn't really scare me at all when I watching it, and not much afterwards either. I don't think it even qualifies as a horror film, the high level of graphic violence notwithstanding.Where HANNIBAL works at a high level, as high as any film I've seen this year, is a psychological drama that moves like a thriller and takes time to explore all of the major characters. It's a manipulation that Hannibal Lecter is not as "bad" a man as the stories major villains--Mason Verger, Paul Krendler, even Pazzi--but the movie pulls it off. Once again, we don't much mind when Lecter kills and, um, does other stuff with his victims because they're jerks. They certainly treat Clarice Starling like crap, and Julianne Moore does a brilliant job at showing an older Clarice, someone who knows she's great at what she does, knows the powers that be (especially Krendler) hate her for just not going away, and knows that she'll never be accepted. One sly notion floated in the film is that Clarice does fear and hate Lecter, but at least respects him for not lying about what he is. The ending reflects this paradox nicely.Above everything else, the film looks beautiful and moves like lighting. Ridley Scott simply has the right touch to propel a film's narrative through the ennui or lengthy exposition that has torpedoed many a dramatic thriller. In a lesser film, the material with Pazzi and Lecter in Italy would feel like a waste of time, but here it's good enough to make a movie in itself.And HANNIBAL is not as gory or violent as most people think. There are several scenes where incredible violence or torture are IMPLIED (Pazzi's exit, the massacre at Verger's, the fate of the petty thief who gets Lecter's ID at a huge cost), but the film does not linger on the blood. It sure does so at the climax, granted. It's certainly a very hard R, but an NC-17? I would say no.The best situation in the movie comes when Hannibal uses a single line of dialogue to solve two problems at once at Verger's, before he exits the stage. You'll see what I mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great suspense film that should be set apart from its predecessors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that the first time I wanted to watch Hannibal, I was quite unsure what I would find. The various media who wrote reviews about this movie lambasted it and called it a "mainstream hit," and similar other types of name-calling. But a film with the calibre of "Silence of the Lambs" cannot be eclipsed by any preceding movie or a sequel.With that being said, being a big fan of "Silence of the Lambs," I thoroughly enjoyed "Hannibal" as a film in itself. Ridley Scott did a tremendous job conveying his own vision onscreen, as always, and is commended with his unique handling of the staple characters of this series. Anthony Hopkins was frightfully entertaining and, as with its predecessor, "smart". His acting is always a pleasure to watch, no matter how much of a role he plays. Upon seeing his fiery eyes and his maniacal grin, the fascade of Anthony Hopkins being Anthony Hopkins, the Actor, fades away and the reality of Hannibal Lecter settles in. Julianne Moore handles the role of Clarice Starling quite well and manages to separate herself from Jodie Foster's Academy Award Winning role. Truly, this collaborative teamIf you've been a fan of the book and want an original take on the story of "Hannibal", watch this movie. If you loved "Silence of the Lambs," don't expect this to be an intelligent thriller, as the directors are different. If you love suspense, thriller, and the actors and actresses in this movie, see it - they won't fail you. But I must warn you... it's quite gross and gory. Bon appetit!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite its numerous good points, this was a mistake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why I didn't like this film. I think it was because I expected something similar and just as good as Silence of the Lambs, and there isn't much that can do that.However, it certainly isn't a movie to be sneered at. It is very different to Silence, and quite a fair bit more gruesome overall. Anthony Hopkins certainly did his best, as did Gary Oldman and I liked the way the story involved three different sides all trying to capture Lecter at once. However, this was a mistake for several main reasons:#1: I don't care what's been said, the fact remains; Julianne Moore is a poor substitute for Jodie Foster.#2: In Silence of the Lambs, Dr Lecter is a brooding psychopath, who can torture people simply through talking to them. In Hannibal, despite the tremendous effort of Anthony Hopkins, he is a gay with a lot of one liners. 'I prefer you just as you are.'#3: The utterly ridiculous way that Mason Verger became disfigured. 'It seemed like a good idea at the time.' Gary Oldman did well, but his character was restricted by this preposterous premise.I don't know how to score this film. It isn't a below average film in itself, rather an unnecessary one. But as a single film rather than a sequel, it can actually be watched and understood without watching Silence of the Lambs first. Personally, I didn't like it, but critically on its own, it doesn't seem SO bad.6/10 - but it would have been so much better if they'd left Dr Lecter alone. Please god, make sure there isn't another sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guarentee that this movie will leave you with tremendous head aching...It was a great movie and great acting...This movie is much gorier than the first. It is about Hanibal more than the first one also. IF you want to see lots of blood, guts, and other gross features watch this one...but be prepared to feel sickened as how could someone do this? I liked the movie and it was very scary indeed...it wasn't like all them other slasher horror movies because after all it is just a man doing the killing not a monster/vampire alien or a guy in a hockey mask. But a true man (in the flesh) Anthony Hopkins is wonderful and brilliant. This movie is deffinetly rated a 10 in my book. If you liked the first one, then you will deffinetly like this one and if you like blood and guts you'll like it. This movie stook out more than the others because this could really happen and that is why it is realistic and very disturbing to watch some scenes. My face hurts just thinking about it. This is the first real horror movie that has satisfied me in years...Thumbs up!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not half as gory as it was made out to be. The story was sad (not meaning a "tear-jerker"). And, Anthony Hopkins...I'd expect to see him on Broadway doing "Hannibal: The Musical". Why this character? I really wanted him to get caught or killed because he's a dirty, homicidal psychopath...but, somewhere he's become this great, romantic hero.It was also fairly predictable. Upon our first encounters with the characters, you can easily figure out which ones are going to be butchered by Hannibal.Sorry for such a negative review, but I couldn't believe all of the good ones. I would place it in the same area of the store as "Jurassic Park II" or "The Mummy Returns". The "Only-saw-it-cause-the-first-one- was-good" section.So the ticket sales look good and everyone thinks it's a success.3 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautifully shot, excellently scored, wonderfully acted, gorgeously staged film that is an absolute visceral pleasure to watch. It has all the hallmarks of a classic horror film, hallmarks which mainstream US critics (who love nothing better than a straight, bold-faced movie with no human humour) on one hand celebrate in the classics, and on the other hand despise in modern day movies."The film is too gory and disgusting", claim most SOTL-philes. The same thing was said about "John Carpenter's The Thing" back in the early 80s when film critics were salivating over Spielberg's warm fuzzy take on Aliens on Earth (critics have such short attention spans they can only handle one ideology at a time.)"The villain is comical and amiable", cry the naysayers. Did nobody laugh at Frankenstein's monster's humorous bumblings in Bride of Frankenstein? The characters in this story actually make us laugh! What a terrible, terrible thing! Lord knows most people in everyday life never do anything funny."The film is nothing like Silence of the Lambs" is also a popular complaint. I thought sequels were usually despised because they apparently clone the formulae of their predecessors? That this film is so different to SOTL is a cause for celebration, not derision!Basically, this film is destined to become a classic. I feel sorry for the people who can't enjoy this film now because of simple, artificial, pretentious reasons. And those are the people that will be jumping on the bandwagon in years to come, appreciating Hannibal as the horror masterpiece it will be seen as in years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HANNIBAL (2001) Rating: 8/10There is a lot shadowing over Hannibal to stop audiences from enjoying it. The critics didn't think it was too flash, the censors gave it mighty high ratings and most sequels, according to some people's philosophy, aren't worth the time. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and I wasn't distracted by any of the above. At the start I honestly found Hannibal a little boring, but when the cool detective story comes in it gives the film a little more life. We needed something else to keep the film going however, because it was missing the chemistry of the first. When Lecter finally enters the United States, things heat up. The gore splashes everywhere, the scenes are more exciting, the characters get meatier (in both senses of the word) and the audience will start to get more involved. The detective story in the first hour or so in the film is very well played and neat, the killings in the movie are creative, the cinematography is beautiful and the soundtrack is stunning. At times the film goes a bit off-course and is a wee bit laughable, but it remains enjoyable in the focused parts of the movie, which is a lot of the film, not much of it is really `bad' bad. Ridley Scott directs the movie fabulously and gives us stylish and memorable scenes. Some scenes in the movie are memorable in a bad way, though, I'll warn you now. The acting is brilliant, with Julianne Moore fabulous as a more determined but less interesting Clarice Starling; Anthony Hopkins as a scarier and less mature Hannibal and Gary Oldman who is great but completely unrecognisable as grotesque make-up covers his face. Hannibal is a gross, great and gory re-visit to the character we enjoy so much, I recommend it to people who either enjoyed the first film or enjoy very extreme deaths in movies.</fullReview>

Hannibal cuts off his own hand and this is not publicized to help capture him???The most interesting part of the movie was the last 15-20 minutes when the gore begins. I have to admit, I was begging Dr. Hannibal to eat Ray Ray Liotta's character! What a slime ball!!!! My recommendation??? Watch the entire film to satisfy your curiosity and form your own opinion. However, if you find yourself getting bored, fast forward to the end of the film and watch the last few moments when the action begins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No NC-17 rating a crime.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this film a 6 out of 10.There are hundreds of reviews posted for this film. I was discouraged by negative reviews while it was out in theatres, and finally checked it out on DVD. It met my expectations in these ways:It was nowhere near as interesting as Silence of the Lambs. Ridley Scott makes visually stunning films. The story was slow and mostly boring. The intense scenes of gore were unnecessary and are probably the primary reason for this film's success.Since this film has been out for awhile, I am not worried about mentioning major spoilers. In fact, I feel compelled to comment on them.Although Julianne Moore is fine as Starling, her character in the film is not believable. I could not understand when she frees Hannibal from ?custody', and lets him help himself by giving Hannibal a knife! The fact that the wild boars would not attack Hannibal is not explained. The Krendler character conveniently isolates himself at his home for the infamous dinner scene. Hannibal has it too easy trying to escape. If he is still wanted by the FBI, shouldn't they be more hot and bothered when he turns up on a surveillance video, such as keeping an eye out for him at the airports? He cuts off his hand at the end of the film, and then without incident boards an airplane. With the law enforcement on his tail, wouldn't they send an APB to all airports to look out for an old guy missing a hand? Then there are the gore scenes. I grew up enjoying flicks like `Dawn of the Dead', `Day of the Dead', etc. These films would have easily been given an NC-17 rating if it existed at the time. `Hannibal' was given an R rating. That means unsuspecting parents that took their children to this R rated movie, subjected their kids to scenes of very graphic and disturbing images. An ambiguous R rating also deceives general adult audiences who are used to a level of violence the rating normally represents. An NC-17 serves as a special warning to all moviegoers that the violence is much more intense. It doesn't matter that, yeah, this was all special effects and not real. Even one of the special effects people involved with the movie, mentions on the DVD that he himself was very disturbed by the image of a person with his entire brain exposed and still conscious, eating a piece of his own brain. I myself can vividly recall this image several days after seeing it. To allow this film to be released without an NC-17 rating is negligence in part by the studio and the ratings board. I am not easily squeamish, and as I said before, I enjoyed the campy fun of gore flicks. But this is a mainstream film, obviously aware of the large built-in audience, showing insensitivity in deciding to show these images. I made the decision a long time ago that I have no interest in seeing any of the `Faces of Death' videos, because I wish to not have these awful images existing in my head.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as Silence of The Lambs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS** ***SPOILERS*** In Silence of the Lambs, Anthony Hopkins performance can only be described as magnificent. In Hannibal it wasn't as good (not that it was bad). Julianne Moore should be commended for bravery for taking that part and having the guts to replace Jodie Foster. She did pretty well in the part but, not quite as good as Jodie. The storyline was not as good either, much of the supposed to be scary parts were over done gory slasher film types. It didn't have the suspense and thrills that made Silence so great. It wasn't all bad though, it started out well with Clarice being shunned by the FBI she trusted, and Hannibal following every step, until he was found out. Then it went slightly down hill. The book was of course better than the movie (excluding the ending). But you can't blame this on the screenwriter entirely; I personally don't think this was the best candidate to turn into a movie. The movie couldn't possibly fit all the stuff that made the book better, including Margot and Hannibal's past and showing more of Paul Krendler's involvement with Mason Verger. The ending to the movie was actually better than in the book, and I won't do the Clarice would've never done that angle. She was on hypnotic drugs, she would have done anything, but the 2 of them leaving together was much like the gore, a little over the top. The score was like the first chilling and one thing that did not disappoint but probably could have worked better with more help from the story.</fullReview>

But I can't remember much from it, which is a good way to tell how good I think it was.Anyway, this follow-up was fairly pointless. I couldn't have cared less about Agent Starling - she was about as interesting as a chalk sandwich.And as much as I am perversly interested in stories involving cannibalism, I'm not a big fan of movies that attempt to get us to root for the villain. Yes, Hannibal is a suave, likeable gentleman on the surface, but he deserves to be tortured for dozens of years then killed for the crimes he committed.And so we rooted for him, and he got away... ...so we can get another pointless sequel, hooray.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal Lechter.There has never been a villain so terrifying and hypnotic.He is the supreme god of the insane mind and he is also one of the most famous movie characters around."Hannibal" returns us to this man who has caused a sensation that provides plenty of fear.Anthony Hopkins returns as the cannibalistic psychopath who has been spending the past ten years hiding out in Paris.He has a desire for art and still has an appetite for consuming humans.The film is based on the novel of the same name in which Clarice Starling(Julianne Moore) has become a disgrace to the FBI because of a screw up that left one of her men dead during an attempt to apprehend and arrest a dangerous woman who has the tendency of slipping needles in her head that contain her HIV virus so when a cop grabs her head they get effected.Clarice is considered a disgrace and has to deal with a womanizing FBI agent played by Ray Liotta.He shows no respect for Clarice and is the kind of man that could take lessons on how to treat women.The film is divided in two sections.The second section deals with Hannibal and his stay in Paris.Hannibal is the target of one of his victims that became the only person to survive Hannibal's psychotic rampage.That man is Mason Verger who is played by an uncredited Gary Oldman.Eventually,he was convinced by Hannibal to peel his face off with a broken piece of glass and now spends the entire time in a wheelchair with a face that is beyond hideous.Mason was a child molester who is just as insane as Lechter is trying everything he can in his power to seek revenge against the cannibalistic killer.And finally there is Detective Pazzi played by academy award nominee Giancarlo Giannini("Seven Brides,Seven Beauties").He wants to apprehend Hannibal himself to collect a reward being that Hannibal Lechter is on the FBI's ten most wanted list.There is great chemistry between these two actors."Hannibal" was a pretty good sequel but it did not have the impact of "The Silence of the Lambs".That film showed Hannibal Lechter in a more terrifying sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Off to la VITA NUOVA ("The New Life"), Clarice. But not in the movies !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Subject: "The Ending You'll Never Forget!" (Tagline to DVD "Special Edition") So there are SPOILERS.Considering the amount of anxious pressure that Dino &amp; Martha DE LAURENTIS were exerting upon Thomas Harris to finish his epic-length third 'Hannibal' novel (which would promptly be reduced to the short story minimum, with serious departures, that Steven Zaillian could adapt to Ridley Scott's film version), this literary 'instant classic' may appear to severely undermine the almost-perfect qualities of this film."Almost-," that is, considering that bizarre ending, contrived for whatever reasons, which so distinctly is NOT that of the ca. 600 page novel. But I would like to partly defend the Scott-Zaillian(-Harris ?) decisions. Because the movie DOES work well, thematically, if not exactly as narration ! In fact, what is great about the film is that it so perfectly re-presents the aesthetics of the central Dantean Love Sonnet (see 'opera' piece) within the context of the leitmotiv of 'The Dantean Mind of Hannibal Lecter' in the novel(s). The all-consuming "dark love story" (Hans Zimmer, MUSIC) between "Clarice" (Julianne Moore's more-experience, hence more disillusioned) "Starling" and her dark guardian-angel, "Hannibal," at first enjoying his 'Paradise Re-gained" of Florence ("with a view"), is given its just due in this film adaptation.And there IS a great amount of the psychological battle-of-wits involved in "Dr. Lecter's" subtle 'seduction-of-Evil' correspondence (from the obligedly-chaste 'courtly-love' distance of a FBI fugitive, far from his "straight arrow" Special Agent); doomed as they might appear, to never consummate their affair as "star-crossed lovers" (Ridley Scott). There, we might see one critical departure; i.e., for that (the Shakespearean) pair of ill-destined lovers in the different corrupt "City State" ("Fair Verona" rather than "Florence"/"Washington, D.C.") ! Which explains, perhaps, certain departures. What IS masterfully maintained is the corruption !Apart from all the evidence of Dantean 'poetic justice' retributions, which the film takes straight from the novels, there is the serious flaw of attributing "the mash note" (even if it's being on a postcard of a particular William Blake painting IS a fine touch !) to "Mason Verger" ("He didn't write it, because I did !"-- Gary Oldman); i.e., to his fraudulent machinations and manipulation of the Justice Dept. and FBI. The message, in form of Lecter's 'esoteric' Old Testament reference to "the answer to Samson's Riddle": "the honey in the lion," is NOT just 'something Lecter would say'. It is the essence of the 'beatific purity' of Clarice, as her 'Beatrice' to Hannibal's 'Dante', among the corrupt and cynical of "that stale bureaucracy" of the "Krendlers" (Ray Liotta), "Vergers," and others : "the Philistines" who would betray 'the true Israelite' at every turn :"I thought, to begin with, you might tell me how you're feeling.""About what?""The masters you serve and how they've treated you. Your career, such as it is. Your life, Clarice." ..."You serve the idea of Order, Clarice. They don't. You believe in the oath you took. They don't. You feel it is your duty to protect the sheep. They don't. They don't like you because you're not like them. They hate you and they envy you. They are weak and unruly and believe in nothing."Since this exchange captures the sense of Hannibal's elliptic Biblical reference, the alteration can be excused somewhat. Indeed, this very aspect of the film's diegesis (the world of womanly purity bound to corrupt 'City-State') is the option which justifies the decisions on 'ending' (even the "Never-Before-Seen Alternate Ending" [DVD]). It may be as simple a thing as the decision that the horrific of 'the happy cannibal-couple' would be too much for audiences : the actual "New Life" succumbing of Clarice to the cynical wisdom of our (best of all the previous Hollywood attempts to depict Nietzsche's so-called "Blond Beast"/'Superman') epitome of evil, as an Uebermensch "beyond Evil." And, while the film's ending supports one equally Dantean reading of the story, the novel fully explodes the twisted narrative of perverse chivalry in an almost literal (cannibalistic) reading of the "New Life" sonnet's all-consuming passions."Then, unaware, she ate his heart." (From the novel: "Inspector Pazzi" (Giancarlo Giannini), on his 'high maintenance' wife (Francesca Neri).]But the cinematic aesthetic production values are superb, and rich enough in literary culture and historical mise-en-scene to validate the claim to : "as compelling a film as you will ever see" (Joel Siegel, "Good Morning America") and other accolades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had few expectations when I sat down top watch this film. At the end I don't know what to make of it.Is it breathtakingly complex and subtle with an intriguing plot, or is it pretentious nonsense in which 75 percent of what little plot there is seems superfluous?The characters are strange, the relationships don't develop at all, the gore is for gore's sake.It strikes me that Moore has done it for fame, Hopkins as an ego trip, Scott for money and Oldman for a laugh.I got nothing at all from this film. That doesn't make it a bad film, but I didn't like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pleasant Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I fully expected to be disappointed by this third installment to the Hannibal Lector trilogy. I was expecting a cheap hacker flick, but I found it to be a well crafted film with excellent acting from a top-rate cast. Hannibal wasn't well received with the critics, or the public for that matter, and its easy to see why. Too many people compare it to it's predecessor, The Silence of the Lambs. I'm one of those few who considers the two films pretty equal in comparison. Silence relied almost entirely on Anthony Hopkins, who stole his scenes, but left the rest of the film suffering from a lack of excitement. Hannibal makes good use of Hopkins, as well as adding to the gritty and fascinating subject matter with another grotesque character, played with excellence by Gary Oldman.Thomas Harris's novel and Ridley Scott's direction make Hannibal a far more different experience. The subject matter doesn't seem to be taken so seriously; its actually rather humorous at times, which doesn't leave quite an impact on the viewer, but it still makes for a fun ride. Many complain about the ending, but personally, I thought it made a perfect end to an excellent trilogy of filmmaking.O O O O O O O 1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in to this film trying to keep an open mind about it. The Silence of the Lambs was a really tough act to follow, and I tried to keep that in mind so I could be objective about "Hannibal". Unfortunately, try as I might I just couldn't help but compare the two. Hannibal just didn't do it for me, however, it was no fault of Hopkins, who delivers yet another brilliant performance. His Hannibal is every bit as loathesome and eerie as he is supposed to be, and he literally sent chills down my spine sometimes. Other than that, the plot was thin and weak. What was with the obsession with wild boars? I couldn't help but laugh about that. Overall it seemed to me that the plot was hastily contrived to act as a vehicle for one of the greatest villains ever to hit the movie screen. Worth a look on video, but don't feel too bad if you missed it in the theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As always with R.Scott films, they look great but lack a good script and depth. In the DVD, Mr Scott talks about the amount it cost to get a good script writer, I'm left wondering if it was money well spent.Well, the first part of the film was good, the italian sencery, I saw a lot of influences from Gladiator, in some of the statues shots.J.Moore had an impossible task to live up to, I heard they could had gone for A.Jolie but I think she would had been to confident. Ray Liotta, was simply mis-casted, he has been having trouble trying to find a suitable role ever since goodfellas.Apart from Hopkins, the most impressive performance was from Giancarlo Giannini. I understand he has done a number of italian films, but I hope to see him, in more english speaking movies.Finally, when watching the DVD extra, one thing that annoys me is when Mr Scott cuts out certain sences, because they don't speed up the story. Well, no they don't but they do add depth. He did the same with Gladiator, sences that were not always of direct importantance but would add Cast depth.By the way have you ever seen R.Scott do a witty movie, err no!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally got to see this on DVD to see what all the fuss was about.. Scott's direction takes a slow, haunting approach witch those of us with a stop to smell the roses mentality appreciate.. problem is that much suspension of disbelief is required her, and when you slow things down the audience will get ahead of you. As a result, I found the film had little suspense. I was also given too much time to contemplate over as to why no one could nab Hannibal.. He walks around in public doing whatever he pleases and apparently has a frequent flyer pass.Still, I did like the film.. Scenes and images stayed with me long after. The performances are excellent all around, and of course Hopkins is one of those actors who can really hold an audience in his grip. The famous climax is what nightmares are made of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie in theaters, I loved it. Now when I rented it on video, I just thought that it was OK. Why is that? Is it because I was so hyped up about going to see it that I couldn't bear to be disappointed? Probably. So anyways...Anthony Hopkins gives another excellent performance as Hannibal "the Cannibal" Lecter, Julianne Moore is fine as FBI Agent Clarice Starling (not as good as Jodie though), and Gary Oldman as the deranged Mason Verger? Fantastic! The film's problems? It's too graphic. The "hanging", the pigs (or boars or whatever), the "brain-food" scene...It would have been OK if we had just seen the aftermath of it, not him doing actually doing it. And they cut out quite alot from the book. Where's Margot? And Barney should have had more screentime. So, it's not nearly as good as "Silence of the Lambs", but it's OK in it's own way. Rent it and see how you like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so Hannibal isn't Silence of the Lambs (1991), I don't think people should go watching this film expecting that it is. It picks up ten years after the original silence (okay, so Manhunter in the original but I don't want to get down to that right now). Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is in some hot water after a shoot out goes wrong and is assigned to visit reclusive billionaire Mason Verger (an un-recognisable Gary Oldman, but more on that later) about the whereabouts' of everyone's favourite cannibal Dr Lector (Hopkins). All right, so the plot isn't much, it begins with a revenge trap, and then becomes some kind of Grand Guignol romantic horror, with some broad black comedy thrown in. Where the film's strength lies is in Ridley Scott's evocative depiction of Rome, painting Florence as the same kind of dangerous and vibrant metropolis that made the LA of Blade Runner so memorable. The weakness however lies in the script, yes, there are some plot holes and a few of the characterisation seem under developed, but these are only minor floors. Now lets get down to what makes this film really great. Firstly, we have Hopkins reprising the role of Lector, let out of the "dungeon" and allowed free reign of terror around Rome and the US. There is a certain feeling that once the beast is out of the cage; so to speak, a sense of terror is lost. But Lector is still terrifying, going way over the top in pursuit of Clarice. Also, we have one of the greatest villains ever with Verger, one of Lector's former patients who has had his face completely removed (in one of the film's more disturbing scenes), Oldman layered under a ton of make up allows himself become Verger, a little over the top maybe, but wouldn't you be a irate if you'd had you're face peeled off.The film builds a beautiful tension, with the help of Hans Zimmer's operatic score, even if the film loses marks for the slightly stupid final "tea part scene"... And you get the feeling that Scott's a little bored with shooting the American landscape but over all this is a decent enough effort, definitely worth you're time and money. Go on - break the silence.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I dont read novels I had no prior knowledge of the story other than what I had read beforehand about the film, and then the critics reviews. So I didnt go to the cinema expecting something that I wasnt going to get. I saw Silence of the Lambs and thought it excellent deserving of the praise and the Oscars. But I didnt go to see Hannibal expecting any type of repeat. I bore in mind that Dr Lecter was 10 years older and enjoying his freedom. I therefore had a completely open mind and was prepared to like, or dislike, what I saw on the screen free of complaining about what was in the book but not the film and vice versa. I thought Ridley Scott's direction was first class in every way, especially his use of light and shadow to emphasise certain scenes and the use of Florence really evoked the atmosphere. Julianne Moore was an excellent older Clarice and her scenes at the end with Dr Lecter had a frisson of emotional involvement that left me wishing it had been developed further. Anthony Hopkins just proved that there is no one else who could match his interpretation of the old devil. He made Dr Lecter such an attractive personification of evil that I hoped nothing nasty would happen to him. An anti-hero with a vengeance. For me the whole production was a throwback to the days of vintage Hitchcock for suspense and first class thrills. Maybe a couple of scenes were a bit OTT but nothing compared to chainsaw massacres and the like. The only critics who were revolted by the film were the ones who had obviously not watched it properly because several reviewed scenes that weren't in it ! I cant wait to buy the video and DVD and have Hannibal all to myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure what to think of this movie. It was good. But it was also bad. It was involving and slightly thrilling while being really dumb at the same time. It had it's positive moments (the phone call between Clarice and Lechter) and it's moments of sheer stupidity (I have wild boars that are trained to eat human flesh when they hear screaming!).Scott has found himself a happy style. He never tries anything different or daring, he continues to make solid movies. Not films, but decent ways to spend a couple hours. Which is sad. His career began because he was able to take risks. Look at Alien, Blade Runner, Legend, etc. Then look at 1492, Thelma and Louise and Gladiator. No risks taken there.In the end, most of Hannibal was just gross. Every so often we'd get to see the classic Hannibal Lechter, but the rest of the time he was almost an absurd heroic version of the psychopath we had grown to admire in Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs.So this movie was not a waste. It wasn't incredible, but it held my attention for two hours. And the conclusion on the airplane was almost as good as the conclusion for Lambs. Yes it was chilling, but it also made me feel good, hinting that this may not be over.</fullReview>

Most of The Movie was unpredictable like when Hannibal cut off his own hand instead of Clarice's, and when Hannibal fed a small cooked piece of the brain of one of his victim's to a small child on an air plane. Also, he gutted someone by cutting a hole in them and tossing them out of a Church Window, Hanging them. Also, most of the hype made it seem like he was caught at the end, he got away.Overall this was a gory, bloody, gross but very intense movie. I say it deserves a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

If exposure didn't work, it wouldn't be considered such a commodity.

		<fullReview>The problem with sequels is the original players are not offered any more character development. They have become icons, or symbols of people, and are drawn in broad brush strokes of caricature. Did we learn anything more about Clarice or Hannibal? Absolutely not. They acted as predicted surrounded with the known atmosphere introduced in the first movie. The movie was stylishly photographed but the scenes lacked any depth and when examined they fall apart. Are we to really believe Clarice falls asleep in a chair and Hannibal happens to sneak in just then and romps around the room without her awakening. Don't you think Clarice would be a tad more alert given her circumstances and training. Does it make sense for a women with Clarice's background, rather rural, and for someone who jogs regularly to stay in shape to be slurping whiskey in the middle of the afternoon. Anthony Hopkins was good as Hannibal given the paucity of script. Couldn't they have found some other piece of music besides the Goldberg Variations as his leit motif, again just a copy from the first movie, no original thought used. Julianne Moore, a good actress, lacked Jodie Foster's intensity or grit. She was not convincing as Clarice. Gary Oldman, as usual, was good since his character had to be more, should I say it, fleshed out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one nasty movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing's first: this movie was nowhere near as good as its predecessor, "Silence of the Lambs". In the original, we learn more and more about Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lechter. They become two well-defined characters. In "Hannibal", we learn nothing more about them. The whole story is just a shallow, hypothetical continuation of their interaction. Perhaps we learn that Hannibal cares a little more about Clarice than we previously thought, and wouldn't kill her when given the opportunity. But then again, would Dr. Lechter's character have been changed had he killed her? Probably not, in my opinion. There's not much to the character aspect of this movie, which is the major component of the story of Hannibal and Clarice.What this movie does successfully expand upon is just how psychotic yet of sound mind Dr. Lechter is. We get to see Hannibal Lechter in full-force. The "brain scene" is undoubtedly the most convincing portrayal of a deranged character that I have seen in any movie, ever. It takes a twisted mind to keep a victim conscious while he removes his calvarium, slices off a piece of his brain, cooks it next to the fellow who says "Hey, that smells good", and feeds it to him.Julianna Moore was a good choice, all things considered. She has some of that creepiness required to play Clarice Starling. But make no mistake about it, she is no Jodie Foster. Jodie Foster was IDEAL for the role of Clarice, and I was extremely disappointed when I heard she wouldn't be playing the role again. Perhaps she read the script and thought the movie was a cop-out, just as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an incredibly slow, dull, quiet and basically mediocre film in which there is no characterisation, no exploration of what should have been complex issues and in which absolutely nothing seems to *happen*! One reaches the end and thinks "was that it?" - so very much like Planet of the Apes!We were supposed to see a development of both main characters and their intensely complex relationship, yet there is no glimpse of emotion or depth. Why did they bother to make a sequel if they had nothing new to say? Julianne Moore is permanently expressionless and doesn't look a day older than 30. This would be bad enough if Anthony Hopkins (poor lamb) didn't look so very obviously well over 60 - he is simply too old and out of shape to be even remotely menacing.As for the pathetic story - Ridley Scott has taken the book, awful as it was, and stripped it of all the subplots which, though very silly, at least added much needed flesh and made it almost (but not quite) interesting. The absence of Mason Verger's lesbian sister and his paedophiliac past (an issue no director would have the balls to deal with nowadays), coupled with Gary Oldman on auto-pilot, leaves the character with, well.. no character, not even madness. Nasty Paul Krendler is reduced to about 3 lines of dialogue which is hardly enough to make him Starling's nemesis!What little blood and gore there was in the book has been cut, and Lecter really has nothing to do. The exploration of his past has also been cut (although considering the laughable "reason" given for his behaviour in the book, this is probably for the best), as has any real life in the character of Starling.Basically, there is no atmosphere, no tension (rising or otherwise), no character, no reason for any of the (very minimal) action, no drama, and the ending (though mildly more plausible than the book's hideous pantomime version) is half-hearted and pointless, giving us no sense of conclusion or of the story having developed or any deeper knowledge of the characters. This is a wholly pointless film which goes absolutely nowhere and has absolutely nothing to say. Nice soundtrack, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott is more suited to directing action movies rather than a horror-suspense thriller (a few action scenes in this movie already demonstrate his talent as an action director). This sequel to Silence of the Lambs is not as marvelous as the original except the ending where it's astonishingly superb. The middle part of the film has been dragged too long &amp; paced too slow, resulting in less scenes of meeting &amp; contact between Hannibal &amp; Clarice. The best part of the show is none other than the interaction between the two but, sadly enough, their chemistry simply fails to spark (main reason is because Agent Starling wasn't played by Jodie Foster, whom we've already got used to her acting as the lead character of the film)! In a nutshell, this is still a worthwhile sequel despite the weaknesses of the film mentioned above.</fullReview>

The closeness of the above scene as well as not so subtle joke of a copy of a `Vegetarian Cooking' book in a scene, and the complete lack of logic (how the hell did one of the FBI's 10 most wanted travel from Italy to the US without being spotted!, makes it clear were in parody mode here. You half expect Hannibal to make James Bond style jokes after dispatching a victim.The film looks awful, all silver and grey colours surrounded by beautiful scenery for that stylish car ad look. The main problem is its predictability, ********SPOILER**********, there cannot be a person who watched this film who did not guess he chopped his own hand off at the end, not starlings. On the good side, the acting is good, Anthony Hopkins obviously is having fun, and just seems to be taking the whole thing as one big laugh, and over acts appropriately. Julianne Moore is good (a lot better than the weak little girl portrayal by Jodie Foster in Silence). The only bad part of the acting was Gary Oldmans accent, which must rate up there with Michael Caine, Bob Hoskins and Dick Van Dyke as the most lousy foreign accent in movie history. You do not have to be American to hear an unconvincing American accent. A big disappointment.</fullReview>

It was pretty entertaining overall and should not be compared to it's two predecessor's since they are all pretty different movies. As a sequel to Silence it was satisfactory especially considering unlike others I wasn't expecting the second coming. I would reccomend it and found it much more entertaining then Scott's last movie the overrated Gladiator. And it wasn't really gory or maybe that's just me considering I watch a lot of horror flicks so i've seen worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought they did a pretty good job with this, all in all. Don't compare this to Silence of the Lambs though - this is a totally different movie. As for gory, I don't know. I read the book first (read it 2 times actually - liked it MUCH better on the second reading. It was a little hard to take the first time.) Compared to the gore in the book this movie was like "Mary Poppins:. Also - don't expect it to be too much like the book if you have read it. I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if I had read the book after seeing the movie. I am a little bit bummed that Jodie Foster didn't want to play Clarice, but I do think that Moore did a good job with the role. Anthony Hopkins, as always, was wonderful (perfect for Hannibal Lecter.) I really hope they do a movie of Red Dragon with him as Lecter. That was my fave book out of the three.All-in-all, I do think Ridley Scott did a really good job. However, there were a few things that were in the book that were not in the movie that I really wished would be in there (but think that American audiences probably couldn't have handled.) There were quite a few things I'm glad they left out though. If you can get this on DVD, I highly recommend getting the special edition one so you can see the making of info. It is pretty interesting and fun to see how they did all of the special FX.Bon Appetit! (heh heh.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes the story to a better place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal, the third in the series of Thomas Harris' adaptations about Hannibal Lecter, takes the entire mythology of the characters to a new place. With Ridley Scott on board and most of the production crew from Scott's Gladiator, the visual work on this film in stunning. The locations and the framing of almost every shot with little exception is fantastic just to sit back and take in. Furthermore, this film's screenplay was done by David Mamet, who gave us Glengarry Glen Ross. With the combination of all that mixed together, Hannibal blows its predecessors (Silence and Manhunter) out of the water without a doubt. This film establishes Hopkins as a capable actor in an often pigeonholed genre and gives Julianna Moore the chance she deserves to be a breakout hit. This film will be a classic much like Silence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Vile and Disgusting Piece of Trash! SPOILER ALERT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was talked into watching what I must now describe as the most disgusting films I have ever had the displeasure to stomach. The film is Hannibal, starring Anthony Hopkins, Julianna Moore, Gary Oldman and Ray Liotta. Beware of spoilers in this entry.With little plot, one must question the mind of David Mamet, who wrote the screenplay. I have read the reviews of the film. Some attempt to justify the violence and threadbare storyline by the declarations of fine acting. Personally, I thought that it should have received an X rating. There are films which contain violence--decapitations, dismemberments, shootings--but they were films where the viewer was able to distance himself somewhat from the screen. In Hannibal, the portrayals are all too real and that is where I have a problem. Anthony Hopkins has prostituted himself too much in this film. Personally, really, truly, honestly, I think that the writer, director, producer and principle actors should have spent some time in gaol time for having expressed themselves in this film without proper warnings to the public. Yes, I think that Anthony Hopkins, Julianna Moore, Gary Oldman, Ray Liotta, David Mamet and a few other choice individuals should havn been ordered to spend some quality time with Robert Downey, Jr. and Christian Slater and Ben Affleck, not because they made or participated in this high budget piece of trash, but because, even with an R-rating, children were able to view all of the harrowing scene and have indelibly impressed on their minds a man cutting off his own face and feeding it to his dogs, Gary Oldman's intestines being spilled, three men being eaten alive by wild boar and Ray Liotta's skull cap being surgically removed so that Anthony Hopkins can scoop out sections of his brain, stir fry them, then feed them back to Liotta, who apparently is already suffering from a severe shortage for agreeing to do this film. I had to stop the dvd several times to watch it. I was hoping for some redeeming moments, but it only grew worse. If I had children and given a choice, I would unquestionably opt for them to watch virtually any mainstream hardcore porn flick instead of this one. I do not object to anyone's rights to make such a film, but to distribute it as merely a sequel to Silence of the Lambs is criminal.Forgive me whilst I throw up</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 2 hour long gross-fest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts out with a drug bust gone wrong, resulting in Clarice Starling gunning down five scumbags in a fish market, and ends with Hannibal "Stumpy" Lecter feeding human brains to a small child on an airplane. In between there's disembowelings, slit throats, a faceless pedophile (he got that way by peeling it off, at Hannibal's suggestion, and feeding it to his dog), hands being chopped off, people having their brains eaten while they're still alive, and much more to delight any true fan of blood &amp; guts. There's little effort at subtlety here, if it's disgusting, it's in there. Does this film make a worthy successor to "Silence of the Lambs"? Not a chance. At best it rates maybe 5 out of 10, and that's being mighty generous.Still, one can't really fault Ridley Scott or the cast. They did the best they could with the mess they were given in the form of Thomas Harris's novel of the same name. The truth is, "Lambs" was the sort of story that was ill suited to a sequel of any kind. Like "Casablanca", it ended on a perfect note, and any effort to revisit the principal characters later in their lives was bound to be a big disappointment. Adding all the gross parts seemed to be a smokescreen to hide the fact that the plot and characters in "Hannibal" just don't work very well. It's easy to see why Jodie Foster refused to have anything to do with this production. Although Hopkins does a decent job playing Hannibal, his performance is nowhere near as mesmerizing and menacing as in "Lambs". Perhaps that's because he and his character are ten years older, and it shows. The Hannibal of "Lambs" looked lean, mean, and very fit, whereas in this movie he looks like he's about ready to retire to his rocking chair and start collecting his Social Security checks. Julianne Moore is OK, but is just no substitute for the original. But mostly the problem is that the story is just nowhere near as gripping, no matter who starred or directed. Methinks Messr's Harris, Scott, and Hopkins would have been best served by simply letting Hannibal slip away into the mist at the end of "Lambs" and left his future wanderings to our imaginations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not bother with a summary analysis of the film's elements, as I'm sure those can be seen elsewhere. Rather, I would like to discuss the movie in its DVD format. For those of you who have already made the purchase, you may notice several scenes in which frames have been removed, particularly the "dinner" scene towards the end. And no, these frames are not recovered in the special features. I find it disconcerting, yet hauntingly familiar that Scott, or whoever was in charge of the editing process, would alter the movie from its theatrical release just to save...time? Money perhaps? This isn't the first movie to undergo a bit of scraping around the edges as it is transferred from the big screen to the little one. I am disappointed to see that Scott would allow this. Ah well...the extra/alternate scenes do provide the viewer with a more complete picture of Lecter's ties to Starling, though Scott does stray a bit in his storyboard-to-shot comparisons. All in all a well-composed DVD and well worth the purchase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaking the Silence, not Imitating It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Silence of the Lambs was a masterpiece. I was delighted to hear that the sequel was going to be put into the capable hands of Ridley Scott, one of the greatest directors of the late 20th century. It was also a joy to hear that Hopkins would reprise his role as Hannibal, but it was a great disappointment learning that Jodie Foster won't return.Comparing Hannibal to Silence of the Lambs is a mistake that many people make. As Scott himself puts it, Hannibal is more of a sequel to the characters of SotL, not a sequel to the film itself. Hannibal introduces new things that Silence left untouched. To many people, this change makes Hannibal unfaithful to the original. In my opinion, the best sequels are the ones that tread new ground. It is probably due to the rarity of these sequels that a series original is always quoted as being the best.Anyway, Julianne Moore does a great job of bringing Starling back. I'm glad that they could find a suitable actress to replace Foster. Hopkins as expected, is a joy to watch from start to finish, he dominates every scene he's in with the same fashion that made him so great in SotL. The rest of the cast were very strong too. I was a little disappointed that Gary Oldman's unique talent of portraying bad guys was wasted on an unrecognisable guy in a rubber mask, but that was a minor setback.Yes, the film is quite gory. Gore doesn't offend me much, but one scene near the end was quite hard to stomach (more on that later). The film was quite a tense affair, despite the large manhunt, Hannibal keeps his cool and allows us to do all the sweating. Ridley certainly brought a few directional techniques from his previous movie, Gladiator. There were lots of slow downs and camera effects that Gladiator fans should feel at home with. And as usual, Hans Zimmer provides a great soundtrack.***The following paragraph contains SPOILERS!!***The one part of the movie that left an ugly taste in my mouth was the dinner scene near the end. It seemed unrealistic for Paul to remain alive, let alone conscious, with the top of his head sliced off and his brain exposed. Since my first viewing it has come to my attention that this is possible. Exposing the brain obviously doesn't kill people, otherwise we wouldn't have brain surgery. Paul manages to stay conscious because of the heavy dose of morphine that Hannibal pumped into him, if it weren't for this, Paul would have most likely died of shock, or would have at least fainted. However, this evidence still doesn't help much. The scene still feels way too unsubtle and exposed to deserve a part in this film.Apart from the inconvinience mentioned in the above paragraph. Hannibal is still a solid modern thriller, try not to compare to SotL, and you're in for a treat. It is probably one of Ridley Scott's worst efforts, but it still has plenty of entertainment value. Rating: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Show me the guts, the gore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hype generated for this film would lead one to believe we were going to view scene after scene of the cannibal Dr. Lecter spilling the innards of one gut filled victim after another. I sat through the entire feature waiting for something to happen. Something interesting or shocking. There was no payoff. I'll admit the ending gave me a good laugh. Ray Liota was absolutely awful in this film, but the final scene shows us that he actually does have a brain.The shoot-out toward the beginning - that woke me up a little bit. And I thought it was interesting that Barney (the dungeon orderly from 'Silence of the Lambs') claimed that all of Lecter's cell items were thrown away, when actually Barney was selling the items on eBay as serial killer paraphernalia (good for him.) Julianne Moore was quite good as Clarice Starling. Her portrayal calculated and intelligent--much better than Jody Foster's Starling from the previous film.I was not shocked by this film. There are about 3 seconds of gore in the film, and those 3 seconds are pretty light. There are about 3 seconds of psychological thrill, and about 3 more seconds of action. For the rest of the film we see a guy who is horribly disfigured due to cutting off his own face, zipping around on his electric wheel chair.</fullReview>

I read the book, too, which fed my interest. But let me tell you folks, this one was *bad*...The whole production quality is terrible. The script is cheap; it tries to be sophisticated and clever to live up to Ted Tally's "SILENCE" script, but it doesn't. The casting is simply terrible (with the obvious exclusion of Anthony Hopkins, whose always exhilerating performance is the sole reason for the *1/2 rating). Julianne Moore tries, but she just can't live up to Jodie Foster's subtle strength and assurance. All other co-stars are, plainly put, a shame.&lt;POSSIBLE SPOILERS&gt; One thing that bothered me was how Mason Verger was made out to be some sort of gerbil. His face was skinned, but that doesn't cause his face to be lop-sided and distorted, or his hands to be gnarly and his body limber and elderly. Why oh why they felt they had to do that, is beyond me. Just to get a few whimpers out of the audience? It came off as very desperate to me. &lt;END OF SPOILERS&gt;I am repulsed by Ridley Scott and his film crew.</fullReview>

Wanting to see this in theaters so bad seeing how my favorite movie is SotL, but never happened cause well....I was under aged.... I waited months on end waiting to buy this movie. Yesterday, I went to buy it and no one in this town had the VHS version and I dont own a DVD player. Well, I was kinda mad about that however the rentle store across the road from the mall and there it was for rent. When me and my friend got back to his house, popped it in and BAM! Faulty tape! Just great! We waited for a half an hour, when his mom came home and took us back to get a new tape. We got dinner at Burger King, came back popped it in and there was the MGM logo. And from there on out, it was worth the wait. The beginning scene with Barney and Mason to the last scene with Hannibal in the plane.... It was soooo damn good. Worse movie of 2001? NO CHANCE! It blows all the summer 'blockbuster' out of the water by far, and I loved Planet of the Apes...but it can't compare to Hannibal.Anthony Hopkins once more takes on the role for Hannibal and of course, he did it great. Julianne Moore was superb as Clarice, a matter of fact... I enjoyed her more than Foster. Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) I thought was to look like a high class muppet or something. When i put a mental picture of him when reading some of the book, I just wondered how they could do it in the movie, and how they did it in the movie was fantastic. The character, though a pervert, was awesome and just simply sick. I am also a fan of the ending. Sure it aint like the book and the book ending is just as shockingly cool as the movies ending.****SPOILER!****SPOILER!****When you see Hannibal in the plane with the asian child, it felt weird to me. How he can seem so nice, yet do something so evil is just....wow.... Its weird. The kid has just did a cannibalistic act, without even knowing and the ending fade on Lecters eye was creepy to me.****END SPOILER!****END SPOILER!****This movie in so many wayz is at work of art. Also, from what I read from the IMDB user comments for this movie, I was thinking total gore fest. And you know what, it wasnt. 80's slasher films are more scarier than this. Want a scare? Rent Texas Chainsaw Massacre! Though cheesie, the concept really makes you think. Hannibal was just a pleasure. It was witty at times, and incredibly good. Bad Script? Hell no, Ridley Scott did a fine job with this movie. Hannibal stands good as a sequel, and even better on its own. Anyone can be a critic, and some of those 'Anyones' seem to have no idea what they are talking about. Sit down, relax, get some popcorn, and watch the movie. Its entertaining and I recommend it to anyone who is mature enough to handle it. By that I mean, don't sit down with your 8yr old and watch it.... if you do, your kid must have a great grasps on reality, or you are just sick. Enjoy.Rating: straight A, trust me... its "Goodie goodie"</fullReview>

The film is painfully mediocre when it does not feature Anthony Hopkins who is the ONLY thing anyone remembers about the film. What does that tell you?That said, the sequel is much better. HANNIBAL is not a perfect film, but it is not the unforgivable debacle that some people have made it out to be. In my opinion, I think some people went into this wanting to hate it. Anyway, it's a very enjoyable film that features top notch performances from all involved (except for Ray Liotta). There are some very memorable scenes of gore, however, the film is not as gory as it's been made out to be. Julianne Moore is very convincing and much better than Jody Foster. Also, the film, unlike its predecessor, held my attention even when Hopkins wasn't giving a chilling monologue. Anyway, see this for a good time, it doesn't take itself nearly as seriously as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and neither should you.Overall Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new lease of life on DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw "Hannibal" at the cinema in February 2001, I was highly disappointed, I felt the first hour had some depth and good character work, but the plot(s) - especially the Verger storyline were unengaging and slightly predictable.On DVD (and with the added commentaries as a guide), I found the film really took on a second lease of life. Moore was better than I remembered as Clarice Starling, Hopins as deliciously evil as before and Oldman, better, but still not perfect in his role.Maybe I enjoyed the film more, because I had just finished watching "Silence" on DVD - still as thoroughly engaging as I remembered.The only comparison between the two is the strong acting throughout both films. Both films have annoying characters - Dr Chilton in "Silence" and Paul in "Hannibal" - but both have distinct feels to the films, which make you equally identify them as separate films. Hopefully, in time, Ridley WILL make the Director's cut of this film which he claims he won't make, as many of the Deleted Scenes were very good and would have added to the film a lot. Obviously, the thing I most wondered on a repeated viewing is how I would feel about the ending, at the cinema, I absolutely hated it. On DVD, it was......better. Still outrageously stupid, but better than it was on first watch. I would say "Hannibal" is a little bit behind "Silence" on every level, but only slightly. The one thing that "Hannibal" did have over "Silence" was a shocking and powerful soundtrack that is already a classic.So, I say, give it another go if you didn't like it. You might be surprised like I was.9/10Yd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inferior yet thoroughly entertaining film !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A long awaited sequel that was waited upon for ten years will naturally have a level of anticipation that can overshadow the film itself. That is possibly a great way to describe the frenzy surrounding Ridley Scott's follow-up to the 1991 thriller ?Silence of the Lambs'. This time, ?Hannibal' sets itself apart very quickly from the original. Jonathon Demme directed the first Hannibal Lecter outing, which centered around a crazed cannibalistic killer who had the key to finding another crazed killer on the prowl. The first movie centered upon the direct relationship between FBI agent Clarice Starling (then played by Jodie Foster), and Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Demme focused upon this relationship and in a subtle way insinuated towards a mutual sense of admiration between the law enforcer and the law abider. All this meshed up in a psychologically intense, elegant and brilliant film. This time, ?Gladiator' director Ridley Scott does what he does best, he delivers a straightforward popcorn flick, which lacks both the intensity and the psychological disturbance within one's mind that the first movie caused. Scott abandons any style of a psychological film and imposes the film upon us in a truly elegant manner in which the film creeps up on us, but nowhere near the way in which the first one did.  This ultimately leads me to wonder if Scott intentionally envisioned this style. He probably knew he could not make a film superior to its original, and therefore brought the film his way. Elegant, classy and well crafted, yet lacked the substance to truly make it a terrifying piece of fiction. ?Hannibal' is not a scary, nor terrifying film. Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as the crazed killer obsessed with FBI agent Starling, here played with Julianne Moore. Bar none, Hopkins is terrific. He IS Hannibal. As he preys upon his victims, his soothing voice caresses the scene, extracting that sub-lime genre of the conventional ?slasher', catapulting him into the area of a classy, well-educated killer, which seems to have a purpose in killing his victims. Yet, Julianne Moore will be the focus of the film as she takes over from Foster. Yet, do not be alarmed, she is merely a secondary character who takes a backseat to all the events catered around Hannibal. The film is well done. Scott will probably disappoint the die-hard fans of the first who expect a psychologically intense film that will stay with fans long after the film is over, such as the first one. But, it is a fun film. Seeing Hopkins bite into his character is well worth the price of admission all in itself. This truly proves what a great actor he is. Furthermore, as we track Hannibal in Italy where he is in seclusion, during that time the film maintains a touch of brilliance and class as we discover that he realizes something is wrong. The characters in this film are fun, Gary Oldman plays Mason Verger, a hideously disfigured man who was a victim that escaped Hannibal's grasp, and trust me, the make-up that Oldman endures for the film will make no one eat pop-corn in the theatre. Ray Liotta also stars and Giancarlo Giannini does an incredible piece at playing an Italian detective who is troubled by Hannibal's presence. This film is well-done, fun to watch yet in no way as great as the original. And I believe it has something to do with the fact of the settings. The first half is mostly set in Italy creating a sense of elegance, and Hopkins is brilliant as he is a subtle simple man living in Italy. Yet, when the movie sets itself for the final 40 minutes, this is where it comes apart becoming clichéd, somewhat ludicrous as you will see in the climax and whereby it gives in to the Hollywood norm of blood, a few attempted chills and a disappointing ending.See it for yourself, and then you will understand. Despite all these flaws, you will still manage to have a great time, this movie is fun, and it seems as if it Scott wanted it that way. He crafts a pretty good film, intentionally drawing away from the first one, but the dip in the film after it leaves Italy results in a disappointing climax that will leave audiences somewhat with their stomachs upside-down. But hey, it is Hannibal ?The Cannibal' after all. In the end, a good film, but unfortunately does not try to set itself apart from other conformist thrillers, resulting in the audience leaving the theatre perhaps wanting more, yet at the same time asking why?Giancarlo's Rating: **1/2 (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, I was completely satisfied with this film. There were hardly any flaws in the storytelling and all the actors did very well. I liked the way this was a story in its own, not really a sequel, and had a completely different style from THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. There was some truly beautiful photography in the Florence scenes and excellent, classical music to go with it. But what really kept me watching were the wonderful actors, Hopkins, Moore, Oldman, Giannini. I've never read the novel but the screenplay really kept me interested. The plot is a little weird and twisted, but it's what you've got to expect from a movie about Hannibal Lecter. But now I'm gonna stop writing, just see this movie and don't try to compare it to SILENCE (just enjoy it), it's totally different!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal joins the long line of movies released in 2001 you just should not see. I still regret that I spent my money at the cinema for this below average film. It simply has nothing of the prequel´s appeal. Lecter being some kind of well educated "gentleman" killer who loves art, books and music in "Silence of the lambs" has nothing left of this "elegance" in "Hannibal". The very special atmosphere from the first part which was mainly created by NOT showing too many scenes of violence is totally destroyed in this movie. Not only are the bloody actions of Hannibal Lecter shown en détail but they also seem mostly "unnecessary" and not quite fitting (when you´ve seen "Silence of the lambs"). The "Ray Liotta"-scene from the end was completely "out of bounds" and quite ridiculous. Moreover the producers might have thought that there would be no need of a sensible storyline if they had Anthony Hopkins playing. Let´s hope there is no third film in development.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lecter Inspector</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody's favourite psychopath is back in his third outing; `Hannibal' shifts the focus away from Agent Starling onto the undoubted star of the series, Dr. Lecter, as played once again, with creepy relish, by Antony Hopkins.Set seven years after the events of `Silence of the Lambs', FBI agent Clarice Starling, now played by Julianne Moore, is publicly disgraced for her part in a bungled bust that leaves six people dead. Being the criminal supergenius that he is, Lecter has cleverly disguised himself (a hat) and set up a new life in Florence as the scholar Dr. Fell. Inspector Pazzi has been assigned to investigate the mysterious disappearance of the curator of the Palazzo Capponi (a job Fell is now lobbying for.) Pazzi recognises Fell for who he really is and sets out alone to capture and deliver him to Mason Verger, multi-millionaire victim of Lecter, who has his own sinister plans for his mutilator.Convoluted? Maybe. `Hannibal' is deeply flawed; Julianne Moore's portrayal of Starling doesn't have the depth that Jodie Foster brought to the role and the film does tend to rely upon (admittedly inventive) gore splattered set-pieces. The somewhat disturbing love, Lecter has developed for Starling does bring traces of humanity to his character. But this depth also prevents him from being the monster that captivated audiences in `Silence of the Lambs.'Overall though, this one of those rare occasions where the film is far more satisfying than the book. Thomas Harris' novel bludgeoned the reader with literary pretensions that constantly attempted to convince you that it was so much more than the airport lounge pulp it was racked alongside. The screenwriters David Mamet and Steve Zaillian have successfully pared down Harris' original story to create a fairly fast-moving thriller from what is essentially a rambling and self-indulgent book.Ridley Scott's typically lush visuals and sumptuous production values create a look that is refreshingly different to the previous Lecter films. Whereas, Moore's Starling is rather flat and boring, this is made up for by the Hopkins' gleeful Lecter and his equally perverse nemesis played by an unrecognisable Gary Oldman.Though flawed, this film does deserve attention, it won't receive the awards of it's predecessor, but it will remain with you. The film has received fairly minimal marketing - it doesn't need it, because this film will be talked about. A lot. I recommend you go and see it yourselves before its gruesome secrets and sick postscript become public knowledge. Do beware, this film contains material that would never be seen in a mainstream Hollywood even five years ago, this probably says more about our society than any questions the film opens in itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Silence' and 'Hannibal': Two Brain Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Silence of the Lambs", the film that preceded this film starred Jodie Foster as "Clarice Starling" and Anthony Hopkins as "Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter" in Academy Award winning roles. "Hannibal" stars Julianne Moore as "Clarice Starling" and Anthony Hopkins back from Silence as "Dr. Lecter", the title character. As I write this, there haven't been any awards given to "Hannibal" nor award nominations so any future readers, bear with me. First off, "Silence" is a good film from many standpoints. Story, acting, direction are all excellent. Unfortunately, "Silence" suffers "age-wise". As time goes by more and more viewers should realize what a negative effect time has had on this film. From the technical facilities, hairstyles, even the character's idealisms become outdated. I suppose we should wait and see what will become of this film 50 years from now. Still, no one can deny the marvelous work done by all involved in this film. The sequel definitely had big footsteps to follow. "Hannibal" (even though many try to deny) is truly horribly done. The blame really must go to the director. Ridley Scott, who directed "Thelma &amp; Louise" has forgotten what was good about his earlier films. Myself, not being a fan of his, saw some great things in his direction of "Blade Runner" and "Alien". Maybe, he wasn't responsible for those films after all. With "Gladiator", "Hannibal" is a capsule of his 'money-making' best but his 'creative' worst. There are enough plot holes, one-dimensional characters and confusing editing to annoy the most patient viewers of this film. *POSSIBLE SPOILER*While "Silence" lets you use your brain, "Hannibal" shows theirs and eats them. Uninvolving and plotless (A 'Psychological Thriller' without a plot?), it eventually become annoying. Showing off does not make for a good show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of COURSE it wasn't as good as the sequel, what did you expect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously, as the sequel to a stunning Best Picture winner, Hannibal has a lot to live up to. In it's defense, the movie takes up that task with fervor and skill. Anthony Hopkins, as is to have been expecting, delivers another spectacular performance in one of his most memorable roles, Gary Oldman portrays Mason Verger, the film's unfortunate protagonist, with appreciable malice and non-appeal, and even Julianne Moore manages to successfully fill the shoes of Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling. The Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest thrillers ever made, in my opinion, so I was dedicated to that film's performers when I walked in to see Hannibal, and I was still impressed with how well Julianne Moore performed for the role.The magnitude Anthony Hopkins's performance, as a matter of fact, is accented by the character of Hannibal as he is seen throughout the three films in which the character can be found. In Manhunter (the mediocre film based on Thomas Harris's spectacular novel, Red Dragon), Hannibal is little more than an interesting extra with a few spoken lines. He helps Will Graham along periodically in his efforts to catch the troubled `Tooth Fairy,' but he is little more than a side character in the film. In The Silence of the Lambs, Dr. Lecter plays much the same role, helping Clarice Starling this time as she hunts down a man who kills large women and takes their skins. There can be no mistake about Hannibal's magnified presence in The Silence of the Lambs as compared to Manhunter, and then this year they come out with a film based entirely on his character, and they do, in fact, name the film after him. Do you think Harris would have written a novel based on the character if Brian Cox had played Dr. Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs? I can't help doubting it. The story of Hannibal follows the now-disgraced Starling (due to a publicized FBI raid that was easily manipulated to make Starling look bad), as she travels Europe in pursuit of the evasive Dr. Lecter. After his escape in The Silence of the Lambs, he traveled to Italy to hide, but even more, so that he could pursue his vastly intellectual interests. Hannibal is unmistakably gorier than The Silence of the Lambs, but that's clearly because the film follows Hannibal Lecter as its main character. In previous films, we mainly only heard stories through the dialogue of Dr. Lecter's crimes, but here we actually see them. You can't really hold this against the film as gratuitous violence, because it is a movie about the character that was so popular back in 1991. They're just giving us more of what we want and I, for one, thank them for it. One of the most important things about movies that are made from novels is how faithful it remains to the original work. Movies like The Green Mile and Stand By Me are incredibly faithful, and with excellent results, and Hannibal also remains faithful to the original novel in the most important places. The story is necessarily condensed for the film version, but the film does not take giant liberties from the text, which is something that is sometimes done and almost always deteriorates the quality of the story. This type of destructive behavior can be seen in Manhunter, for one example, and also in classics (who would think they had any right to change these?) like Jonathan Swift's `Gulliver's Travels' and Mary Shelley's `Frankenstein.'The one part where Hannibal deviated from the novel most noticeably was the ending. Many people (including myself) were disappointed that the film ended in almost exactly the same way that The Silence of the Lambs ended, but you should have seen the ridiculous ending that Thomas Harris put in the book! What a mess! The movie may not have had the best ending in the world, but it's all uphill from the pitfall that can be found at the end of Harris's novel. For the most part, Thomas Harris has brought us an interesting story for Hannibal, and the film succeeds on most levels in delivering it to (unfortunately) the vast majority of the public ? meaning the people who will never bother to read the book. It's amazing how well they managed to switch the roles of protagonist and antagonist here. We find ourselves rooting for the ?bad' guy (Hannibal, who has horribly murdered several people), and hoping that he will kill the ?good' guy, who is one of Hannibal's previous victims, but who now plans to viciously murder Hannibal for revenge. Sure, the movie may have seemed excessively gory or unpleasant at times, but that's what kind of movie it is, all of that stuff fits with the story and the characters. We're dealing with a pure sociopath as the film's protagonist, so obviously there is going to be some violence. It is no secret that Hannibal is not on the same level with The Silence of the Lambs, but that is to be expected. But despite all of the astronomical expectations and other odds against it, Hannibal manages to be a very good thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a pretty big mess of a movie, but it is worth the money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very much looking forward to Hannibal. I started to read the book, but unfortunately, I never got past the first few pages. I just put it down and for some reason I never picked it back up. Oh well. I loved The Silence of the Lambs. I think that Anthony Hopkins portrayed pure evil. Really, I have never seen pure evil on screen. Just looking at him in that movie made me shudder. Not to mention that Ridley Scott directed it. He's not one of my favorite directors, but he does show some potential. I thought that the movie wouldn't be as good as the last, but I thought it would be better than this.First of all, Hannibal is beautiful. It's a shame this wasn't nominated for Best Cinematography. I swear, this is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Kudos to who ever is responsible.Second, Julianne Moore is, in my opinion, better at playing Starling than Jodie Foster. I love Foster. She's one of the best actresses out there. But her fake Southern accent always bugged me. It just sounds fake. Not `Nicholas Cage in Con Air' fake, but I never thought it sounded right. Being a born and breed Southerner, I can tell a fake accent when I hear one. Moore actually sounds Southern, which helped, not to mention she's a great actress.Third, Anthony Hopkins is good.Fourth, Gary Oldman as Mason Verger is perfect. No one may be able to recognize him, but he does a great job.Now, let me get to the bad stuff. The movie is nothing like Silence for several reasons. The biggest one is that all of the characters have changed. It's ten years later from Silence. Hannibal has ceased to be the creepy psychopath from Silence and has become more of a philosopher. Starling is no longer the idealistic FBI rookie, but is now a worn out veteran. None of this is bad. But, what made Silence of the Lambs so creepy was that Lector was behind bars. He was down right evil. In this movie he is free and he is no longer evil. Well, he is, but he isn't the same kind of psychological evil from Silence.Another bad point of the movie is Ray Liotta. He was good in Heartbreakers (shoot me, I liked it) but he is TERRIBLE in this. Egad.Another bad point is that the movie's ending (I won't give it away) is rather stupid and convenient. This is the second movie I've seen in a row where Anthony Hopkins has cut off his own hand.My finale complant is the editing. I loved Gladiator, but I hated the way it was edited. Well, Ridley Scott does it again. I hate it when directors cut movies real quick with close ups. I like the camera to be further away from ther action and I like long takes. Shoot me, that's the way I like it. Why? Because when they shoot action scenes real fast (or slow motion), with a million cuts for one scene, where the camera is in the action, it's damn hard to see what's going on. Not to mention it's easy to fake. I love action scenes that are one take long where the camera is back far enough so I can see what the hell is happening. That was a problem with Gladiator and that is a problem with Hannibal.In conclusion, Hannibal isn't a bad movie, but it isn't great. Like I said, it's a beautiful film with great sets and gorgeous cinematography. It is not as gross or nasty as some people have made it out to be (but it's still rated R, so why the hell do you parents persist in BRINGING YOUR BABIES WITH YOU! FIND A BABY SITTER OR JUST DON'T COME!). Ridley Scott directed the movie well, but it is horribly edited. The story is rather weak. The movie is worth the money but it does not meet the sheer brilliance of Silence. Silence shocked you mentally. Hannibal tries to shock you with blood and guts. It's still a good movie, though it isn't good enough for me to want to see it again. I did enjoy it, but it left me a little unsatisfied.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER*Lector's mellowed during his ten year break, displaying a sangfroid not seen since Hopkin's butler in 'The Remains Of The Day'. In fact, I thought it WAS the butler in 'The Remains Of The Day'. Lector began the series as a grubby sex pest but has since been upgraded in status to almost a manslaughter on the grounds of provocation case, a morally vexatious idea that is vintage Hollywood.At the start, the cat and mouse game between Lector and the Italian detective threatens to make this a workable thriller, but it doesn't last. The second half is flawed because we know Starling won't be hurt by Lector, therefore there's no choice but to wheel on that tried and trusted chestnut, the mad professor or somebody pulling a lever and yelling "RELEASE THE BATS!" The trouble is, it's pigs. The producer and director of 'Razorback' were faced with a similar stark realisation upon it's completion. Yes, it's great, but I think we've blown it. Who wants to see a film about a giant pig? Or a giant film with medium size pigs? In terms of creating that sensation of mounting terror and impending doom as your throat seizes up and the blood pounds in your ear at that suffocating moment of ultimate horror; the average pig, let's face it, does not cut it. Far from being threatening, the porcine posse are avuncular to the point of serenity. Some watch television in the living room with their owners. In California you can probably marry one. But SCARE anyone, in a 'this is supposed to be a horror film' kind of way? Clarice would probably be content keeping one in her office as a mascot, not least because she can't seem to find a suitable man. (What's the difference? They cry in unison.) Perhaps pigs on motorbikes may have been more frightening as there's always the off chance they'll run over your toes.The last scene and line in the film sent up a barely disguised sigh of disgust in the auditorium I was in. Have the lambs finally being silenced even as the cash tills ring? Are we actually going to question why we're all sitting here? Are these the most nauseating scenes ever to grace a multi-million dollar mainstream studio picture? What does mainstream mean anymore, one with a gourmet meal of cannibalism and child abuse? 'Our new air of authority, our sentinel of misery' as a punk priestess once so presciently sung. In Hollywood, where there's a swill, there's a way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So kill me - I enjoyed it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can, however, understand the almost universally negative press for this film. Hannibal is a movie made to be enjoyed rather than admired. It's briskly paced, meanders back and forth, requires an incredible suspension of disbelief, yet is so much fun it's scary. Or is it the other way around?This film's predecessor, the acclaimed Silence of the Lambs, is the opposite of Hannibal in that it is a movie made to be admired more than enjoyed. And admire it I did, but I did not particularly enjoy it. I am unfortunately part of a generation greatly desensitized towards violence and gore, so the film did not even begin to scare me (which is ironic, considering both Angela's Ashes and Sleepers, two films not intended as horrors, did scare me), and I wasn't particularly impressed by the formulaic ending, most likely because it has been duplicated to no end in countless B movies.Hannibal was a refreshing change of pace, a Hollywood blockbuster that's actually fun, a rarity in the days of mindless trash like Armageddon. Gary Oldman just sits back and has a good time playing his character, the villain of the piece, for laughs, and Julianne Moore is unexpectantly good in playing a slightly older version of Jodie Foster's naive Clarice Starling. Ray Liotta is hilarious in his first successful comedy role (though it generally isn't meant as such), and Anthony Hopkins delivers a deliciously over the top performance as Hannibal.The locations, especially those in Italy, are stunning and beautifully shot, and director Ridley Scott thankfully doesn't take the material seriously. I'm surprised that there hasn't been more spoofs of this film, as the material seems perfect to take a few shots at. I did my own spoof of the film that fared incredibly well, and I know that Dr. Dolittle 2 had a scene which spoofed it, but that's it, to my knowledge at least.Bottom line: You could do a lot worse, this is good material if you're looking for a mindless thriller7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was quite fascinated when seeing Silence of The Lambs. However, when I read the book Hannibal, I started doubting whether a sequel was such a good idea. When seeing Hannibal in the theatre, I understood why Jodie Foster refused to act in the sequel. The change in character between agent Starling in The Silence of The Lambs and Hannibal is just to drastic to be believable, and this breaks the power of the new movie. I was again very impressed by the acting of Anthony Hopkins, though, which clearly saved the movie.</fullReview>

Moore as Clarice Sterling was surprisingly VERY good. There was also great directing and scenery.The movie has a relatively slow pace. In this one, Lecter has escaped to Italy. Meanwhile there is a diabolicle disfigured man who is out to get Lecter for leaving him in his current disfigured self. Detective Sterling gets involved in the case, and another cat and mouse game with Lecter ensues for a second time.There are some flaws to the movie. Too much emphasis on gore and rather abrupt ending, but overall the feeling of adrenaline between Lecter and Sterling is still there. On par with the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having escaped from the FBI in The Silence of the Lambs, Dr. Hannibal Lecter is now in Florence, Italy, with a new identity, studying art and living a good life.Disgraced cop Clarice Starling is being pursued by a vain and cruel colleague,Agent Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta); and her career is in the middle of a downfall thanks to her gung-ho tactics on a narcotics case.Mason Verger (Gary Oldman)is the deformed multi millionaire who wants revenge over Hannibal (he is the sole survivor of the crazed psycho,but ended up with his hole face destroyed),and to do so, he is willing to use Clarice and Agent Krendler in order to track down the doctor.Verger's greatest wish in life is to see his wild geneticly changed animals eating the crap out of Lecter.This sequence to the highly acclaimed Silence of the Lambs has its moments. The movie is visually stunning: powerful imagery and breathtaking camera movements are all around the film, but it lacks a little bit of action and rhythm in some parts, specially in the beginning and in the scenes involving Starling."Hannibal" gets on track when it shows Mason's guys and a detective hunting down Dr. Lecter in Florence. The director, however, brought the suspense and tension from the book by Thomas Harris to life, creating memorable scenes that won't be easily forgot, specially the ending. The acting is outstanding, specially from Gary Oldman, who should win an Academy Award Nomination as Best Supporting Actor, his portrait of Mason Verger won't get out of your head for days. All in all, Hannibal is a nice thriller and definitively a must-have for DVD owners.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's begin by saying that The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite movie of all time. That said, I was kind of upset by the fact that a sequel was being made. (I'd appreciate no one pointing out that Lambs was a sequel to Manhunter and destroying my fantastical world I've built up for myself) So I set out to find a reason why it would be horrible. First, Jonathan Demme wasn't returning to direct; that's it! It couldn't possibly be good, right? Oh, but Ridley Scott is going to do it...DAMN! Well, Ted Tally isn't going to adapt the book; that must be it. Alright, they got David Mamet...DOUBLE DAMN! Now while Anthony Hopkins is coming back to play Lecter, Jodie Foster isn't going to play Clarice; that's the end all-be all of reasons why this movie shouldn't be made, right? Especially considering the list of replacements they were talking about. I read about Sarah Michelle Gellar and Gillian Anderson. Two actresses that I like, but certainly couldn't play Clarice Starling. Then, out of nowhere, they dropped the bomb on me. Julianne Moore... [unbelievably foul expletive deleted].So going in I had some really high expectations for Julianne Moore. And all I can say is that she surpassed them all beautifully. Jodie Foster was great, but given that she was not going to play Starling again, we move on. And there is absolutely no one who could have done any better than the incredible Julianne Moore. Then I found out that my favorite actor was also going to be in it, Gary Oldman.Now, given that the performances, directing, and screenwriting were all top notch, we move on to whether the movie would be good or not. We can not let ourselves forget that you can get all the great actors you want together and it still isn't necessarily going to be any good (ie. Copland). When you love a movie as much as I love The Silence of the Lambs and you've seen it as many times as I have, you can't help but wonder what happens next. And that's all I wanted to see this movie as. These two characters (I suppose 3, if you count Barney) were so well developed in Lambs that, had they never crossed paths again, I would have been content watching them live out their days separately with nothing of consequence happening. That being said, the movie was much more than simply what happened next.A complete departure from The Silence of the Lambs was necessary and that's just what they did. It's a different kind of movie; one filled with not just disturbing images, but situations as well. Without Tak Fujimoto's cinematography, the movie has more of a straight-forward presentation of events to it. This gives it a very unsettling tone in certain parts. I really did like this movie. While you can't really say whether it was better than the first or not because they were different types of films, I suppose I can say that I enjoyed this one a lot more than I expected to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To the people who say it is nothing to the original that is because they are two diffrent kinds of movie. To the people who say it has no plot it has sorta the same as the original. Silence - FBI gets Hannibal to help catch killer and he has his own agenda. Hannibal - Mason helps the FBI to catch Hannibal but has his own agenda. With diffrent subplots of course but they are the same thing. To those who think it was no good without Jodie Foster and Julianne Was no good. I can't change your mind but din't diss Julianne she did a awesome job also just a diffrent kind. To those who insulted Ray Liotta. He did his job good he just had a bad part.My opinion it was a better made film not a better one than Silence. Better directed, edited, and acted. It deserves two Oscars for sure. Best director and Best supporting actor The man who played the sleazy detective. Awesome job by all but he was phenominal.Grade - 82</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge Thomas Harris fan. I was leary when i first heard that Jodie Foster was going to play Clarice Starling, but she was masterful at it. Then, when I heard that Julianne Moore was going to take the mantle, I was disappointed, but nevertheless enthusiastic.It would be an understatement to say that I was not satisfied with the movie. Going into the theater, I was curious as to how Ridley Scott was going to portray the deep characterization of the novel since the majority of the plot explanation took place inside the ironic order of Lector's perfectly chaotic mind. As it turns out, the matter was handled though being ignored completely.Comparing this film to it's predecessor, The Silence of the Lambs, is not fair. The Jodie Foster incarnation was a great screen adaption of an incredible novel, while Hannibal was more of weak attempt at making a two hour long story out of a character sketch.After contemplating my dissatisfaction, I realized that I was being unfair. It is not common for a film to accurately portray a complex novel plot. I began to think of Hannibal as a movie without using my base knowledge of the book and was not as upset with the performance. Anthony Hopkins, though absurd at times, is his usual stellar self and Julianne Moore and Ray Liotta were unexpectedly good.One last note: if anyone who has yet to read the novel wonders what exactly Inspector Pazzi and his wife were like, they will be pleased to hear that Giancarlo Giannini and Francesca Neri were flawlessly cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lacking the wit, verve and panache of Demme's original, this gruesome follow-up falls short on several counts. Without the character's surprise element, Lecter becomes just another monster, though the audience is encouraged to root for him as the movie progresses, and Oldman the victim becomes the bad guy. Excellent though Julianne Moore is, she can't eclipse memories of Jodie Foster, and she is sidelined for great chunks of the film, which is a shame. Giancarlo Giannini's role is played out very predictably, and this rugged, impressive actor is not given justice to his talents. And, frankly, when the movie runs out of ideas, it ups the gore quotient (especially in the particularly emetic dinner sequence, which seems to be played at a slow pace deliberately to have the viewers vomiting in the aisles). Mamet's influence on the script is obvious in places, but you have to hunt for it the rest of the time, and can one really believe that these same talents were behind the masterpieces of The Spanish Prisoner, Thelma and Louise and Schindler's List? Oh, please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly, Hannibal merely lingers above mediocrity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would think that with the combination of a fantastic director like Ridley Scott, stellar screenwriters like David Mamet and Steven Zaillian, and astounding actors like Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore; that you would have one of the greatest films ever made. Well Hannibal is, disappointedly, far from it. Scott's normally masterful, stylistic direction is quite irregular in Hannibal. Some scenes carry his wonderful flare and others definitely do not. Steven Zaillian and David Mamet's screenplay is not what you would come to expect from the men who wrote Schindler's List and The Untouchables. Like Scott's direction, the screenplay is quite uneven in quality. I think they had a little too much fun with some of the characters. There are some very awkward lines of dialogue. The pacing isn't the greatest either. After the opening shoot-out, the film takes a while to get going again. Anthony Hopkins gives a solid performance as well as Julianne Moore but I couldn't help but miss Jodie Foster. Gary Oldman delivers an unnecessarily over-the-top performance and comes off as being quite annoying sometimes, as the disturbed Mason Verger. Giancarlo Giannini does deliver a great performance and probably the film's best as the sleazy Italian detective, Rinaldo Pazzi. Some of the films highlights are John Mathieson's sharp and atmospheric cinematography and Han Zimmer's wonderful, haunting musical score.Hannibal could have been worse but it could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Screaming of the Hams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?I'm having an old friend for dinner.' It seems as if Dr. Lector should have eaten alone. Sometimes sequels are merited and sometimes classics should be left intact. ?The Silence of the Lambs' was screaming out for a second installment, but when Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster turned their noses up at Thomas Harris' novel alarm bells should have started ringing.The film which takes place a decade after the original sees Hannibal running riot in Florence while Clarice licks her wounds as a disgraced FBI agent back in America. One thing leads to another, and before you know it Lector is once again being pursued by a bunch of crooked cops, and wide eyed Feds. Throw in a few subplots concerning victims bent on revenge, man eating pigs, and other absurd diversions and there lies the essence of this mess of a movie.The problem with ?Hannibal' is that it had a hard act to follow. The fact that it didn't make the slightest effort to hold a torch to its predecessor makes matters far worse. Anthony Hopkins exudes none of the charm or terror that made his character in the first film into a cultural icon. Julianne Moore is cold and unsympathetic, lacking all the cunning and vulnerability of Foster's Clarice. For the screen's greatest bad guy to be reduced to the role of a clown in this freak show is a sad reflection on Ridley Scott's talents, but judging by what he had to work with it seems as if the blame doesn't rest solely with him. The original novel on which the script was based was just deplorably bad and after that everything was going to fall apart.On its own terms ?Hannibal' is neither thrilling, funny, or dramatic, and it is riddled with flat performances. When viewed in the light of its predecessor it is an abysmal mess. Hopkins is just a shadow of his former self, and Moore simply doesn't have the presence of Jodie Foster. But at the end, one inescapable remains: Lector was infinitely more terrifying when he was behind bars. Let the cannibal out of the bag and the suspense goes with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What it's really about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thomas Harris spent twenty years crafting the Hannibal trilogy, and stuck to his guns even after Demme sent his project on a sideways trajectory. Silence was a very good police procedural thriller but it was a shallow adaptation of the second chapter of a complex trilogy that examined the ugliness and triumph of human existence. The film Hannibal honored the secret level or subtext that Harris has illuded to interviews. Confused? Let's review. A few selections from the dictionary. Hannibal: grace of God. lecter: a reader or lecturer. monster: a marvel- from monstrum, meaning divine omen. Clarice: bright light. Starling: a bird related to the pidgeon and dove, also: a creature who lives in the stars. Dolorhyde: hidden sorrow.Okay, suppose you're a brilliant psychiatrist with a tragic incident in your past involving cannabalism, they ate your younger sister who you tried to protect. You go on with life and go into the healing profession because your survivor guilt compels you to contibute to the world. But because of your doctor's privilege you can't talk about your patients and in a lot of cases you can't cure them of their disturbing evil impulses. This weighs on you. You have no faith in God. Then you meet a brother(Mason) and sister (Margot) in the course of your practice and the violence of their situation triggers your own horrible past. You can't handle the thought of such a beast as Mason getting away with such a betrayal of his own sister. You flip out, people like Mason should go to hell. So you send him there, along with a few other of your choice patients. You are discovered by a policeman (Will Graham) who threatens your existence. You try to kill him. You succeed. But he kills you as well. YOU WAKE UP IN HELL. Locked up in an asylym where everybody believes you to be a serial killer. And because of your interest in medieval studies you recognize that this isn't just any hell, this is Dante's Inferno. Because you were such a great communicator in life, one of your punishments in hell is to be able to communicate only in riddles, anagrams, clues and puzzles. You died with out absolution, as did many of the other people you meet in hell. But because this is Dante's hell you can get out if you use reason, make a decision and act on it. You also don't have to feel bad about killing anybody in hell because they're already dead, they just get recycled and being killed and tortured is part of the circumstances of being in hell. When in Rome do as the Roman's do. When in Hell...Now while your waiting for an opportunity to get out of hell, (and because you're so brilliant you are the only person who realizes they are in hell), you meet a bright light, a girl not yet a woman, who also died without absolution, she's gives you back your faith in God, the touch in Memphis. You help her achieve her goals and advance. And in doing so you make your way out of your imprisonment, you can go to heaven now but you wait in purgatory for her life to descend to such a point that she will be more receptive to your view of this existince and you venture back into hell just to get her out. Now in Harris' book, Lecter succeeds. They make it to heaven together. In the film, Clarice, institutionalized beyond repare and having lost her faith in God can't make the decision and as a result can't get out of hell. In fact she tries to keep Lecter in Hell but he loves her so much he would rather cut off his hand, and leave her his heart in it (that's why there was cleaver, the name of the opera piece is Vide Meum Cor= Behold My Heart). He grabs the boat out of hell, dematerializes into the fireworks (stars) and is ascending to heaven (the plane) where he shares wisdom (the brains) with an innocent ( the little boy). The books followed the Divine Comedy whereas the film ended by following Dante's poem La Vita Nuova (The New Life) because in that poem Love carries off the dead Beatrice (Clarice)Scott and Zaillian brilliantly pulled off this film and kept true to the subtle subtext of Harris novels, which Demme completely left out of Silence. Why is it gory? Because hell is a gory place. What else would you expect from hell? Why is Lecter the hero, cause he's the only person who is sane, that is, aware of the situation and acts accordingly. Why Florence? Because Dante was from Florence. I think it was outstandingly clever and courageous for the filmmakers to toy with the concept that Clarice might be the last villian in the story, she tries to keep Lecter from Heaven even though he's earned the right to go there. This film is like no other. A gory traumatic trip in and out of hell. Romantically tragic. Read the books, one after the other, read The Divine Comedy, (get the Cliff notes). Then see the film again when it comes out on video. `</fullReview>

Anthony Hopkins was just as creepy as ever and this performance was better that his in Silence of the Lambs just because he was out of jail and could have more fun with the role, which I believe he did.

		<shortDescription>Will the real Dr. Lecter please sit down?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> Hannibal is a movie that has a lot going for it, but it ends up being a victim of its own plot.  I find it impossible to not compare Hannibal to Silence of the Lambs. The main characters are the same and the plot relies heavily on what went before. Anthony Hopkins reprises Hannibal Lecter with equal doses of elegance and savagery; unfortunately his old Hannibal cannot be the same guy we met 10 years ago. More on that later.  I'm glad Jodie Foster turned down the role of Clarice Starling. Initially I was rooting for her because I found her so powerful in Silence. But here, Starling basically revisits the previous mix of strong-woman-asserting-herself and the lost-babe-in-the-woods trying to overcome her tragic past. (The scene where she is ordering around the macho police officers is a carbon copy of a similar scene in the first flick. Yawn.) This was already covered in Silence; in Hannibal, we don't get any new psychological development to chew on. A nice colloquy between Starling and Lecter near the end seems to address this, but we don't get any sense of resolution (leaving the door open for Silence 3, perhaps?). I think that if Foster had retained her role, it would have cheapened her performance in Silence.  There is much more action in Hannibal than Silence, but this cannot hide the fact that we don't care about most of the new characters. Mason Verger, an old victim of Lecter, is bent on revenge. But outside of looking like he stuck his head in a Quisenhart, he comes and goes without serving any purpose except to give Lecter something to do. And because he is repulsive both on the outside and inside, we don't care about him. A sleazy FBI agent played by Ray Liotta is not just a bad guy, he is a stereotyped male dunce. The key to having an effective bad guy is to show that while he has faults, they are human faults (as much as we disliked Dr. Chilton in Silence, we could see that he was just a pompous ass). This way our psyches will be wrestling with the contradictions; yes, he is bad, but at the same time we care about him. This creates a more effective and memorable character. When Liotta gets his come-uppance at the end of the film, we can justly laugh at him and forget all about him. And he ends up serving no meaningful purpose.  Giancarlo Giannini plays an Italian cop whom we know is a good man, but who finally succumbs to greed. Outside of him, the landscape is populated by throw-away toughs who show up for a while and are done in. That's another difference between this movie and Silence; in Silence, we cared about all the characters, major and minor. We got to know them a bit and why they did what they did. Even Jame Gumb was a sympathetic character--and it was Lecter who made us feel that way. But no such pains are taken in Hannibal. Now then. The basic problem with this movie is that it is a victim of its own plot. Simply put, Hannibal Lecter moves around! What made him such an effective villain in Silence is that he was trapped, and the only thing that he had available to him was his mind. Which is scarier: being chased by a wild animal, or chased by a madman? All the animal can do is use its instincts and speed. The madman is scarier, because he has intelligence and cunning, and you cannot predict what he will do next. In Hannibal, Lecter has become a wild animal. He walks freely. He goes where he wants to. He can escape not just by using his mind, but by thrusting a knife into your chest. Because of this, he no longer sinister; he has become just another crook on the run. The only time we saw Lecter move freely in Silence was in the last scene; and even then, it was a casual stroll down into a boulevard of people where he slowly disappeared. Making your villain stationary has long been an effective device. A particularly memorable instance was the role of Mrs. Danvers in Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca. Whenever Mrs. Danvers is on screen, she is always standing still. In this way, she became something less than human, something of which to be wary. Lecter loses this quality in Hannibal. I felt the first half of Hannibal was much better than the second. Lecter retains much of his measured elegance in the first half; later on he succumbs to the obligatory guts-and-gore that would seem to violate his own standard of rudeness. Worst of all, the last scene is execrable. Together with the silly fadeout, it's seems no one could think up a decent ending for the film. I think even Hannibal Lecter would have found it objectionable, and deemed the writers to be "free-range rude."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Most People Think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am perhaps the perfect audience for "Hannibal", Ridley Scott's follow-up to "The Silence of the Lambs", the Academy Award-winning 1991 psycho thriller that made fava beans and Chianti the horror menu of choice. I was a fan of Jonathan Demme's "Silence", and greatly admired the performances of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, but while many folks I spoke to seemed to feel that the picture was a transcendant emotional and artistic experience that illuminated heretofore unexplored pockets of their own lives, I just felt like I'd seen a much-better- than-average thriller (I had to wait a few years, for David Fincher's "Seven", for that transformative experience). Therefore, my expectations for "Hannibal" were not as high as everyone else's, and while many audiences were disappointed by the film's inability to live up to its predecessor, I got to just sit back and enjoy what is, though not the equal of "Silence", still a quite solid and engaging thriller. "Hannibal" picks up a few years after the action in "Silence". Clarice Starling, played by Julianne Moore after Foster opted out of the sequel, is still with the FBI, but is currently in disgrace following a botched drug bust. She is languishing in miserable obscurity until approached by Mason Verger, a filthy-rich pedophiliac and the only survivor of an attack by Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter (Hopkins), the insanely brilliant psychiatrist who tormented and tutored Starling through her capture of the psychopathic Buffalo Bill. Verger wants revenge on Lecter, who left him wheelchair-bound and hideously deformed, and wants Starling to help find the mad doctor. Before Starling can find Lecter, however, he is found hiding in Italy by a dissipated cop (Giancarlo Giannini), and when Lecter learns that Starling is back on the case, it becomes a cat-and-mouse game across two continents as Lecter and Starling once again lock horns.None of this material is handled with the probing psychological insight that made "The Silence of the Lambs" such a success. Assuming we already know what we need to about these characters, screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian concentrate instead on simply maintaining a nice fast pace and keeping the gory action set pieces coming. Fortunately, material like this is just the right domain for Ridley Scott, who is able to indulge his curiously disjunctive visual poetry at just the right unexpected moments, and maintains a tone that nicely balances between Gothic tragedy and Grand Guignol slaughterhouse. I'll probably be banned from the site for saying this, but I feel Scott's work here surpasses his helming of "Gladiator", in which is razzle-dazzle pyrotechnics sometimes got in the way of the story and weighed the action down with portentous dollops of doom. There are a few of those weird stutter-quick shots that marred "Gladiator"'s combat sequences, but they seem to fit much better within a modern context. Fortunately, the acting is still of a uniformly high caliber. Julianne Moore is somewhat cheated by the film's screenplay (she spends much of her time sitting behind a desk, waiting to see what Lecter will do next), but she still manages to convey some sharp moments of indignation and anger through the thriller machinations. Mason Verger is a horrible and fascinating creation, and is played with relish by an unbilled actor who knows his way around a villainous role (if you don't already know who portrays Verger, I won't spoil the surprise). Giannini is also quite engaging as the Italian inspector; his hangdog face and weary voice convey a lifetime of horrifying work, and a rich character is drawn where the screenplay has just provided broad strokes.Really, however, this is Anthony Hopkins' picture to make or break, and for the most part, he handles the proceedings with his usual flair. Lecter is a bit more jokey this time around, perhaps a concession to the unexpected folk-hero status bestowed on him by "Silence" fans, and Hopkins' charm and unexpected moments of understatement once again render him surprisingly likable. Still, Lecter is a killer above all else, and there are moments of grisly action that surpass even the graphic face-biting sequence in "Silence". This film has received much flack for its gore (it's part of what kept Foster and "Silence" director Jonathan Demme away from this follow-up), but really, there's nothing worse here than what you'd find in your average direct-to-video slasher flick. It's just served up with a little more zest, and that's probably what bothers folks.Scott is back with most of the same crew from "Gladiator" (costume designer Janty Yates, composer Hans Zimmer), and they acquit themselves strongly all the way around. Special kudos here go to cinematographer John Mathieson, whose work I feel surpasses his lenswork on the Roman epic. His glistening camera's eye makes Italy a land of mysterious shadows and ominously glaring statues, and great images of Lecter walking the age-old streets, coat flapping behind him like Dracula's cape, are truly emblematic, uniting Lecter with his horror-fiend forebears and further solidifying his position as a madman for the ages."Hannibal" is no classic, to be sure. There are moments where not much happens, and the story gets a bit muddled and confusing toward the end. But you know what? "Silence" had some dead-end stuff in it, too, and it made the AFI's Top 100 Films of All Time list. "Hannibal" will never make such a list, but if you're in the mood for a good, slickly polished, strongly acted thriller, you may want to check it out. Free advice, however: if the theatre's snack bar is offering something called "the Ray Liotta Special", just say no. When you see the film, you'll know what I mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good an adaption as could be hoped for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why are so many people slating this movie? Brilliant cinematography, haunting, chilling soundtrack, perfect production design, solid, grand direction, very good performances (except Julianne Moores somewhat mediocre, if underwritten, performance). Anthony Hopkins is brilliant, as always, if his performance in Silence... anchored him in the minds of moviegoers as Hannibal Lecter, this one solidifies it. Comparisons with Silence.. are a bit futile, this is a completely different movie. whereas the first was steeped in claustrophobic atmosphere, this one emphasises freedom, open space and grand scale, something Ridley Scott is pro at, and pulls off to full effect in this film. A final thing: Gary Oldmans performance as the sadistic, horribly scarred, vengeful Verger is one of his finest to date, I think, nearly stealing the spotlight from Hopkins, a truly memorable creepy character, although Oldman allows us to feel a certain measure of sympathy for him (something missing in even the novel). He also utilises the scripts witty black humor best, as subtly as Hopkins does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting sick in the theatre due to the content of this film my bottom!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This really is a highly enjoyable film and I will refrain from comparing it to The Silence of the Lambs for a number of reasons. First of all this film can be watched without having seen ?Silence', second of all I do not remember how I liked ?Silence' and third Jodie Foster has been replaced so that Clarice Starling is now played by Julianne Moore, who I think was very brave to play this character. I mean it is a pretty big risk for an actress to play a character that has previously been played by Jodie Foster. And be honest Jodie Foster was good as Starling. But not only that Julianne Moore was kind of famous and established as an actress before this movie came out. I mean she had (big and small roles) in Box ? office hits and critically acclaimed films, like The Fugitive, The Lost World, Nine Months, Benny &amp; Joon and Boogie Nights. All of which were in my opinion enjoyable (except for The Lost World) plus they showed that she is a good actress. Now taking that job was risky, if she'd spoil the character it would be trouble for her, but chances were she would nail it and that is exactly what she did. After a while you probably will be thinking: ?Jodie Foster or Julianne Moore, who cares?' just like I did. I myself thought she was believable and played her character well.But onto the movie which is, I must add a bit slow paced in the first half, which by the way does not mean it is boring. It is good for a film in which nothing happens. The second half on the contrary is much more eventful and finally has some gore in it. The gore that (so claimed the newspapers here in the Netherlands) made people sick in the theatre in Italy I think. The gory scenes that made theatre owners reschedule the break (yes in the Netherlands there is a break between the first and second half of the movie). The scenes that probably had Julianne Moore taking psychological counseling after the movie (or was it rather the whole theme and setup of the movie?). Well all I can say is blah, blah, blah. These IMPORTANT reports, were in my opinion nothing more than cheap marketing, an alternative to Trailers and Teasers. I mean what gets you interested more in a thriller than the fact that it is even thrilling to the actors, a film that is so gory, people throw up? NOTHING, that's right NOTHING. Well onto the gore, which is I must say pretty gory, but nothing to get sick off. Plus it really is filmed, choreographed and acted in a sublime way (Bravo Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Scott). As I am talking about Anthony Hopkins anyway. I think he did a great job in performing Hannibal Lecter. Another thing that struck me was the incredible mask on Mr. Verger (Gary Oldman) whom I really did not recognize at all. I mean this is a man I've seen in a dozen films or so, but it was also a man who was ?mutilated' beyond any recognition. All in all a good film. I can't wait to see Nr. 3 in the series (please, do not change any of the cast, I rather enjoyed seeing Mrs. Moore in this one).8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Sequel, And A Terrible Film In Its Own Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Hannibal' should serve as proof of why some sequels should never be made -- it's fat, lazy, and content to merely rest on the laurels of the brilliant `Silence of the Lambs', while never bothering to say something original or to add something fresh to the ongoing series. (I'll ignore the fact that `Hannibal' also made a boatload of money, which probably will insure that at least one more crappy sequel will be made at some point.) `Hannibal' was a movie with a lot of expectations to live up to -- and, quite frankly, it failed to live up to any of them.`Hannibal' continues the story of everybody's favorite refined, cultured, psychotic cannibal, Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). A decade after his escape from authorities, he's living comfortably in Italy, teaching art, living a wonderful existence. Not fairing as well is Clarice Starling (played Julianne Moore in `Hannibal') -- she's bearing the responsibility for a failed FBI raid a la Waco, so she's reassigned to the touchy case of Hannibal as a way of making her disappear from the limelight. Also thrown into this mix is a millionaire named Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), one of Hannibal's few victims that actually lived to tell the tale of his attack. Unstable and obsessed with Dr. Lecter, Verger wants to exact a little vengeance on Hannibal `the Cannibal', so he's started a hunt for Lecter that ultimately will cross paths with Starling's investigations.The main problem with `Hannibal' is the simple fact that it makes little sense in its own right, and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever when held up against `Silence of the Lambs'. Characters often seem to do things merely to propel along the plot to the next scene, not because they make any sense. There are dozens of examples of this. Clarice's `responsibility' in the botched FBI raid is an absolute joke. While it's explained HOW Mason Verger was transformed by Lecter in a grotesque, adult-looking version of David Lynch's `Eraserhead', it's never explained WHY it happened, and that's a wee bit more important. Also, at one point, one of Verger's employees decides to listen to Lecter about something important instead of Verger -- while Verger's not exactly the most sane employer on the planet, wouldn't you listen to the guy signing your paychecks instead of Hannibal `The Cannibal' Lecter? It's a constant mess of contradictions that serve to continuously drag the movie down.Also surprising was the absolute lack of tension in the film. Director Ridley Scott had the opportunity to fill the film with some nail-biting suspense -- after all, what could be scarier than Hannibal Lecter on the loose? Instead, the movie moves along at a plodding pace, rarely scary, rarely tense -- gross and violent, yes, but the tension that filled `Silence of the Lambs' is but a memory in `Hannibal'. Some of the scenes in Italy were stylish and worked effectively well -- in fact, I found myself wishing that the Italy sequences had been expanded to an entire film, and everything in the U.S. had been dropped -- but for a film rooted in the horror genre, it's surprisingly flat and boring.Hopkins is okay in his reprisal of the Lecter role, not great -- the character's developed more of a sense of humor this time around, but gone is the reptilian sociopath made famous in `Silence'. In `Hannibal', he's not exactly a parody of what he used to be, but he's definitely a shadow of former greatness. There's nothing new or interesting added to the Lecter character. Julianne Moore does fine replacing Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, considering there's little to work with and no substance to the role. Gary Oldman chews the scenery to interesting, if not exactly great, effect as the loony Verger, and the one truly good character lost in the shuffle is the Italian detective Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) who first finds Lecter. Understated, gripping, and very good, Giannini's performance is the one small gem that can be found amidst the rest of this mess.Two grades for `Hannibal': C- on its own merits for being a tepid, sluggish thriller with a handful of interesting moments, and a F for being the sorry excuse of a sequel to `Silence of the Lambs' and squandering the potential to be something truly great. Avoid this film, it's not worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly, Hannibal lingers above mediocrity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would think with the combination of a great director like Ridley Scott, superb screenwriters like David Mamet and Steven Zaillian, and fantastic actors like Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore; that you would have one of the greatest films ever. Well Hannibal is, disappointedly, far from it. Scott's normally masterful direction is quite irregular in Hannibal. Some scenes carry his wonderful flare and others just flat out don't. Steven Zaillian and David Mamet's screenplay is not what you would come to expect from the men who wrote Schindler's List and The Untouchables. Like Scott's direction, the screenplay is quite uneven in quality. I think they had a little too much fun with some of the characters. The pacing isn't the greatest either. The film takes a while to get going. Anthony Hopkins gives a good performance but not his best. Julianne Moore is also good as Clarice Starling but she is clearly not Jodie Foster. Gary Oldman delivers an unnecessarily over-the-top performance and comes off as being quite annoying sometimes as the disturbed Mason Verger. Giancarlo Giannini does deliver a great performance and probably the film's best as the sleazy Italian detective, Rinaldo Pazzi. Some of the films better points are John Mathieson's sharp, atmospheric cinematography and Han Zimmer's wonderfully ominous musical score. Hannibal could have been worse but it could have been a lot better. 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elegantly violent, sadistic and yet tasteful. What else could you have expected from the good old Dr. Hannibal Lecter? A person whose world is even more mysterious than the man himself. A character so unique it is impossible not to have him in mind once you had the pleasure to meet him, and of course not being the dinner that same night. Dr. Lecter is a man who really enjoys life on his own way without asking anyone anything, and believe you me, it is a very unique way!. Wouldn't you love to have a coffee with him?And on the other hand there is Clarice Starling, oh yes Clarice!!!. The long lost love of Lecter. The only person who could ever stand before Lecter and survive; the antagonist that was able to trick Lecter and won his admiration for it. If there was a person in this world worthy of Lecter affection that is Clarice. Starling understands Lecter and appreciates what he does, but she lives in a world she promised to take care of even though she doesn't feel like she belongs here. So, how could Lecter not get excited when he found Clarice Starling was back on the case?, to proof himself he was still capable of get away from it from the only person he admires/loves. To face again the one person who is capable of bringing him down.Hannibal is a film in which the struggle between good and evil resides in the eyes of the same person, Lecter himself. He is not bad, he is not good either...he is just HIM!!. A character who can kill you or save you depending of your role in this world. Ask yourself...did Lecter kill an innocent man during the film or at the first two films? Of course not, in that sense Lecter is like a punishment from God trying to erase the bad element. A different person trapped in a world hidden in hypocrisy and who would like to be like him but can't. And who is to play Lecter better than Anthony Hopkins? Hopkins did a marvelous job, elegant, cynical (which I loved the most), and even romantic.Love kill the demons,but...Do these persons really love each other or it's just a matter of fight between good and evil?To tell you the truth, as opposite from many people I know, I've never been a fan of SOTL. What attracted to me about this film was the fact that Ridley Scott directed it as I've always been a fan of his work (except G.I.Jane). And the truth is, I love this film much more than I do the first one. Saying this, "Tata" see you round for the next piece of mind!!!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy, if not equal, sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to speak of this film and not mention its shortcomings. Julianne Moore is a television movie of the week version of Clarice Starling compared to the remarkably nuanced and layered performance of Academy Award winning Jodie Foster. Mason was much scarier in the book, although Gary Oldman is stunning in the pared down role. There's a lot missing, including a delicious subplot involving Mason's lesbian sister. And Ray Liotta should just get a new agent.But then, there is Sir Anthony Hopkins. He moves effortlessly like a spider through webs of his own making, as well as those of his enemies. Hopkins, who even composed the music he plays in a scene at Hannibal's Venice apartment, delivers a tour de force performance that almost, almost, lives up to the anticipation we have all felt for a decade waiting for Hannibal to return.And, of course, there is Ridley Scott, who infuses every scene with cinematic magic. Oh, I suppose I could have done without the pigeon scene in the beginning, but it was a hoot. It also foreshadowed the delightful way that Sir Anthony squeezed a devilish humor out of so dark a role.Living in North Carolina, I had to yell "Foul" when Mason Verger's home turned out to be the well-known Biltmore Estate in Asheville, but I guess they had to film it somewhere. And there isn't much else wrong with this movie, as long as you don't dwell on Silence of the Lambs in watching it. Silence was a once in a lifetime masterpiece, and Hannibal is a worthy, if not equal, sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Silence of the Lambs. Best Genre Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is was an outstanding film, in my opinion better than Silence of the Lambs. Ridley Scott is one of my heros and he never fails to impress. Hans Zimmer's powerful and haunting score proves that he is truly a master of his subject. Anthony Hopkins is amazing again as the "good doctor". Julianne Moore is perfect as the much older and wiser(not to mention sexier) Clarice Starling. I can't help but think how incredibly dumb people are for hating this film or not wanting to view because it is not Silence of the Lambs or the absent Jodie Foster. Please. Clarice Starling character is not to complex that it can't be done by two or three other actresses out there. There is nothing truly special about Foster's performance in SOTL. Gary Oldman is great as Mason Verger however the character played a much bigger role in the novel than what is presented here. In fact, the only serious gripe about this film is that it couldn't live up to the novel. Don't get me wrong, this is a great adaptation of a fantastic piece of modern literature. But they shouldn't have changed the ending or omit a lot of scenes and four characters out of the novel. I just hope Ridley Scott includes the 3 hour directors cut onto the DVD release of this film. I am just itching to see it. I just can't get enough of this film.</fullReview>

We learned to fear Hannibal Lecter and rightfully so: "Ready when you are, sergeant Pembry..."HANNIBAL is not bad, but there's too many flaws in the script to make this a unique comeback. And by all means... Hannibal Lector is a murderer, not a hero.I'm not even sure I want to see this movie again. And if you want to see true horror on the screen then watch SEVEN again.

Although some may see these scenes as "artistic", I found them repellent.Hannibal is an interesting character. But ultimately, I don't believe he is a likeable one.

		<fullReview>The flocks of folks who went to see Hannibal and left the theater feeling empty or dissapointed should see the film for a second time with objectivity. Unlike the superior Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal brings to the table direction that correseponds directly to Hannibal's freedom. Wide landscape shots of Italy and the Verger Estate are the norm as oppossed to Demme's caged animal feel. The direction works. Hopkins is marvelous, at times over the top, but so is Lecter folks. Having read the novel, I found Oldman to be right on the mark, and I'm glad the contrived plot about his sister was removed. The biggest complaint besides the gore was the humor of the brain scene. First off, does anybody remember the crucified guard and Face/Off part in silence......yeah....that is what I thought too. Read the novel. The brain sequence contains many of the same comedic lines from Krendler as the film. Ray Liotta miscast, but who is nit picking. The ending should have remained the same, however, the american public wouldn't have gotten it, or would have the gall to think that they, not Harris, know what is best for Starling. Moore subpar to Foster. She is better looking, but that accent slipped a little bit and you all know it. In her defense, this was Hopkins film and not hers, but her support should have been on par to Hopkins support of Foster in Silence. The film's score was perfect and right on, a mix of the classical and the macabre. Manhunter, which should be remade much much better, is the worst of the three. Will Graham yelling up in the tree is so over the top and ridiculous. Denis Farina - miscast. I am really glad that they were able to go into Dolarhyde's head and explain why.........wait......they didn't. He was just lanky and scary looking. RED DRAGON? For a book with this title, they could have at least mentioned it or made better references to it. Yikes. Michael Mann hits a low. Ah,well. They all can't be silence can they? Enjoy Folks! The Rest Is Silence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal the Cannibal is living la vita in Rome as a museum curator, dining scrumptiously on Opera-goers and other tasty classical morsels. He impresses the audience by lavishly spouting Latin, and boggles our minds with his new cultured life. He smacks his chops and shows us which part of the human brain is the...ah... tastiest. Bon appetit!Meanwhile, Clarice Starling's career is in serious doubt. She is involved in a sting gone wrong which results in several of her F.B.I colleagues getting killed. Although not her fault, she is immediately blamed by her crusty-old-fart F.B.I superiors. Hannibal follows up on this with relish and sends her love letters, of all things!!Lurking in the background is hideously-disfigured Verner, one of the Doctor's 'patients' who survived an extremely nasty Lecter-attack. He is full of revenge and has gruesome plans for the Doctor, of the porcine kind.Now this totally involving plot should make for an excellent film.... WRONG! To my utter amazement, I found this movie incredibly boring! Even Hannibal was boring! He wasn't the evil frightening figure that we saw in S.O.T.L. Here, we meet an almost lovable, okeydokey Grandpa who just likes a little brain or liver to the side with his beans and sprouts!Even the murder scenes were boring. We are subjected to slow lingering scenes of the killings, so we see how the Doctor performs surgery on his still-conscious patients. Admittedly, it looks repulsive and gory, but does little to relieve the boredom. Probably the only scene that left a lasting impression on me was the now Infamous Dinner Table Scene.The opera music score was also another yawner. I think I heard the same opera song at least 4 times not including the credit roll at the okeydokey end. CONCLUSION? How much blood can squirt out of a living person before they croak? Just ask Dr Hannibal Lecter!</fullReview>

It follows the horror guidelines of a sequel in elevating the danger and the gore. Boy, does it elevate the gore. But the great thing about this film is the developments in the relationship between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. Julianne Moore has big shoes to fill. While she doesn't wear them quite as well as Jodie Foster did, she fits in them okay. It's not too big a problem, as Clarice isn't even the same person anyway. She's more hardened and seasoned, not the rookie she was in "Lambs". Hopkins is great, of course. Ridley Scott does a good job of continuing the story. He won't get the same raves he did for "Gladiator," but that's okay, it's still a good movie. No award-worthiness, but an entertaining, interesting, and often sickening movie.

One thing lack from this movie is the setting which almost 60% of the movie are at night or nearly dawn. In the house, the office and on the road, it all showing dark or the sun about to set.Such beautiful props to admire are the buildings in Italy and some other nice scenery.

		<shortDescription>Exceptional sequel to Manhunter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Manhunter is, quite simply, the pinnacle of serial killer films, and Ridley Scott (who I thought redeemed himself over the shockingly overrated Gladiator) pulls out all the punches in Hannibal. Like Michael Mann in the original, Scott uses visuals and sound to create tension and mood. Like Brian Cox in the original, Anthony Hopkins is affable and charming, not an essence of pure evil. Julianne Moore is very reminiscient of William Peterson's Will Graham in the sense that one begins to wonder if she has been greatly altered and modified by her experience with Lecter.Like Manhunter, the lines of good and evil are not clearly drawn. One does not know where one ends and the other begins. Manhunter ****Hannibal ***1/2P.S. I know I avoided Silence of the Lambs. There is a reason. To me, of the trilogy, Silence fits the least. It is American Gothic all right, but at the core, it's a crime drama, albeit a solid and memorable one. Hopkins gets into Jodie Foster's head certainly, but he's a secondary character (despite winning Best Actor, Anthony Hopkins only had about 27 minutes of screen time, SOTL was Foster's movie.) The core is Foster tracking down and finding a whacked out guy. Manhunter presented its serial killer with depth, while SOTL just showed him to be evil and that's it.Manhunter and Hannibal really plumb the depths of the inner soul. I just do not think that Silence reaches those levels.</fullReview>

And Ridley Scott made a more fragile Hannibal Lecter, that preferred to cut his hand than try some McGyver skills like open the handcuffs with a knife. Although I missed the suffering eyes of Jodie Foster, Julianne Moore did the right job between the flesh and the brains. An older Anthony Hopkins is also a more sophisticated serial-killer.

		<fullReview>I Enjoyed "Manhunter",and I loved "The Silence Of The Lambs",and I hoped this picture would be similar to them...but it isn't,absolutely not!It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.Hannibal kills and kills - how it seems just for his pleasure and without any real motive...what he never would have done in my opinion.The plot hasn't got a right sense and is very uninspired - you get something like that better in every Third-Class-TV-Thriller.There are a few scenes I really laughed about.That one scene with the brain,that should be SOOOOOO shocking - it is ridiculous!This is the funniest scene of the movie,but there are some others that are quite similiar---but they aren't enough to save the whole film,and all in all:It is not meant ironically!Most of the time the movie is just BORING...extremely boring! No suspense,no psychology,no tension.Even Anthony Hopkins is bad in that movie - he totally exaggerates his acting,overplays the character and just looks "diabolique" all the time.The only highlight of "Hannibal" is Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling,who is as good as Jodie Foster was in "The Silence Of The Lambs"...but she can't save the movie at all,it's just too bad! Jodie Foster must have known why she did'nt want to play in this RUBBISH!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could have been so much better.It could have at least been good.It is an accomplished film, well acted and all, but the story is really pathetic coming from such a good team. The gripping psychology from silence of the lambs is gone, leaving a typical slasher type movie with a bigger budget. Then, afterwards, the team threw in some ultra gore to stir up some controversy (look what it did here in Australia) and released it with enough publicity to know it would succeed. And it did. All I can say is : Don't let them take your money like they did mine!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal turns into a parody of himself in this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie's not bad, but it's hard not to compare it to Silence of the Lambs, which in comparison...is bad. It never seems to work, when the killer starts to create gimmicky ways to kill people (ala Halloween II). Anthony Hopkins is great as usual, but he parodies himself here. He doesn't seem as evil, just more vicious. I thought Julianne Moore did a respectable job replacing Jodie Foster, but I didn't buy the "tough woman cop against the world" act. I'm sure Jodie is not losing sleep over not appearing in Hannibal. One of the best things about SOTL was the sub plots and story intricasies. Hannibal has them, they're just not nearly as interesting. The Verger character is quirky but I never felt sorry for him. The lively dialog between Clarice and Hannibal is almost non-existent. And we are not treated to one scene of Hannibal getting inside someones head (except the Ray Liotta character....literaly) which was what made the character so spooky originally. The special effects and make-up are well done. The music by Hans Zimmer is exceptional and Ridley Scott does a good job of creating an eerie atmosphere. However, those things make for only a good movie, not a great one. 6 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be the first to admit I was looking forward to this movie. I thought Silence of the Lambs was gory but extremely interesting. The by-play between Hannibal and Clarice was riveting and if I rent the video now I usually fast forward to the times they are interacting.This 'Hannibal' thing doesn't have whatever charm it's predecessor had. And Lord knows I do not buy Julianne Moore as Clarice. Not to say she didn't do a good job - just not the same as Jodi Foster. (And was I the only one thrown off by the fact that at one point in the movie they played cassette tapes of the first film and used Jodi Foster's voice?)I suppose it's all in the fact that the thrill of discovery that I had when I first watched Silence of the Lambs is gone. In 'Hannibal' Dr. Lecter is older, Clarice looks and sounds different and I never got to see Dr. Lecter eat Dr. Chilton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily, easily, EASILY the most grossly disappointing movie of 2000. For anyone who went to this movie hoping to see anything remotely resembling the beauty of "Silence of the Lambs", I feel your revolted pain. From start to the point at which I walked out 2 hours in, the script was as predictable as if I had written it myself, and as is all too common, the makers of this debacle vainly tried to drown the shortcomings of the script in gallon after gallon of fake blood. This was NOT "Silence of the Lambs 2". This was "I Know What You Did Last Summer 3" with half the silicone, eight times the salary and a little opera music thrown in to make it seem "cultured". It is no surprise whatsoever to me that Jodie Foster was unavailable. If I had been part of "Silence" and then seen what was coming with "Hannibal", I would have made myself "unavailable", too. Three incredibly talented actors (by which I mean Gary Oldman, Giancarlo Giannini and, in particular, Anthony Hopkins) must have received sizeable paychecks to be willing to sell their thespian souls for this turkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is the big deal?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, I went to see this the first day it was out. I absolutely loved it. I had no expectations of it being better than the original, I knew there was no human way possible to accomplish that, and it didn't either. But I still enjoyed the film very highly and will no doubt buy the DVD when it is released.What my summary is talking about is what is the big deal with the violence. If you look back on "Silence" the most violent parts of the film were when Hannibal escaped from his cell. When he escaped he killed the guards, chopped off one of their faces, and killed the ambulance men. It was a violent ending.Now, that was just the end, when he is out of his cage. And in "Hannibal" he is out of his cage the whole film, hence, this film will be more violent. To me it only makes sense. And I found the violence in this film to be very well done. It is done with (no pun intended) taste.SPOILER TO THOSE NOT KNOWING THE END.And I had no quarrels with the brain scene at all. I thought Ridley Scott did the right thing by adding humor in it to make it seem more bearable.END SPOILERAnother thing, I would like to congradulate Ridley Scott on his absolute perfect direction of the film. I think it should have won an oscar for cinematography. Scott is known for his ability to create new worlds for his audience, (The future, The Roman Empire, and now modern day Rome).But I will take off a half-point because that scene with the child on the plane, those who have seen the film will know what I am talking about, is more disgusting than any other image this film has to offer.</fullReview>

At least it avoided the ridiculously bad ending in the book (was Thomas Harris a hack who got lucky w/ SOTL, or a good writer who turned into a hack?), but the ending they put in place wasn't much better.

		<shortDescription>nothing to do with silence of the lambs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a whole new movie, not worth-seeing or waiting for! But it really made me fell very chilled afterwards! That's way i would gave it a big 6.5(so i gave it 7) for that feeling only. Very good music, very cool acting by Anthony Hopkins and Giancarlo Giannini, Clarice was better looking, sexy but she wasn't original, Jodie Foster was a much better Clarice. is this movie considered to be as a sequel? Then those who do consider it are Brainless(!) or have nothing to do with the world of the Lambs!(ha ha!). First of all is shocking, disgusting and (*spoiler*) you really do not want to see the ending, which although seems fake and a bit real but makes you sick(don't pay for a pop corn, it would end up in a bathtub... etc.!). (end of spoiler). It has a great first part in Florence where it really gives it all! And a very bad second part in U.S.A where Hannibal (spoiler) eats brains, fries them and gives them to innocent kids! And of course the pig scene! Oh god if that isn't bad! Clarice is shot, Hannibal is set Free(while being tighted up) and Mason Verger is eaten alive by pigs!(spoiler ends) Gross! It is a film that is not to be taken seriously, because in the end we get to see that the whole thing was just a sick joke, written by a much sicker person! O.K other films maybe be sicker but at least this should not have been a sequel to a great film like "the silence of the lambs". I really liked Hannibal Lecter as a character, i enjoyed the scene where Giannini dies although it sucked big time! And i loved the stupid dialogue between Liota and Hopkins,that was silly and funny(and gross!).(spoiler) The scene where Clarice tries to kill Hannibal is trying is very well filmed, has a sense of humor but lacks in having much interest... all in all don't watch it unless you are really prepared for a travesty(well not excactly but kind of)like that! Have a good apetit! PS_1 Clarise you naghty girl!(a quote from this disgustingly beautiful film!) PS_2 Silence is badly broken and abused!(see tagline!) PS_3 Few words, much meaning: A cannibal(thomas harris) eats his own heroes! or Cannibalising on the "silence of the lambs"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much different from the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hannibal" is much different from it's original "Silence of the Lambs", in terms of gore, it's been amplified about ten times including on screen decapitations of numerous sorts, and in terms of story, it's a relatively thought-free film that establishes it's radical difference from the first one. "Silence" held your interest in the sense that it was intriguing from start to finish, when you look in the mind of a serial killer, and must try to ensnare him. "Hannibal" doesn't go in terms of intrigue, it follows suspense and follows the characters years after Hannibal's escape. After having successfully eluded the authorities for years, Hannibal resides peacefully in Italy as a brilliant art scholar, who minds his own business, has classical women accompany him to opera, and speaks with his fellow scholars. However, things heat up when, back in the states, a vengeful victim, physically scarred beyond recognition, determines to destroy Hannibal with the cooperation of a corrupt FBI official and a corrupt detective. Clarice is suffering the wrath of that fellow FBI official while trying to survive a media hailstorm from a sting operation that went terribly wrong. Hannibal is determined to make contact with Clarice again while in the midst of trying to eliminate his enemies, in his own way. Anthony Hopkins returns to form as the iconic serial killer who reveals his character in the sequel, than in the original. Julianne Moore, while a very good actress, for some reason cannot be convincing enough in the role Jodie Foster had originated. Gary Oldman shows up unbilled as the victim intent on destroying Hannibal, and under all his makeup, he still manages to create a very twisted human being. Ray Liotta is decent in his role as the malicious FBI official but isn't convincing enough to be spited, his undoing at the end of the film is pretty much the mother of all gore in this movie. It's something you should rent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a boring mess!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This review may contain spoilers"Even before going on release the movie had to pass 2 burdens: The burden of a sequel and the burden of adapting a book.A good sequel(not to mention an excellent one) will give us the viewers new things we didn't know from the first film, it will take the hero's at least one step further and in short will make it interesting for us. The burden of adapting the book is not less easier since you have to choose what changes to make what to delete and what to leave.SOLT is an excellent example of a very good adaptation. "Hannibal" is an perfect example for how badly things can go wrong.When I saw the movie I was few hours after finishing the book and it was still fresh in my mind. The changes David Mamet &amp; Steven Zaillian(2 talented screen writers) made, turned a powerful book to a very messy film. I accept that changes had to be made and I admit that Thomas Harris' book is a difficult one to adapt,because it is about control &amp; power,which are very hard to translate,but the changes and omissions made here simply ruined the story.Here are some examples: Deleting the whole sadistic behavior of Mason Verger towards children and deleting the whole story line of his sister Margot left Mason death meaningless and pointless.Deleting Jack Crawford from the story left me with no reason to why Clarice Starling eventually gave up to Hannibal Lecter. Deleting the whole Memory Palace of Dr.Lecter left me with no reason to his action. What is left are chain of events which have no meanings. All these omissions are things that could give me the extra thing that can make a sequel interesting and intriguing and they are the big changes, the small ones simply just added to the fact that someone has done a very sloppy job here.Some other aspects of the movie:Ridley Scott - Did you see him during the Oscar. He looked tired, agitated and burned out. His work here as sloppy as the script he was filming. It is almost 20 years after "Blade Runner"(one of my all time favorite),and since than, what he has done, has not even came closer to that achievement and I think he will never do.Anthony Hopkins - Nothing is left from the menace that his Lecter had in SOTL. Something was missing in his performance. He looked bored and uninterested in the whole project.Julianne Moore - An excellent actress,but her Clarice Starling is lack of passion, a one Jodie Foster brought to the role.To sum everything up this is simply a boring movie. It is not even bad enough to make me angry. It was so boring that by the end I couldn't care less what happened on the screen in front of me. Shame though, because as they say "The book is much better" and it had a huge potential for a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did Ridley Scott read the book?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just read the book the first thing that struck me was the big difference between the Hannibal Lecter of the book and the Hannibal of the film/s. In the book he comes across as a true psychopath: highly intelligent and cultured (self-taught), more multifaceted, but narrowly focused, and with a single but major "character flaw", namely the nonchalance with which he not only kills his enemies, but also eats bits of them. In the films he is much more crazed killer than cultured man of the world, his violence more easily triggered whenever he feels trapped. This is not a complaint, it makes the book more readable and the film more watchable, but there is in my view a real distinction between the "two" Hannibals. The credit for this acceptability is obviously due to Anthony Hopkins who, despite Ridley Scott's best attempts, embues Hannibal with real characterisation. What made me say that? The fact the Scott leaves out the most important background information in the story by far: why Hannibal has such (paternal/fraternal?) feelings for Starling, and what made him the cannibal he is, namely that as a child he witnessed the killing and eating of his little sister by crazed mountain folk, facts of which Starling are not aware, but are his continual obsession. In her mind any empathy comes from her admittance to vulnerability in the original "Silence of the Lambs" episode. Scott never offers us any kind of background or characterisation, he is just content to make a decent thriller/horror film by numbers. If Boris Karlof had been alive today he would have used him. He made the same mistake in Gladiator. In fact the staccato pace with which the first half of the film moves along proves my point, that Ridley Scott is anxious to put away all necessary background and get to the horror and gore. OK, there is fine dividing line (not quite successfully drawn in the book) between making Hannibal "interesting" and making him "likeable", and I don't ever want to be faced with "Hannibal the Musical" with Julia Roberts as Starling and a Sound of Chewing chorus of flesh-eating offspring, but more "fleshing out" (no pun intended) of their relationship and fascination for each other would have made the film so much more interesting, in fact moved it on to a different level. The lighting effects were borrowed from Bladerunner, and the music from Alien 3, and it was painfully obvious that none of the main actors were ever actually in Florence during the shoot. Compare this with "Seven", "Copycat" or "Heat", where a slow but steady build-up and oodles of characterisation made those three films what they are. I could suggest that Ridley Scott was never allowed by Dino de Laurentis (the producer)to include those "pauses for breath" that make films so much better, and which were so successfully used in Alien and Bladerunner, both five star movies. But back to Hannibal. I preferred the second half, far more Gothic. But again we could have used a bit more background. That the film is so enjoyable is purely down to the actors. Anthony Hopkins made his name by playing shy, middle-aged English gentlemen. To see him as Hannibal Lecter, in close-up, is to realise that here we have an actor of real stature. Mesmerising. As for Julianne Moore, she got lumbered when Jody Foster disqualified herself. "Central casting? We need a competent never-heard-of-before actress, who doesn't even remotely look like Jodi Foster, to play token female, typically competent, bitter, world weary, shafted-by-her-corrupt-superiors FBI agent." Julianne who? How many dollars? OK, we'll take her!" She did a highly competent job within the constraints of Scott's directing, I hope we will see more of her work, and I do not agree that she merely attempted to play Foster playing Starling - she was never given the chance. As for Gary Oldman - terrific! In conclusion therefore, a highly enjoyable, albeit frustrating to the reading public, film that should have been 45 minutes longer. 6 out of ten for direction, an average of 8.5 for acting, an average of 7.25 overall. Fair enough?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*******SPOILER WARNING - IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE YET, YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO READ THIS COMMENT!*******It was a bit difficult to like this movie. Not only because it's difficult not to compare it to the Silence of the lambs, but also because you're not sure it could actually stand alone on it's own feet. And you will never know. Makers must have been under constant pressure, especially Julianne Moore, who fails to be very Starling-like. Original Starling is somewhat complex a character, balancing with feelings of insecurity and ambition. In Hannibal it looks as if her authority and femininity problems have been solved by making her an anorectic... and that is the very problem: Director has really taken everything out of Moore's beautiful, thin figure; she is much less three-dimensional than Jodie Foster's Starling, because Fincher uses her more as a slim body and long, girl-like hair than as an actual character.On the other hand Hannibal's character is too mystified. Not very scary, but more familiar, friendly, eccentric food-loving uncle from Italy. Or your regular sexy bad boy.The merry kitchen scene near the end is quite funny, but is followed by the worst scene in the whole movie. When Hannibal ties Starling to the fridge door from her hair, she decides to tie them together with handcuffs. She is drugged, but still, what a lousy judgment from an FBI Agent! I don't buy it. She must know that Hannibal has to break free, and that means someone is about to loose a hand. Even if she knows it's not gonna be hers (as did the audience), it still makes no sense. Furthermore, there was no evidence of such development in their relationship during the couple of hours that would lead us to believe she was not physically afraid of him. That makes the handcuffing business even more suspicious, after all, this is one of the most wanted HUMAN EATERS of the 21st century we're talking about... That scene reminds of Fincher's Alien 3, where Ripley has a close encounter with an alien. Coincidentally the alien decides not to eat her, because she is carrying their baby. Blah...Still, atmospheric, well made and with some good moments. Eminently re-watchable.</fullReview>

Clarence Sterling is facing the other side of the medal also. During a catastrofal shoot-out she kills 5 people. She loses her badge and her good name. Mason Verger is the third person. He is the only victim of Lecter who's still alive. His face tells you that he did not had an pleasant encounter with Hanibal. His obsession for vengeance brings Hannibal and Clarence back together. The film is visual almost perfect. No Suprise because Ridley Scot has been directing this movie. Beautiful scenery in Rome and Sicily. Julliane Moore is great as Clarence Sterling. Charming and very, very sexy. The film has an ironic tone with some gruesome graphical details. Hanibal has class and style. A complete other movie than his predecessor. But that doesn't make it a bad movie. On the contrary. The Silence has been broken...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand why many people criticised Hannibal and said that it was awful. I saw the movie and I believe it was great! I think the direction was absolutely perfect. It is different than Silence of the lambs but that does not mean that Hannibal is a bad movie. I believe it is one of the best movies of the year. Hopkins was perfect as Hannibal! A real psycho! You must see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth while sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was an impressive follow up to 'Silence Of The Lambs.' I find the big reason for its (few, if not many) bad reviews is reading the book also titled 'Hannibal' before you watch the movie. Naturally almost every book ruins the movie for most people. The second reason is the missing Ms. Jodie Foster, who had audiences all over the world captivated by her performance in 'Silence.' If you don't mind the lack of Jodie Foster, and you haven't read the book, I generally think you'll find this movie to be very impressive.Even people who HAVE read the book that I've talked to, have said that the movie was generally good. People who call this movie's first have very slow, just mean lacking in Hannibals cannibalism. But other than that, the first half is good too.Over all, I would give this movie an 8 out of 10 which I define as very good and worth your while to sit down and watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal is exquisite, an amazing sequel and an extraordinary experience. Since the day i saw the teaser poster i knew that this film was going to be an instant classic. Ridley Scott is absolutely incredible, Sir Anthony Hopkins is spectacular and Julianne Moore was the best replacement for Jodie Foster. The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best movies of all time; Hannibal is not as good as "The silence...", but is just extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was disappointed in this movie. The first half of the movie is painfully slow. Things pick up after that but the movie is a shadow of 'Silence of the Lambs' - which was original, clever and scary. This movie is none of those things - although what it lacks in the plot department it makes up for with it's gore. The last 10 minutes are gruesome - but the movie is instantly forgetable. I gave this movie 5/10 because the acting is generally good. Shame about the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ok movie ** WARNING - Some Spoilers **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I went to see this movie cause I kept hearing about it, about the ending being so shocking, etc. It got a lot of talk in the media and stuff. Well, while it was ok at most, I was mostly disappointed. It certainly wasn't as good as Silence of the Lambs. I did like Hopkins though. He is a good actor so it was worth seeing for him at least. The majority of the movie was quite slow however and I did notice a few people leave the theater.I'm in the beginning of reading the book so I'd like to see how that differs from the movie. So far the details are better in the book. And I'm curious about the difference in the endings! The ending in the movie left me very disappointed. I thought it was quite stupid. It was not shocking at all since it looked SO FAKE AND RIDICULOUS! I did however like the pig feast though. Now that was shocking and quite gross! That's what I expect out of a horror movie. :) In any case, I don't think I'd ever seen anything quite like that scene. So I was expecting a lot more out of the ending.Well, in finale, I'd say check it out either matinee or rent it when it comes out. The $7.50/person was a bit much for the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artfully done, and stands alone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the people seeing this movie are broken down mainly into three groups: those who saw Silence of the Lambs, those who read the novel, and those for whom this is their first exposure to Hannibal. For those of you who saw the prequel, while this is a great movie, you should know going in that the story is done differently than the previous film. Where Silence of the Lambs focused more on the character Clarice Starling, as the title would suggest, the focus of this story is Hannibal. Also the settings aren't as dark, but still the film definetly packs the suspense of its predecessor. Oddly enough it uses humor in a rather intriguing manner in some of the more tense scenes that don't relieve the tension as much as it does intensify it. Those of you who read the novel won't be dissapointed. In some ways its more refined than the novel, but in some ways it does lack. Its more refined in the sense that the plot is more streamlined, and the pace of the story feels faster than the novel. For example some of the less crucial characters, (such as Verger's sister) are either removed, or their roles were edited down in the story. However while this gets the plot going, it also hinders character development. So while Mason Verger seems evil, doesn't appear as evil as you know he is, Starling doesn't take as big a fall from grace as the book shows, and Hannibal doesn't seem as much of an anti-hero as he used to. However, you will definitely find the ending intriguing. Now for those of you who haven't read any of the novels or seen the movies, well you're in for a treat. Don't worry, the plot of the story stands enough on its own that you won't be confused from not knowing what happened before. Hopkins once again delivers an excellent performance as Hannibal, and as does Julianne Moore as Agent Starling. Ridley Scott's directing is simply amazing. The scenes are all beautifully filmed, (yes i know thats an odd word choice for a movie about a serial killer, but from Florence to Washington, every shot is simply breathtaking.) The score is equally amazing, and makes exceptional use out of the operatic peace that is heavily used. This film has two of the most intense scenes I have ever seen filmed, which even though they get a bit gruesome, you won't want to close your eyes for fear of missing what's going to come next. This film is definetly one to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Violent Sequel Misses The Mark...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not understand how such a flawed storyline could make its way to the silver screen. Ridley Scott's much-awaited sequel to Jon Demme's SOTL has cheapened the haunting mystic of Sir Anthony Hopkins's character, Hannibal Lecter. Like many people who have already seen this film, I believe much of the blame lies at the feet of novelist, Thomas Harris. His murky and convoluted novel virtually guaranteed that there would be problems with the film's script.The first half hour of the film really drags (zzzzzz), and for a while I actually forgot what film I was watching! Anthony Hopkins does his best, but even he can't save this sinking ship. His character comes across as grossly unbelievable!.For example,Hannibal Lecter's uncanny ability to travel around the world and commit heinous crimes and go almost undetected, stretches the boundaries of reasonable story telling. Also, although Hannibal does not reveal his age in the film, looking at Hopkins, we must assume that he is at least 60+ years old. If that is true, it is hard to believe that none of his hapless victims are physically strong enough to fight off his attacks. Ray Liotta's character, Paul Krendler should have at least given Lecter a run for his money. Instead, Lecter has no problem subduing him (yeah, right.)Julianne Moore (Clarice Starling) seems to sleep walk through much of this tale and when she can be bothered to really act, one gets the feeling that she'd rather be somewhere else!.Her performance is deadpan-to say the least.The best thing that can be said for Gary Oldman's character (Mason Verger) is that his make-up was well done, although he was disgusting to look at. When Verger finally succumbs, I for one, was glad to see him go.And what about the level of violence in this film?.Again, Ridley Scott goes over the top making his point. I suspect he took his cues from Harris's novel, which makes the same mistake. The violence detracts from the story and `Hannibal' comes off looking like an educated man's slasher movie! (this film really deserves an X for Xcessive violence!) Ray Liotta's final scenes will either disgust you (as it did me) or it will make you chuckle with laughter (the way my wife did). Either way, the whole film ends up looking corny. (and the novel's ending is even more corny!!!)Now I understand why Jodie Foster turned down this project!.Oh well, at least we still have SOTL on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Die Hard Fans Need Apply</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday, I paid five dollars to sit in a theater and view a film that could have been based on any sensationalistic, tabloid magazine story. Utterly lacking in depth and believability, I shed a tear of sorrow over the knowledge that this film had been directed by one of the most talented film makers in Hollywood today, from a screenplay by two of the most talented scribes in the business. Yes, the film I'm talking about is "Hannibal" and the power team behind the project of Ridley Scott, David Mamet, and Steven Zaillian.However, can we really blame them for this misfire? I think the real problem started with the source material, the novel written by Thomas Harris. The plot already contained problems, problems that even Mamet and Zaillian couldn't write away. Here's an author so in love with his own creation that he's willing to throw anything on the table for the experience of keeping him alive. My circle calls this "The Jack Ryan Syndrome".For example, FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore in a monotone performance) is willing to go to any lengths to stop Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins chewing the scenery, so to speak). She will even face certain death to stop him by handcuffing herself with him to hold Hannibal until the police arrive. Why then, after finding out where he is, does she venture to the mansion in an attempt to arrest him on her own? After all, Lecter is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List and all she would have to do is tell her supervisor and there would have been a small army of heavily armed law enforcement officials ready to eradicate Lecter from the face of the earth. A sad fact of this whole thing is that Hannibal Lecter, the murderer mind you, is the most charismatic, interesting character of the whole story. I found his perverse love for Clarice, a love so deep he not only saves her life but would rather mutilate himself than to hurt her, a very interesting concept. But I would rather go back to the days when we would root for the hero, no matter how flawed, and hate the villian.And what was with Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta)? His futile attempts to bed Starling were more reminicent of male attitudes toward women in law enforcement in 1970 than in 2001. I actually felt bad for Julianne Moore. Her performance and the look on her face hinted that she was wondering how she got wrapped up in this project in the first place. Kudos to Jodie Foster for demonstrating good judgment and passing on this one. The same goes for Jonathan Demme. I think they realized they took these characters as far as they could go in "Silence of the Lambs". Considering the talent involved, I wish I had something good to say about "Hannibal". Since I don't, I'll leave with the suggestion that only die hard fans of the "Lecter/Starling" story apply. All others are cautioned to save their money.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>People who are expecting Hannibal to be the same as Silence of the Lambs are perhaps missing the point. Hannibal's favorite musical work is Bach's Goldberg Variations, the important word here being variations. Hannibal, Silence of the Lambs and Manhunter are all variations on a theme and as such must vary in tone and detail. But the story is pretty much still the same. This time Hannibal takes the place of the serial killer and Mason becomes the evil man who helps the FBI.</fullReview>

Apart from the main characters and Anthony Hopkins as main actor, the two movies have nothing in common. Both script and directing lack subtilty, depth and restraint. The renaissance-setting of the movie (Florence, Dante, the château of Mason Verger, ...)in itself is brilliant, and provides a good background theme for the movie. But... then we are confronted with all sorts of superficial effects, like disembowled people, men being eaten alive, ... while we can't find the depth that made SotL so good.Conclusion : good, but not enough...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal Lecter is a Restoration spark, and Anthony Hopkins has done his homework.The problem with "Hannibal" is that he has nobody to spar with. There may be an obsessive fascination between him and Clarice, but there is no exchange of wit: she has none, and his is beyond her. It is true that in "Silence of the Lambs" Clarice had to use her head; in "Hannibal" she is barely there.I would love to see a Hannibal Lecter with a friend or soul mate, and with an adversary worthy of his time. The grisly aspects of Dr. Lecter's character have been over played to the sad detriment of his wit. He is oh, so much more than a killer.Is there a screen writer ready to take up the challenge? Where is Etheridge when we need him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal is back, but is he better?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal the Cannibal is back, but is he better? Well, he still has the same appetite for humans and is as intellectually intact as ever. The film attempts to give audiences a deeper view into one of the most notorious screen villains in the past 20 years, but for some reason I felt as though I didn't learn much more about him than from "Silence of the Lambs". And as for comparing the two, one might as well forget it. "Silence" was a top notch thriller/mystery. "Hannibal" is a characterization/horror movie. There is nothing wrong in the filmmakers trying to make a completely new film, rather than re-hashing Silence. And for that, the filmmakers deserve credit. I admit, I was expecting more of a thriller like Silence, but I welcomed the attempt at delving further into Hannibal's (Anthony Hopkins) and Clarice Starling's (Julianne Moore) characters. I just felt the film fell short in giving viewers that insight and instead relied on shock value and a bizarre new character (an unrecognizable Gary Oldman, as a surviving member from one of Hannibal's past "attacks").The production values show the film was very professionally made, as director Ridley Scott rarely makes a bad looking film. And Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, and Gary Oldman do fine acting jobs (only Ray Liotta didn't fit in quite right). But this film falls under the category of more style than substance; more shock and gore than insight. Because it was a well made movie with good acting, I thought it was worth my money. But I would not see it again except maybe as a rental. (7 stars out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see some unity in what they were after, Lecter becomes more human and less mystical in this, suspense comes off pretty Ok but it is hard to get past the ridiculousness of the gore parts. It was basically just a slasher flick. Lecter is however the only real lead character, even Clarice Starling comes off as a pretty underwhelming as a character, I did not even realise that Oldman was the rich victim Verger. Scott does not manage to pull this off, and as said, he is one for showing everything on the screen, which worked like a charm with Gladiator but turns this into more of a slasher flick than a psychological thriller. It is great at being offputting and sickly provocative in parts that have to be seen to be believed. The whole thing just did not flow.Blame should best be put on the original book for this however. Hopkins does great for fear in this one he never lets up, I can see why Jodie Foster did not return but I really cant see why Ray Liotta and Julianne Moore and especially Gary Oldman signed on. I could sense betrayal pending around the Verger role just past half way through.Some sure signs of a slasher formula are things like everybodys inability to react to the cle she'd "look behind you" idea, a maverick cop, a highly trained FBI agent and a hired thug all fail to defend themselves when he does that "voice from behind, shocked he quickly spins around but its too late" thing. A thug for some reason is looking one way wimpering for his partner and when he hears a sinister voice all he does is turn around, despite having a gun which he could have at least tried to shoot his enemy with. As for feeling no pain when the top of your skull has been cut to seperacy it was just laughable. But yes, it was extremely sickening how vulnerable the relevant character had become. Off that, Moores accent seems to fade in and out, it was extremely strong in the original here there are only some strong points.One thing worth mentioning as a plus is Hannibals loyalty to Clarice, she saves his life and the curtesy he extends her was in a way touching, the end left me baffled, "what thats it?".I recommend never laying eyes on this one, its as bad as any of those cheap "killer on the loose flicks", with some secondary sound and picture quality it would fit right in in a $2.00 80s horror flick bin. Dont bother with it you'll be doing yourself a favour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Silence of the Lambs; the difference is in the direction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hannibal" (rated R) Directed by Ridley Scott. Written by David Mamet and Steven Zaillian. Starring Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Giancarlo Giannini, Gary Oldman. Running Time: 131 minutes.Overview:In a James Bond-like opening sequence, FBI agent Clarice Starling (Moore) leads a messy DC drug bust that results in the deaths of an agent and several drug dealers. Later she gets a letter from the Guinness Book of Records informing her she has killed more bad guys than any other female agent. All of this bad press attracts the attention of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins), now living in Florence as a curator of medieval art. Hannibal decides that now is the time to renew his acquaintance with Starling. At the same time, a Florence police inspector (Giannini) becomes suspicious of Lecter and begins to investigate him, while Mason Verger (Oldman), Lecter's only surviving victim, plots a grim and gory revenge for the doctor. Lecter and his three pursuers carry out the chase on both sides of the Atlantic.Review: 2 1/2 Stars out of 4 Here's the $7.50 question ($5.00 for a matinee): How does this film compare to The Silence of the Lambs, the 1991 original directed by Jonathan Demme that grabbed all the major Oscars? The answer: It's not as good. Hopkins almost equals his earlier performance, Moore creates an interesting Clarice Starling and the addition of Giannini is fortuitous, but the rest of the cast adds little and the sequel's story falls short of the original. The real difference, however, is in the direction: Demme's camera placement and point-of-view lensing offered many opportunities for the viewer to inhabit the character of Starling, allowing us to experience her fear and apprehension. Scott, primarily an action film director (Gladiator, Thelma and Louise), tends to put everything on the screen, leaving less to the imagination.The script, written by Mamet (House of Games) and Zaillian (Schindler's List), begins briskly as a fairly skillful mystery-thriller, weaving together the stories of four characters, each of whom is consumed by something they need in order to put their lives back in balance: respect, revenge, riches, and a robust meal. More than two hours later, however, this early promise gives way to underdeveloped plotting and the premature disappearance of one of the more interesting characters.As for performances, Moore inhabits Starling well enough to eventually exorcise the ghost of Jodie Foster who played the original role ten years ago. (Foster read several drafts of this script, but was never satisfied with any of them and declined to participate). Moore's Starling lacks the youthful idealism of Foster's original, but this is to be expected of a character who has spent the last decade battling the federal bureaucracy. Oldman disappears into the character of Verger, who has been disfigured outwardly by Lecter, and devoured inwardly by revenge. As Lecter, Hopkins is suitably sinister, though he does not surpass his Oscar-winning performance of a decade ago (not that any other actor could).The real find here is Giannini as the conflicted Italian cop who is the first to learn that Lecter is in Florence masquerading as an art scholar. He can turn Lecter in to his bosses, or he can try to capture Lecter himself and earn a suspicious $3 million reward. Since he has a young wife with expensive tastes, he goes the bad-cop route.The look of the film is dark at times, but some of the locations chosen by the filmmakers set up fascinating contrasts: Verger plans his hideous revenge in the ravishing hills of North Carolina, while Lecter hides his ugly past in the elegant city of Florence. Meanwhile, the film's only admirable character, Starling, operates on the decaying streets of DC.If it didn't have a classic to compare itself to, this film would fare far better. In any event, it is worth seeing - but at the matinee price. ###</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a disappointment !!Hannibal was, (for me) a dull unimaginative film with little to redeem it.I have always felt that Manhunter was the superior film to Silence of the Lambs, but Hannibal is inferior to both in all respects.The first three quarters are slow and uneventful and merely serve to introduce a vengeful ex patient of Lecter, and sole surviving victim who himself is a very twisted individual. We learn how he suffered his injuries (although from what we see, it's hard to see him as a victim) and follow his quest for Lecter.Hopkins should know better than to take on a script that has missed all the best points of the book and his performance serves only to transform this intellectual psychopath into an unstoppable 'Jason' character. Gone is the charm of his previous rendition and in comes a stale mixture of a 'beauty and the beast' story without the books great ending.How on earth are we to believe that a man such as Lecter who is on the FBI's most wanted list can use air travel without any disguise and not get caught at immigration.None of the characters are particularly likeable leading you to care very little about what happens to them. Although on a positive note, Julianne Moore did a great job filling Jodie Foster's shoes.There is no tension, no mystery and absolutely none of the style I would have expected from Ridley Scott.I almost left the cinema through boredom.Sorry, but it really is that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit, I was very ANXIOUS to see this movie. Silence of the Lambs is one of my ALL-time favorites, and when I began to hear buzz about "Hannibal" I was getting ready to see another "SotL"(Silence Of The Lambs).I'll start with the performances. Anthony Hopkins SHINED as always, he masterfully portrayed the loveable cannibal. I was disappointed to see Jodie Foster was not playing Agent Starling,but Julianne Moore did a nice job as the disgraced agent. Gary Oldman was excellent,and overall..the cast was superb,except for Ray Liota.( I personally thought they could have gotten a better person for the part) On to the story, I personally liked the story..having read the book(which I think was quite good..). It put a smile on my face to see Hannibal on screen once more. As for the changed ending, I was disappointed in that. I really liked the ending the book gave,and the movie's..well,it just wasn't fitting. I came into the movie theater, expecting more the of the excellence that was in Silence Of The Lambs. Certainly,some of it was there..but there seemed to be something missing. The psychological push and shove between Hannibal and Agent Starling,the other symbolistic things that were in the first movie seemed to be lacking,or entirely missing. So, it was no Silence of the Lambs. But,it was good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait for video</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're expecting a suspenseful, complex thriller like Silence of the Lambs, think again. What to even say about such a poor sequel? Part of the problem is obviously the book that it was adapted from, a dull, plodding story with little tension or suspense that showed a 'softer' side of Hannibal Lector. Well, who wants to see that? My major problem with this movie is that Hannibal isn't creepy like he was in Silence. I don't blame this on Anthony Hopkins at all, but on the script that he was working from, full of cliched lines and gory violence.Oh yeah, the violence. As I sat in the theatre, I couldn't help but feel that the people who made this movie got together and a room and thought about how much useless violence and gore they could possibly show us and still get an R rating. (Although, I have to admit that I'm not clear on how this got an R, and I'm not one who is usually offended by violence and gore.) This is a slasher flick, not an intelligently made drama, as it could (should) have been. The finale scene is laughable. (In fact, everyone in the theatre was laughing, and I couldn't help but wonder what has happened to our society.) When it's not violent, it's downright dull.The acting was pretty good, although Gary Oldman came off much more over the top than the character in the book. Julianne Moore picked up Jodie Foster's role quite well, although her part in the movie is minimal. (She gets to whine, cry and scream a lot.) I'm amazed at how much money this movie made. Oh well. I guess you should see it, but don't waste nine bucks at the theatre, and be prepared to be completely grossed out. I certainly won't be watching it again. I chalk it up to a big waste of time. You'd think that Thomas Harris could've come up with a better story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERSThis is one of the movies that stay in my mind for days, it has nothing to do with the first part, which I don't like, so I consider it as an individual movie, which is understandable even if you haven't seen the first one. The truth is that there are about three gruesome, gory scenes but you're already prepared before watching it. Hannibal is a cannibal, it's also a horror movie so you should be waiting such scenes. Here is the most intent scene of this movie: At the end, when this guy got his brains out and we see him tasting some. Yum! The following scene in front of the fridge is the most important scene, I think. Hannibal' s love for Clarice is obvious and leave us with this question: Does Clarice love Hannibal too? (Wouldn't it be kinda disgusting? - "My darling, I'm starving" "Oh, you can have some of my finger"). 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from the obvious pluses ie. acting, cinematography that you would expect on a high profile Hollywood sequel, I found this film a little bit disappointing and dare I say it - a little bit sick.I could understand the gruesome ending if I was watching a Peter jackson movie, however I found it hard to comprehend what it was trying to achieve. The bit where he offers the "tasty morsel" to the kid is not funny and therefore must be regarded as little bit tasteless.I seem to remember Anthony Hopkins spouting on a few years ago about how he was fed up of appearing in gory flics. I was left wondering whether he should have stuck to his original decision. All he really gained from this was a large wad.Fans of "silence of the Lambs" may be disappointed. The gore is neither funny nor frightening - just mildly offensive. Not one Ridley Scott can be proud of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being very impressed after seeing Silence of the lambs i read Hannibal and loved it. Psychologically extremely interesting and i just couldn't put it down. I was extremely curious how they would capture the psychology and suspense in the movie, especially when seeing the media-circus around this movie. It was nice to see the movie, but that is all. Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as always (i laughed my head of when Hannibal said "okidoki"). But he didn't scare me like he did in SoTL. The constant tension and suspense are gone and the last part of the movie is just horror (in every sense of the word).The book is a must read but the film isn't worth paying a cinema ticket for, but when it comes on television, see it!, after you have read the book of course.</fullReview>

In Hannibal, the producers seemed solely interested in disgusting their audience.

		<fullReview>Everywhere I go online, I see comments about people not liking Hannibal. How it's horrible, disgusting, nothing like Silence of the Lambs.BINGO!This isn't a part two. There is no kidnapped woman for Starling to try to rescue. It's all about Hannibal, hence the title. Starling is only a supporting character in this movie, and I think Julianne Moore did an extraordinary job, considering the shoes she had to fill.Yes, Hannibal is much slower-paced than most people would prefer. In this fast paced world, people want things now. They want to be told what the movie is about, not to have to figure it out on their own. Hannibal takes its time. You have to wait a bit to actually see the title character. This film requires patience. Shame on everyone out there who dares compare this to Silence. Silence of the Lambs is perhaps one of the best thriller/suspense movies out there. But for me, Hannibal is a guilty pleasure, and I enjoy it on a different level than Silence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> If you have seen "The Silence of the Lambs" just forget about it since this movie has nothing to do with the other one except for the fact that the main character is the same and goes on eating people. The philosophical or metaphysical feature that was present in "The Silence..." is not here anymore. This is just a technically well done horror suspense movie with an excellent performance of the two main actors (the cannibal and the policewoman)and with a good well told story solidly built up. Some images are very good and almost poetic like those which take place in Florence. The dubious relationship that establishes itself between the two main characters is very interesting though just suggested. Well you won't lose much if you don't see this movie but if you do you won't find the ticket money wasted after all.</fullReview>

It's not as great as the predecessor, I agree, but it stands on it's own thanks to great direction by Ridley Scott, and the superb acting by Anthony Hopkins. And let's not forget Giancarlo Giannini, a talented actor we just don't see too often. In the book, Giannini's character didn't say much to me, but in the film I really cared for him.MORE GOOD ROLES FOR GIANCARLO GIANNINI !The cutting of the film also deserves mention. In some action-driven scenes one feels like being in there. Fastpaced cutting, just as Scott used on 'Gladiator'.Julianne does well, but I really missed Jodie Foster.Aah, there is one scene in particular that I LOVE! The infamous dinner-scene! Thet's pure black comedy in it's prime. A friend of mine didn'd get it but that's his loss, and that goes for every one of you nay-sayers.

		<fullReview>Why oh why did they bother making this movie? The first one was a horror suspense classic,but this is a total non event.There is nothing right about this movie at all.It is a total bunch of nonsense from the sleep inducing start through to the downright risible ending.Nothing against the lead actors,they were watchable enough.Hopkins was his usual reliable self,but the whole premise of the movie made his performance almost a parody of the first one,and Julianne Moore was very good as well.She didn't have the vulnerability of Jodie Foster's portrayal of the character in the first movie which gave that film the extra depth,but since this film takes place ten years after,that is perfectly understandable.The character would no doubt have changed alot in that amount of time,especially being in such a high profile and male dominated profession such as the FBI. The rest of the cast though were just there to make up the numbers or to be fodder for Hopkins.Gary Oldman was more over the top even than usual,and Ray Liotta seemed lobotomised long before the ending.How can David Mamet,the same man who wrote the sublime Glengarry Glenross be involved in a movie with such poor characterisation as was on show here? And as for Ridley Scott,perhaps he should go back to making TV ads and pop promos,which is what most of his films resemble nowadays. The first film left enough scope for a sequel but this has come far too late and at the expense of some great talent.What a waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this movie goes to great lengths to create suspense and excitement, as in Silence, the movie's tension is generated by the interaction between Lector and Starling. Unfortunately, Julianne Moore is unable to pick-up where Jodie Foster left off.As a result, Starling is a wooden facade of the character the audience was so able to get wrapped up in during Silence of the Lambs. Hopkins on the other hand is just as chilling as before.From a plot standpoint, it is more predictable the it's predesessor. Dr. Fell is a wonderful job of special effects but generally the movie falls short in building a lot into any character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What in the Hell were they thinking? *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They wanted to follow up a great piece like Silence of the Lambs with this?A lot of people will say, "you went into this wanting to hate this", or "it shouldn't be compared to Silence of the Lambs.' To those people, shut up. I went into this wanting to like it a lot more then I did when I walked out. As for the comparison; fine, let's compare it to something else and it still won't make this any better of a film. I can only compare it to Halloween 2. Both had predecessors that were great horror films (both also had great British actors who played doctors) and turned out sequels that were not needed and were made with meaningless gore. None of it in Hannibal was focused with the right kind of attention and detoured itself away from what could have been a great cinematic piece. It was a greatly missed opportunity, but it doesn't come close to good.First things first, the story itself: The thing with Mason should have played a bigger, more significant role in this film. In Silence they used the Buffalo Bill thing much more effectively. Before I even went in, I was thinking of (and hoping against) an all Hannibal absorbed story line and I wasn't very disappointed in that area. The Buffalo Bill, Clarice, Hannibal stories all supported each other in Silence of the Lambs. Buffalo pushed the Clarice story as it pushed the Hannibal story and then Hannibal pushed Buffalo Bill and so on. Hannibal was nothing but a compile of stories running neck and neck hoping to finish out as the end of the movie. They were like characters in a slasher. Each one was sent out and each gets hacked off until the last one is left. Nothing moved anything here but the components of what needed to be moved to get to where it wanted to wind up. Silence of the Lambs wasn't even about Hannibal and it gave us something to watch and feel for, but Hannibal gave us nothing.The camera work: Two words - "crap" and "py". What the Hell was half of that? When Clarice finds Hannibal's letter, that's really lame. And worse was when she sees him in the video and they do a slow motion on her. I thought "Are they serious? They can't be, can they?"There some things that was just confusing. Like why did Paul Krendler walk up into Clarice's house like he owned? As if she would even want him near where she lived. And some of the shots were like `how twisted is this', like it was trying to duplicate Fight Club or something. And I swear to God, it got to a point that if I had heard one more cigarette being inhaled or mouse clicking, I was going to snap and kill everyone in that theatre. No Oscar should be handed out for best sound. I'm only willing to let it go for best cinematography cause I have to admit that was only one of the two good elements about this film.Now, I'm not a big fan of Jodie Foster's work nor am I going to rant that she's the greatest actor of all time, but I will say that Julianne Moore is no Jodie Foster. I was more interested in watching Foster's Clarice then Moore's. And that really says something because of that annoying southern accent Jodie carried. Moore didn't carry that and it kind of lost me. I didn't believe she was this character for a minute. Plus the killing of the woman in the beginning should have played more on a character who lost a father in the line of duty. Something else that was almost completely pointless.As for Hannibal himself: What a waste of a perfectly good villain. We knew nothing about him but that with all his sophistication, he killed with the goriest of class. I liked him better when he was kept back in confinement and yet still retained control of his situation by using his mind games. What was really scary is that a man who can't touch you can get into your most personal place. It showed how ingenious he was and because a mad man could manipulate what's supposed to be a safe environment. That was very horrendous to ponder. That's why the only part that I liked was when in the videos, we see Hannibal attack that nurse whose attack was only insinuated at in Silence of the Lambs. There was something disturbing about seeing him attack in an environment that is supposed to be controlled. Other then that, Hannibal didn't use any of his intellect, just his humble graces and manners. In Lambs, he was very into getting into people's heads. Here he almost became annoying to listen to after awhile.Over all: People will remember Ray Liotta with his skull open and chewing on a piece of his own cerebellum, but will anyone know what it severed to the story or as a piece of cinema? I don't think so. If they had used the original ending, it would have put Liotta's brains, not to mention Hannibal's, to work. I would have loved to see him use his brilliance into seducing Clarice into consuming on a living person's brains. It would have made the film build to something and something to ponder on, but without it, it was all pointless.Cinematography is great. I think that's where some get confused and mistake this for a masterpiece. I'm not going to deny that it was great, but that and the scene I mentioned above are all this film is worth in contrast to the price of admission. It was nothing but a gore show. I could have done without more then half of what I saw. If anyone is reading this and wonders if they should see it, do yourself a favour and pass.</fullReview>

I read the book after I saw the film, and don't see what all the fuss is about. There was not a great amount of difference between the book and the film (surely you have to allow for some changes) and as for the ending of the film (which everyone seems to disapprove of), I actually thought the ending of the film was more realistic. It leaves the story open for the possibility of another film, and still captures the feelings between Hannibal and Clarice. He chopped off his hand instead of hers and escaped. This showed his love for her. I was delighted that he'd got away and I think a part of Clarice was also relieved. I think the book's ending was too far- fetched, and closes the story line up. I loved the film and I must say again that Anthony Hopkins in this film, is the most stunning and sexy being ever to have walked the face of the earth - and I don't want to hear anyone say otherwise!

		<fullReview>Actually, I had no desire to view Hannibal. It was my friend who paid for me, and when I saw the very beginning of it, I regretted the decision over being dragged into the theater. This movie neither kept me in suspense nor horrified me with those well-designed scenes. Hannibal is really a flop, and it somehow reminds me of Jonathan Demme, the director of the fabulous Silence of the Lamb. He is really an artist, while Reiley Scott is merely a sci-fi specialist. Demme knows everything, keeps everything in control, and allows Foster and Hopkins to play their parts thoroughly. But in Hannibal, the performance of the veteran Hopkins and stunning Julian Moore is reduced pathetically to nothing but disappointment, completely controlled by the director. The profound and thrilling character development and interaction are replaced with absurd scenario and irrelevant strands. The only reason I prompt you to see this film is to find out why Demme succeeded but Scott failed. How unparalleled Silence of the Lamb is!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal is definitely worth seeing - but not because it's a brilliant film.Anthony Hopkins was great, as usual. There was no real avenue for him to mess it up, though. Everyone knew he was Hannibal (Silence Of The Lambs was arguably his career-defining role), it was a well-written screenplay, he just stood out from the rest of the characters. Julianne Moore was a bitter disappointment. More accurately, Clarice Starling was. Her character was boring and poorly scripted, the scenes she was in were basically tension-free. Perhaps Jodie Foster could have put in a better performance? Who knows. The movie was far too comical. Silence Of The Lambs was a gripping, chilling thriller; Hannibal is an attempt at a black comedy. I do admit, it was clever. I did enjoy the original book by Thomas Harris, and I think the screenplay was as entertaining as it could've been. Ridley Harris did a decent job as director - the shots of Florence were fantastic.All in all, I guess I enjoyed the movie. My expectations were high, which is understandable considering that Silence Of The Lambs is one of my favourite movies. Hannibal definitely won't win as many Academy Awards as Silence Of the Lambs did, but I guess it will get people to the box office. I guess that's what matters when you're making a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie in a year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew that this movie was gonna be good, but I didn't expect it to be this great. It is needless to say that Sir Anthony Hopkins was excellent. As he's gotten older, he's also got more charisma. Moore was very good. I'm even tempted to say, that I'm happy Jodie Foster didn't take the role. I must say that the role of Mason Verger was a little 'comic', but he was still such a side character, that it didn't take anything away from the movie. I don't understand why the people say this is the goriest movie in a while. There isn't that much of it. And it's done very artistically. I have no doubt that Hopkins will receive an Academy Award next year....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a bit disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that The Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest movies ever made. So I was very enthusiastic about seeing Hannibal. But after the movie a bit disappointed. Why? First of all I didn't like the violence in the movie. Secondly I don't think that Ridley Scott isn't the right man for directing this kind of movie. His style of directing is just too "visual" for this movie.Things that I liked about Hannibal were acting and the music. Hopkins and Giannini were great and other cast was good too.I'll give 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cruel merciless and graphic.... just like he good Doc himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal is NOT Silence of the Lambs 2. It is a different movie, with a different approach, and different storyline. Dr Lecter is not an crime psychology advisor anymore, but a dangerous psychotic criminal on the loose. But there's someone even more psychotic out there who's out to get the good doctor....The movie itself, the production and direction, somewhat stick to the original thought, but have cut many ties with the SOTL. Most prominently this is reflected in failure to leave the details of horrendous deeds of Dr Lecter and others to viewers imagination. While in SOTL a much of thrill was implied rather then depicted, in Hannibal we are treated to full blood-and-gore imagery.Also, J. Moore is not as convincing as Foster in her portrayal of a hard-cut FBI agent Starling, but she does the job well. I think one of the opening scenes (shooting a wanted criminal with a baby in her arms) was made exactly for that purpose. To make us all perfectly aware that Starling is tough, much tougher than she was 10 years ago while chasing the kidnapper Buffalo Bill Gumb. That she is no longer a frightened FBI trainee who wishes that the lambs would stop screaming.Other than that, the movie is good, scary, and will keep you on the edge of your seat, in spite of slow pace in some moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal is one crispy kidney of a sequel with some tasty morbid bits to keep you engrossed in epicurean conversation for months to come.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as the Chianti jokes have died down, and the ominous slurping sounds friends repeatedly left on your answering machines have ceased, the amiable doctor returns. And what extremely patient little human appetizers we all have been, awaiting to see what Herr Doctor Hannibal Lecter would serve up for us in his Silence of the Lambs sequel...Hannibal doesn't disappoint. I know people are already whining it's not as scary as the first...well, that's true. How could it be? Partly because we already know what's in store for us with the intellectual ripper. And partly because we are so desensitized to the whole genre these days...But, I assure you several scenes in this deliciously tasty horror will have you squirming in your seat and covering your eyes in the armpit of your companion for fear of "seeing to much."Blunt Hint: Be sure to pack your MPB (Movie Puke Bag) for the final scenes-you're gonna need it!Hannibal's story goes...Clarice has heard from Hannibal, again. He's sending little notes- just to say "told you so" Seems Clarice has had a bit of trouble in her post at the FBI and she's about to be served up to the press as a sacrificial lamb if you will... Hanny just wants her to know he's there for her.Clarice's slithering boss Paul Krendler is incahoots with someone hell bent on "getting" to Clarice. Get Clarice, get Hannibal...At least that's what Paul's evil puppeteer, Mason Verger reckons. Mason's setting an elaborate trap for poor totally suspecting Hannibal.Mason was Hannibal's fourth victim and only survivor...Of course survivor is a strong word. Mason is too vile a human to feel an ounce of semi-bad for . He's a raping pedophile Hannibal had been court appointed to. Hanny was actually doing the world a favor -attempting- to rid the earth of this heinous man. But he failed, and it's now Mason's life mission to hunt down Lecter at any cost and produce a human haggis (of sorts) from the man. And Hannibal's the deranged one...This Mason guy oozes with a particularly strong scent of Eau de Creepay folks! Think, quintessential Boogie Man. Sleeping is going to be tough this week.What's this Mason ? Hannibal has been found? Thanks to his peculiar tastes in hand creme? In Florence? A semi-crooked cop Pazzi (Italian favorite Giancarlo Giannini) has managed to parlay a true matching (17 points) finger print off the old boy and tip of the angry fetus faced victim.You wanna take on Hannibal do you Mason? Okeedoekee, he's coming out of hibernation.Ah, but just who's hunting whom? Hmm? And dear Clarice has always held a very special part of Hannibal's heart...Will he come to rescue her from her awful ongoing scandal? Mmm, could be.Having read the book, I will say, I found the David Mamet script's ending much better. An ending you'll have to see for yourself.Ray Liotta, who is looking extremely handsome these days, plays the sexist Paul Krendler, crooked FBI guy, purrfectly. His final scenes will go down in the history books of horror as some of the most repulsive special effects frames ever preserved onto film- too bold a statement- see Hannibal and get back to me... Since the "work" on Ray's face he's become a a double order of properly seasoned manbeef. Scrumptious!Gary Oldman is barely recognizable here. Argh. But, even under all his makeup the actor shines through. Gar's done some fascinating- albeit whacko -work. If, for some ungodly reason, you're not familiar with him go here, rent Sid and Nancy and then peruse from there - a must see actor...Enjoy.Julianne Moore did an admirable job in the shoes of Clarice. She had that same gollygee- I'm an officer- and just gonna go by the book sir- at what ever cost, attitude Jodi Foster brought to the original role. Her accent wasn't as Holly Hunter annoying either. Admittedly the new Clarice was disturbing for the beginning of the film, in a switching of the Bewitched Darrin's way- you know that unsettling feeling one gets when a major character in the story is suddenly not the same- except no one in the story seems to notice? Of course we were all ready for this rude switch-a-roo as the press made such a stinkfest over Foster poo-pooeing a reprise of her role. Julianne did just fine. Check out End of the Affair for more Julianne in action-and of course Ralph Fiennes' naked.Finally there's our scene and liver stealer, Hannibal...The Sir Anthony Hopkins. There are a handful of sexy older actors...Tommy Lee Jones, Sean Connery, Jack Nicolson, Brian Dennehy and Mr Hopkins. With Hopkins it's all in his brilliant eyes. Though he's probably best known as Hannibal, Hopkins is a consummate actor as comfortable in the role of the human steak connoisseur madman, as playing a writer destined to pen a child's classic (C.S. Lewis) or beneath some make-up in a quality version of Quasimodo. Versatility and talent wrapped in a nice sturdy package of manyum.Okeedokee. Get out and see this. Hannibal is one crispy kidney of a sequel with some tasty morbid bits to keep you engrossed in epicurean conversation for months to come. The way a real horror movie should!Snack Recommendation: Braised Bolognese Belly, Ray Style Sweetbreads, of course, chilled Chianti served in crystal flutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sir Anthony Shines!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen this film 3 times already, it only gets better with each subsequent viewing. Tony Hopkins gives a masterful performance as an older and wiser Dr. Lecter. His wit/charm, and evilness are blended perfectly. Julianne Moore does as best as could be expected in the role of Special Agent Clarice M. Starling, but I could only wonder how much better the role would have been, if graced by the presence of Jodie Foster. Sir Anthony is more than enough to carry the film, but I only regret he is not in more of the sequel. David Mamet has presented the audience with a well-written screen adaptation of Thomas Harris' geat novel. The cinematographer of this film is superior to SOTLambs, and the music score also outshines the one in SOTL. In addition, Ridley Scott has given us a well-crafted continuation of Jonathan Demme's Oscar -winning masterpiece. My only criticisms of the film are that the film drags for about the first hour, but after this, it is a non-stop race to the finish. In addition, I would have liked to have Scott Glenn reprise his role as Starling's FBI mentor, Jack Crawford, as he appears in Harris' novel. Overall, I found this film to be an excellent dark comedy and my only hope is that Anthony Hopkins sets a record to be the first actor to win 2 Oscars for the portrayal of the same character, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, M.D. Okey dokey then, ta-ta...

		<shortDescription>Beautifully filmed; incredibly dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say I really wasn't bothered about seeing this movie. After Hopkins' hypocrisy of condemning his playing of Hannibal and violence in movies generally after Silence of the Lambs I could only sense a big fat cheque luring him back to the screen.However, many of my friends reckoned it was worth watching. It wasn't. The movie has no plot and no tension. The main characters are brought back for a sequel for no other obvious reason than that they were popular before so that automatically gives them some modicum of script immunity. I think it's important to remember that Lector was only the back plot of the previous two movies in the series and he isn't good enough to carry the movie like this.The movie is also not particularly gory, barring the final sequence. People who tell you otherwise obviously never saw the Indiana Jones trilogy.I was tempted to say the only good things here are Hopkins and Ridley Scott but then realised that Hopkins wasn't actually required to do any acting: he plays an emotionless character who is never sad, surprised, in love or even particularly happy.All we are left with are some black humoured quips that we've all heard a dozen times before in the Bond movies, and a demonstration of Scott's filming techniques - which we've already seen in his better movies.Pointless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I expected a lot, it delivered a bit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Silence of the Lambs. Has to be in my top 5 movies of all time. After seeing this, I bought the books for both Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs and read them both. As soon as Hannibal was published, I bought it and read it too. That left me expecting an awesome movie.With Ridley Scott directing (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator) I expected to see an excellent film. With Anthony Hopkins again starring as Hannibal, I expected to see an excellent film.Well, I was disappointed. Not entirely, mind you, but to a large enough degree to write this comment.The camera work was good, the acting was OK, but nothing like the Silence of the Lambs - Anthony Hopkins was good, Julianne, well she is no Jodie Foster (in this role). In general the film followed the book - and that is a good thing - the book is excellent.However, the ending of the film was a bit... lame? I did like the "Master's Apprentice" style of the ending, but there was a lot of chemistry between Hannibal and Clarice that was left out just before this. Thomas Harris, in his book, develops the Lecter/Starling a lot further, and I feel cheated that this was not in the movie.I must admit that it was interesting to see the number of people that left the cinema when "that" scene was shown - some I would not have expected! However, the film as a whole could have been a bit "tighter" if the Lecter/Starling relationship was explored a bit more - as in the Silence of the Lambs.Oh well, not a complete waste at least. Hannibal is still Hannibal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie, not recommended for anyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is extremely underrated and misunderstood by critics, both professionals and amateurs. It is, in fact, one of the best and most intelligent movies shown on the screen lately. However, for those who understand its implications, it may be so disturbing that they regret seeing this masterpiece.Sir Anthony Hopkins was brilliant in the Silence of the Lambs, and he is no less enchanting in this one, and Julianne Moore as Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling is competent, as are most of the other actors. This helps making this movie so disturbingly hard to escape unaffected from.The story builds on the attraction between the main characters from the first movie, and takes it one step further, creating a very disturbing sensualism between the righteous as we know it and the ríghteousness of a madman.Hannibal Lecter, M.D.'s power to control humans and animals by speaking to them, and even by his very presence, influences even the viewers of this movie, and one is forced to reconsider one's definitions of good and bad. Who is guilty and who is innocent, who is right and who is wrong? Who is entitled to love and being loved?The gory images of this movie are extreme, but no more extreme than any Wes Craven horror movie. What makes it all too hard to laugh it off is the finesse with which it is carried out, the classical music and Dr. Lecter's elegance and respectability. Where the movie is not realistic, it is surrealistic, and it integrates those parts seamlessly in a very sneaky manner, blurring the contours of reality.Where I am from, this movie is allowed for youth from the age of 15. This movie should not be seen by anyone below the age of 20 and above the age of 35, and should not be viewed by anyone who has ever felt even remotely mentally unstable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superbly crafted commercial grotesque</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I often need to see a film twice to appreciate its qualities. I suffer from the constant urge to compare the movie I am viewing with classic movies of the same genre. Never have I been more aware of the need to appreciate a film "for itself" than when I recently viewed "Hannibal" for the second time. To begin with, there would be absoultely no way to view a sequel to SOTL without comparing it to that film. SOTL was an absoultely fantastic thriller which showcased one of the greatest performances ever filmed. Secondly, I read the novel "Hannibal" just weeks before the film opened in America. I thought that the novel was very clever and suspenseful. The novel truly "whetted my appetite" for the film. Thirdly, there are few too commerical films produced which begin with an interesting story. With "Hannibal" I was sure the film would be excellent since Thomas Harris provided such excellent, descriptive material for the filmakers. Upon my first viewing of "Hannibal" I kept asking myself, when are they going to introduce Mason's sister, or the children Mason continues to abuse, or Lectors' Jaguar. I was disappointed that the film only ran 100 minutes long. However, upon the second viewing, I can say that the film is a delight to the senses. The photography is beautiful and the music is perfect. The director has created an intelligent and entertaining thriller which provides enough action and wit to appeal to mass audiences, and enough "art" to satisfy the most discriminating filmgoer. The actors capture every nuance of their characters. Gary Oldman and Giancarlo Giannini particularly portray their characters with tremendous intelligence. "Hannibal" should be regarded as an adult's night out at the movies. What an appealing change from recent alternatives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always felt Sir Anthony Hopkins could "do no wrong" and after seeing "Hannibal", I still feel the same. But, the movie was a very, big let down. Hopkins "just is" mezmerizing and hypnotic!..no matter what the movie and he keeps proving it over and over.Moore did a wonderful job of recreating Clarice and I was very impressed with her performance. Also, Ray Liotta and Gary Oldham were very good. But, alas, the total, overall effect was a letdown because of the ending. I assume money was the reason...meaning "shock value" was behind the change from the book's ending.

		<fullReview>First things first- without Anthony Hopkins this movie would be nothing! His real life characteristics intruding at times into the Hannibal Lector character (which was a good thing). I was disapointed that Jodie Foster did not want to do this movie, but Jullianne Moore added a different spin to the character, giving it much needed separation from Silence of the Lambs. I thought the Empire review of this movie was a little harsh at two stars, cursing it with comparisons of its predesessor. In its own way, this is a good movie. It suffers from a little bit of 'Blair Witch Syndrome' in that if you listen to all of the hype you may be disapointed. Keep in mind also that this is a very different movie to Silence of the Lambs. The movie itself offers many beautiful locations, good direction and excellent performances from Oldman and Moore. My only gripe with the movie was that in terms of plot, the struggle between Thomas Harris (writer of the novel) and the movie producers is visible at times. The film gets off to a great start, slow build up and plenty of action (typical Ridley Scott stuff), but after that it is very stop-startish. It never flows or maintains any momentum.In conclusion I'd say this is a 'good' movie but not a great one. Worth a watch if you like blood and 'guts'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal yet sophisticated and elegant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not quite what I had expected. Of course with a movie with such a big marketing scheme to promote it, I had seen previews and read comments before I saw Hannibal, yet it made quite a different impression on me than I had anticipated.Were most comments on the movie about its brutality, its nauseating killings and unnecessary violence, I found it to be a very elegant, sophisticated and pleasantly thrilling motion picture. Mind you, Hannibal isn't quite an all family movie; some killings do occur and some people indeed get nauseous while watching them. However the fact that Dr. Hannibal Lecter is a sophisticated chap who appreciates the finer things in life and, as I was told, only eats people who in some way or another deserve it, the movie managed to get me to accept that all the horror wasn't really unbearable.Fine cinematography, beautiful colours and atmosphere, especially in Italy, where Dr. Lecter frolics about in some of Europe's most splendid and picturesque places.Fine story, although I don't think it is as intriguing as its predecessor Silence of the Lambs. Yet good enough to make it very exciting to watch.Fine actors too! Of course we all know that Sir Anthony is a brilliant actor and that he can be as horrific as he can be charming in the skin of Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore was surprisingly good as Clarice! It can't be easy to have to equal or top Jodie Foster's fine performance in Silence of the Lambs, and Moore did just that. I have always though of Gary Oldman as quite brilliant, and he was again rather noteworthy, although perhaps somewhat hard to recognise. Let us say he is a man of many faces.All in all I would highly recommend the movie to anyone who's in for a thrill. But be warned that some blood and other things that should normally be on the inside of humans, occasionally come out.Have fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal is a totally different film than Silence...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a fan of Ridley Scott and Thomas Harris and after Gladiator last year i was really looking forward to this sequel. And i actually liked the book Hannibal very much and i think that all the readers that didn't like the book and also thought that Harris was pressed to write another book about Hannibal Lecter by the film company(which i think is bullocks to be frank) had decided early on that the film wasn't going to be good. But i think that it was and if you say to yourself that this one is going to be totally different as a film than Jonathan Demme's Silence of the lambs then you are off to a good start. Because Scott has made a extremly stylish, goulish and almost romantic horror-thriller that is very true to the book. I thought that both Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore were very good, it can't be easy to fill the shoes of original Starling, Jodie Foster, but Moore is a better actress and tries do her version of Starling, not imitate Foster. Where Silence... was a tight, exciting detective-thriller, Hannibal is more of a opera/horror/romance thriller that sometimes slides over to macabre humour. I thought it was scary and thrilling and very intense. I've heard and read some people say, it doesn't happen anything in the movie, it's not very scary, eehh, do you have any imagination at all? It's the same thing with Blair witch project, a fantastic horror movie. But if you can't feel yourself in the situation and if your imagination doesn't start up, well then it's your loss. And if you have set your mind for a Silence 2, you're bound to be disappointed. It's not easy to follow up a movie like Silence... but i think Hannibal was a very good try. I liked it a lot!</fullReview>

Hannibal is created into a soft wussy which only attacks people who he thinks are dumb in the meaning of 'not busy with arts, opera and that kind of thing'. Hannibal is scened at first in Florence, a place -described as- fitting to his personality. I think this must be a joke.And then there is Clarice starling who seems to really love her gun. Shooting around when she can and I have to say it was non-original to make her boss a person who was after her in the beginning, that reminds me of Dr. Chilton in SOTL, and also of Jack Crawford.In a few words, I was dissapointed in the way they made this sequel and I heard there was some speaking about a third part. I really don't think I will even take the time to check out the movie. I'll stick to Silence, and that's it. Hannibal was crappy.</fullReview>

So, as one of them, I reckon I can give a decent review."Hannibal" ISN'T SILENCE OF THE LAMBS! It`s a different movie! I`ve heard so many people muttering "It wasn't like the first one... " But that`s because it doesn`t TRY to be the previous film. For a start, TSOTL isn`t just about Hannibal Lecter, whereas this film completely focuses on him. It`s not the dark, broody totally tense film TSOTL was. Instead we have Antony Hopkins reprising his role as Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter and having a hell of a time doing it. You can tell Hopkins enjoys this part, and knows it belongs to him, and him alone."But Jodie Foster isn`t in it!" How many times have I heard that? If Julianne Moore had known how many times, I`m sure she would have re-considered taking the part. She does a fine job as Clarice Starling, and, as is very sensible, doesn`t try to be Foster acting the part. She plays it as if it were the first time the character had been seen by anyone. Don`t stick one character with one actor, I know it would be nice to, but the world doesn`t work like that.As for the adaptation from the book... I sat waiting for characters to appear that didn`t... Plot lines to appear that didn`t, and Mason Verger`s gruesome doom at the hands, or mouth, of his pet eel. Well, I waited, and waited, and then the film ended. The film has a lot of differences in it from the book, partly because of time I suspect, but it doesn`t matter. Hannibal is still a very engrossing, grossing (!), and thrilling horror movie. Long live Hannibal Lecter!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is already one of my personal all-time favourites! I saw yesterday evening in the theater and I'm still thrilled!It's simply the most exciting and raffined serial-killer-movie in the world! The actual plot could have been a little better, but the completely perfect acting by, especially, Anthony Hopkins makes the plot go in second line. If Anthony doesn't deserve an Oscar for this performance, no one does! I give 11points out of 10! Julianne Moore is excellent, but I believe Jodie Foster would have been better! She's just so good in the very psychological scenes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A better movie then most think it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It amazes me how much talk have been devoted to the violence of this movie, comparing it with a slasher movie. Which i think it's preposterous. HANNIBAL is a weird love story between a disgraced FBI agent Clarice Starling and her mentor/father figure/nemesis Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He's Moriaty to this modern-age Sherlock Holmes, but with a romantic twist, a bit like the original THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR. He's the wolf to Clarice's Red Riding Hood. Anthony Hopkins is suberb as the good doctor, and the rest of the cast is unanimously very good. Gary Oldman even plays Verger Manson for a bit of a laugh! I think Lecter is a very intriguing and appealing character. I admire specialy his incredible sophistication and good manners, and also his disposition to reach his ends. Do i admire him? Yes! Do i approve of what he does? No! Is he a monster? Absolutely! He's what is more dangerous about a human being: incredibly destructive, remorseless, driven and with a great humanity, which in a way only makes him even worst. Hannibal always projected that idea that if he wasn't so vile he would be a great chap to chat to in a cocktail party (although i prefer pubs, more intimate ambience!). The Violence of the movie is totaly in character with him, and in reality many less intriguing and pathetic psychopaths have done much more horrible things for lesser reasons then self-indulgence. Bottom line is: Dr. Hannibal Lecter is a fiction, and with it we can have fun. Congratelations Ridley Scott, you have done good! Can't wait for your next movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Instead of reading the book first, then going to see the film, I did it the other way around and I'm glad I did. First of all, Hannibal is not for dummies. Not that I'm trying to offend anybody, but for people who run screaming from the theatre, with "its too gory" etc on their lips, are doing the film a great injustice (and should definitely avoid the book altogether), they don't get it. Its not a slasher film that insults your intelligence; it's psychological with a little 'colour' thrown in. All scenes of violence are significant to the plot, and to me, are not that graphic. If you'll pardon the pun, it's not overkill. It is necessary to get the point across and piece the story together. As for the actors, at first, I didn't know what to think about Julianne Moore playing Clarice instead of Jodie Foster but, she's a strong character and gives the part that something extra that I think was lacking in the previous film. She goes toe to toe with Sir Anthony and holds her ground beautifully. They are a good match and it works. I like her (sorry, Jodie). I also wondered "what's Hannibal going to be up to this time?" I was pleasantly surprised and totally enthralled from start to finish to see how he has evolved since "Silence of the Lambs". I've seen the movie twice (more times to come) and now I am probably one of the movie's biggest fans. I will be the first to defend it against the critics. It is, believe it or not, a kind of love story but on a very intellectual level; not your typical "sweetie pie, cutesy poo" way (thank god). It is obvious that, going against everything they believe in, Hannibal and Clarice are falling in love with each other, but, why? is the question, when they struggle with themselves constantly. They need each other to fulfil an emptiness that only they themselves know about. We witness it first-hand and are a little squeamish about this not-so-happy couple but its great stuff to work with. I have since read the book and, quite frankly, you need a machete to wade through it. It does however, give more indepth insight into those fiendish characters that Hannibal is up against (that make him look more like the Pillsbury doughboy than the monster he is known to be) and might be worth a read if you haven't done so already, just for clarification. I'm still relieved and cheering when he gets away! Hats off to David Mamet in sifting through the junk and cooking up a masterpiece. He played his cards perfectly and came up trumps in pulling together one of the finest pieces of work that I've ever seen. It couldn't have been easy, believe you me! Thomas Harris usually keeps me riveted to my chair while I'm reading his novels; a rollercoaster of emotions at intense proportions. But this time, I was more curious than riveted. However, I loved the ending and I can't wait for the next installment. As for Gary Oldman-who knew? There's an Oscar for makeup/special effects in here somewhere and a supporting actor one for Gary, I'd say. A great performance indeed. Giancarlo Giannini is just as brilliant at being despicable and Ray Liota, took creep to a whole new level. But, without a doubt, my heart belongs to Sir Anthony Hopkins. I believe that Sir Anthony as Hannibal Lecter is one of the finest performances that he's ever accomplished(and there have been many). His is one character that you could not substitute (unless Jeremy Brett were still alive, then, maybe). But in any case, you can't change him - don't even try! No one else would do. He appears as plain as a piece of paper but once he starts, he carves out the character with the precision of a surgeon's scalpel and leaves a scar, under the skin and in the mind. Heaven help me, I too have fallen in love with Hannibal Lecter. However, he's one person I wouldn't want to use the phrase "bite me" on. Okay, okay, I'm phoning my therapist right now. Shoot, busy signal? She's probably at the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs are great thrillers. When you go and see Hannibal forget them, because you are going to a horror film. The violence is shown raw and in detail (remember not to buy any popcorn). Acting is great Hopkins is again a great Hannibal, but director Ridley Scott didn't make him as attractive as Demme did. Jullianne Moore is a great Clarice, as much as I loved Jodie Foster I didn't miss her. I even think that for this movie Moore is a better choice. And I also thought the actor who played the Italian inspector was great. But I don't think much of the story, and the ending was disappointing.

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong this is an amazing movie. But unfortunately it just isn't anywhere near as good as Silence of The Lambs. Obviously produced much better than its predecessor (obviously because of the 10 year difference in technology). The plot is sketchy at best, the rushed filming is obvious when you watch it. Another brilliant performance by Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal, but Julianne Moore failed to perform as Starling. Comparisons to Jodie Foster should not be made here. Of course, the difference between hannibal and silence is that where silence was a movie about clarice starling, Hannibal was a movie about Hannbal Lecter. Maybe, that's why the emphasis us not on Julianne Moore's mediocre performance.All in all, definitely a good movie, but it lacks the screenplay and plot of silence of the lambs, and that's where it tries to make up in shock value. This is a bad idea. Hannibal, see it on the big screen for maximum enjoyment.-Lobba</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you laugh or squirm?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror? Nope. Suspense? Not really. Gore? It tries.So what *is* Hannibal aiming at? It builds on the relationship between the killer and the detective that was set up in the first film, even though Starling is now Julianne Moore rather than Jodie Foster. It gives you a little more insight into the mind of Hannibal himself, the view made more interesting and three-dimensional by the fact that he's free and roaming the world. Supporting cast are good - Ray Liota the exception, though I appear to be one of the few people on the planet to realise he can't act for toffee - the script and dialogue are fair and some of the direction is superb; the scene in Florence where the crook is trying to get a fingerprint from Hannibal is pacy and very well shot.There really are no surprises in the film though. Those you expect to die, die. Those you expect to live a long and fulfilling life appear to do so. Attack dogs are scared of Hannibal, police fail to arrest him when the chance presents itself and all the really bad guys meet sticky ends. The finale in the kitchen does its best to present shock value, but it is laughable.If you are a fan of the first film, see the second for the sake of completion. Then wait for the third and hope it provides a resolution rather than simply furthering a franchise - 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has its moments, but goes nowhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the long-awaited sequel to Johnathan Demme's fantastic 'Silence of the Lambs', this is one effort that would not have been done cheaply. That's why Ridley Scott, director of 'Alien', sci-fi / noir hit 'Blade Runner' and of course last year's Oscar-nominated blockbuster 'Gladiator' - to name but a few - was hired to direct this film. Anthony Hopkins, his superb role as the refined, dangerous psychopath Hannibal Lecter so crucial to 'Silence of the Lambs' was retained, and, after a long, arduous search to find a replacement for Jodie Foster, who declined to play the part of hardass detective Clarice Starling for a second time, Julianne Moore seemed, at first glance, to fit the bill. But the question is, does Hannibal maintain the high standard set by 'Silence' in the way 'The Godfather Part 2' did for Coppola's 1972 masterpiece; or does it fall into the dark and lonely (but not without company) category of eagerly anticipated but disappointing Hollywood sequels? Comparisons to 'Silence of the Lambs' are inevitable, and, sadly, 'Hannibal' is vastly inferior, but looked at by itself this film definitely has its charms. It picks up pretty much where 'Silence' left off, but Clarice Starling's position as a high-ranking FBI agent i becoming increasingly unstable after a botched surveillance job leaves a fellow agent and a few criminals dead on the street.Hannibal also has a prestigious job in a Florence library, but his integrity is being investigated too - by an agent in Florence (Giannini) who is only after one thing: a reward. Clarice gets involved eventually and hers and Lecter's lives become entangled so another chapter in this story can be opened. Unfortunately, however, things just don't happen this way. The pace is funerally slow for the first hour or so and even when Clarice and Hannibal get closer, the film never really takes off and nothing new is achieved. The film gives rise to some horrific images: Men being eaten alive by a pack of blood-crazed and ravenous wild boars, Hannibal giving a victim a full lobotomy, while concious, of course, and a combination of classy direction from Scott and masterful acting by Hopkins means that the film has some very scary moments (however its less direct: thanks to Hopkins' acting we are terified of the character of Lecter more than anything, but still chilling all the same) but the plot, to me, seems like a mere platform for some tension, good acting and black humour(slightly overdone this time) as it never moves too far in any direction. In fact, for the most part this film concerns itself with Starling's battle to keep her job and also her emotional battle against the memory of Lecter and even when they eventually meet (most of their communication is done over the phone or through Hannibal's letters compared to the tense, direct confrontations of 'Silence') no new ground is broken and you come away from this film knowing no more about the characters that you did in the beginning.Moore is satisfactory as Starling, but she never really captures the aura of assertiveness and fighting spirit that made Starling what she is supposed to be and what Jodie Foster always maintained in 'Silence of the Lambs'. But on the plus side, this film is worth watching for Anthony Hopkins' excellent display of comedy, charm and dangerous levels of insanity. Every piece of black humour that escapes both his lips and face becomes meanacing, he does "psychotic" so well that it is both enjoyable and terrifying to sit back and watch him tastefully murder people in his deep, dangerous eyes, never mind how he does it with blade, a rope, and a knife and fork. But eventually this film comes down on the side of a technically accomplished, well acted film that definitely has is moments but which, unfortunately fails as a sequel as it fails to break new ground. 3 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This sequel breaks the silence and proves that Julianne is a match for Jodie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hannibal" is quite a provocative movie. It lures you in, from its relatively brief opening scene, and keeps its hold tight until the end. A much different movie than "Silence of the Lambs", it is not as psychological - relying more on a killer-on-the-loose approach. Anthony Hopkins is back on form as the infamous Dr. Lecter (though he seems to have toned-down the role - his style here is more subtle than in "Silence"); while Julianne Moore steps into Jodie Foster's shoes with a remarkable style and grace - it was no doubt quite an unnerving experience for the actress, considering the role of Clarice Starling won Ms. Foster an Oscar. However, Ms. Moore most definitely pulls it off. Kudos to her. Stylish, ominous, deeply-layered and -textured - "Hannibal" is an interestingly complex movie. The direction (surprising for Ridley Scott) is tight and well-paced, as is the editing. The script is superbly evocative and daring, and the use of classical/opera music throughout gives the movie an edgy feel - heightening the tension as if by default. The film contains a number of gory scenes, but they are never gratuitous, and always well-placed. Break the silence; go see this movie . ..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott should respect the written word to a greater extent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonathan Demme's "Silence of the Lambs" doubtless ranks as the greatest serial killer horror masterpiece ever conceived on film. In my opinion, anyway! Of it's genre, it was unsurpassed. After "Hannibal," it still is.If you allow me to quote from critic Roger Ebert, he described it brilliantly and I quote :"It has been a good long while since I have felt the presence of Evil so manifestly demonstrated as in the first appearance of Anthony Hopkins in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. He stands perfectly still in the middle of his cell floor, arms at his sides, and we sense instantly that he is not standing at attention; he is standing at rest -- like a savage animal -- confident of the brutality coiled up inside him. His speaking voice has the precision of a man so arrogant he can barely be bothered to address the sloppy intelligence of the ordinary person. The effect of this scene is so powerful that it underlies all the rest of the movie." - unquote. I do hope you allow me this quote with the above words from Mr. Ebert. They cut the very essence of what I wished to explain. The remaining words are my own.I also like to warn readers who still haven't seen this film - especially those who have read the book - to please don't read my review before they have watched the film!The cunning evilness of "Silence of the Lambs" was the very key factor to it's incredible success. The mere sight of Sir Anthony Hopkins, in his portrayal of the evil monster Dr. Hannibal Lecter, were enough to disturb our sleep. We were frightened every time he appeared on screen. I still am. We were aware of the fact that his brilliant mind could harm Clarice M. Starling, even from his asylum cell. We were concerned for her.This is what's missing from HANNIBAL. In this movie, Mr. Hopkins has to make an effort to frighten us, and that alone is an essential difference between the two movies.Normally, I respect Ridley Scott as an important director. He's very skilled in filling the screen with tight pictures, and even in this movie he has included an harmonic musical color. And he made "Alien...."I'm not about to write anything bad about neither Sir Anthony Hopkins (I respect him too much) or Julianne Moore. But Ridley Scott should respect the written word to a greater extent. I've read the entire trilogy of author Thomas Harris. He spent eleven perfectionistic years to write his brilliant book "Hannibal." What upset me in this new movie, was director Ridley Scott's and his writers' omission of several key scenes and key characters.They totally changed several scenes, so haunting and disturbing in the book, to their own story. The ending of the movie, compared to the book's ending, was so different that is was close to being criminal. Why director Ridley Scott and his crew did so, I have no idea, so I can only speculate, but to me it was very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bitterly disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it was my fault for expecting too much from the film, but I was bitterly disappointed with Ridley Scott's Hannibal. I have to be honest and admit that I was hoping this film would be at least as good as it's 1991 predecessor The Silence of the Lambs (which is one of my favourites), however, it falls a long way short.I had already read Thomas Harris' novel, and can understand why Jodie Foster didn't like the screenplay! In my opinion key characters (Mason's sister) and key scenes (Mason with the young children) were omitted from the film. Aside from this, I actually found the film quite boring! Especially the first hour or so...Julianne Moore's lack of screen presence relegated Clarice Starling to little more than a minor character. None of her admirable traits that Jodie Foster so brilliantly portrayed were present; I find this especially disappointing when you consider Ridley Scott's usual calibre of female leads (Ripley; Thelma &amp; Louise; GI Jane). Hopkins seemed to be holding something back a lot of the time, as if he wasn't quite comfortable with reprising his infamous role. The only character who really made any sort of impact was Mason Verger. Gary Oldman once again proving how good he is at playing the bad guy!In terms of direction, there were a couple of scenes which easily stood out from the rest. The opening credits were excellent, &amp; I loved the brief scene in which we followed Lecter &amp; Starling to Paul Krendler's house after the very, very disappointing 'pig' scene. The drive scene reminded me of one of the better music videos shown on MTV!But I think my biggest disappointment with Hannibal has to be the ending. Whoever made the decision to replace the novel's brilliant ending should be shot!! I felt that the new ending was weak, and above all too safe. The filmmakers should have had the courage to depict Harris' closure. As it stands, the ending merely emphasises the poor quality of what could have been another Oscar winning film.</fullReview>

The tension and suspense seems to die somewhere in the latter half of the film. This doesn't go without saying that Hannibal has more then it's share of shocking jaw-droppers. On the other hand, expectations can be a horrible thing. Many people went to this movie expecting to see something up to par with Silence of the Lambs. Unfortunately, that is a very high expectation. I, on the other hand, went expecting to see how the film compared to the novel, and I was pleasantly surprised, even though the movie didn't touch upon many of the books riskier details. I recommend seeing this movie in the theatre for no other reason then for the "theatre" experience. However, if you're not into gore, well, stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal starts out with an eerie opening, pulling you into its atmosphere. It builds up and builds up, however there is a point where things start to go "blah." The tension and suspense seems to die somewhere in the latter half of the film. This doesn't go without saying that Hannibal has more then it's share of shocking jaw-droppers. On the other hand, expectations can be a horrible thing. Many people went to this movie expecting to see something up to par with Silence of the Lambs. Unfortunately, that is a very high expectation. I, on the other hand, went expecting to see how the film compared to the novel, and I was pleasantly surprised, even though the movie didn't touch upon many of the books riskier details. I recommend seeing this movie in the theatre for no other reason then for the "theatre" experience. However, if you're not into gore, well, stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All gore and no story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't as disgusted as some of my friends were with the movie. However, I was very disappointed. Anthony Hopkins is too great an actor to waste on a movie that aims to do nothing more than shock the sensibilities of its viewers. Hannibal is a far cry from the mind-bender it succeeded.Have no regrets if you pass it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This may cost Scott the Oscar for 'Gladiator'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The type of gore witnessed in 'Hannibal' is something I would expect from amateurs such as Brian DePalma or David Fincher or from slightly above average directors like David Cronenberg but not from Ridley Scott. Scott has dealt with gore before but in rapid succession and never with this much detail. The climax is geared for shock value putting one in mind of something like 'Friday the 13th'. I loved 'Hannibal' until the disturbing climax. I support its freedom of expression totally but the entire thing left me half loving it and half hating it. The film has sort of a split personality and I remind Academy voters to look carefully at Ridley Scott's work on 'Gladiator' and judge him solely on that film but I feel those turned off by 'Hannibal' will allow human nature to interfere and deny Scott his Oscar. This film, right in the middle of the Oscar race, may cost Scott his Oscar dearly. Julianne Moore does a great job of filling Jodie Foster's shoes and while Hopkins brings back a cultural icon in Hannibal Lecter, he isn't quite as polished this time around. Gary Oldman, Ray Liotta and Giancarlo Giannini are all good but not great in supporting roles. The film is very well written by David Mamet and Steve Zaillian and this is the film's best academic achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People need to see it for what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not know what people's problem is with this movie. Even though many did like it,many complained that it is too different from "Silence of the Lambs". Now, wouldn't it be boring if would get an exact copy of that movie? Hannibal can stand on its own. What did we really like about Silence so much? For me it were the interesting conversations with Dr.Lecter and then finally his gruesome escape. This is what most people loved about it and now they have it for over 2 hours, so I don't see what they are complaining about. It would receive the praise it deserves if people know what they are getting into: mostly action/suspense with a bit of "detective work". So finally stop busting on "good" old Hannibal because it delivers all the essence that we loved about Silence, in my opinion that is. Love it for what it is. I'll give it an high 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another overhyped sequel that couldn't quite deliver the goods.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another sequel that was completely overhyped. It probably isn't fair to pass off Hannibal against it's predecessor but i'll do it anyway. Where Lecter was genuinely frightening in silence of the lambs, in hannibal he is merely a charicature of himself. There's lots of gags like 'i've had some terrific diners there' that offset the heavy tone hannibal is supposed to carry. And then there's julianne moore. what can i say. although she's a fine actress, she never had the chance to make this role her own to begin with, and that's just a shame. There's already been a lot of controversy surrounding the extremely gory scenes in this film, and there are a few, let me assure you. where silence of the lambs truly tried to fathom the psychology and minds of serial killers, the problem with hannibal is it feels like the entire story was cooked up just to gross out the audiences. as for the ending, well.. don't go see this if you're kind of squemish with this kind of stuff. Did i mention the cinematography was excellent? (hey, it's Ridley!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very good at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of the movie was pretty cold and distance. I found myself thinking, "This is not very engaging at all". This cold and distance style of Ridley Scott may be more appropriate for Bladerunner (my Top 5 of all times) but certainly didn't work here.Things got more exciting when he returned to American. My favourite sequence in the movie is the one where he lured her out with the phone and ended up at the merry-go-round.The ending climatic scene. What can I say? Its shocking. But it's just shock tactics and not much else.Missed Jodie Foster. I was initially excited that Julianne Moore (Loved her in Boogie Nights) was taking over Jodie. But I wasn't impressed by her in this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It couldn't be more wrong to dis Hannibal on how much it departs from the style of Silence of the Lambs. SOL is an excellent movie, but is also more of a conventional suspense- and plot-driven thriller (hence the easier acceptance by - for lack of a better word - the masses). Ridley Scott's Hannibal, by contrast, is the quintessential PSYCHO thriller. If you get disgusted instead of engrossed and mesmerized watching Hannibal, it's simply because the movie is not MADE for you. To me, Hannibal makes a worthy inclusion in the list of such masterpieces as Stanley Kubrick's artsy and controversial works ("A Clockwork Orange" and "2001 A Space Odyssey") and Ridley Scott's earlier groundbreaking work, "Bladerunner", all of which I enjoyed immensely. Quite simply put, it's all about the otherly world experience. In the case of Hannibal, it's about experiencing the bizarre, disturbing, and utterly fascinating world of Lecter's mind and, above all, his TASTE ... for a bit of the REAL bad guy's brain with caviar, and, of course, for Clarice.Hannibal may be in the same genre as SOL and, alas, same trilogy ... but it thrives at a completely different realm.I can perfectly live with it if you are repulsed by "Hannibal".

		<fullReview>I don't know why so many people disliked this film. Maybe they wanted a "Silence 2", which this film is definitely NOT. This movie is about what makes Hannibal tick. What he likes. What he dislikes. And we do learn this time around who he likes, and why.I found the movie highly entertaining, specially in the Florence sequences, with only a music track. Its effect was a bit hypnotizing. With it, you learn the kinder side of Dr. Lecter, and the weak part of Agent Starling, while a subplot (I don't know why, I consider the manhunt part a subplot) occurs.A thinking man's version of "Silence". That's the best description I have for "Hannibal". I loved it. But I couldn't eat anything else the day I saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a little disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realized going into the movie that expecting a "Silence of the Lambs II" was unrealistic. But this movie, was very disappointing. First of all, Gianini's character was weak. I don't understand why he didn't just attack Lector the second he knew who he was. Why the charade when you are dealing with one of the most ruthless cannibals? Another thing that disappointed me was the soap opera between Lector and Clarice. After awhile, it was clear that the two had feeligs for each other and the fear of Clarice losing her life was nonexistent. Not to mention that I was almost cheering for Lector towards the end of the movie, as Liotta's character proved to me even more evil than Lector's. Let me see, if I pick the cannibal over the bureaucrat then there is something wrong. Jody Foster had fear in her eyes when she approached Lector, and rightfully so. This new Clarice was more of a supercop, something I felt was not consistent with "Lambs". Back to the soap opera, I couldn't understand how Clarice was unable to locate Lector, considering nothing happened to her in the end. She should have been able to follow him (she was snapping out of her drug induced state) and see where he fled to amidst the swarm of police backup arriving. And Hannibal's hand? Give me a break, just cut the handcuffs in half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film with some flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a theory on Ridley Scott: he's got two faces. There's one Ridley Scott who becomes deeply involved in a project, who works with it for several years, and the final product becomes spectacular. Alien and Blade Runner would be prime examples. Then there's another Ridley Scott who sort of functions like a hired gun: these are normally the films he shoots in between he´s more passionate projects. "Hannibal" is such a film. It´s evident that master director Ridley Scott hasn´t stretched the screenplay to its limits and truly explored the story, but rather presented it in a fairly straight forward way. The result is an enjoyable film - well worth seeing - but it certainly has its flaws. It´s a shame, too, that such a great actor like Gary Oldman is covered with grotesque make-up throughout the film... The cinematography and music, though, ranks quite high.</fullReview>

Hannibal behind protective glass, in Silence, was a character that promised evil as his cruel insults indicated. One could only imagine how horrific he would be unleashed, and in Hannibal that promise does not disappoint. The pure disdain and apathy he conveys towards his victims and even for himself is portrayed excellantly by Hopkins.

		<shortDescription>An ugly film, elevated only by Hopkins' performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is big-budget grand guignol that is doing exceptionally well at the box office, mainly because it has a built-in audience from the following of the first film. The overall tone of this film is quite different from the first. Instead of subtlety and an intriguing relationship between Starling and Lecter, the film seems to get bogged down in unnecessary subplots. Ray Liotta's character is also unbelievable in that he says such misogynistic things and is not reprimanded for it by Clarice or the FBI. It's hard to believe that he wouldn't be fired for some of the comments he made, even in the male-dominated FBI. Starling and Lecter don't even get together until the last 25 minutes or so. And where was the plot of the film? Where was the character development? I would have liked to have known of any reason for why Lecter is the way he is. What was the point of it all, except as some kind of technical exercise for Ridley Scott? There were also some character 'entrances' that were thrown away. Where was the buildup to Verger's or to Lecter's first appearances on the screen? And where did the story logic go? How could Lecter be so invincible? How did he get into and out of the US so easily? How did he make the people he drugged do or allow the things they did? Do poppers really make someone that crazy? I also find it offensive that the film should exploit such beautiful music, such as part of the Goldberg Variations by Bach, and put this music in such an ugly setting. The first film was witty and made some good points. The second is only elevated by Anthony Hopkins' great performance. Apart from that, it's just plain ugly.</fullReview>

How do you blend the gruesome with the tasteful? I think that Mr Scott made a wonderful job with this movie even though there will be a legion of detractors complaning because they went to see another movie. I agree with the fact that some times the rythm is lost, but at the same time that is the main attraction of this movie. Just a little warning: this is not a Horror movie nor an Action movie.

		<fullReview>This is a very good review to a very good movie. Said this, I have to wonder what did all the people who has been attacking this film really expected from the sequel to the "Silence of the Lambs". You have to understand one thing first, on the "Silence..", Hannibal Lecter was an imprisoned man who played psychologically with the F.B.I. for the greater purpose of his escape, this gave the film a grey tone and maybe even a sad and depressed one that served it great. On "Hannibal", Dr. Lecter is a monster on the loose and fleeing from a greater danger than his renewed incarceration. How could anyone expect the film to force-copy the sad overtones of it's predecessor if the film centers on the run of Hannibal from his hunters? This film is more dynamic because the story it tells is very different from the one on the other two books. If anything, you have to feel simpathy with the evil guy and wish that everything turns out well for him and bad for the sadistic multimillionaire who is after him, but at the same time, the movie reminds you that Lecter is a sadistic killer himself and leaves you with the guilt of sharing that simpathy with him.. only until the end when you see clearly that the monster has a human side which the hunter lacked. Dr. Lecter has his motives but the hunter only had revenge on his twisted mind. The great thing about all this is that, deep down, it is an impossible love story. The film is great, the characters are well developed, and the performance of Sir Anthony Hopkins is the best! You have to go and see it even if you are one of those rare entities who haven't seen "The Silence of the Lambs".. but if you did saw it, go with your expectations high because a high reward is what you are gonna get.Just remember that Dr. Lecter is not just an average serial killer, but a killer who knows his prey and how to cook it. Have a great time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gobbling Of The Pigs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning: Contains Possible Spoilers)Did Thomas Harris fall asleep writing this story or Ridley Scott did directing it? I certainly almost did watching it.The movie starts with the hackneyed plot of our star agent bungling a drug bust through no fault of hers and then a pseudo hotshot investigator tries to take advantage of her situation. Lots of bullets, lots of bodies, (they even make the quarry a fully pregnant lady), our hero gets unjustifiably suspended and then takes matters into his own hands, or her hands in this case. Please, this corny crap has been used countless times in TV serials and cheap action movies, like some Bruce Willis flick - I am surprised Thomas Harris could even bring himself to write this!Then comes the ridiculous deformed character in wheelchair who somehow is super rich and powerful and who has such a superb network of intelligence and runners that they manage to catch Hannibal Lecter when for years the FBI failed despite him being on their ten most wanted list - Wah, am I watching a James Bond movie or what?!The story moves at a tedious pace with Ridley Scott crafting his pseudo artistic style more suitable to a reflective drama than a crime thriller. The suspense, if there is any, is as flat as walking through your neighbourhood grocery store.There is even such cheap thrill as hungry pigs eating humans. And the climax where Lecter does a haute cuisine of human brain, rather than being the stomach churner it was intended to be, instead looks delicious as watching a French master chef preparing his signature dish - it actually got me thinking of having pig brain for dinner! No kidding.And yeah, you may half expect Hannibal Lecter to break out "Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation..." when he bends over Clarice Starling.This movie is a prime example of the kind of product we get when greedy Hollywood executives try to cash in on a successful film by pushing the creation of a sequel. In the process, quality becomes trash, and The Silence Of The Lambs has become The Gobbling Of The Pigs.This movie would be forgivable if it is a typical Bruce Willis-type action flick. But with names like Ridley Scott, Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore and Thomas Harris, not to mention the formidable legacy of Silence - Hollywood has hit the pits of disgrace. I really could not give this film anything better than 4/10. Pig brain stew would be better value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK People! Get over it. This movie is not "The Silence of the Lambs". "Silence..." was not about Hannibal and there was still some gore. "Hannibal" is about Hannibal so duh, there is going to be more gore. And I am so sorry you could not follow the story line. Was it so hard to follow? This was a completely different movie than "Silence". And if you could not get over the fact that Jodi Foster wasn't in it then that's your problem. Julianne Moore did a wonderful job stepping in as Starling. It sounds to me that you just didn't go into the movie with an open mind. You were looking for "Silence..." all over again. What you got was something new. I am sorry you didn't like it. YOU LOSE.P.S. Try opening up your mind. You will enjoy things in life much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of David Mamet's considerable skills, the Agent Starling vs evil incarnate is wearing down. Julianne Moore earns her bucks for a skilled performance, but the device lacks credibility in this sequel to Silence of the Lambs. Hopkins is gorgeous, the master of understated camp, Giancarlo Gianno compelling, and Gary Oldman should get a medal for that almost anonymous performance. Cinematography takes the breath away, so the whole survives its weakening plot line. There's another hook at the end for a second sequel, and there should be one, but let's have David Cronenberg or Atom Agoyan take over, and restructure the main conflict. Offer Hopkins anything he wants, but scrap the Starling character. I must look up that music. What is it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost as bad as trashy talk-shows.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "Silence Of The Lambs" this film has created another call to our censors. However Thomas Harris's novel has been toyed with a little too much for this reviewers liking, with every element of the plot and characters dumbed down for the "Jerry Springer" watching audience.Hannibal is not a story for cheesy horror fans, yet it is presented in cheesy horror format. Director Ridley Scott (Alien, Bladerunner) has a flashy visual style (which was used to great effect in the 1992 flop "1492 Conquest Of Paradise") but can't manage the substance to give this film balance. Nor is the dialogue our two leads Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore have to contend with up to scratch leaving them with luck-lustre performances.Moore (Boogie Nights) has been set up to be verbally pounded, filling Jodie Foster's shoes as FBI Agent Clarice Starling. Not much direction, or worth in the script effectively waste an extremely talented actress, while Hopkins (Shadowlands) as our flesh eating fiend Hannibal attempts to work with his character but to no avail.Also wasted are "Goodfella's" Ray Liotta as Ray Krendler a fly in Agent Starlings ointment, and Gary Oldman (Romeo Is Bleeding) as Manson Verger, Hannibal's 4th victim (who in the book is scarier and far less goofy, although a fine job by the make-up department, aid Oldman who works harder than anyone else in the film).Alongside an ever growing list of factual and continuity errors, is my problem with the foreshadowing imagery of the book. The filmmakers have kept the imagery in the movie but in almost every case cut out the event which it was foreshadowing.Despite the stellar cast, no-one from scriptwriter Steven Zaillian (Awakenings) right up to director Scott, knows how to make this film stand alone. Scott (who possibly believes he's returned to form after the success of "Gladiator") should watch his first feature film "The Duellists" and realise what he was capable of without a huge budget.How author Thomas Harris can say he's pleased with the film is beyond me. This film had the potential to take viewers into the darkness and see through the looking glass, what's on the other side of a genius lost to evil. But sadly in its present state, I couldn't even recommend it as a budget video. Such a shame directors David Lynch (Blue Velvet) or David Fincher (Fight Club) weren't at the helm of this project.Perhaps their invigorating talents, might have been able to take this to the dizzying heights of our 1991 rendezvous with Hannibal, oh well, the way this is raking in the cash, one can hope they get offered shot the next sequel.Two Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>warning - - mild spoilers ahead.I'll be the first to admit, I went into this movie expecting a lot. Silence of the Lambs is one of my all time favorite movies. I knew Hannibal would have to work a bit to get over the fact that Jodie Foster was no longer Clarice, but based on the incredible talent of Anthony Hopkins, and based on the incredible quality of the previous movie, I figured they'd surmount that little problem without much difficulty. To their credit, you could almost forget that Clarice was played by a completely different person.I had also heard tons of stories from critics, coworkers, and friends about how much more gory this movie was. I figured that was just another way of saying "you're gonna see even more scenes with Hannibal killing people."The anticipation of the movie was great, which is a good thing because the actual movie was a huge letdown. There was only one really notable killing scene - - that being the now infamous brain-eating scene. The others were either handled mostly off-camera or completely unrealistic. For example, you cannot disembowel someone with one quick, imprecise stroke with a 73mm knife (the knife in question was a Spyderco Hawkbill, which is a folding knife used mainly by fishermen to cut nets). You can give them a nasty cut, but you can't remove all their organs.As for the gore factor, sure there were a couple of mildly gory scenes (the brain eating scene just wasn't that gory to me) but I thought the scene in Silence of the Lambs with the crucified cop was much more gory and intense than anything in Hannibal.Also, the suspense just wasn't there like it was in Lambs, and what suspense there was wasn't properly used. I can't count the number of times the creepy music would start up and I'd grin at my girlfriend and get all ready for a good Hannibal-eats-another-hapless-victim scene only to have absolutely nothing happen. I found myself bored through most of the movie.I went into Hannibal expecting a second incredible psycho-thriller and instead got a run of the mill movie in which there were a few interesting scenes that almost seemed to be thrown in just to give a little variety to the movie.</fullReview>

I kept looking at my watch wondering how long more I had to wait to get out! There's just too much babbling going on all the time, it drove me nuts!If anyone other than Ridley Scott had directed this film then I think the reviews would be slightly different. Basically after Gladiator he could do no wrong!Another thing is people think the gore is great in this film, yet if this amount was in Friday the 13th then people would want it banned!Overall I was VERY disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected much from this movie because it had a good director, Hopkins as the doctor and it was touted as having lots of gore. Oh, and it was the sequel to Silence of the Lambs... The beginning was nice (besides the awful opening credits and music)and I expected the slow pace would be a good build-up for the horrors to come. The problem is, the film takes too much time before anything happens, and when finally the pace picks up, everything goes way too fast! The beginning sets the mood quite nicely though, but the "action" and violence goes by way too hastily (except the last vomit-inducing scene..) and thus all the build-up is shattered, and the viewer is left very disappointed at the whole movie. If there is a slow build-up, there should be reward for the viewers´ patience, but there is very little satisfaction to be gained. Hopkins is good, but the script is nowhere near as good as in SotL, so he comes off less scary and powerful. Julianne Moore is good, but she´s no Jodie Foster. The editing was awful near the end of the movie and the scenes are quite patchy. And the music sucks big time... Overall, a disappointment. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How on earth this film managed to get an M 15+ rating (children under the age of 15 are allowed to see the film only when accompanied by an adult) in Australia for the first two weeks of its release will remain a mystery for me. The Australian censors obviously have gone quite mad (especially when films containing graphic sex scenes (non-violent) is deemed to be unsuitable for audiences at all, but graphic violence is fine). Rest assured, however, after public outcry the rating has been upped to R 18+, a far more suitable rating. Ok ... venting has been done. On to the film itself.Hannibal is a film you have to see, simply because you'll either love it or hate it. I don't think there can be an in-between. The story is simple enough. It's "Where's Wally (Waldo)" - but this time Wally is Hannibal and he's in Europe - somewhere. Agent Clarice Starling, after being disgraced in the line of duty, is put back on the Hannibal trail. There's a sub-plot of revenge, with Mason Verger, Hannibal's 4th and only surviving victim, bank-rolling Hannibal's capture.Some people may be disappointed with Clarice's character - she was a meek little thing, compared with Silence of the Lambs where she was a little fiestier. That's precisely the point! Clarice basically has a gag order on her the whole film, and Julianne Moore does a wonderful job with the frustration the character has to deal with. Sir Anthony is wonderfully chilling as Hannibal.While some of the scenes seemed, to me, to be a little implausible side of things, on the whole Hannibal is a great horror/suspence flick, but it does lack the panache and implied violence of Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal is just a little more (if you'll pardon the pun) in your face!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many aspects of this film has been misunderstood. First this is not a sequel but rather the third act of Thomas Harris's trinity concerning the rather extraordinary and odd confluences that effect the existence of Hannibal Lecter M.D. Renaissance Man. Understandably this film cannot be understood by anyone who hasn't had the great pleasure of reading the books in their original order. This film cannot be separated from the books due to the unintentional blunders of Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs. While Silence was a rather well directed suspense film it was however a botched adaptation of the second chapter of a trilogy. Gone are the metaphors and puzzles that characterize the communication style that Hannibal Lecter is bound to by the laws of the universe. I feel that Ridley Scott and Steve Zallian have honored the true intent of the books even by changing the ending. Nothing is what it appears to be. Ta Ta should be read as TA....TA. Get out your dictionary and peer into the minds and souls of Thomas Harris and Hannibal Lecter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ten years ago, Jonathan Demme and his « The Silence of the Lambs » marked a new era in the thrillers. He presented to the world a refined serial killer who captured the respect and admiration of the film lovers. Hannibal Lecter, as a character, had the strengh of a Rick Blaine, the awareness of a Don Vito Corleone and the fame of a Jams Bond. Demme brought Hopkins to life and Hopkins IS Lecter.Who better than Hopkins to give to the « Cannibal » that old Brithish coolness? However, ten years later, Demme gave place to Ridley Scott. A talented director, no doubt but it was not enough. The movie had much potencial. Saddenly, Julianne Moore was not a wise choice.She could not show the fragile side of Clarice Starling. Jodie could. Wonderfully. Unfortunately, the film was a bit of a deception. Too sadist, sometimes, as it was the novel. Hopkins saved it: he is the last of the Olivier's acting School.Also wonderful is the make-up of Gary Oldman (Mason Verger)and the scene of his death: Dantesque. The gore scene of Ray Liotta will win a deserved place in the History of the Movie pictures. Too little, however.Lecter deserved better...And for the younger generations that do not know Giancarlo Giannini, go to your videoshop and ask for a movie named « Seven Beauties»...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "Hannibal" has the same unfortunate problem as actor Jim Belushi: a more famous older brother. Just as Jim Belushi and his brother John have a lot in common, so do "Hannibal" and "Silence of the Lambs." And just like John Belushi was the better of the brothers, "Silence of the Lambs" still stands as the better film. Still, "Hannibal" has quite a lot to offer.The best joy of this film was its intriguing, original plot. While most sequels have to stretch to continue their stories, the events in "Hannibal" seem the logical output of "Lambs." This can be attributed to Thomas Harris' well written-book, and the contributions of dramatic bigwig David Mamet. I believe this a rare occasion where not reading the book is beneficial to the movie-viewing experience, as I hear there are some discrepancies between the two (I have not read the book, though I'm planning on it). Regardless, the excitement comes from the suspense, not knowing what is coming next.And in this story, it's hard to tell what will happen next. One of the first characters we meet is Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), a horribly disfigured, and horribly rich, former victim of Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins). Verger is bent on seeking revenge on the escaped Lecter. To do this, he uses former Hannibal guard Barney (Frankie Faison), and our heroine, FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore). Starling has just been involved in a FBI fiasco, and exploiting this, Verger lures Starling back into the Hannibal hunt. Of course, she faces opposition from within her department, in the form of Justice Department member Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta). However, once she tracks Lecter to Florence, Italy, she faces competition from foreign law official Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini). All the meanwhile, the sophisticated and (ahem) tasteful Lecter is up to his old tricks, sparked to re-enter crime as his arch nemesis rejoins the battle.So with all these old friends back together, who's missing? The most obvious is Jodie Foster in her Academy Award winning role as Starling. Much was made of her refusal of the sequel, and of her replacement, Julianne Moore. And how does Moore stack up? She is an acceptable replacement. She doesn't emulate the same frailty/strength issues as Foster did, nor the innocence or beauty. However, she has the same spunk and attitude, and actually makes Starling a little tougher, which would make sense after ten years of service in the FBI. Moore is never particularly jarring as Starling, but it would have been nice to have Foster back.Also gone is director Jonathan Demme, and in his place is the almost legendary Ridley Scott. The director of such classics as "Alien," "Blade Runner," and "Thelma and Louise," has been recently nominated for an Academy Award for a little film he did called "Gladiator." So what's he doing here? Actually, adding quite a bit of detail. While "Silence of the Lambs" excelled in character development, it was less strong in stylization and visuals. Scott has filled "Hannibal" with beautiful scenery, detailed action sequences, bizarre camera angles, and other minute pieces of detail which have come to be Scott's trademark.But guess who came back to play? Sir Hopkins is at his full form, playing quite possibly his favorite character. Lecter is less psychotic this time, more refined, but every bit as frightening. And after all this time, Hopkins still makes us hate and cheer for Lecter all at once. As for the rest of the cast, you get what you would expect: Oldman is effectively creepy, Giannini is shady and backstabbing, and Liotta is pretty straightforward. Though, towards the end, I noticed Liotta put a lot of thought into his performance."Hannibal" won't be the award-winning blockbuster its older brother was, but it is a very good sequel, and that's saying something in Hollywood today. With the parties involved giving it their all, it's a film that is only about a medium, where its predecessor was well-done.</fullReview>

However, once she tracks Lecter to Florence, Italy, she faces competition from foreign law official Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini). All the meanwhile, the sophisticated and (ahem) tasteful Lecter is up to his old tricks, sparked to re-enter crime as his arch nemesis rejoins the battle.So with all these old friends back together, who's missing? The most obvious is Jodie Foster in her Academy Award winning role as Starling. Much was made of her refusal of the sequel, and of her replacement, Julianne Moore. And how does Moore stack up? She is an acceptable replacement. She doesn't emulate the same frailty/strength issues as Foster did, nor the innocence or beauty. However, she has the same spunk and attitude, and actually makes Starling a little tougher, which would make sense after ten years of service in the FBI. Moore is never particularly jarring as Starling, but it would have been nice to have Foster back.Also gone is director Jonathan Demme, and in his place is the almost legendary Ridley Scott. The director of such classics as "Alien," "Blade Runner," and "Thelma and Louise," has been recently nominated for an Academy Award for a little film he did called "Gladiator." So what's he doing here? Actually, adding quite a bit of detail. While "Silence of the Lambs" excelled in character development, it was less strong in stylization and visuals. Scott has filled "Hannibal" with beautiful scenery, detailed action sequences, bizarre camera angles, and other minute pieces of detail which have come to be Scott's trademark.But guess who came back to play? Sir Hopkins is at his full form, playing quite possibly his favorite character. Lecter is less psychotic this time, more refined, but every bit as frightening. And after all this time, Hopkins still makes us hate and cheer for Lecter all at once. As for the rest of the cast, you get what you would expect: Oldman is effectively creepy, Giannini is shady and backstabbing, and Liotta is pretty straightforward. Though, towards the end, I noticed Liotta put a lot of thought into his performance."Hannibal" won't be the award-winning blockbuster its older brother was, but it is a very good sequel, and that's saying something in Hollywood today. With the parties involved giving it their all, it's a film that is only about a medium, where its predecessor was well-done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ALWAYS MESMERIZING. BRILLIANT, BIZARRE, AND ABSURD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The viewers have been waiting for 10 years to find out if it's as good as "Silence of the Lambs". No, not as good. This one is better. In fact, it's one of the two most frightening movies of all times, the other being "The Exorcist". HANNIBAL is really not a sequel but the third and most satisfying part of one very long and scary ride through the haunted place of abnormal psychiatry.This movie speaks to the imagination, to the feelings, to the passions, to exalted senses and to debased ones. I admit, HANNIBAL is not for everyone. I think they should put a "Warning!" right after the MGM lion. "If you're subject to nightmares, don't see it." Before you head to your nearest cineplex, ask yourself these questions. Do I want to faint with fright? Do I want to have my hair stand on end? Do I want to see an unforgettable thriller with equal parts of horror and suspense? If the answer is yes then run don't walk and you'll have to stand in line because HANNIBAL took another bite of the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong and Underdone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointing to say the least, is what I say about 'Hannibal'. I haven't read Thomas Harris' novel, so I can't judge if the movie is a step up or a step down. Judged on its own merits, 'Hannibal' is a slickly-produced, well-acted film, but it fails to generate much real suspense or tension throughout its elaborate proceedings.I have to agree with the critics: taking Hannibal Lecter out of his cell and out on the streets makes him least mysterious and interesting. What was so fascinating about Hannibal in 'Manhunter' and 'Silence of the Lambs' was how, despite his physical incarceration, he still had the power to get under a person's skin or into their very minds. And, like all good horror films, it was the implication of what he might do that intrigued far more than the acting out of it onscreen. In fact, when Lecter did finally cut loose in 'Lambs' to do in a pair of Tennessee cops, director Jonathan Demme wisely kept the gore low, but the atmosphere to the maximum. Ridley Scott lets blood, brains and intestines run freely in his film.In'Hannibal' we get to watch the good doctor hack and slice to his gourmet delight. Although it was entertaining to watch Anthony Hopkins back in action, and at times, the sheer relish he had with the role had an infectious (though demented) joy about it, there didn't seemed to be any real weight behind his actions.Julianne Moore did an fine job with her portrayal of Clarice Starling, and I didn't find myself missing Jodie Foster. The problem isn't with her acting, it's with the script. Though it is logical that in the intervening decade, Clarice would have become a harder, more battle-weary FBI expert, the story suffers because it was her innocence that made her dance with the demonic Lecter so fascinating. In 'Lambs', Clarice had challenges both external (as a trainee agent tracking down serial killer Buffalo Bill) and internal (matching wits with Lecter - a man who might eat your soul if not your liver). Here, she's more workmanlike in her approach, and because she doesn't scare as easily anymore, neither does the audience. In 'Lambs' we saw the world through Clarice's eyes, and shared in her fears and triumphs. It's impossible to watch 'Hannibal' without cynically thinking about how much the film (and the novel it was based on) are largely motivated with the public's fascination and desire for more Lecter product (evidenced by the awful serial killer knock-offs that followed 'Lambs'). Even the little continuity notes in the movie (Barney the orderly makes a return appearance, and Clarice listens to the tapes of her old conversations with Lecter - which now via Soviet-style revisionist history, have Moore's voice dubbed over Foster's) only seem intended to goad me into re-renting 'Lambs'. It seems to me that Harris and company simply failed to come up with anything really new or original to do with Hannibal and Clarice and felt content to re-hash what (apparently) worked before, though like many photocopies, beauty runs only skin deep. Let's hope that, despite the box-office bonanza the film is making for Universal, good taste prevails and the series is brought to a halt. At least before Hannibal goes the route of all movie monsters and we have to sit through 'Abbott and Costello Meet Hannibal Lecter'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silence of the Lambs is a drama -- Hannibal is a horror film. There's the difference - plain and simple.Harris is rumored to have resented the Hollywood call to create a sequel book that could be lifted and pasted into a film format. Well, I read Hannibal the book and really thought he'd gone too far. Clarice Starling isn't a literary character who will live forever such as Huckleberry Finn, but she was true and real. Hannibal's Clarice betrays the original book (and film).No, this isn't what I thought it would be. It is too Lector-centric. The beauty of Silence of the Lambs was that Lector was a supporting player. Here, he has to carry the film. It is too much and too in your face.The ending, although much more true to the Starling in the first film, is a gorefest.I've watched some of the goriest films ever put out there and my stomach literally turned - I thought I was going to vomit. This is really some gross stuff.....Would I see it again? (Hate to admit it, but - yeah- probably.)But be warned - this is a really really gross film - don't take the kids (like so many did when I saw it - they will be scarred for life from it).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopkins IS Hannibal Lecter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most disconcerting and unsettling criminals in the history of the cinema returns, in this long awaited sequel that finds him at large and free to pursue his own unique dining habits, in `Hannibal,' directed by Ridley Scott, and starring the inimitable Anthony Hopkins as the infamous gourmet, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The psychological games between Hannibal and everyone's favorite F.B. I. agent, Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore), that began in `The Silence of the Lambs,' continues here, though the tension that permeated `Lambs' has been significantly reduced, mainly due to the fact that this film lacks the immediacy of the original. Though Hannibal's presence is still coldly threatening, he simply hasn't that same sense of urgency about him in his freedom that he did in captivity. Seeing him in a `normal' setting is just much easier to assimilate than seeing him in that ominous isolation cell in which he resided when first introduced to an unsuspecting audience in 1991. Probably the most chilling aspect of the film is the fact that someone as unsound as Hannibal can with such facility mask his true identity and compulsions and function so effectively within society. It's like living among snakes without knowing which ones are venomous. As a viewer, watching him interact with others-- knowing what we do about him-- is unnerving in itself; and when things begin to heat up and he at last shows his hand, it accords the audience some relief, in the same sense as having an illness finally diagnosed so that you can begin the treatment which precludes healing. And any respite from the ambiguous horrors of the story is welcomed, since Scott has done a superb job of creating an atmosphere and mood that poise the audience for the worst of the definite atrocities that are obviously coming. As for the performance of Anthony Hopkins, it goes without saying at this point that he IS Hannibal Lecter. In reviving the role that won him an Oscar for Best Actor, he brings that same icy countenance to the screen, that same reserved manner and eyes that reflect an emptiness of soul, all of which creates an illusion of invulnerability about him. He presents a portrait of someone who is quite capable of perpetrating acts so dark that even shadows could not prevail upon them. And taking into account the intelligence of Lecter, and the calculating methods he employs in carrying out his heinous deeds, it makes his presence all the more disquieting, more so even than that of Norman Bates (as played by Anthony Perkins) in Hitchcock's `Psycho.' If at all a case could be made that there is a weak link in the film, it would have to be the presence of Julianne Moore; but it would be a tough case to make inasmuch as Moore cannot be held directly responsible for it. She simply had a nearly impossible task in attempting to fill the shoes of Jodie Foster, who made such an indelible impression as Clarice in `Lambs,' for which she received the Oscar for Best Actress. Moore is a gifted actress, and her performance here is quite capably realized, but she doesn't quite capture that spark of intimacy that Foster's Clarice had with Hannibal, and consequently what passes between them does not evoke that same sense of dread and apprehension that was so vividly felt before. Moore must be given credit, however, for a noble effort-- she does give a good performance here-- but taking over a part that Foster had made so intrinsically her own was a task that was just too insurmountable. The supporting cast includes Giancarlo Giannini (Rinaldo Pazzi), Francesca Neri (Laura Pazzi), Gary Oldman (Mason Verger), Ray Liotta (Paul Krendler), Alex Corrado (Piero), Zeljko Ivanek (Dr. Doemling), Spike Jonze (Donnie) and Frankie Faison (Barney). There are some fairly graphic scenes in this film, but with the exception of one near the end, they all play out very quickly; this is not, after all, merely another `slice ?em and dice ?em' slasher film. Scott presents the story in such a way that the audience is psychologically and emotionally primed to see more than is actually shown; this is simply good filmmaking. But be advised: Some of it will be a bit too strong for some. In the end, `Hannibal,' though falling short of the level of excellence of `Silence of the Lambs,' is still a film that makes the ten years or so it took to bring it to the screen worth the wait. Not for the squeamish nor those with a fragile psyche, it is a film, however, for those who would sojourn into regions beyond the known; if it is the dark places you seek, this one should more than fit the bill. I rate this one 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice blend of gory, mystery, and suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having never saw The Silence of the Lambs since it first came out, I could barely remember the premise of the movie when I went to see Hannibal. I think this worked in my favor. I wasn't trying to compare the two films together and was, perhaps, able to enjoy this film more than some others.Mild Spoilers AheadThe opening was a very typical Hollywood product, where a gun fight was used to "hook" the audience's interest and to provide the momentum for the next act. The pace slowed during the second act, when the script was trying to establish the major characters. This was where we get to know their motivations and their personalities. This part receives the most criticism on my part because I felt the characters could be developed more. This act is slow but there is that beautiful score by Patrick Cassidy "Vide Cor Meum" that grabs your attention every time it comes on. Nevertheless, the ending was very good, which propelled beyond the usual nice-and-tidy Hollywood ending. The writers definitely were planning on another sequel.End SpoilersI do vaguely remember the Silence of the Lambs. And I have to admit that this film doesn't compare to what I remember about the original. But, this film stands well on its own. There were moments when the dark humor used in the movie that could send you giggling and shivering at the same time. If it is not titled "Hannibal: the sequel to Silence of the Lambs", then perhaps people wouldn't be as critical on this film if it was "just another horror film". And by the way, you have got to check out that song sung during the opera scene "Vide Cor Meum" (which is also played again near the end). That song is incredibly beautiful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more and less than what you've heard (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it is understandable everyone has differing standards and expectations for a sequel to a truly great movie, still I am astounded at some of the reviews on this movie. Both professionals and everyday movie-goers. I read the book, have seen and read Silence of the Lambs (SoTL), seen Manhunter. I had read nearly every review out there on this movie before seeing this and it seemed that there were two different movies called "Hannibal" out in the theatres. I wasn't sure what the extreme variation in opinions and reviews meant, this would either be the worst movie I've ever seen or possibly the best. It is neither the worst nor best movie ever made. However it is more (better or more intense) in some ways, and less (worse or less intense) in other areas of expectation. You have to know the background of the characters, need to know SoTL. Just don't go in expecting the style and the characters to be exactly the same after many years (in the story and in our reality). They are not and shouldn't be the same given passing years and differing circumstances. That said, I felt this was less horror and more thriller drama than many reviews would lead you to believe. Read on for why I say that.There is far less blood and gore than what you have heard... that people might have puked at this movie I find laughable. Maybe having read the book version of Hannibal it toughened me up, I expected more disturbing material, more gore. The rants on the 'over-the-top' nature of this movie and it should be NC-17 were just plain alarmist. Anyone who has seen a horror movie made in the last 20 - 25 years (going back to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) should not have a problem in this area. I can be squeamish and nightmare prone and I was able to watch all the scenes with only a bit of squinting to blur it now and then, more in fear (from the books detail and reviews) than how bad the visuals really were. The brain eating dinner scene was as much laughable as it was frightening or sickening. (And I believe this was purposeful, a bit of camp). It might shock a bit, but this is not THE most in amount nor in intensity of gore ever seen on the screen. Far less gore than Saving Private Ryan. Just before going to the theatre to see Hannibal a sci-fi movie on television rated Y -14 was playing. It had giant alien bugs tearing futuristic soldiers apart that was similiar to the level of gore with the man-eating pigs in Hannibal. Some people find the man-eating pig implausible, some extra information spent on that aspect might have helped. Verger's face was not as bad as I visualized it from reading the book, but looked plausible and still nasty. They took the very disturbing NC-17 level material in the book and got it down to R material. Not all that is for the better, some at the expense of character development - Mason Verger needed fleshed out (ha ha pun intended) in particular who was clearly evil in the book.One complaint was that certain gore scenes were unnecessary. The tape of the attack on the nurse alluded to in SoTL being one of those. It WAS needed and perfectly fit in the plot. This is where Lecter's arm is broken for a comparative x-ray to the one Mason Verger supplies. This showing how Lecter even tied up was so dangerous, his bite there will be what Starling thinks about when Lecter feigns a bite at the refrigerator scene later on. The disfiguring of Mason Verger flashback might have been skipped. This doesn't detail the type of hypnotic drugs described in the book, but seeing Lecter mesmorize the drugged man into cutting off his face probably had some merit to the hypnotic power of the man (in reading the book this scene did about make me gag, it was blurry and dark for the most part in the movie). The disembowelment was perfectly in line with the historical event of Pazzi's ancestor and Pazzi was less than honorable in making sure the street thug bled to death. You really didn't see that much in the disembowelment, a pile of guts splat. Itchy and Scratchy from the Simpson's has more graphic broad daylight detail shown in their cartoon mutilations. The dinner scene, well he isn't called Hannibal the Cannibal for nothing. What do people expect? He is choosing the most appropriate punishment for Krendler. What does a brainless man need with his brain? Might as well get a gourmet meal out of it, and he can avenge the honor of Clarice at the same time.The interactions between Hopkins and Moore don't have quite the same effect that those between Hopkins and Foster did in SoTL. It is less psychologically intense, more cat and mouse especially in the carousel scene. But was it supposed to be the same? Probably not because this is a different movie with a different focus. Clarice isn't a green FBI trainee but a time and experience hardened law enforcement officer. Hannibal is not behind glass or bars restricted to only "quid pro quo" fun. He is definately in love-mode here, he teases and wants, he pursues Clarice so she can chase him. She gives him some reason to be excited, to "come out of retirement," to fully appreciate his freedom by truly risking it by going to her. He desires to help her out of her quandry as he had helped her catch Buffalo Bill. The same yet different from SoTL. We can try to say the only reason Clarice risks her career to go save Lecter from Mason Verger's pigs is she is simply doing "right" regardless. I think that makes it too black and white, it is right but she couldn't and wouldn't have Lecter killed also because she does care for him. She is torn between her duty and right and feelings for the man.Right wins in a way when the handcuffs are put on at the refrigerator - ask yourself why didn't she take and use her gun? She didn't want to be put into a position of using it against him. She isn't always happy doing the right thing. Like shooting a drug dealing HIV positive woman carrying a baby when she has no other choice. She would have felt guilty if Lecter had been imprisoned again, for him that is worse than death, she absolutely didn't want to kill him. This is some deep stuff hidden in this - Clarice feeling bad for doing the right thing, finding that doing the right thing can cause you to be punished unjustly, that doing the right thing can in a way be a bad thing. You are getting a bit more here then just good Clarice and evil Hannibal. There is a treading of common ground, two people who "have" to kill. How far removed is Clarice's killing in the line of duty or self-defense from Hannibal's killing in self-defense and killing the "rude" he feels the earth would be better off without? The main difference, outside of legalities - Hannibal being a bizarre vigilante, is in how it effects you. If Clarice keeps looking into the abyss (having to kill and having to be intimate with the mind of a killer) will she eventually see the abyss looking back? ... Hannibal doesn't fear the abyss but rather embraces it as his code of honor and morality. At the end Hannibal tho' smitten with Clarice isn't looking to run away with her ala the book end. He saw the phone line light and knew he had limited time to complete what he had started, he wanted her to do the right thing. Hannibal actually respects and admires her ethics. He wanted to give her a good-bye kiss then is going to run FROM her knowing she will continue the pursuit. He wants her to pursue, and he to turn the tables again later. Some quid pro quo, some cat and mouse, sequel time. Hey, SoTL was left W-I-D-E open for a sequel as well.Straight up excellent performances from the cast given the material. The drug bust was very detailed action and let us see the new Clarice as we should. The hardened, experienced, unappreciated law enforcement officer that she bacame over the years. The scenes and filming in Italy, the Italian police officer Pazzi... just excellent. This IS Hannibal's world and gives some thriller drama over horror aspects. The scenes in the states between Clarice and Hannibal in the carousel, cat and mouse detective for Clarice. Her rescue of Hannibal more of an action scene than horror I'd say. We get to see Hannibal as surgeon sewing up Clarice, we get 'the picture' of what Hannibal would like from her (eventually, he's patient) when she wakes up dressed for dinner in the low cut evening gown. Ninety percent of this movie was thriller, action, drama and not slasher horror.Overall the filming was excellent, the visuals were gore enough apparently to traumatize some but not much more than what was needed to convey the story. Some holes in the plot mainly not giving us the clear picture of Verger's crimes and evil nature. Read the book and you'd push him into the pig pit yourself. The ending of this movie was just short of satisfying and we are led to believe Hannibal sacrificed his hand... yet, I bet we'll see a 2-handed Lecter in the sequel to this. I personally could have lived without the brain eating dinner scene and would have prefered more time with Clarice and Hannibal alone interacting. Still this a movie about a cannibalistic killer, so something like that brain scene isn't out of place... maybe we need to feel less "romantic" about our favorite cannibal killer Hannibal. Still the brain dinner scene was a bit of a dive into campy B-grade territory. The ending of SoTL versus Hannibal makes the difference in how these two movies are regarded I think. Despite some flaws this is a very good movie. As far as sequels go I'd say it is close to excellent.Sorry so long-winded, but I didn't see this until the 3rd weekend out and had heard so much I thought was misleading about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the heck is Jodie Foster?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard from the critics that "Hannibal" was a boring film that didn't reach the level of the first part, "The Silence of the lambs". In my opinion, they are two very different films. You have to think that in 10 years the film industry have evolved a lot. I don't know if it has evolved to better or worse, but I think "Hannibal" is better than lots of productions with enormous budgets.The points that I would like to remark from the film are:- Brilliant performance of Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore as Dr. Lecter and Clarice Starling, even though the character of the Special Agent was better performed by Jodie Foster. I would say it's a pity not having Jodie Foster in the film, 'cause the connection between Hopkins and Foster was unbelievable. Also a mention for Gary Oldman as the 4th Lecter's Victim.- Excellent photography and camera plans in all the movie. When the film occurs in Florence, you can feel the charm of the city (I almost thought that some settings were taken from "Gladiator" ^_^). - Ridley Scott, always surprising the audience with innovations in the 7th art.EXTREME SPOILER AHEAD. DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM. BEEN WARNED :) Scroll down to the ending if you don't want to read the spoiler.But one bad point in the film is the end scene. I mean, a film that has got style and is a bit slow in several moments, can't end in that way, with this crude scene of cannibalism. In my opinion that's one of the most grotesque scenes I've never seen before. Lots of people will say that is impossible to live with the head opened and with the brain out, but it is possible. As Dr. Lecter says: "the brain itself doesn't feel pain". A brilliant doctor indeed.Anyway, "Hannibal" is a very good film. One of the most awaited films is now in the theaters. Is it as good as expected? I don't know. I just say that Ridley Scott, Anthony Hopkins and the rest of the crew have created a masterpiece that will be remembered in time. At least Hannibal Lecter hasn't got any evidence of spongiform encephalopathy for eating brain :) Go and see it, worth look! 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>===== Rating System: ***** Must see **** Very good *** I liked it, but you might hate it ** I hated it, but you might like it * Avoid =====I was going to bring structure and logic in this comment, but since the writers (!!!) of Hannibal didn't bother either, here it is...Positive aspects: Gary Oldman's make-up was brilliant...The murder sequences are really well done, only the Scream-factor is a little too high...The film is consistently entertaining...Some of the acting is pretty good...The pigs...THAT final Dinner Sequence!!!...The music is excellent. Negative aspects: Hannibal Lecter is twice as much in this as in Silence, but he is not half as scary...Clarice Starling's character is totally unnecessary and forgettable...There was a focus on too many characters, which made the film confusing and uninteresting...The photography of the first action sequence is the same as in Saving Private Ryan and Gladiator; very original...There was little to no plot, the film has no real beginning, middle or end...There was no suspense whatsoever...The way Hannibal acts to Clarice and vice versa makes you think Silence never happened...Silence's Hannibal was a real psychopath, In Hannibal he seems like a standard slasher character...The film is too long, and doesn't seem to have a real point...I don't remember Hannibal's shift from Venice to America, pretty confusing...There film doesn't seem to give its audience anything to solve, like Buffalo Bill in Silence, misses the excellent climax it needs so badly.An entertaining film but could have been so much better and feels a little disappointing afterwards because expectations are too high. It's a little like Speed 2 and Batman and Robin. (not so highly) Recommended.***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hannibal" is the long awaited sequel to the Oscar-winning 1991 movie "The Silence of the Lambs". It's a good film but can't match up to its predecessor. Anthony Hopkins reprises his Oscar-winning role as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who as you may recall escaped from his jail cell in the original movie. 10 years after the events in "Silence", Hannibal is still at large and very much in hiding. FBI agent Clarice Starling (now played by Julianne Moore taking over for Jodie Foster) still wonders where he could be. One of the good things about "Hannibal" is the acting of course. Hopkins is back in fine form here, and Moore is good too (if not quite as compelling as Foster was in "Silence"). There are other major assets as well. The story kept me interested throughout, the Italy locations are beautiful (where Lecter is hiding out), and the film score by Hans Zimmer is very creepy and suspensful. But one thing turned me off in "Hannibal", and that is the graphic violence although I expected to see it here. "Silence of the Lambs" was a violent movie too, but this one is more violent. There are some very gruesome and disturbing scenes in this film, and quite frankly I'm surprised that the movie wasn't slapped with an NC-17 rating. "Hannibal" is not loaded with one violent scene after another, but when the violence does comes into the picture, prepare to see lots of blood. Nevertheless, I'm just barely giving "Hannibal" a mild recommendation because inspite of all those disgusting moments, it's a well acted and gripping thriller. However, "The Silence of the Lambs" is a much better film.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal seems to me something of a missed opportunity, not that it isn't stunningly filmed and acted. Anthony Hopkins has once again turned in a brilliant performance and Julianne Morris performs well in the shadow of Jodie Foster. The musical score adds to the films atmosphere and the film is worth seeing for the stunning backdrop provided by Florence (surely the perfect setting for Dr Lecter). I would have considered this film a classic except for the travesty of the last half an hour. It was always going to be difficult to translate the ending of the book into visual form, both for practical and reasons of taste. It seems that the script-writers haven't bothered, instead we get the gore and none of the explanations or psychological elements that the rest of the story is leading to. Thomas Harris managed against all odd to produce a book that surpassed what had gone before. The film with all the positive points it has does not. My advice is to see the film but if you have half a brain leave after Lecter is captured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequel surpasses Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing these days about Hollywood films is that they waste time on poor sequels. This is NOT the case in Hannibal. This movie was extremely well acted by Sir Anthony Hopkins and most of all by Julianne Moore. This movie also had its good share of really shocking parts that really helped the movie get as good as it is. I dont want to ruin the ending, but it is definitely CLASSIC. You only need to see this movie once to remember it. Usually I frown upon sequels overall, because they try and re-use old tricks from the original. You don't need to see "Silence of the Lambs" to see this, because this movie really follows around Hannibal rather than use him like in SOTL to solve another plot point. It almost makes you feel as if this movie isn't a "sequel", if you will, but more like a spin off. This was a great movie and you should definitely see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoiled by the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could say that this film was appalling, but as I'd heard a few things about it ...*** SPOLIER HERE ***I'd seen on TV that the last scene involved somebody eating his own brain, the second last scene involved pigs attempting to eat Hannibal, the line "I've been thinking about eating your wife" or whatever... At this point I should also point out that ACE-122 claimed that Hannibal was taken off the 10 Most Wanted - only to mysteriously reappear - Verger insisted that he reappear - this is not a mistake in the movie - even on first viewing this is obvious ...*** END SPOILER ***so basically the 3 major plot points were spoiled - and its very hard to enjoy a movie under those conditions...However, what makes me think that the movie was bad are : lack of plot, lack of character development, a lack of suspense, and a rather obscene idea that its ok to be a serial killer as long as you kill bad people. Was that the message of the film or was its message lost on me?As a movie its ok - but Hannibal comes off as far less threatening; Silence implied alot of things about Hannibal, and once you see him knock off a few people, you start to think that he's just another killer, not really a serial killer.The acting is fine, though some of the characters are not fully developed. The real problem with this movie is that it is predictable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>so finally the long-awaited lecter saga is here, with not-so thrilling main cast (what does julianne moore doing?) and surprising director ('gladiator's' ridley scott), and the unpredictable gary oldman, all combined with highly- appreciated anthony hopkins, presenting the controversial thomas harris sequel to the silence of the lambs.hannibal is here.in a stunning opening (surely ridley scott's trademark), the saga flows in a-quite slow but entertaining scheme. when i say entertaining, surely is not brilliant.still it's definitely proves to be exceed it's previous movies in other ways.thomas harris' red dragon is adapted into manhunter, an interesting movie in an 80's style and slow wit. it is indeed most 'normal' hannibal. the silence of the lambs shows us a definite side of human sickness and brilliant novel-adaptation. hannibal exceed the others with it's terror and gruesome.one thing for sure, if you like the way agent starling presented, played by jodie foster and characterised by thomas harris in the silence of the lambs, you might find her difficult to accept in hannibal. apart from julianne moore's effort to show the other side of clarice starling, thomas harris presentation of agent starling in hannibal is proven to be an emphasize to built hannibal character,rather than polishing starling own character. the agent has become a complementary character to show the villains' gruesome.if you are indeed a thriller and gruesome-blood fan, i promise you, 'hannibal' is indeed your movie.if you stuck with the silence of the lambs (both stories and casts), i think you'd find it difficult to enjoy this movie.apart from that, this movie deliver a strange mood that makes you adore the cannibal's personalities, yet his moves to satisfy us.-x-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more and less than what you've heard (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it is understandable everyone has differing standards and expectations for a sequel to a truly great movie, still I am astounded at some of the reviews on this movie. Both professionals and everyday movie-goers. I read the book, have seen and read Silence of the Lambs (SoTL), seen Manhunter. I had read nearly every review out there on this movie before seeing this and it seemed that there were two different movies called "Hannibal" out in the theatres. I wasn't sure what the extreme variation in opinions and reviews meant, this would either be the worst movie I've ever seen or possibly the best. It is neither the worst nor best movie ever made. However it is more (better or more intense) in some ways, and less (worse or less intense) in other areas of expectation. You have to know the background of the characters, need to know SoTL. Just don't go in expecting the style and the characters to be exactly the same after many years (in the story and in our reality). They are not and shouldn't be the same given passing years and differing circumstances. That said, I felt this was less horror and more thriller drama than many reviews would lead you to believe. Read on for why I say that.There is far less blood and gore than what you have heard... that people might have puked at this movie I find laughable. Maybe having read the book version of Hannibal it toughened me up, I expected more disturbing material, more gore. The rants on the 'over-the-top' nature of this movie and it should be NC-17 were just plain alarmist. Anyone who has seen a horror movie made in the last 20 - 25 years (going back to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) should not have a problem in this area. I can be squeamish and nightmare prone and I was able to watch all the scenes with only a bit of squinting to blur it now and then, more in fear (from the books detail and reviews) than how bad the visuals really were. The brain eating dinner scene was as much laughable as it was frightening or sickening. (And I believe this was purposeful, a bit of camp). It might shock a bit, but this is not THE most in amount nor in intensity of gore ever seen on the screen. Far less gore than Saving Private Ryan. Just before going to the theatre to see Hannibal a sci-fi movie on television rated Y -14 was playing. It had giant alien bugs tearing futuristic soldiers apart that was similiar to the level of gore with the man-eating pigs in Hannibal. Some people find the man-eating pig implausible, some extra information spent on that aspect might have helped. Verger's face was not as bad as I visualized it from reading the book, but looked plausible and still nasty. They took the very disturbing NC-17 level material in the book and got it down to R material. Not all that is for the better, some at the expense of character development - Mason Verger needed fleshed out (ha ha pun intended) in particular who was clearly evil in the book.One complaint was that certain gore scenes were unnecessary. The tape of the attack on the nurse alluded to in SoTL being one of those. It WAS needed and perfectly fit in the plot. This is where Lecter's arm is broken for a comparative x-ray to the one Mason Verger supplies. This showing how Lecter even tied up was so dangerous, his bite there will be what Starling thinks about when Lecter feigns a bite at the refrigerator scene later on. The disfiguring of Mason Verger flashback might have been skipped. This doesn't detail the type of hypnotic drugs described in the book, but seeing Lecter mesmorize the drugged man into cutting off his face probably had some merit to the hypnotic power of the man (in reading the book this scene did about make me gag, it was blurry and dark for the most part in the movie). The disembowelment was perfectly in line with the historical event of Pazzi's ancestor and Pazzi was less than honorable in making sure the street thug bled to death. You really didn't see that much in the disembowelment, a pile of guts splat. Itchy and Scratchy from the Simpson's has more graphic broad daylight detail shown in their cartoon mutilations. The dinner scene, well he isn't called Hannibal the Cannibal for nothing. What do people expect? He is choosing the most appropriate punishment for Krendler. What does a brainless man need with his brain? Might as well get a gourmet meal out of it, and he can avenge the honor of Clarice at the same time.The interactions between Hopkins and Moore don't have quite the same effect that those between Hopkins and Foster did in SoTL. It is less psychologically intense, more cat and mouse especially in the carousel scene. But was it supposed to be the same? Probably not because this is a different movie with a different focus. Clarice isn't a green FBI trainee but a time and experience hardened law enforcement officer. Hannibal is not behind glass or bars restricted to only "quid pro quo" fun. He is definately in love-mode here, he teases and wants, he pursues Clarice so she can chase him. She gives him some reason to be excited, to "come out of retirement," to fully appreciate his freedom by truly risking it by going to her. He desires to help her out of her quandry as he had helped her catch Buffalo Bill. The same yet different from SoTL. We can try to say the only reason Clarice risks her career to go save Lecter from Mason Verger's pigs is she is simply doing "right" regardless. I think that makes it too black and white, it is right but she couldn't and wouldn't have Lecter killed also because she does care for him. She is torn between her duty and right and feelings for the man.Right wins in a way when the handcuffs are put on at the refrigerator - ask yourself why didn't she take and use her gun? She didn't want to be put into a position of using it against him. She isn't always happy doing the right thing. Like shooting a drug dealing HIV positive woman carrying a baby when she has no other choice. She would have felt guilty if Lecter had been imprisoned again, for him that is worse than death, she absolutely didn't want to kill him. This is some deep stuff hidden in this - Clarice feeling bad for doing the right thing, finding that doing the right thing can cause you to be punished unjustly, that doing the right thing can in a way be a bad thing. You are getting a bit more here then just good Clarice and evil Hannibal. There is a treading of common ground, two people who "have" to kill. How far removed is Clarice's killing in the line of duty or self-defense from Hannibal's killing in self-defense and killing the "rude" he feels the earth would be better off without? The main difference, outside of legalities - Hannibal being a bizarre vigilante, is in how it effects you. If Clarice keeps looking into the abyss (having to kill and having to be intimate with the mind of a killer) will she eventually see the abyss looking back? ... Hannibal doesn't fear the abyss but rather embraces it as his code of honor and morality. At the end Hannibal tho' smitten with Clarice isn't looking to run away with her ala the book end. He saw the phone line light and knew he had limited time to complete what he had started, he wanted her to do the right thing. Hannibal actually respects and admires her ethics. He wanted to give her a good-bye kiss then is going to run FROM her knowing she will continue the pursuit. He wants her to pursue, and he to turn the tables again later. Some quid pro quo, some cat and mouse, sequel time. Hey, SoTL was left W-I-D-E open for a sequel as well.Straight up excellent performances from the cast given the material. The drug bust was very detailed action and let us see the new Clarice as we should. The hardened, experienced, unappreciated law enforcement officer that she bacame over the years. The scenes and filming in Italy, the Italian police officer Pazzi... just excellent. This IS Hannibal's world and gives some thriller drama over horror aspects. The scenes in the states between Clarice and Hannibal in the carousel, cat and mouse detective for Clarice. Her rescue of Hannibal more of an action scene than horror I'd say. We get to see Hannibal as surgeon sewing up Clarice, we get 'the picture' of what Hannibal would like from her (eventually, he's patient) when she wakes up dressed for dinner in the low cut evening gown. Ninety percent of this movie was thriller, action, drama and not slasher horror.Overall the filming was excellent, the visuals were gore enough apparently to traumatize some but not much more than what was needed to convey the story. Some holes in the plot mainly not giving us the clear picture of Verger's crimes and evil nature. Read the book and you'd push him into the pig pit yourself. The ending of this movie was just short of satisfying and we are led to believe Hannibal sacrificed his hand... yet, I bet we'll see a 2-handed Lecter in the sequel to this. I personally could have lived without the brain eating dinner scene and would have prefered more time with Clarice and Hannibal alone interacting. Still this a movie about a cannibalistic killer, so something like that brain scene isn't out of place... maybe we need to feel less "romantic" about our favorite cannibal killer Hannibal. Still the brain dinner scene was a bit of a dive into campy B-grade territory. The ending of SoTL versus Hannibal makes the difference in how these two movies are regarded I think. Despite some flaws this is a very good movie. As far as sequels go I'd say it is close to excellent.Sorry so long-winded, but I didn't see this until the 3rd weekend out and had heard so much I thought was misleading about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good, but not "filling"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is beautifully shot, incredibly acted, superbly scored and at times gut-wrenchingly gruesome. However, the script is variable, some very unfunny jokes tossed in, and the story, which I won't go into detail with exactly how and why, seems a bit weak.The premise is simple. Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is the top female FBI agent. An attempted drug arrest goes wrong, and Starling is left with egg on her face. She is put back onto the case of Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to give her an opportunity to, ahem, get her teeth into something. Lecter has been whereabouts unknown for 10 years. An Italian detective named Pazzi (Giancarlo Gianni) stumbles across Lecter unknowingly during another case and via checking the FBI most wanted website suddenly realises that he has a huge reward possibly staring him in the face. Clarice contacts Pazzi with regard to a security tape which confirms Lecter's presence in Florence, but Pazzi wants the 3 million dollar reward on offer from the gruesomely disfigured Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) who suffered at Hannibal's hands some years before and is out for revenge. That's the bare bones of the story in the first half and the film starts brightly, at a good pace and creating a great atmosphere. The pace drops in the middle and certain questions you can't help but ask. How does Hannibal, one of the FBI's 10 most wanted, fly on a public jumbo jet from Florence to the US with consumate ease? OK, the guy is a master criminal but y'know? Anyway the action moves to the US and Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta - hey long time no see!) ;who has some sort of no-brain macho mindset and is trying to stymie Starling's faltering career; comes more into the story a bit more.My main problem with this film was it's ending. Not to give anything away, but I was really getting into the film and it just sort of finished. I was entertained but felt a little short changed by the suddenness of it, and was genuinely surprised and disappointed when the credits rolled. This may be, I admit, because the story didn't develop how I'd expected it to, and hey, that's my fault I suppose. But the movie had promised a little more in it's starter and main course to leave me with a rather annoying lack of pudding(not that I was really hungry after the end, you understand).But still, well worth watching and one that you think about after you've seen it.. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BADLY CONCEIVED SEQUEL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really should have known better, considering all the "iffy" at best scuttle and the so-called "problems" bringing a SILENCE OF THE LAMBS sequel to the big screen. Numerous rewrites, Jodie Foster turning the role down, Jonathan Demme not wanting in, etc. Somehow, somewhere I had hoped for the best, being as enamored by the good doctor that I am, and plunked the money down.First, the tumultuous lack of chemistry between Julianne Moore and Anthony Hopkins, didn't help. They acted like they were some old couple that got on each others nerves frequently. Second, the script jostled from one direction to the other, and it showed, badly. The predictability ratio was also too high, basically numbing the screenplay down to the IQ of a poptart. Instead of slick, well-infused, suspenseful dialogue, a lot of gross-out graphics were thrown in to compensate. Worst of all, is the character Hannibal Lecter, himself. The script, and the portrayal itself, was presented as cartoonish and a mocking self-parody. Very different from the Dr. Lecter that scared the daylights out of us, years ago. Now, he's just a whacko, sans style and wit. Frankly, it came off like just another slasher flick.On the upside, Florence is still a magnificent city, and picturesque, as always. Oh, and this is somewhat better than the ill-fated movie: THE SILENCE OF THE HAMS. Sometimes, it does pay to believe what you read.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that in the SOTL has very awesome parts through the dialogue, but in the violence is soo....cold. The people go to the movies of serial killers, ?for what? for seeing him taking a cup of cofee?? No!!! To see him in action and here that action is awesomely shot. First of all, the performance of Sir Anthony Hopkins is awesome, more chilling that in SOTB. His touch of dark humor to every assassination is perfect, in the middle of the end of the final "dinner" I have myself laughing and think" ?How the f--k did they do that? Julianne Moore I think put more heart and action that Jodie Foster, in SOTB Joide was smart and quiet but here Clarice is very "free" to do everything he wants. The most surprising performance of the movie to me was of Gary Oldman, first of all the makeup that is thrilling and awesome and the same time. About the "alternative" ending I think its surprising and very romantic at the same time.Not be surprised that in the next OSCARS this is nominated for at least 8 or 9 awards, including best screenplay adapted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not "Silence of the Lambs" 2. Ridley Scott's "Hannibal" is its own drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You might say it's a high-class murder mystery - well, "mystery" only if you don't know Anthony Hopkins' Dr. Lecter. (And if you've seen him in Julie Taymor's "Titus" 1999, you'd even have a clue to the plot ending.) Suspenseful, only depends on how you take the scenes. Scary, not really; it's theatrical. It's also a colorful cast: besides Hopkins, and Julianne Moore as FBI agent "Clarice Starling", there's also Gary Oldman (behind heavy makeup), Ray Liotta, and Giancarlo Giannini from Italy.Jonathan Demme's "Silence of the Lambs, The" 1991 has its horror, intensity, and cerebral psychological drama. Director ("Insider" 2000) Michael Mann's "Manhunter" 1986 - script was by Mann adapting Lambs' writer, Thomas Harris' novel "Red Dragon," which included Dr. Lecter - is an equally taut psycho thriller of an FBI agent going after a serial killer; it was a substantial solid role for actor William Peterson."Hannibal" is NFE (Not For Everyone). Here's some recommendations of other works by:RIDLEY SCOTT - his directorial debut "Duellists, The" 1977, with Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel, costume swordsmen drama with beautiful foliage settings; and the very first "Alien" 1979; the fantasy sci-fi "Blade Runner" 1982; the incomparable "Thelma and Louise" 1991.ANTHONY HOPKINS - a more calming role in "84 Charing Cross Road" 1986, with Anne Bancroft, especially for book lovers; also "Shadowlands" 1993, with Debra Winger, based on true events.JULIANNE MOORE - in 1999, she gave substantial performances in 5 films: "Cookie's Fortune", " Ideal Husband, An", "End of the Affair, The", "Map of the World, A", "Magnolia"; also try ("Velvet Goldmine" 1998) director Todd Haynes' "Safe" 1995, you'd see Julianne Moore at her best.GARY OLDMAN - he produced "Contender, The" 2000, gave a terrific performance as the nemesis opposite Joan Allen; try "Romeo Is Bleeding" 1993, playing opposite a feisty Lena Olin as the evil force.RAY LIOTTA - try him in Jonathan Demme's "Something Wild" 1986, deliciously wicked playing opposite Jeff Daniels and Melanie Griffith; of course, he's very good in Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas" 1990.GIANCARLO GIANNINI - he has done numerous films with Italian writer-director Lina Wertmüller, like the controversial "Swept Away" 1975; he was in ("Like Water for Chocolate" 1992) Mexican director Alfonso Arau "Walk in the Clouds, A" 1995 with Keanu Reeves and Anthony Quinn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps people enjoy being negative or perhaps the hype was too high but Hannibal is a winner...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say with all of the negative comments I've been reading about Hannibal, were they and I watching the same movie??I agree with one comment, the movie ended too quickly and left us with just as big a cliffhanger as Silence of the Lambs did. It sort of summed up too quickly.Aside from that this is one of the BEST movie sequels ever made, while it isn't Silence of the Lambs it's not really supposed to be. People have to realize that this story is told in a different fashion, it may not be as frightning psychologically but it is a suspenseful thriller.I think the reason many laughed at the gore scenes was because it was the only way to relive their discomfort.The movie was wonderfully written, a decent adaptation from the book but no less enjoyable.Scott has directed another masterpiece, and this movie is a masterpiece. The key to enjoying this movie is not to think of it as Silence of the Lambs.Performances...Liotta: One of his best roles, this guy is an amazingly talented actor. He stole the show, at least in the climax that is! Moore: Not Jodi Foster and while I like Moore she really didn't seem to be Clarice, the movie may have been even better if Foster stared. Hopkins: Just as chilling as in Silence, a great performance. Oldman: This is an Oscar worthy performance and I kid you not, It was the best performance in the movie.The thing about Hannibal is that it needs not to try and have a frightning unworldly twist to it. Silence of the Lambs set that up for us, in this movie we know Hannibal is a monster, we know he's twisted and we know the kinds of things he did, and by now and by some strange force we begin to see him as the protagonist, a twisted hero if you would go that far. We love to hate him and even begin to feel for him, in a world in where you have a faceless child molesting man plotting to feed Hannibal to wild bores, Hannibal doesn't seem all to evil anymore.You have to watch this movie with a twisted sense of appeal to the characters in order to enjoy it. If you stop analyzing it an taking it apart you will see a very good film underneath it all.My advice is, if you watch this movie with a stubborn viewpoint you most likely will be negative, if you open your mind you won't be. This movie is too good to complain about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal is a good movie gone horribly wrong. The first half or so of the film, with its lush scenery and excellent cinematography, captured my attention and was quite entertaining. However, all went south once Dr. Lechter arrived in the US. His capture by his nemesis (whose name eludes me) is just plain stupid. Clarice's actions following this are even more unbelievable. Details? Need I mention the man-eating pigs (irony? please!), the bizarre Italian goons, Clarice's Darrell Hammond-impersonating-George W. Bush boss, and the final, absurd dinner scene? I tried to explain the movie to my roommates, and couldn't help but think about how stupid the whole thing was. This is yet another bad movie in a sea of bad movies. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time--go rent a Cameron Crowe flick instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the movie very good. It was nothing compared to Silence Of The Lambs...but if I was reviewing it I would give it a good two and half or three stars. The acting was superb. Anthony Hopkins was so wonderful he didn't use the same old tongue sizzling noise...he added new phrases like...okey dokey and things like that. Julianne Moore was AMAZING!! I liked the fact that she didn't try to BE Jodie Foster. I would have like to see Jodie play the role but I think she was right that the script was too gory and that her character wasn't the same. Ray Liotta was excellent. I don't want to spoil the movie so I won't say what scene he was the most excellent in...Dinner anyone?. The story line was exceptional. A little gory but we might have needed it! I think all together it was a very well put together movie...and after reading the book...i'm glad it butchered some of the scenes out. Very good movie. Not as good as it's prequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not having seen Silence Of The Lambs I didn't really know what to expect. The main story is about Mason Verger Hannibals 4th victim trying to seek revenge on Hannibal. Anthony Hopkins plays a great phsyco even though I found it impossible to hate him. Julianne Moore fulfills the role of Clarice Starling very well, picking up where Jodie Foster Left off. Overall It was the best film I have seen in ages, with its make up, effects and a great storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Telling a good story, either book or script, needs to be victorious in two wars: one, it needs to take the reader or viewer away from his familiar surroundings and not have him flee, and two, in this strange and wondrous universe, without missing a beat it needs to lead him back to his very own soul. To have an event driven genre meet these requirements is incredibly hard, but two of the most famous of these battles already waged in the Hannibal universe succeeded in this gloriously and at the same time form this film's main enemies. One is the film Silence of the Lambs, through the fantastic performances of both Foster and Hopkins that are led through its universe by the hand of scriptwriter Ted Tally and the eerie directing skill of Jonathan Demme, that effortlessly returns as the conqueror in both wars. The second is the book that the film Hannibal is based on. I remember starting in the bathroom sometime in the afternoon and reading it cover to cover, skipping every meal until sunrise was nigh. An amazing tour de force that had me diving deep into the darkest ponds of the soul and sympathizing with one of the most ruthless killers ever invented while wondering more about the writer than the characters. It is not easy to join these ranks. In my opinion this film came close, but no cigar. The creative powerhouses in this movie all claim that one should judge it on its own merits, but during the movie, one can't help but noticing it still relies heavily on the memory of the viewer regarding its prequel. True, Scott, Zaillian and Mamet have made a serious attempt to capture Hannibal's playground adequately, true, Hopkins delivers memorable moments, true, Moore is a more than worthy successor to Foster, but frankly I think they haven't tried hard enough to win the war. In my opinion the Hannibal universe is equally character driven as it is event driven, but sadly, focus was put on the latter. The script allows for generous leaps in the storyline and suffers from loss of the threathening peace and tranquility that made the book and its prequel so enormously good; the musical score is way towards orchestral overkill (they should have stuck with Howard Shore, instead of the incredible amount of people this uneven score took); and oddly enough, there is just, well, too much Hannibal and too little Mason Verger (who in the book after making Martini's out of childrens' tears after he psychologically tortures them immediately ranked among my top list of seriously evil characters). I would have liked it more if the focus of the movie was kept on Starling and if Verger was fleshed out some more. The 40 odd minutes of Hannibal in Silence were of incomparable quality; now, I found only about 60% of his screentime to be actually memorable. I would have liked smaller but more powerful dosages. This time the film was more of a Hopkins vehicle and that simply does not enough credit to the rest of the story. In its favor I should point out that I liked it for Moore's performance, Scott's dark directing skills and its clinical use of extreme violence that Scott has written the book on (although I would very much have liked to see how David Fincher of Seven, The Game and Fight Club, would have handled this one), Oldman as Verger who turned in yet another good show and sadly got way too little screentime, the pigs were there (not credited in Snatch) and oh, for readers of the book, also the dinner scene at the end, that I have to admit was actually one of the sickest things I have ever seen. All in all, a bit disappointing, but worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you take this film at its base categorization, it fails miserably.It is neither suspenseful, thrilling, and where exactly was the horror in this? The make-up is overdone to the point of being silly "comic book villain" style. Was that the point? The gore scenes reduced the audience to laughter. There are countless continuity errors (not even taking into account those between "Silence" and this sequel) It's mostly silly and hardly believable. I quite often found myself close to falling asleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, Misunderstood, The Next Horror Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll try to keep this brief and short.Firstly, this film is completely different from Silence Of The Lambs. No, that does not mean that it isn't as good. In fact it is hugely better. Silence Of The Lambs was a well made police procedural. It wasn't a horror movie. Hannibal is a horror movie, and it is excellently original and excellently well made. And there is absolutely no way that the 'blood and guts' in this movie (which have been, as is common with the media, completely sensationalised) detract from its respectability or quality.Hannibal is a brilliant movie, featuring perfection on every level. Acting, music, makeup, direction. Hopkins, Liotta, Moore and Gianni are all fantastic in their roles. Gary Oldman as Mason Verger (with a second billing to his fantastic makeup job) portrays the first truly abhorrent movie monster to be shown for quite some time. Hans Zimmer's beautiful, haunting music score really sets the gothic/macabre-romantice mood of this affecting movie. And Ridley Scott's direction is so visceral and immersive, not to mention unique, rich and original.Hannibal truly is a masterpiece of a film. I won't bother going into specifics, because the movie itself is better at showing you WHY its so good. All I can really say is just how enjoyable and fantastic this film is.Do not listen to anyone who says the following: "It focuses more on the gore than suspense." "It was a case of style over substance." "There was too much humour in it." "Doesn't hold a canlde to Silence Of The Lambs."Quite honestly I am tired of hearing those cliches. Sequels are a strange, misunderstood and mistreated beast. In the world of film criticism, sequels are considered, as a rule to be inferior products. Well that's a closed minded belief if I ever heard one. Also, sequels are always damned if they follow the same kind of plot and style of the first film, a la Scream 2. But what of a sequel, like Hannibal, which is completely and utterly different, goes down a completely different path and is all the better for it? It gets ripped to shreds by the media for not being the same as its predecessor!!! What a load of hypocrisy!Don't listen to critics. Which I guess means don't listen to me too. But as long as that means you watch Hannibal with an open mind, then I guess that's a good thing....</fullReview>

This film was one of the best movies I've seen this year!! People who disliked it didn't give it a chance. They just continue to compare and get all upset and bitter. Those people need to get a life and watch the film for what it is! A GREAT movie. All my friends loved it and so did my dad who I saw it with.

		<fullReview>To anyone who slams this movie and hasn't read the book, a big boo-hoo to you. I felt as if this movie was missing some elements of the book, but overall it is a good book to script converstion (but nothing will match The Green Mile). The decision to film parts in Flourence adds to the mood of the movie and helps one relate to the book. The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that the gore was overdone a bit and I hate the fact that Ridley Scott had the ending change. Hannibal is meant to be the end of a trilogy and the movies ending leads one to belive that thier could be a sequel. I am happy that they are thinking about remaking Manhunter with Hopkins. If you stop to think, Anthony Hopkins only had about 27 minutes in Silence and 40 in Hannibal. As for Julian Moore as Clarice..... she makes the part hers by not trying to immitate Jodie Foster. Granted, Jodie Foster plays the part perfectly, but I admire Julian Moore for not trying to copy her style and adding her own. Anyways, it was Hopkins that told R. Scott to get her, so you know that an excellent actor had something to do with it. Overall I say go see this film if you have read the book. If you want Silence, then don't see this, you will be dissapointed. However, if you are looking for a good film that holds it own, then Hannibal will be top notch entertainment. Also, you got to love Gary Oldman in his uncredited Mason Verger role, it's classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is it that each and every critis tends to compare 'Hannibal' with 'The Silence of the Lambs'? Okay, I can see the reasons, but they are too obvious. Both movies are about Starling and Lecter and both were based on a Thomas Harris Novel. But why don't they see that these are two separate movies? The story takes place about 7 years after 'The Silence of the Lambs'. It's a different time and a different director. Demme very much focused on the close-ups and on suggestion, Scott focused more on explicity. But I think Scott really held back in a very good way. The movie was far less gory than all the critics claimed it to be. Don't forget 'The Silence of the Lambs' doesn't refrain from gory details, like the dead body hanging on Lecter's cell, the cut-off face, the autopsy-scene and Jame Gumb's skills as a couturier. 'Hannibal' was not more or less gory. It was of the same calibre.'Hannibal' is a different movie in oh so many ways. Lecter is on the loose now and we simply miss the suspense of him being captured and still dangerous. Scottis very often being blamed for this lack of supsense but the man can't help it. If there's anyone to blame then blame Thomas Harris. But it would've been an almost exact copy of 'The Silence of the Lambs' and that would have been boring.Julianne Moore was absolutely breath-taking. Some people said she was too good as an actress to play Starling. I disagree. She is more mature than Foster. She's not Foster, she's the Clarice of the present. And Hopkins is Lecter, although he describes is as just a part. He carries the movie and provides some of the best scenes I have seen in a long time with a dark whimsical type of sarcasm and irony. He stays within the limits of parody and could have provided himself with a much easier job by simply copying the lines of 'The Silence of the Lambs'. He doesn't. He adds new things to his character. The movie adds new things to his character. One of the most unpleasant things (that I personally did not like) was the fact his sexuality is questions several times. We already get confused in the Mason Verger flash-back scene and he acts rather gay when he meets commendatore Pazzi while holding his cigar.Gary Oldman also deserves credit just as Giancarlo Giannini. The latter is rather impressive making his character human rather than a charicature.Zimmer's musical score is breath-taking and very effective and so is Patrick Cassidy's mini-opera, 'Vide Cor Meum'. And what was most striking about 'Hannibal' in general was its stunning Cinematography. Was 'The Silence of the Lambs' rather dark, 'Hannibal' is warm. It's not just Florence giving the movie its touch it's Scott's feeling for image (his trademark). The movie's opening credits are very original, reminding me a bit of David Fincher's 'Se7en'.Now is there anything negative to mention about this movie? Yes there is. It is far less creepy than 'The Silence of the Lambs', but as I mentioned before: it is a different movie. The movie very faithfully sticks to the novel. And I thought the beginning of the movie, let's say the first 30-40 minutes was pretty messy. The scenes are too short and being switched too often to really make an impression. The movie's first big scene, the drugbust at the fishmarket was quite messy also but it was a good opener anyway.All in all a very good movie, with the occasional let down. I loved the shot of the lamb however. That is a merit of the movie: it refers to 'The Silence of the Lambs' but it doesn't overrefer to it... it has its own identity. And the dinner scene: I am so glad they kept it in the movie (I guess everyone knows by now): it is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen... perfect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Few redeeming features</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to figure out what Ridley Scott wanted to do with this film. On the one hand it has quite a simple, yet effective, plot, but on the other it just seems to feature extremely graphic scenes, which are intended to disgust and cause revulsion. There is no doubt that the visual effects are superb, but why would anyone want to actually see them in all their detail?It's a disappointing effort from Scott, no way on a par with his Alien films or, more recently, with Gladiator. If you want to watch a psychological thriller featuring a serial killer then you'd be better off with Silence of the Lambs, Kiss the Girls, the Gingerbread Man or the Cell.As for the acting: It's very much touch-and-go. Hopkins is back as Lecter, but doesn't develop the character any further than the first film. Moore is very different from the Agent Starling of "Silence of the Lambs", and borders on wooden for most of the film. The other actors, such as the FBI chiefs and the Justice Dept. guy, just seemed like stereotypes found in other films (see US Marshals, X-Files). Even Lecter's archenemy, Verger, was an uninspiring performance from Gary Oldman.Overall this film just seemed aimed at evoking strong feelings in the audience, with little content. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it didn't fall into the trap so many other's in this genre do - of trying to lighten the atmosphere with comedy. There was always a sense of foreboding and a darkness which didn't let up at all.</fullReview>

Fortunately, the failure of this film cannot be blamed on the people involved in the actual film. Thomas Harris' book of the same name didn't seem to have the impact of the first two books. However, the film didn't attempt to put things right: Anthony Hopkins inclusion of terms like 'Okey Dokey', made Lector into a camp circus monster. He is starting to look more like Freddy Kruegar than the personification of evil. Or was he supposed to be evil anyway? Who knows.Let's pray they DO NOT make a sequel. Can you imagine the title? 'HANNIBAL 4 - He's Back and He's Hungry'. No doubt it will happen, and Hannibal the Cannibal will join the ranks of Jason, Myers, and the aforementioned Freddy. They may as well make 'Freddy Vs Hannibal'.This film scraped the bottom of the barrel, and turned the most sinister 'monster' since Count Dracula, into a joke.</fullReview>

NOT tears of absolute disbelief!!...Ridley Scott ( as talented director as he is) managed to capture the first half of the story in Italy very well and Lectors character was darkly intelligent and impressive as i had hoped...good start me thinks! After Lector had escaped and ended up back in the USA things really took a turn for the worse...gone was all the intelligence and the last half of the film seemed to me to have been rushed and made into a comedy horror film! with Lector cracking jokes and ridiculous torture scenes...its totally apparent that the film is never gonna live up to the book but i had high hopes for this sequel and for the first hour i wasnt disappointed..its a shame it didnt stick through to the (unintentionally funny) ending =^,^&gt;</fullReview>

He is starting to look more like Freddy Kruegar than the personification of evil. Or was he supposed to be evil anyway? Who knows.Let's pray they DO NOT make a sequel. Can you imagine the title? 'HANNIBAL 4 - He's Back and He's Hungry'. No doubt it will happen, and Hannibal the Cannibal will join the ranks of Jason, Myers, and the aforementioned Freddy. They may as well make 'Freddy Vs Hannibal'.This film scraped the bottom of the barrel, and turned the most sinister 'monster' since Count Dracula, into a joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was really a disappointment. I didn't particularly like the new Clarice Starling, she wasn't the same shy person she was in Silence of the Lambs. I guess you could say that 10 years in the FBI change a person, but nevertheless I didn't really like her. The only time she seemed to be the same person is the jogging scene.Back to the film now. It's a perfect film to make you lose your appetite. I'm usually really okay with gory films, but what the good doctor does is really beyond gruesomeness (is there such a word?).I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it, but make yourselves a favour and see another film instead. Definitely not a good film to see on Valentine's Day (that's when the preview was released in the UK)...</fullReview>

NOT tears of absolute disbelief!!...Ridley Scott ( as talented director as he is) managed to capture the first half of the story in Italy very well and Lectors character was darkly intelligent and impressive as i had hoped...good start me thinks! After Lector had escaped and ended up back in the USA things really took a turn for the worse...gone was all the intelligence and the last half of the film seemed to me to have been rushed and made into a comedy horror film! with Lector cracking jokes and ridiculous torture scenes...its totally apparent that the film is never gonna live up to the book but i had high hopes for this sequel and for the first hour i wasnt disappointed..its a shame it didnt stick through to the (unintentionally funny) ending =^,^&gt;</fullReview>

Silence of the Lambs was dominated by Anthony Hopkins ability to make you fear being in his presence with his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter. In Hannibal with Lecter being in more of the movie you feel more comfortable with him which lessens the effect he had in Silence of the Lambs. For Horror movie fans the gore is not going to be anything you haven't seen before.</fullReview>

But once the film shifted from Florence and onto the capture of Lecter, it took a nose-dive into a feeble black comedy with it's infamous, over-the-top ending, done for a cheap shock effect.There's no suspense or tension, and the Mason Verger character becomes nothing more than a comic book bad-guy. Neither the book or the film Hannibal lives up to it's predecessor in anyway. Major let down. 5/10</fullReview>

Rate it may 6 or 7, If you read the book skip the move (rate it 4) The lower rating because there are sometime thing happen and they don't really explain why the character would do that. Plus a lot of the acting wasn't great. Anthony Hopkins did do a good job in reprising his role though. His acting saved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS!I really think I'd have appreciated Hannibal a lot more if I hadn't read the book beforehand; the book was excellent, especially the ending which I consequently found very disappointing in the film. I was also disappointed by the omission of Mason's sister who even Lecter called a more interesting character than Mason and similarly leaving out the flashbacks to lecter's childhood which explained his cannibalism.This considered, in it's own right i thought the film was fantastic even if it did put me off my dinner! The removal of Krendlar's skull looked horribly realistic, which sadly was more than could be said for Mason's make up although Gary oldman's amusing acting did make up for it- as did all the other performances.As I only saw the film a few hours ago there are certain scenes that are really lodged in my head- the flashback of Mason ripping his face off with extremely disturbing, Lecter's cutting his hand off a nice alteration from the book and his murder of Pazzi wonderfully close to it.Finally- my congratulations to whoever was responsible for the soundtrack, it seemed to me designed entirely to Lecter's - for want of a better word- tastes!</fullReview>

In a reversal of fortune, Clarice seems to be in the cage most of this movie while Hannibal gets to play in historic, classic, cultural Florence.I doubt that Julianne will follow Jodie's path at the Academy Awards, but there should be a few nominations for this Dino De Laurentiis film. I would think that Hopkins may be challenged for the repeat by Oldman's -- man of 1000 faces -- performance. Nominations for direction, screenplay and supporting actors would also seem appropriate, unless they come up with a better film which - looking at latest releases - is a cold day in hell.It was great seeing Giancarlo Giannini (as Rinaldo Pazzi) in a pivotal role in a major American movie. The star of "Swept Away" and "Seven Beauties" from a generation ago brings depth and experience to his protagonist role in the search.My favorite parts of the novel have been brought to the screen in a visual terror befitting the director of "Alien" and "Blade Runner". True, there is significant blood on the screen, however the real horror is reserved for our intellectual discovery of the sociopathic mind. Would you expect less from David Mamet?This film is more like the first Hannibal movie "Manhunter" then "Silence of the Lambs". In this series, it seems that each sequel gets better. Five Stars.

		<shortDescription>A terrific film which keeps the legend alive...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you consider the challenges that were overcome to get this film made, I am surprised that Hannibal hit the screen at all. That fact that it has and turns out to be a master class in the art of filmmaking makes it all the more remarkable. Straight away I thought Julianne Moore was right for Clarice Starling and she proves this with some punchy dialogue effectively delivered ensuring the innate toughness of Starling comes shining through. Surprisingly perhaps, the major change is not in Starling, as you would expect being played by a different actress, but in Anthony Hopkins performance of Lecter. It makes perfect sense though. In 'Lambs', Lecter was imprisoned and behaved accordingly. Surely we couldn't expect Hopkins to simply reprise the performance he gave in 'Lambs'. Instead, in yet another seemingly effortless performance, he underplays marvellously to give us the appearance of benevolence cloaking evil. In Hannibal we see other aspects of Lecter's personality, notably his love of the arts and his great aesthetic sense. He is much more gregarious and provides some of the amusing moments in the film as well as the most horrific. This film provoked a range of emotions in me, it made me laugh, jump out of my seat and in the end, go home full of admiration for a great film. Certainly the ending differs from the novel but enough has been written on that elsewhere and it is not the only element of the book that has been changed in the journey to the big screen. I believe however those changes are largely necessary to make the story filmable as well as serving to keep our attention more tightly focussed on the central characters and story.So often, sequels crash and burn as they rely on the reputation of what has gone before but Ridley Scott has paid tribute to what is obviously fast becoming a movie legend as well as making Hannibal a great, great film.</fullReview>

Hannibal is a classic example of "If a little is good, than a whole lot must be better". In SOTL we're exposed to just enough of thediabolical, twisted mind of Hannibal. It was like a fine wine which was just the right amount to leave him as one of films most frightening figures. On the other hand in "Hannibal" the viewer is forced to drink a couple of bottles of Thunderbird and throw up in the gutter. The character Hannibal has now lost all of his mystery and fright. He's been reduced to a Jason with etiquette.The film had no suspense and was pretty predictable. The other villian in the film, Mason Verger, kept reminding me of Jim Carrey's "Fire Marshall Bill" character. I kept waiting for him to say "LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING !!"Throw in a rather boring rendition of Clarice Starling by Julianne Moore and you're left with a real average movie.5 *'s</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those viewers who really enjoyed getting creeped out by Hannibal Lecter's inhuman characteristics and cerebral linguistic ability in the Silence of the Lambs, don't go to see Hannibal. If you are a Nightmare on Elm Street fan, and love Freddy Kruegers jovial banter when preparing to kill his victims, you will love this flick. Hannibal Lecter has been reduced from a highly intelligent, sophisticated psychopathic killer to a wisecracking killer with unusual dietary habits. The producers of this film along with the director should be ashamed of themselves for wasting the incredible talents of the top two billed actors in this picture. Hannibal was too funny, Clarisse had a chip on her shoulder throughout most of the movie. The chemistry that Jodie Foster and Sir Hopkins shared in SOTL was missing because of poorly scripted dialogue in which the two characters didn't really talk to each other, but rather spoke at each other with their own agenda. This movie wants so desperately to be a Saturday night date flick that it forgets that most of the accolades the first movie received were because the acting was so superb that you left the movie with the creeps instead of having nausea. SOTL was for the most part not graphic in the violence it displayed, however Hannibal takes the idea about visceral gross out to a new extreme. If you like gore, you'll love this movie. If you are looking for an Oscar contender, go check out Chocolat, or Cast Away because the golden Statue doesn't give awards for assuming that the prime target audience of this picture is stupid. The movie cheated from the book in some key ways which I will not share in this forum. Shame on Thomas Harris for contributing to this pulp fictionesque movie that could have been more, he's a far better writer than what this screenplay turned out to be.</fullReview>

The new director and the revised cast worked very well together and the relationship between Lecktor and Starling lost no zest.I recommend this movie to those with a strong stomach only, it has its fair share of gore.

		<shortDescription>A word in defense of this great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From reading preceding critical reviews, I've noticed there are 2 categories of people who did not like this movie. There are those who have unfairly compared it to the first movie, and those who didn't like Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling.The first criticism is an unfair one. Why do you grade a sequel based on its predecessor? Why can't you simply ask yourself the question, "Was I entertained?" "Was the acting superb?" "Was the script superb?" "Was this thriller thrilling?" I feel that Hannibal stands alone as a separate movie. Even if you have never seen Silence of the Lambs, there is enough introduction of both characters to bring about an understanding of where they came from and who they are. I was truly on the edge of my seat from the moment the MGM lion roared, and that's the bottom line for me.The second criticism is absolutely laughable. It's obvious that those that make that criticism did not examine Julianne Moore's portrayal objectively. The simply observed that Jodie Foster and Julianne Moore are not the same actress, and that's enough for them to pan Julianne Moore. Actually, if you want to be objective about it, Julianne Moore is BETTER as Clarice Starling. She is more believable, more weak and strong at the same time. Ask yourself this, "Was Julianne more believable as Clarice?" Yes. "Was her acting superb?" Yes. End of discussion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me get this off my chest first, for people expecting Hannibal to be anything like it's predecessor u will be disappointed. It's really nothing of the sort and the only recognizable similarity between the two is Hopkins' exceptional performance. I read a lot of bashing of this movie so when I went in to see it today I was skeptical. I thought to myself, is this movie going to be another one those cheap ripoff sequels that aren't even half of what the original was? My skepticisms were thrown out the window however as this movie turned out to be a very suspensful and highly entertaining piece of film.To compare this movie to Silence is unjust for the fact that Hannibal tries not to be like it's predecessor. It is very much unlike Silence, so u really cant compare the two. When u go into see this movie, judge it alone without the comparison and I think u will see that this movie is very well done. The acting is overall very superb. Anthony Hopkins does no less than entrance the audience once again as the character of Hannibal seems to fit him like a glove. Julianne Moore does a fairly good job playing Clarice Starling. I have heard a lot of bad reviews about her role and I really cant see why. She plays a different Starling then Foster did, since this movie is 10 years later, and pulls it off exceptionally. The supporting cast also did a fine job especially Gary Oldman as Mason Verger, who plays a deliciously evil villain who sometimes deserves pity for what he is doing and what he went through.The plot in itself seemed to me to be fairly well written, and highly plausible, and to not give too much of the ending away, it does leave room for perhaps another sequel. Speaking of the ending, I heard so much about the gruesome and gory scenes in this movie but when I walked out of the theatre I thought that they were not even half as bad as what most people were saying. Perhaps it is the fact that I am maybe decensitized to violence, but this movie did not shock me, and I really dont think that is what it set out to do. I think Ridley Scott set out make a film using his own brand/style of directing, and if some scenes called for a bit of blood and guts, so be it.To conclude, if u enjoyed Silence of the Lambs and are looking for a deserving sequel to live up to the Hannibal name, perhaps this is not ur type of movie. I rated it a 10 because of it's originality and brilliance, and I applaud the filmmakers for bringing the very believable character of Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter back into our lives, and nightmares.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From reading preceding critical reviews, I've noticed there are 2 categories of people who did not like this movie. There are those who have unfairly compared it to the first movie, and those who didn't like Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling.The first criticism is an unfair one. Why do you grade a sequel based on its predecessor? Why can't you simply ask yourself the question, "Was I entertained?" "Was the acting superb?" "Was the script superb?" "Was this thriller thrilling?" I feel that Hannibal stands alone as a separate movie. Even if you have never seen Silence of the Lambs, there is enough introduction of both characters to bring about an understanding of where they came from and who they are. I was truly on the edge of my seat from the moment the MGM lion roared, and that's the bottom line for me.The second criticism is absolutely laughable. It's obvious that those that make that criticism did not examine Julianne Moore's portrayal objectively. The simply observed that Jodie Foster and Julianne Moore are not the same actress, and that's enough for them to pan Julianne Moore. Actually, if you want to be objective about it, Julianne Moore is BETTER as Clarice Starling. She is more believable, more weak and strong at the same time. Ask yourself this, "Was Julianne more believable as Clarice?" Yes. "Was her acting superb?" Yes. End of discussion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me get this off my chest first, for people expecting Hannibal to be anything like it's predecessor u will be disappointed. It's really nothing of the sort and the only recognizable similarity between the two is Hopkins' exceptional performance. I read a lot of bashing of this movie so when I went in to see it today I was skeptical. I thought to myself, is this movie going to be another one those cheap ripoff sequels that aren't even half of what the original was? My skepticisms were thrown out the window however as this movie turned out to be a very suspensful and highly entertaining piece of film.To compare this movie to Silence is unjust for the fact that Hannibal tries not to be like it's predecessor. It is very much unlike Silence, so u really cant compare the two. When u go into see this movie, judge it alone without the comparison and I think u will see that this movie is very well done.

		<shortDescription>criticism unjust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Hannibal' was a great movie, and it is receiving a great deal of unjustified criticism. First of all, it should be said that the movie followed the book very well. Except for the ending, the movie stayed true to the plot. Furthermore, I don't think the movie could possibly have captured the tone of the Harris's book to any greater effect. The movie really captured the black humor that Harris used in the book (especially in the ending dinner scenes). Furthermore, the paradox between Lecter as monster and sociopath and Lecter as highly urbane and sophisticated is done very well. In fact, there were many times when I found myself cheering for him. Ask yourself at the end of the movie-who comes out appearing more evil, Mason Verger or Hannibal Lecter? Those who think the violence and gore were gratuitous may have one of the few justified criticisms. Actually, there were very few graphic scenes, but those that were, really were. People who had read the book would have gone into the movie knowing what to expect; it should have come as no surprise. However, some of the scenes that showed victims with their throat slit with giant pools of blood around their heads really were not necessary. The scenes that came at the end of the movie have come under a lot of criticism. (I won't spoil, those who have seen it know what I'm talking about.) True, these scenes are not for people with easily turned stomachs, but if you look at the tremendous humor in these scenes, the actors couldn't have done it better. Those who claim that Starling's character (Julianne Moore) fell flat must remember that Harris's intention was to develop the character of Lecter, not Starling, in the book. Starling had her moment of glory in Silence of the Lambs. In Hannibal, Lecter is supposed to take center stage. (This realization might dawn on anybody who looks closely at the title of the movie and the book). Moore actually did very well with what she had to work with in this movie. Sir Anthony Hopkins as Lecter turns in another fine, if different performance. He is given more free reign to develop other aspects of Lecter's character. Lecter is still the same psychologically manipulative, eerily intelligent, and frightening person that made him so effective in Silence, but anybody can seem that way if he is put in a dark prison cell with a face mask and creepy musical score. It is exceptional that Hopkins managed to endow Lecter with these same traits in the outside world. Lecter's sense of humor (which was in evidence in the 'Silence of the Lambs' book but not so much in the movie) is much more developed in 'Hannibal.'Gary Oldman as Mason Verger turned in one of the finest performances of the movie. It would be hard for any actor to give the character as much life as did Oldman from underneath all that make-up. Oldman managed to make the Verger character quite humorous in some places. I don't think this aspect of his character came through in the book very well, but it really added a lot to his character in the movie. Ray Liotta also did very well as Paul Krendler, especially in the movie's final scenes. I won't spoil those for anyone who has not yet seen the movie. Overall, I would like to admonish anyone who goes into this movie expecting another 'Silence of the Lambs' to think again. Many critics have said that the movie was disappointing when compared with Silence. I don't think this criticism is justified. Silence was indeed a top-rate film, but people should not criticize 'Hannibal' for not being the same. It was not intended to be. The books were not very similar to each other, so this movie should not be blamed for leaving out similarities that weren't there in the first place. Finally, I'm not quite sure what to make of the ending. It was not at all similar to what Harris would have intended, but I was dissatisfied by the ending in the book. I guess I would have to say that I liked the ending in the movie better, but several people have told me that the ending was stolen from someplace else. Also, I'm not entirely convinced that the ending is plausible given Lecter's mentality. The ending in both the book and the movie was the only aspect that came up a bit sour for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of us who were crazy to see what happened after the Silence of the Lambs and grabbed the book as soon as it came out, watching Hannibal the movie, was sad. Why? Because the book was absolutely great and to wait so long to watch what you read and then encounter yourself with the sad truth they completely changed the ending, it's sad...really sad...If the producers and directors of the movie would've followed the book just as it was written by Thomas Harris (which I applaud!!), they would've actually made an excellent movie. Anthony Hopkins was absolutely great, as always! But I would've like to have seen Lecter as in Silence of the Lambs, scarier... Julianne Moore, could've done better...I think it was that I loved Foster's Clarise better...About the gruesomeness, ok, a little too much, but the book is actually worse in this department. It's just that it's one thing to read and imagine a scene like the one with the wild pigs, than to see it in the screen...though it was shocking, at the same time it was exciting.One thing I do not like at all is the comedy that the producers or screenwriters decided to include in this movie. PEOPLE! We do not want to go to the movies and laugh in a movie like this! Do not mix, a thriller suspense, with a comedy...This really was what made me not LOVE this movie. Hannibal could've been as good as, Silence of the Lambs, not better, but at least as good. But they blew it!I don't want to blow the ending for those of you who haven't seen the movie, so I'll just say, it was sad for those of us who read the book and expected the awesome ending Thomas Harris gave us...I rate the movie 7 out of 10, thanks in great part to the excellent acting of Sir Anthony Hopkins!But, hey guys! The movie is GOOD! Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I found Hannibal very predictable from the beginning through the end. Due to that, Dr. Lecter no longer became a frightening character but one in which you knew each move he would make. The scariest movies are ones in which the director plays with your psyche and one in which you do not know what will happen next. It's not the gore or the blood that scares. I don't think Hannibal keeps you at the edge of your seat, wondering what he would do next. People were taken aback by what the blood or gore but not by the mystery of this man. It wasn't just the Dr. Lecter character that is weak but the others as well. You just knew the Italian cop would be killed as would the pick-pocket and the list goes on.People have always been interested in the minds of serial killers or mass murderers or in Lecter's case, a highly intelligent killer with a cannibalist twist to him. Dr Lecter is a very interesting character. He was highly manipulative. He's the type of person whom his victims had at one time liked and perhaps admired but when they knew more of him, especially if they knew his true identity, their like of him turned to pure terror and horror. I don't think this immense fear was captured in the movie. Silence of the Lambs does much better at capturing this even though it had work to do to complete the capture of the Dr Lecter character persona. Dr Lecter's psyche and the sheer terror his victims felt of him is what would have made this film a Class One act. The gore, guts and blood is not what gives it its edge. It merely gives it an R rating and something for people to hype about.I hope they will not do a Part III for that would completely wreck the mystery of the Dr Lecter character and "cheapen" it. Hollywood is not good at sequels for they tend to end up becoming extremely commercial and the essence of the original film no longer exists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh dear...Having re-watched Silence of the lambs just a few days before, i went to the cinema with great expectations, and possibly because of that felt horribly let down.SOTL was brilliant largely because of the intelligence and the psychological aspects, Hannibal seemed to have a been very poorly written and seemed to go down the desperate route of using gore and shock instead of intelligent well written cinema.Additionally there were numerous *huge* gaps in parts of the film that blatantly had been cut due to time restraints - these along with other plot holes and major annoyances left me extremely disappointed...The acting itself was fine, and again Antony Hopkins gave a good performance (although severely limited by the material he was working with - his character was no where as good as in SOTL). Moore didn't seem as good as Jody Foster (who is rumoured to have turned the part down due to the script) at the character Clarice Starling, but was passable none the less.Doubtless if i hadn't seen SOTL so recently the movie would have faired much better, but if a film wants to get game from it's predecessors it should accept the downside of being compared with them. Live by the sword, die by the sword as they say.Overall i'm still glad i went to see it, but i'm afraid it gets a very depressing 5 out of 10...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ten years ago 'Silence of the Lambs' - surely a contender for the most overrated movie of all time - wowed audiences and critics alike. Now 'Hannibal' has done it again. Although the response has been more muted, its obvious that most film critics actually take 'Hannibal' seriously. But how seriously can you take a film that asks us to believe in an art-loving, literate psychiatrist who just happens to be a serial-killer and cannibal? What sort of genre does this mess of a movie fall into - a horror film that is not frightening, or a thriller devoid of any suspense? Perhaps we should see Hannibal more in keeping with Indiana Jones (remember those monkey skull meals!). After all he is able to murder people in full public gaze, escape detection despite being surrounded by police, fly all over the world and get a job in an art gallery without ever being recognised - despite being on the FBI's 'Top Ten Wanted' list. Ridley Scott, Anthony Hopkins &amp; Co. must be laughing all the way to the bank. I vote this film the biggest con-trick since 'Blair Witch Project'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good film. As a standalone movie it would be regarded as very good indeed. But the difficulty lies when the inevitable comparisons are drawn with The Silence of The Lambs. The latter is a far superior film, a modern masterpiece of cinema that could not hope to be surpassed.It's beauty lay in its simplicity and densely concentrated action. The best parts lay in the few but remarkable scenes between Foster and Hopkins. The subtlety of the portrayals of both these actors was astoundingly effective.Hannibal, on the other hand, is sprawling. It's a longer film than its predecessor, and the action flits between the FBI in the US and Lecter in Florence, and his subsequent return. The number of supporting characters and subplots are many.But the performances are not strong enough to sustain them. Mason Verger is a cliched camp villain, and even Hopkins' performances borders on this at times. Julianne Moore must be commended for taking over the reigns of Clarice Starling, putting in such a solid performance. But the chemistry between Foster and Hopkins in the earlier film is lost.The violence is also far less subtle. Here it can only be described as graphic. Which is a shame, because if the film hadn't gone all out for gore and shock value, and had instead concentrated more on the interplay between the characters, this could have been an exceptional film.If you have seen the original, you must see this. Be warned, you won't like it as much, but it is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

Furthermore, the paradox between Lecter as monster and sociopath and Lecter as highly urbane and sophisticated is done very well. In fact, there were many times when I found myself cheering for him. Ask yourself at the end of the movie-who comes out appearing more evil, Mason Verger or Hannibal Lecter? Those who think the violence and gore were gratuitous may have one of the few justified criticisms. Actually, there were very few graphic scenes, but those that were, really were. People who had read the book would have gone into the movie knowing what to expect; it should have come as no surprise. However, some of the scenes that showed victims with their throat slit with giant pools of blood around their heads really were not necessary. The scenes that came at the end of the movie have come under a lot of criticism. (I won't spoil, those who have seen it know what I'm talking about.) True, these scenes are not for people with easily turned stomachs, but if you look at the tremendous humor in these scenes, the actors couldn't have done it better. Those who claim that Starling's character (Julianne Moore) fell flat must remember that Harris's intention was to develop the character of Lecter, not Starling, in the book. Starling had her moment of glory in Silence of the Lambs. In Hannibal, Lecter is supposed to take center stage. (This realization might dawn on anybody who looks closely at the title of the movie and the book). Moore actually did very well with what she had to work with in this movie. Sir Anthony Hopkins as Lecter turns in another fine, if different performance. He is given more free reign to develop other aspects of Lecter's character. Lecter is still the same psychologically manipulative, eerily intelligent, and frightening person that made him so effective in Silence, but anybody can seem that way if he is put in a dark prison cell with a face mask and creepy musical score. It is exceptional that Hopkins managed to endow Lecter with these same traits in the outside world. Lecter's sense of humor (which was in evidence in the 'Silence of the Lambs' book but not so much in the movie) is much more developed in 'Hannibal.'Gary Oldman as Mason Verger turned in one of the finest performances of the movie. It would be hard for any actor to give the character as much life as did Oldman from underneath all that make-up. Oldman managed to make the Verger character quite humorous in some places. I don't think this aspect of his character came through in the book very well, but it really added a lot to his character in the movie. Ray Liotta also did very well as Paul Krendler, especially in the movie's final scenes. I won't spoil those for anyone who has not yet seen the movie. Overall, I would like to admonish anyone who goes into this movie expecting another 'Silence of the Lambs' to think again. Many critics have said that the movie was disappointing when compared with Silence. I don't think this criticism is justified. Silence was indeed a top-rate film, but people should not criticize 'Hannibal' for not being the same. It was not intended to be. The books were not very similar to each other, so this movie should not be blamed for leaving out similarities that weren't there in the first place. Finally, I'm not quite sure what to make of the ending. It was not at all similar to what Harris would have intended, but I was dissatisfied by the ending in the book. I guess I would have to say that I liked the ending in the movie better, but several people have told me that the ending was stolen from someplace else. Also, I'm not entirely convinced that the ending is plausible given Lecter's mentality. The ending in both the book and the movie was the only aspect that came up a bit sour for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From reading preceding critical reviews, I've noticed there are 2 categories of people who did not like this movie. There are those who have unfairly compared it to the first movie, and those who didn't like Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling.The first criticism is an unfair one. Why do you grade a sequel based on its predecessor? Why can't you simply ask yourself the question, "Was I entertained?" "Was the acting superb?" "Was the script superb?" "Was this thriller thrilling?" I feel that Hannibal stands alone as a separate movie. Even if you have never seen Silence of the Lambs, there is enough introduction of both characters to bring about an understanding of where they came from and who they are. I was truly on the edge of my seat from the moment the MGM lion roared, and that's the bottom line for me.The second criticism is absolutely laughable. It's obvious that those that make that criticism did not examine Julianne Moore's portrayal objectively. The simply observed that Jodie Foster and Julianne Moore are not the same actress, and that's enough for them to pan Julianne Moore. Actually, if you want to be objective about it, Julianne Moore is BETTER as Clarice Starling. She is more believable, more weak and strong at the same time. Ask yourself this, "Was Julianne more believable as Clarice?" Yes. "Was her acting superb?" Yes. End of discussion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of us who were crazy to see what happened after the Silence of the Lambs and grabbed the book as soon as it came out, watching Hannibal the movie, was sad. Why? Because the book was absolutely great and to wait so long to watch what you read and then encounter yourself with the sad truth they completely changed the ending, it's sad...really sad...If the producers and directors of the movie would've followed the book just as it was written by Thomas Harris (which I applaud!!), they would've actually made an excellent movie. Anthony Hopkins was absolutely great, as always! But I would've like to have seen Lecter as in Silence of the Lambs, scarier... Julianne Moore, could've done better...I think it was that I loved Foster's Clarise better...About the gruesomeness, ok, a little too much, but the book is actually worse in this department. It's just that it's one thing to read and imagine a scene like the one with the wild pigs, than to see it in the screen...though it was shocking, at the same time it was exciting.One thing I do not like at all is the comedy that the producers or screenwriters decided to include in this movie. PEOPLE! We do not want to go to the movies and laugh in a movie like this! Do not mix, a thriller suspense, with a comedy...This really was what made me not LOVE this movie. Hannibal could've been as good as, Silence of the Lambs, not better, but at least as good. But they blew it!I don't want to blow the ending for those of you who haven't seen the movie, so I'll just say, it was sad for those of us who read the book and expected the awesome ending Thomas Harris gave us...I rate the movie 7 out of 10, thanks in great part to the excellent acting of Sir Anthony Hopkins!But, hey guys!

The rest of the people do a pretty bad job too. Some gore during the movie, as the only way to show something shocking, and inability of Scott to make you feel anything but leaving the theater, are the main lines of this movie.

		<shortDescription>Very predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I found Hannibal very predictable from the beginning through the end. Due to that, Dr. Lecter no longer became a frightening character but one in which you knew each move he would make. The scariest movies are ones in which the director plays with your psyche and one in which you do not know what will happen next. It's not the gore or the blood that scares. I don't think Hannibal keeps you at the edge of your seat, wondering what he would do next. People were taken aback by what the blood or gore but not by the mystery of this man. It wasn't just the Dr. Lecter character that is weak but the others as well. You just knew the Italian cop would be killed as would the pick-pocket and the list goes on.People have always been interested in the minds of serial killers or mass murderers or in Lecter's case, a highly intelligent killer with a cannibalist twist to him. Dr Lecter is a very interesting character. He was highly manipulative. He's the type of person whom his victims had at one time liked and perhaps admired but when they knew more of him, especially if they knew his true identity, their like of him turned to pure terror and horror. I don't think this immense fear was captured in the movie. Silence of the Lambs does much better at capturing this even though it had work to do to complete the capture of the Dr Lecter character persona. Dr Lecter's psyche and the sheer terror his victims felt of him is what would have made this film a Class One act. The gore, guts and blood is not what gives it its edge. It merely gives it an R rating and something for people to hype about.I hope they will not do a Part III for that would completely wreck the mystery of the Dr Lecter character and "cheapen" it. Hollywood is not good at sequels for they tend to end up becoming extremely commercial and the essence of the original film no longer exists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh dear...Having re-watched Silence of the lambs just a few days before, i went to the cinema with great expectations, and possibly because of that felt horribly let down.SOTL was brilliant largely because of the intelligence and the psychological aspects, Hannibal seemed to have a been very poorly written and seemed to go down the desperate route of using gore and shock instead of intelligent well written cinema.Additionally there were numerous *huge* gaps in parts of the film that blatantly had been cut due to time restraints - these along with other plot holes and major annoyances left me extremely disappointed...The acting itself was fine, and again Antony Hopkins gave a good performance (although severely limited by the material he was working with - his character was no where as good as in SOTL). Moore didn't seem as good as Jody Foster (who is rumoured to have turned the part down due to the script) at the character Clarice Starling, but was passable none the less.Doubtless if i hadn't seen SOTL so recently the movie would have faired much better, but if a film wants to get game from it's predecessors it should accept the downside of being compared with them. Live by the sword, die by the sword as they say.Overall i'm still glad i went to see it, but i'm afraid it gets a very depressing 5 out of 10...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ten years ago 'Silence of the Lambs' - surely a contender for the most overrated movie of all time - wowed audiences and critics alike. Now 'Hannibal' has done it again. Although the response has been more muted, its obvious that most film critics actually take 'Hannibal' seriously. But how seriously can you take a film that asks us to believe in an art-loving, literate psychiatrist who just happens to be a serial-killer and cannibal? What sort of genre does this mess of a movie fall into - a horror film that is not frightening, or a thriller devoid of any suspense? Perhaps we should see Hannibal more in keeping with Indiana Jones (remember those monkey skull meals!). After all he is able to murder people in full public gaze, escape detection despite being surrounded by police, fly all over the world and get a job in an art gallery without ever being recognised - despite being on the FBI's 'Top Ten Wanted' list. Ridley Scott, Anthony Hopkins &amp; Co. must be laughing all the way to the bank. I vote this film the biggest con-trick since 'Blair Witch Project'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good film. As a standalone movie it would be regarded as very good indeed. But the difficulty lies when the inevitable comparisons are drawn with The Silence of The Lambs. The latter is a far superior film, a modern masterpiece of cinema that could not hope to be surpassed.It's beauty lay in its simplicity and densely concentrated action. The best parts lay in the few but remarkable scenes between Foster and Hopkins. The subtlety of the portrayals of both these actors was astoundingly effective.Hannibal, on the other hand, is sprawling. It's a longer film than its predecessor, and the action flits between the FBI in the US and Lecter in Florence, and his subsequent return. The number of supporting characters and subplots are many.But the performances are not strong enough to sustain them. Mason Verger is a cliched camp villain, and even Hopkins' performances borders on this at times. Julianne Moore must be commended for taking over the reigns of Clarice Starling, putting in such a solid performance. But the chemistry between Foster and Hopkins in the earlier film is lost.The violence is also far less subtle. Here it can only be described as graphic. Which is a shame, because if the film hadn't gone all out for gore and shock value, and had instead concentrated more on the interplay between the characters, this could have been an exceptional film.If you have seen the original, you must see this. Be warned, you won't like it as much, but it is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

I think this is a very good movie, very suspenseful and actually not more "violent" than Silence or Manhunter. This one is just a little more gory. I also think it's a very good book-to-film achievement, even though (SPOILER AHEAD) some characters are missing and the end is not the end of the book, but the scene is a different one in the book, in the middle section of the book. (SPOILER END). Ridley Scott did a very good job on this movie just like you would expect a Ridley Scott movie. And the actors are pretty good also. I truly recommend this movie to everyone who likes either Scott's films or Thriller/Horror films. 9/10 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is being assessed unfairly!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Begin, I would like to note that the film 'Hannibal' is the most recent entry in the Lecter trilogy. Manhunter (aka Red Dragon) in '86 was the initial entry, Silence Of The Lambs is the second. Just as Manhunter and Silence Of The Lambs are two unique stories, with Hannibal Lecter playing a different role within these films, Ridley Scott's Hannibal is even more unique. The reason people did not enjoy this film was because Hollywood sequels are meant to cash in on the popularity of the previous entries, and grind out the same basic plot. 'Hannibal' the film was totally based on Thomas Harris's novel of the same name, with minor changes made (including the ending), but for the benefit of the viewer satisfaction. The execution of this film is excellent, with Anthony Hopkins (63 years old!) and Julianne Moore (Jodie Foster would not be believable in this story), Gary Oldman, and Ray Liotta flushing out excellent characters. Ridley Scott provides the most visually stunning entry in the trilogy, and Hans Zimmer provides a wonderfully eerie score. Please do not make any more comparisons to Silence Of The Lambs- because the filmakers did not want to do something done before!The Director's Cut should be out on DVD in the winter, good eatin':&gt;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Silence of the Lambs will always be superior to this film. However, I have never seen an actor have more fun with a character than Anthony Hopkins has with the esteemed Dr. Lecter. He simply IS Hannibal the Cannibal. You can't help but smile when he says "Okee-dokee." The rest of the cast was quite good as well. Liotta plays the arrogant Krendler well, and who else but Gary Oldman could bring out Mason Verger from under all that makeup? Giancarlo Giannini also stood out as the doomed Inspector Pazzi. A few days after I saw the film, a friend asked me the inevitable question: Was Julianne Moore better or worse than Jodie Foster? My answer: Different. I don't think it's fair to judge the actress based on another actress's performance ten years earlier.As for the violence of the film, I think many people are overreacting. Yes, some of it is merely violence for violence's sake, but the goriest scenes are done with tongue planted firmly in cheek, in my opinion. Many times during the film, I found myself thinking, "I shouldn't be laughing at this." Hopkins has said that during the filming of the film's finale, he and director Ridley Scott were laughing their asses off. It's easy to see why. I won't give away the ending, but while it contained the darkest of humor, I found it humorous nonetheless. All in all, I quite enjoyed the film. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A silly studio mistake breaks the Silence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT The film is a bit overlong, nothing actually happens to make it worth the time, there are no great revelations (what subtle shades of character development that are made in The Silence of the Lambs are blown up and drawn in garrish technocolor here).Hannibal annoys me in a way similar to how I was annoyed by the absolutely unsatisfying X-Men. To certain degrees the movies are similar, both have interesting characters, interesting moral and social questions, and decent enough budgets to be fully explored. Both movies lacked proper character development, rational motivation, conflict, satisfactory revolutions. You enter and leave both films without knowing anything more about the characters than when you entered. When the plot is forgetful, as it is in both cases, then this is the death's head of all critical arguement.So how does Hannibal look? Well I plucked in my dvd of the Silence of the Lambs and turned on the commentary track. Silence is by Stop Making Sense director Demme while Hannibal is from future Academy Award Winner Ridley Scott. Silence looks much more like an episode of the X-Files. This really surprised me, but then I started to see the obvious parallels. I will say in all honesty that I do not think that there would be a series called the X-Files had Chris Carter not seen this movie because there are some very conspicuous similarities.That said, Silence and the X-Files probably have a certain feel of realism that Hannibal sadly lacks. It is not enough that Hannibal takes place in some of the most visually interesting locations imaginable, no Scott has to waste his environments. Silence was shot on a much cheaper budget which makes its cinema verite style all the more essential for presenting its very gruesome subject matter. Hannibal tries to take Hopkins' Lector and portray it as artistry. Unfortunately he neither treats the cinematography nor the subject matter with a delicate brush. Instead he paints an ugly picture with such broad brushstrokes that he leaves us with little more than an overpriced lampoon of this film's predecessor. Hannibal turns into a bogeyman and cultural elitist, his love for Clarice draws him to cut off his hand to save her and himself (perhaps this is trying to prove to us that since she wouldn't become Lector's protege that he had lost his right hand?).I have seen episodes of bewitched which carry more plot weight which surprised me to see the reaction of the moviegoers that surrounded us in the theatre. Most of them were satisfied with the movie, more still enjoyed the obvious twists and turns of the barely present plot. As far as violence is concerned, don't be fooled. Hannibal is no more violent than an episode of Ren &amp; Stimpy. Either Lector's calculated acts of violence are carried out through montage camerawork that remind of us of a bad Oliver Stone, or as it is in the finale, the climactic brain cooking sequence is both cartoonish and fake. Ray Liotta plays a character that has as much redeeming value as J. Phoenix in Gladiator so when Lector does take the vivesector to his brain our reaction is neither grossed out or shocked. But instead I am reminded of seeing the cripple Franklin as he opens the Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Like Franklin, for whom we feel no pity for throughout the film, Scott is just p***ing into a can. I hope Scott remembers that when the Academy hands him his trophy. He should be glad that he is competing against the Van Sants, the Camerons, and the Ang Lees. Because he sure as stuff couldn't hold bed pans of the Powells, Pressburgers, Kurosawas, or Bunuels.</fullReview>

Julianne Moore creates a character we care little about - she spends most of the movie warning others what Lecter's capable of doing. Anthony Hopkins, reprising his most famous role, offers nothing new as Hannibal; there's a certain feeling of seen-and-heard-that-before.

		<fullReview>First of all this is not part 2. It's part three. Part 1 was Manhunter (Red Dragon, great movie), part two (the in my opinion very disapointing and laughable) Silence of the Lambs and part 3 Hannibal. I think this is a very good movie, very suspenseful and actually not more "violent" than Silence or Manhunter. This one is just a little more gory. I also think it's a very good book-to-film achievement, even though (SPOILER AHEAD) some characters are missing and the end is not the end of the book, but the scene is a different one in the book, in the middle section of the book. (SPOILER END). Ridley Scott did a very good job on this movie just like you would expect a Ridley Scott movie. And the actors are pretty good also. I truly recommend this movie to everyone who likes either Scott's films or Thriller/Horror films. 9/10 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is being assessed unfairly!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Begin, I would like to note that the film 'Hannibal' is the most recent entry in the Lecter trilogy. Manhunter (aka Red Dragon) in '86 was the initial entry, Silence Of The Lambs is the second. Just as Manhunter and Silence Of The Lambs are two unique stories, with Hannibal Lecter playing a different role within these films, Ridley Scott's Hannibal is even more unique. The reason people did not enjoy this film was because Hollywood sequels are meant to cash in on the popularity of the previous entries, and grind out the same basic plot. 'Hannibal' the film was totally based on Thomas Harris's novel of the same name, with minor changes made (including the ending), but for the benefit of the viewer satisfaction. The execution of this film is excellent, with Anthony Hopkins (63 years old!) and Julianne Moore (Jodie Foster would not be believable in this story), Gary Oldman, and Ray Liotta flushing out excellent characters. Ridley Scott provides the most visually stunning entry in the trilogy, and Hans Zimmer provides a wonderfully eerie score. Please do not make any more comparisons to Silence Of The Lambs- because the filmakers did not want to do something done before!The Director's Cut should be out on DVD in the winter, good eatin':&gt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest movie ever, but Hopkins has a blast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, Silence of the Lambs will always be superior to this film. However, I have never seen an actor have more fun with a character than Anthony Hopkins has with the esteemed Dr. Lecter. He simply IS Hannibal the Cannibal. You can't help but smile when he says "Okee-dokee." The rest of the cast was quite good as well. Liotta plays the arrogant Krendler well, and who else but Gary Oldman could bring out Mason Verger from under all that makeup? Giancarlo Giannini also stood out as the doomed Inspector Pazzi. A few days after I saw the film, a friend asked me the inevitable question: Was Julianne Moore better or worse than Jodie Foster? My answer: Different. I don't think it's fair to judge the actress based on another actress's performance ten years earlier.As for the violence of the film, I think many people are overreacting. Yes, some of it is merely violence for violence's sake, but the goriest scenes are done with tongue planted firmly in cheek, in my opinion. Many times during the film, I found myself thinking, "I shouldn't be laughing at this." Hopkins has said that during the filming of the film's finale, he and director Ridley Scott were laughing their asses off. It's easy to see why. I won't give away the ending, but while it contained the darkest of humor, I found it humorous nonetheless. All in all, I quite enjoyed the film. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A silly studio mistake breaks the Silence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT The film is a bit overlong, nothing actually happens to make it worth the time, there are no great revelations (what subtle shades of character development that are made in The Silence of the Lambs are blown up and drawn in garrish technocolor here).Hannibal annoys me in a way similar to how I was annoyed by the absolutely unsatisfying X-Men. To certain degrees the movies are similar, both have interesting characters, interesting moral and social questions, and decent enough budgets to be fully explored. Both movies lacked proper character development, rational motivation, conflict, satisfactory revolutions. You enter and leave both films without knowing anything more about the characters than when you entered. When the plot is forgetful, as it is in both cases, then this is the death's head of all critical arguement.So how does Hannibal look? Well I plucked in my dvd of the Silence of the Lambs and turned on the commentary track. Silence is by Stop Making Sense director Demme while Hannibal is from future Academy Award Winner Ridley Scott. Silence looks much more like an episode of the X-Files. This really surprised me, but then I started to see the obvious parallels. I will say in all honesty that I do not think that there would be a series called the X-Files had Chris Carter not seen this movie because there are some very conspicuous similarities.That said, Silence and the X-Files probably have a certain feel of realism that Hannibal sadly lacks. It is not enough that Hannibal takes place in some of the most visually interesting locations imaginable, no Scott has to waste his environments. Silence was shot on a much cheaper budget which makes its cinema verite style all the more essential for presenting its very gruesome subject matter. Hannibal tries to take Hopkins' Lector and portray it as artistry. Unfortunately he neither treats the cinematography nor the subject matter with a delicate brush. Instead he paints an ugly picture with such broad brushstrokes that he leaves us with little more than an overpriced lampoon of this film's predecessor. Hannibal turns into a bogeyman and cultural elitist, his love for Clarice draws him to cut off his hand to save her and himself (perhaps this is trying to prove to us that since she wouldn't become Lector's protege that he had lost his right hand?).I have seen episodes of bewitched which carry more plot weight which surprised me to see the reaction of the moviegoers that surrounded us in the theatre. Most of them were satisfied with the movie, more still enjoyed the obvious twists and turns of the barely present plot. As far as violence is concerned, don't be fooled. Hannibal is no more violent than an episode of Ren &amp; Stimpy. Either Lector's calculated acts of violence are carried out through montage camerawork that remind of us of a bad Oliver Stone, or as it is in the finale, the climactic brain cooking sequence is both cartoonish and fake. Ray Liotta plays a character that has as much redeeming value as J. Phoenix in Gladiator so when Lector does take the vivesector to his brain our reaction is neither grossed out or shocked. But instead I am reminded of seeing the cripple Franklin as he opens the Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Like Franklin, for whom we feel no pity for throughout the film, Scott is just p***ing into a can. I hope Scott remembers that when the Academy hands him his trophy. He should be glad that he is competing against the Van Sants, the Camerons, and the Ang Lees. Because he sure as stuff couldn't hold bed pans of the Powells, Pressburgers, Kurosawas, or Bunuels.</fullReview>

If you think of it as a sequel to the 1991 classic, then you are in for a flop. On the other hand, if you consider it to be an independent film, then it is quite good. Many details, important details, were omitted, and this makes the story very complicated to comprehend for a person who has not read the book. The Silence of the Lambs is a very unique film, since the film is darker and more exciting than the book. Hannibal, on the other hand, is a bad adaptation of a book. The myth is over, unfortunately.</fullReview>

It just met my expectations for a large budget Hollywood movie;Predictable, insipid, no risks, simplistically politically correct, with some gratuitous gore thrown in for good measure.Save your money and buy yourself a nice bottle of Chianti (pff pfff pfff pffff) instead...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's surprising to see so many poor reviews of this film, I'd think the average IMDb reader/writer would know better than to expect a "sequel" to Silence of the Lambs (it takes place 10 years from those events people!!). Lets not also forget that this film is call 'Hannibal' not 'Clarice" so obviously HANNIBAL IS GOING TO BE THE MAIN CHARACTER. If you want to compare it to Silence of the Lambs understand first that this is not a pyschological thriller, nor a race against time thriller, nor a character study, in fact other than Anthony Hopkins and a few other minor simularities Hannibal is a film all on it's own. Ridley Scott was very smart and making it as far different from Silence of the Lambs as possible so *cough cough* morons wouldn't keep on comparing it to Silence of the Lambs but a film completely different. The characters have changed over the decade, just like we all do; so don't expect Clarice to be doing the same things as she did in Silence and don't expect Hannibal to still be sitting behind bars. This is a devilishly good film and those of you who won't accept it because of it's change of pace nor read the Thomas Harris novel that came out a year ago (Hah! And you call yourselves Silence of the Lambs fans!) than perhaps you should stay away from this one. For those that want to have a good time at a great movie, from a great director, with great acting, and great cinematography will have a blast with this. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shouldn't be compared to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Hannibal twice on its opening weekend, and I have some comments about the film. First, Hannibal was a well made film, and the performances turned in by Sir Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore were outstanding. The premise of the movie was interesting, as it put Hannibal in the unique position of potentially becoming a victim. Hopkins made the character equal parts dangerous and charming, as well as having a sense of humor. Moore, in taking over the role of FBI agent Clarice Starling, did what few actors in the movie industry would even attempt - playing a popular character originally played by an actor who is one of the very best (Jodie Foster). Though Moore seemed a little subdued, this is the way I expected Starling to be after 10 years from the last time we saw her. (If anyone doubts Ms. Moore's acting ability, I would suggest they go rent Boogie Nights. In that film, she displayed a strong range of emotions.) The part I found most interesting, though, was that of Detective Pazzi. He was a classic case of a flawed, yet not unlikeable, character whose actions lead to tragedy. Very Shakespearian. Overall, the movie was stylish and the cinematography was fine. I really enjoyed the more graphically intense scenes (those who saw the movie know what I mean), but I enjoyed them mostly because I had given up hope that today's "make everything safe for children to see" movie execs actually allowed the scenes to make it to the screen. To those who dismiss the movie as gross, or say that they liked Hannibal better in Silence of the Lambs because it only hinted at what kind of atrocious acts the good doctor is capable of, I say this; many of the people I know felt teased by SOTL, and they wanted to see Hannibal not just talking about his "skills" but performing them. This movie definitely gives us more than just some chilling dialogue about his acts. As for the pace of the film, there are a few scenes where things seem a bit slow, which would be okay if they added to the tension, but they don't always do this. Anyway, I would definitely recommend this movie not only to fans of Silence of the Lambs, but also to horror fans in general. Just try not to compare it to the original, because in many ways it is its own movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I left the theater a little dazed because I wasn't sure exactly what I saw. The age old problem with sequels remains: one cannot help having preconceived ideas, especially if the original was a masterpiece. What would we think if Hannibal preceded SOTL??? First off, the edge is off; now we know Hannibal, and are even comfortable with him. It's as if your neighbor is a convicted murderer but was let out after twenty years and now waters his lawn with a smile and a nod as you pass by. Second, the cannibalism is GONE! It's only referred too rather quaintly and not with a shudder. Thirdly, the psychological banter between him and Clarice, which should've been exploited as in the first time, is only obvious for a little bit. Mason Verger is a pathetic villian, as opposed to the looney kidnapper in SOTL. Hopkins, of course, is wonderful. Did anyone notice how he modulated his voice in the mall scene and sounded almost like Richard Burton? Lastly, Ridley Scott, I think for the first time using a contemporary setting, did his best with a less than tight script. There was little or no tension in this film, and that is what is fundamental in this type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not Just ABOUT a Serial Killer - This Film Has the SOUL of a Serial Killer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who thought `Silence of the Lambs' was just too cluttered with story and character, boy does Ridley Scott have a film for you!Forget that tedious build-up of suspense and intrigue, Scott rips the meat right off the ribs and cuts it up into little pieces - bare-bones stories are so much easier to digest that way.Poor little rookie Clarice Starling has grown up to be a grizzled veteran of the FBI. As the FBI does to all it's best female agents, they put her in the basement doing meaningless work to punish her for being a woman in a man's world.In the opening scene, Starling is in charge of taking down a group of the cities' most dangerous drug dealers. When things go badly, the FBI naturally blames Starling, even though everyone knows that it wasn't her fault. But that's all right, because now that the entire FBI is evil, we have a whole bunch of villains to terrorize our little Clarice. After all, a flesh-eating serial killer just isn't enough villain for one film.Who could be more despicable than a doctor who eats his patients livers? Well, a sexist FBI director, of course! Starling's boss, Ray Liotta, harasses her with blatantly sexists remarks every time he sees her. But she unfortunately can't do anything about it, who would believe her word over that of a man? Clarice, even though she's a brilliant, accomplished FBI agent, apparently suffers from Anita Hill Syndrome: It never even occurs to her to hide a voice-activated tape recorder in her purse to nail Liotta with his own words. That would require a twenty dollar investment and a trip to Radio Shack and would completely ruin the plot of this movie.I'll spare you a summary of the rest of the film, after all, the entire story is nothing more than a setup for the final scene, the money shot.Yes, the closing scene is one of the goriest acts of violence ever depicted on film. I suppose that's why the victim had to be made into the real villain of the film, to justify the cruelty.But suffice it to say that nothing about this movie is in any way compelling, believable or intelligent. If this film had half a brain in it's head , it would probably eat it.</fullReview>

However, I know I am in the minority here, but I like that ending and I would have liked to have seen that in the movie. The part about this movie that I did really did like was despite the fact that he was a brutal killer you still liked the guy. I found myself rooting for him. You get to see the softer side of the man when he takes care of Starling. It's like a dark and twisted romance and I would have liked to have seen more of it.As far as the gore goes. Yes there was some and when it happened it was pretty graphic. But it only happened in a few scenes and it really wasn't all that bad. In fact during that final dinner party scene I found myself wanting to laugh, I didn't think it was scary at all.Overall, I think it was an alright movie.

The ending which I didn't like in the book is dramatically changed for the film. I actually liked this ending better although it almost changed the entire premise of the authors ideas. Hopkins is fantastic as Hannibal, and Moore did a credible job as Clarice Starling although she may have tried a little too hard to appear like Jody Foster.

		<shortDescription>A Superb Black Comedy. Better than the first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason that this film has gotten such bad reviews is because people don't understand it. It was never meant to be like the first one and WAS meant to be campy and over the top. The filmmakers knew that if they even tried to make a movie like the first, they would fail miserably. So, they took another route and, boy, it was the right one.Ridley Scott, Dino Delaurentis, Anthony Hopkins, and Julianne Moore have all CLEARLY stated in numerous interviews that it is supposed to be something for you to be entertained by and to get a chuckle out of.I think that it is completely unfair to even compare it to the first, which, by itself, was no masterpiece. Lets break the first one down:Plot: The plot was not anything earth shattering. It was recycled from countless books and five o'clock news programs.Acting: Anthony Hopkins MADE the movie. The man is the finest actor in history! While Jodie Foster was good, anyone could have played her role. She was too subtle and, in my opinion, didn't fit in with a cast that was anything but subtle.Script: Nothing spectacular. Most of the dialogue was lifted out of the book and was only made good because of the actors.Direction: A little annoying sometimes. It got to the point where I was sick of closeups. It was overdone.Now lets look at the masterpiece that is HANNIBAL:Plot: Great. Over the top and hysterical! The characters were fleshed out, the scenes in Italy were breathtaking, and they did a better job than the book (with the exception of Margot being cut out!:()Acting: Beyond words. Anthony Hopkins was fabulous, Julianne Moore was outstanding (AS ALWAYS! Probably the best actress of our time!), Gary Oldman was a hoot,Giancarlo Gianninni was fantastic, and Ray Liotta was great, as he is in every role! One of the best casts ever assembled!Script: Remarkable. The dialogue never felt strained or fake and made me laugh quite a bit.Direction: I was spellbound. This is one of Ridley Scott's best films. The scenery, the shots, everything about it was breathtaking. Demme, eat your heart out!Hannibal packs a punch. Run, jump, leap to see it. Don't look at it as a sequel, its not. Its an entertaining, funny, gory, breathtaking thrill ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Thats why I give it an 11 out of 10!PS: The dinner scene will make you cringe with excitement and laughter!11/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully photographed but otherwise, insipid nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie expecting something worse than Silence Of The Lambs. I expected better than this.The plot is entirely predictable throughout and there is not one scene in which you are not able to easily guess the outcome before it has begun.The cinematography is excellent, however, although without this one redeeming feature I would have left the picture before the end (something which I have never done before).Hannibal's character is not developed in any sense, and the character of Starling is so 2 dimensional that one wonders if the screen writer actually saw SOTL.The film was not a disappointment, as how can Hollywood now disappoint? It just met my expectations for a large budget Hollywood movie;Predictable, insipid, no risks, simplistically politically correct, with some gratuitous gore thrown in for good measure.Save your money and buy yourself a nice bottle of Chianti (pff pfff pfff pffff) instead...</fullReview>

Anthony Hopkins is brilliant, bringing different approaches to his way of living. Julianne Moore plays Clarice in a good way, but she is no Jodie Foster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's surprising to see so many poor reviews of this film, I'd think the average IMDb reader/writer would know better than to expect a "sequel" to Silence of the Lambs (it takes place 10 years from those events people!!). Lets not also forget that this film is call 'Hannibal' not 'Clarice" so obviously HANNIBAL IS GOING TO BE THE MAIN CHARACTER. If you want to compare it to Silence of the Lambs understand first that this is not a pyschological thriller, nor a race against time thriller, nor a character study, in fact other than Anthony Hopkins and a few other minor simularities Hannibal is a film all on it's own. Ridley Scott was very smart and making it as far different from Silence of the Lambs as possible so *cough cough* morons wouldn't keep on comparing it to Silence of the Lambs but a film completely different. The characters have changed over the decade, just like we all do; so don't expect Clarice to be doing the same things as she did in Silence and don't expect Hannibal to still be sitting behind bars. This is a devilishly good film and those of you who won't accept it because of it's change of pace nor read the Thomas Harris novel that came out a year ago (Hah! And you call yourselves Silence of the Lambs fans!) than perhaps you should stay away from this one. For those that want to have a good time at a great movie, from a great director, with great acting, and great cinematography will have a blast with this. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shouldn't be compared to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Hannibal twice on its opening weekend, and I have some comments about the film. First, Hannibal was a well made film, and the performances turned in by Sir Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore were outstanding. The premise of the movie was interesting, as it put Hannibal in the unique position of potentially becoming a victim. Hopkins made the character equal parts dangerous and charming, as well as having a sense of humor. Moore, in taking over the role of FBI agent Clarice Starling, did what few actors in the movie industry would even attempt - playing a popular character originally played by an actor who is one of the very best (Jodie Foster). Though Moore seemed a little subdued, this is the way I expected Starling to be after 10 years from the last time we saw her. (If anyone doubts Ms. Moore's acting ability, I would suggest they go rent Boogie Nights. In that film, she displayed a strong range of emotions.) The part I found most interesting, though, was that of Detective Pazzi. He was a classic case of a flawed, yet not unlikeable, character whose actions lead to tragedy. Very Shakespearian. Overall, the movie was stylish and the cinematography was fine. I really enjoyed the more graphically intense scenes (those who saw the movie know what I mean), but I enjoyed them mostly because I had given up hope that today's "make everything safe for children to see" movie execs actually allowed the scenes to make it to the screen. To those who dismiss the movie as gross, or say that they liked Hannibal better in Silence of the Lambs because it only hinted at what kind of atrocious acts the good doctor is capable of, I say this; many of the people I know felt teased by SOTL, and they wanted to see Hannibal not just talking about his "skills" but performing them. This movie definitely gives us more than just some chilling dialogue about his acts. As for the pace of the film, there are a few scenes where things seem a bit slow, which would be okay if they added to the tension, but they don't always do this. Anyway, I would definitely recommend this movie not only to fans of Silence of the Lambs, but also to horror fans in general. Just try not to compare it to the original, because in many ways it is its own movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I left the theater a little dazed because I wasn't sure exactly what I saw. The age old problem with sequels remains: one cannot help having preconceived ideas, especially if the original was a masterpiece. What would we think if Hannibal preceded SOTL??? First off, the edge is off; now we know Hannibal, and are even comfortable with him. It's as if your neighbor is a convicted murderer but was let out after twenty years and now waters his lawn with a smile and a nod as you pass by. Second, the cannibalism is GONE! It's only referred too rather quaintly and not with a shudder. Thirdly, the psychological banter between him and Clarice, which should've been exploited as in the first time, is only obvious for a little bit. Mason Verger is a pathetic villian, as opposed to the looney kidnapper in SOTL. Hopkins, of course, is wonderful. Did anyone notice how he modulated his voice in the mall scene and sounded almost like Richard Burton? Lastly, Ridley Scott, I think for the first time using a contemporary setting, did his best with a less than tight script. There was little or no tension in this film, and that is what is fundamental in this type.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you who thought `Silence of the Lambs' was just too cluttered with story and character, boy does Ridley Scott have a film for you!Forget that tedious build-up of suspense and intrigue, Scott rips the meat right off the ribs and cuts it up into little pieces - bare-bones stories are so much easier to digest that way.Poor little rookie Clarice Starling has grown up to be a grizzled veteran of the FBI. As the FBI does to all it's best female agents, they put her in the basement doing meaningless work to punish her for being a woman in a man's world.In the opening scene, Starling is in charge of taking down a group of the cities' most dangerous drug dealers. When things go badly, the FBI naturally blames Starling, even though everyone knows that it wasn't her fault. But that's all right, because now that the entire FBI is evil, we have a whole bunch of villains to terrorize our little Clarice. After all, a flesh-eating serial killer just isn't enough villain for one film.Who could be more despicable than a doctor who eats his patients livers? Well, a sexist FBI director, of course! Starling's boss, Ray Liotta, harasses her with blatantly sexists remarks every time he sees her. But she unfortunately can't do anything about it, who would believe her word over that of a man? Clarice, even though she's a brilliant, accomplished FBI agent, apparently suffers from Anita Hill Syndrome: It never even occurs to her to hide a voice-activated tape recorder in her purse to nail Liotta with his own words. That would require a twenty dollar investment and a trip to Radio Shack and would completely ruin the plot of this movie.I'll spare you a summary of the rest of the film, after all, the entire story is nothing more than a setup for the final scene, the money shot.Yes, the closing scene is one of the goriest acts of violence ever depicted on film. I suppose that's why the victim had to be made into the real villain of the film, to justify the cruelty.But suffice it to say that nothing about this movie is in any way compelling, believable or intelligent.

OK "Silence of the lambs" has more suspense than this one but "Hannibal" is still entertaining. It keeps you sitting on the front of your seat! The dialogues are very good too and we see Dr. Lecter on duty. The brain scene is very shocking in my opinion! Ray Liotta plays it perfect! He gives the moment a dark humor. And Gary Oldman as Mason Verger. It is his best role ever. Julianne Moore is good too but not as good as Jodie Foster. This movie has a great atmosphere, is full of suspense, especially everytime when Antony Hopkins appears, and a bit of very funny dark humor!

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but falls far short of "Silence"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Silence of the Lambs" is my favorite movie ever. Needless to say, I was anxiously awaiting Thomas Harris' "Hannibal" when the book came out a couple years ago. Unfortunately, it was one of the biggest disappointments ever. The story was silly. The ending was unquestionably idiotic. Harris sold Clarice Starling down the river. After reading that book, my enthusiasm for a "Silence" sequel was next to nothing.But, despite my reservations, I went to see the new movie "Hannibal" on its opening weekend, and I have to admit I enjoyed it far more than I ever thought I would. It's not that it's a great movie. But it is entertaining and engaging.Ridley Scott's direction and the cinematography are terrific. This movie LOOKS very good. The performances are very good all around. As many have said, Anthony Hopkins is brilliant. He's quickly becoming a national treasure. (He became a US citizen recently.) Julianne Moore does a fine job filling the difficult-to-fill shoes of Jodie Foster. The ending is slightly more palatable than the book's (sorry, bad pun), but it's still a little silly.Now for the negatives:Moore, as good as she is, just isn't Clarice. There were scenes where I found myself wishing Foster was there. The few exchanges between Lecter and Clarice would have been so much more interesting. This isn't Moore's fault, but what can I say?There are lots of problems with this film (ridiculous plot, a less forboding Lecter, etc.). But those problems are problems with the source material, not the people who made this movie. I believe they did as good a job making "Hannibal" into an entertaining movie as they could, considering the book they were working with.In summary, "Hannibal" is a fun night out at the movies (if you don't mind some serious gore), but it isn't art. It lacks the intelligence, psychological mindgames, and resonance of "Silence." No wonder Jodie bowed out.(6.5 out of 10)</fullReview>

If what you were looking for was a repeat of Silence of the Lambs, you'll be disappointed. The psychological manipulation is lacking from Lecter's character, and he is more vulnerable in this movie. Moore did a wonderful portrayal of Clarice, but I missed Foster. Overall a good movie, very pleasing and humorous at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For everyone who keeps saying that "Hannibal" wasn't as good as the "original", I ask: What original? This is not a sequel and should stand on its own as a film. No, it isn't as good as "Silence of the Lambs". It IS a hell of a lot better than "Manhunter" and a thousand other similar works.As a film, "Hannibal" is a whole lot of fun! Yeah, it gets a little slow at times and the characters aren't really well developed. But, what do you expect? This is not a psychological thriller. This is a rather inspired horror/comedy. It's not particularly frightening. But when it works, it works. The scenes that are supposed to be disturbing, ARE disturbing. And that's what we want, right? I was shocked a few times. I also laughed, gasped, and generally had a good time.So, give "Hannibal" a break. Ridley Scott, et al., have given audiences a slick, well crafted popcorn movie. Leave SOTL alone. "Hannibal" is a completely different experience, and a very enjoyable one at that!</fullReview>

Anyone going to see "Silence 2" will of course be disappointed. This movie was ABOUT Hannibal Lecter, not Starling. She was just a person who was there to draw out Hannibal and to show us the relationship that was and is brewing between Hannibal and Starling.When Harris writes the third book and they make a movie from that, you will see the culmination of that relationship. My favorite part was when Hannibal was trying to draw Starling out. That was an absolutely riveting scenario.Hats off to Ridley Scott and to Sir Anthony Hopkins. Moore also did a very good job, she wasn't as great as Foster would have been, but she made me believe it was Starling.Anyone, who reads these before seeing the movie, Expect to be feeling scared, exhilarated, and excited throughout this whole movie!Have fun and Have a Good Evening, as Hannibal would say!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the exception of only a handful of films, sequels are destined to be lesser counterparts to the original. Hannibal falls into that trap, and though Ridley Scott's dynamite, razor-sharp direction of Gladiator helped propel that movie to critical and box-office success, he seems to be going through the motions in Hannibal.Hannibal brings back the psychotic yet intellectual creation that is Anthony Hopkin's Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who has been reclusive in Europe since his escape in 1991. He re-emerges when Agent Clarice Starling becomes victim of a smear campaign (led by Ray Liotta) against her questionable actions during a routine FBI sting. While Julianne Moore tackles the role of Starling with such skill that the pall of Jodie Foster never befalls her, Anthony Hopkins' role seems severely underwritten. He's the title character, yet we spend more than half the time focused on subplots involving far less intriguing characters, including an Italian detective and a vengeful victim, played by an almost unrecognizable Gary Oldman. And as much as it pains to say, Ray Liotta seems to be losing more and more the chance to redeem himself with every dislikeable, cardboard role he plays. Also, while Scott's use of shaky cinematography may have worked well in bloody, medieval battles, this visual style is distracting here. Can't we actually see a battle between Hopkins and co. instead of a camera jittering above their struggle? Hannibal is, at best, a plodding, redundant, and poorly written movie that bears little to no resemblance to the stylish, dark, and intelligent thriller Silence of the Lambs (besides the characters). It's thoroughly uneven and plays more like a big-budget slasher flick than a grisly, engrossing thriller. Stick to the original, where hearing Dr. Lecter make sucking sounds for two seconds is much more enjoyable than this misfire.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal is the long awaited, third entry in Thomas Harris' Hannibal Lecter trilogy. The first was the Manhunter, The next was the hugely successful Silence of the Lambs. The third entry is not so successful.Hannibal begins with an unsettling prologue where a hideously disfigured, wheelchair-bound man is having a conversation with two other men, in a large antique room around a fireplace. This man is Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), who's face is in it's state due to a grisly encounter with Hannibal Lecter. He then asks them is he could see 'it'. One of the men produces a box to Verger, who smiles and laughs to himself at what he sees. It is Hannibal Lecter's face-guard, which was used on him to keep him from attacking people during his transfers from his cell in Silence of the Lambs. We find out why Verger's so happy later on in the film.After this prologue, we then meet Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore, replacing Jodie Foster), a completely focused FBI agent who is about to undergo a drug bust in a fish market. A brilliantly edited gunfight follows, where Clarice shoots and kills five people, including the woman behind it all, an African American woman with a baby in a carriage across her shoulders. Clarice is now recognised as a killer, and has even received a letter from The Guinness Book of World Records asking her permission is they could publish her name in as the FBI agent who has killed the most people. This isn't the only thing haunting her either. She can't stop thinking about her interviews with Hannibal Lecter, and how psychologically frightening it was. Clarice's past is about to be revisited when she receives a letter from Dr. Lecter. Clarice is now back on the Lecter case, with the help of a slow-witted male partner (Ray Liotta).Clarice then receives a message from Mason Verger, who asks her to visit him and give some information on Lecter. She visits the man, and talks of Lecter, and Verger tells the horrifying story of how he became so deformed, in which Lecter talked him into cutting off his face and feeding it to his dogs. This story is told in a quickly edited, but nonetheless disturbing flashback. Mason wants revenge for this, and has organised it, too.Meanwhile, in Florence, the brilliant Hannibal Lecter is living happily, enjoying the beautiful scenery, going to operas, and living his life the way he had always dreamed of, after being locked in a grimy cell for 18 years. When a detective from the area finds out he is a dangerous murderer, and there is a huge reward for finding him, he sets out to capture him and collect his reward. He sends surveillance footage from a department store of Lecter to the FBI in the US, and Clarice immediately responds, telling him to stop, because it is too dangerous to go after him. Of course the detective doesn't listen, and does.The film is gripping, riveting and restrained up until this point, when Lecter makes his first kill. In Silence of the Lambs, he was so creepy because we never saw the murders he committed, and his murders were so bizarre that we couldn't even imagine how he could carry them out. In Hannibal, the magician gives away his secret, as he hangs the detective from the top floor of a museum, with the man's stomach cut open so his organs all fall out onto the ground below, reminiscent of a painting he was lecturing on in the gallery before. What's worse is that Hopkins is given so many one-liners that it leans more towards black comedy than dark thriller. Ridley Scott shows his murder scenes as graphically and realistically as possible, with every scene that features this slightest bit of gore filmed in extreme-close-up, so it isn't disturbing, just as gross as a low-budget horror movie, and nowhere near as fun. It doesn't get much better from there on. The film is mainly restricted to scenes where someone walks into the house and realises someone else is in there, or someone is killed off in another graphic and creative way. The violence isn't dark either, because it is filled up with ample amounts of comic relief, and is nearly always accompanied by the 2001: A Space Odyssey theme. The now legendary 'brain feeding' scene is what sums up the movie. It's superbly done, and probably stands as the most daring thing ever put on film. It's so well lit, edited, filmed so realistically done, and is so well acted as the drugged man's skull is neatly cut open by Lecter, the brain cavity is cut out, served in herb, and fed to him, as a drugged Julianne Moore watches on, in a dazed state. This scene doesn't say anything, it doesn't mean anything, it's just there to shock and disgust. In which it succeeds admirably.While watching, you nearly forget about Silence of the Lambs, as you are rooting for Lecter, and not Clarice, because she's barely the star of this freak-show. You can barely even remember that she's in, and because of the gruesome mayhem that has already occurred, you don't care about what happens to her. Which is a real shame, because Moore makes a fine Clarice. As for Hopkins, he is limited to just having fun with his witty lines and grisly murders. Gary Oldman is creepy and sinister as Mason Verger.The film's source material by Thomas Harris is a great book, and seems so easy to get to screen, especially by Pulitzer prize-winning screenwriter David Mamet, and Academy Award winner Steven Zaillian.As for Ridley Scott, he crafts a sometimes riveting and gripping thriller, but he knows he is capable of doing something better. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BIG DISAPPOINTMENT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was thoroughly disgusted with this movie. It was nothing but a horror flick with some pretty sick and twisted scenes. The original is such a masterpiece that messed with your minds and had you on the edge of your seat. Not to mention, the relationship between Dr. Lecter and Clarice was so intriguing while this movie was just shallow and gross. Anthony Hopkins does a great job but I did not like Julianne Moore. She did not fit the character at all. I salute Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster for having enough integrity to not do this movie because of the content. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morbidly intense and overwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this film reminded me of the first 10 minutes of Armageddon. The editing is quick, with extreme closeups and gliding shots. The editing is so fast at times, (like any Michael Bay movie) that you are thrust into the next moment before being given a complete look at the previous one.This film is not slow paced at all cinematically. In Silence, a single shot lasts for a while, giving you time to fully digest the facial expression, and the moment as a whole. Hannibal is not Silence, it is a chase movie. And the camera work, as beautiful as it is at times, enhances this fast paced story. I thought the final scenes with Julianne and Hopkins, after the "dinner" were as beautiful and as intense as anything i have ever scene on the screen. This moment was only enhanced by the horror of what we had just seen prior to this. A sign of a good movie, sometimes, is one that actually has a physical effect on you. Of course, any gore can accomplish this. (Note: Mason Verger's character could accomplish this on its own!) Yet, when intensity of storyline, gore, character, and music come from quality sources, you take it all the more seriously, such as with anything in life. Overall, the movie made me think, not about intelligent issues that arise (which there are few), but of the out-of-the-ordinary experience I had in seeing Hannibal. As simple as any story is, if the devices used to tell the story are strong and well thought out, a simple story becomes a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but falls far short of "Silence"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Silence of the Lambs" is my favorite movie ever. Needless to say, I was anxiously awaiting Thomas Harris' "Hannibal" when the book came out a couple years ago. Unfortunately, it was one of the biggest disappointments ever. The story was silly. The ending was unquestionably idiotic. Harris sold Clarice Starling down the river. After reading that book, my enthusiasm for a "Silence" sequel was next to nothing.But, despite my reservations, I went to see the new movie "Hannibal" on its opening weekend, and I have to admit I enjoyed it far more than I ever thought I would. It's not that it's a great movie. But it is entertaining and engaging.Ridley Scott's direction and the cinematography are terrific. This movie LOOKS very good. The performances are very good all around. As many have said, Anthony Hopkins is brilliant. He's quickly becoming a national treasure. (He became a US citizen recently.) Julianne Moore does a fine job filling the difficult-to-fill shoes of Jodie Foster. The ending is slightly more palatable than the book's (sorry, bad pun), but it's still a little silly.Now for the negatives:Moore, as good as she is, just isn't Clarice. There were scenes where I found myself wishing Foster was there. The few exchanges between Lecter and Clarice would have been so much more interesting. This isn't Moore's fault, but what can I say?There are lots of problems with this film (ridiculous plot, a less forboding Lecter, etc.). But those problems are problems with the source material, not the people who made this movie. I believe they did as good a job making "Hannibal" into an entertaining movie as they could, considering the book they were working with.In summary, "Hannibal" is a fun night out at the movies (if you don't mind some serious gore), but it isn't art. It lacks the intelligence, psychological mindgames, and resonance of "Silence." No wonder Jodie bowed out.(6.5 out of 10)</fullReview>

If what you were looking for was a repeat of Silence of the Lambs, you'll be disappointed. The psychological manipulation is lacking from Lecter's character, and he is more vulnerable in this movie. Moore did a wonderful portrayal of Clarice, but I missed Foster. Overall a good movie, very pleasing and humorous at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For everyone who keeps saying that "Hannibal" wasn't as good as the "original", I ask: What original? This is not a sequel and should stand on its own as a film. No, it isn't as good as "Silence of the Lambs". It IS a hell of a lot better than "Manhunter" and a thousand other similar works.As a film, "Hannibal" is a whole lot of fun! Yeah, it gets a little slow at times and the characters aren't really well developed. But, what do you expect? This is not a psychological thriller. This is a rather inspired horror/comedy. It's not particularly frightening. But when it works, it works. The scenes that are supposed to be disturbing, ARE disturbing. And that's what we want, right? I was shocked a few times. I also laughed, gasped, and generally had a good time.So, give "Hannibal" a break. Ridley Scott, et al., have given audiences a slick, well crafted popcorn movie. Leave SOTL alone. "Hannibal" is a completely different experience, and a very enjoyable one at that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe some people thought this movie was too gory. No way! I believe this movie was way better than the book was. Anyone going to see "Silence 2" will of course be disappointed. This movie was ABOUT Hannibal Lecter, not Starling. She was just a person who was there to draw out Hannibal and to show us the relationship that was and is brewing between Hannibal and Starling.When Harris writes the third book and they make a movie from that, you will see the culmination of that relationship. My favorite part was when Hannibal was trying to draw Starling out. That was an absolutely riveting scenario.Hats off to Ridley Scott and to Sir Anthony Hopkins. Moore also did a very good job, she wasn't as great as Foster would have been, but she made me believe it was Starling.Anyone, who reads these before seeing the movie, Expect to be feeling scared, exhilarated, and excited throughout this whole movie!Have fun and Have a Good Evening, as Hannibal would say!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal, the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, is a disappointment. Before I saw Hannibal, I had to of course watch SOTL but also watch Manhunter. So by watching these two films, it set the expectation level enourmously high, too high for most films. I went expecting the film to be better than just good, but it ended up being just good.As far as the pace of Hannibal, it's very slow. I had heard that the film was fast paced but found myself yawning from time to time even if the scene at that point was good. The pace was steady throughout but too slow. The first two scenes were great but it went too slow afterwards. The dialogue is snappy and well done but the script itself seems out of place.When it comes to acting, you can't say anything bad about these actors. Of course as usual, Sir Anthony Hopkins turns in a superb performance. Julianne Moore is steady as Clarice and find out that she might have been the only one right for the film. The character is more physical and it didn't feel like it was a Jodie Foster type role. I like that Gillian Anderson might have been a little better though. Giancarlo Giannini also turns in a very good performance.AFTER THIS PARAGRAPH IS A SPOILER WARNING. I FEEL THAT WITHOUT MENTIONING THESE PLOT POINTS WOULD NOT MAKE THIS REVIEW COMPLETE. AFTER ALL, I HAVE TO BACK UP MY REVIEW.SPOILER WARNING!!!I think that the carnivorous pigs were humorous. Too humorous for a film this dark and gritty. The scenes of Clarice in the basement are a complete waste of the film. Sure hearing the old tapes of Clarice's and Lector's conversations are interesting, but there isn't much after that. It's just her listening to tapes and that's it. They should have had just a few basement scenes. Basically, Clarice is nothing but a couch potato in these scenes. Finally, the dinner party scene was pretty good but again, too humorous. But that scene puts you into a trance. It is so far out there that it's like wow. It's like you're feeling like you were on morphine like Clarice was. It was completely entrancing.SPOILER WARNING OVER.The film was good and that's it. I was disappointed but it was better than Manhunter. I think that if you haven't seen SOTL first, you're better off. I think those people will enjoy Hannibal better and then when they watch SOTL, they will say that SOTL is better. At that point, you can't go back and say that Hannibal was terrible because it's already preset in your mind that it was a great movie. Hannibal receives a B-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as "Lambs", but still an engaging experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing which should be noted is that "Hannibal" is NOT as good as "The Silence Of The Lambs". However, this is not entirely the fault of the filmmakers, as the third book in the trilogy is by far the worst. Instead of attempting to emmulate the success of the brilliant "Lambs", Ridley Scott takes his film in another direction, aiming more for black comedy than the tense psychological thriller that was this film's Oscar winning predeccesor. This angle, on the whole, works, although many will be disappointed, in particular with the violence of the ending, which is an unsatisfactory conclusion to an otherwise good film. There are plenty of gruesome moments, but none are unneccesary. Other problems include the make-up of new 'bad guy' Mason Verger, played by an unrecognisable Gary Oldman. The disfigured face of Verger should not be shown until the end of the film, and while the make-up is not bad, showing Oldman in the first scene spoils any sense of terror which could be drawn from the villain's evil visage. On the positive side, both Moore and Hopkins are fantastic, and Scott's direction is, on the whole, engaging. The final scene following the gruesome encounter is a gem, and while the film may be too gruesome for some, it is both entertaining and funny, and definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came away from "Hannibal" with the distinct feeling that something was missing. I knew I had not hated the film, and in fact, quite enjoyed the scenes in Italy. However, the rest came up short.The blame no doubt falls on Thomas Harris, whose novel destroyed the wonderful, somewhat magical, characters he created in Silence. That predecessor remains a cultural milestone because Lecter and Starling embody evil and good and we can feel the tension of their struggle. In Hannibal, the lines are blurred. Lecter becomes a comical villain, your typical one-liner spouting Hollywood lovable bad guy. Granted, Hopkins does it better than most, but the menace he exuded in Silence is missing.As for Clarice, Moore does a good job, as she does in everything she is in. However, it's the character that has changed. Sure, 10 years have passed, but that does not excuse the disloyalty Harris shows for Starling. Foster turned down the role for that very reason and it is obvious why. I cannot believe she has the record for most people killed in the line of duty. The precedence is just not there.As for the much hyped gore-it was just another marketing tool. The exposed brain scene is played for comedic effect and a sense of terror is never felt. The fact that Lecter kills deplorable characters only lessens his own. The Lecter of Silence was a ruthless, maniacal savage, not subject to standard interpretations of morality. In Hannibal, Lecter is no longer a boogeyman, but an unorthodox, misunderstood hero.As much as we all wanted it, this movie should not have been made. The ending of Silence was perfect, and should have left us hungry for more, forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an amazing film! Name me another actor who could have pulled off the role of Hannibal better than Anthony Hopkins and i'll give you a medal. He was chilling and truly evil and yet at the same time you cant help rooting for him. The plot was admittedly a bit slow at times but it was all relevant, necessary and dripping with atmosphere as you might expect from one of Ridley Scotts films. Anyone who has read the book should be doubly impressed with how it was converted into a film. The role of Clarice was i think based more on the book than in Silence of the Lambs because the whole image of Clarice in "Silence" was of someone much more vulnerable and much less formal. Watch this film and if you dont like it theres something wrong with you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lacked the exciting twists of Silence of the Lambs (SOTL).Lecter did not display the intense brilliance he possessed in SOTL.Starlings refusal to defend herself against accusations at the beginning of the movie was out of character and bizarre. She has in the previous movie, and in the rest of this movie, shown to be head strong, vocal and persistent about her beliefs and the truth.In SOTL you could see why Lecter, and the audience for that matter, was intrigued by and attracted to Starling, but in Hannibal none of that was evident. The script made Lecter came across as almost an obsessive stalker, which was not the heart of their relationship in SOTL, and Starling became a shallow and obsessive 'honest' cop.It wasn't a psycho thriller like SOTL. It wasn't clever enough. It even tried to be a gore-fest, and failed in that too, since there really wasn't enough gore throughout.The overriding problem can be summarised as this. Lecter's character was changed from being a brilliant person in SOTL to now being a 'moral' person in Hannibal. It was turned into a typical, shallow Hollywood morality play.'Look. Hannibal only hurts people who deserve it. He's such a nice person, isn't he, and those people he killed were so obviously bad. Good killer. Bad victims.'Overall. The movie failed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What could you expect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the thing. Hannibal was not an unenjoyable film. It had its moments, and all in all I enjoyed it. There are however a few problems. First, We have no right to expect that it could possibly be better than Silence of the Lambs, and for one simple reason. In order to get people into the theater for a sequel, filmmakers need to take something to "the next level", which in the case of Silence involved deviant behavior and gore. The thing is, in silence these moments of insanity and gore were thoroughly believable. We can imagine that there really are people somewhere, like Buffalo Bill, sewing together a body suit from human flesh as he dances around naked in his dank basement. This stuff happens. But in order to make hannibal one up the original, they had to take the gore and deviance to a new level, which is SO outlandish that it simply can't be believed. Hence, the terror factor is removed, only replaced with humor instead, which I don't think was intended. Examples:Spoilers.....Man eating wild boars? An elaborate plan to have Hannibal eaten by these man eating boars? The elaborate plan created by a man who cut off his own face, merely at suggestion? (Oh, well, why don't you cut off your face and feed it to the dogs? Oh, OK.) Cutting off the skull cap of Liotta, only to have him eat some of his gray matter? Hannibal chopping off his own hand? It goes on and on....End of SpoilersSo, that said, I'd also like to respond to all the nay sayers who have been disrespectful to Jodie Foster for skipping this one. I've even heard people complain that she wasn't good looking, so it's a good thing that she was replaced. (How low is that?) The reason Jodie didn't jump on board is because she realized that this film started with inferior material, and since she is one of our best actresses, who can blame her for making such a smart move? I only wish that Hopkins had realized this too. Anyhow, point is, Hannibal ends up being a comedy. I just wish that people would leave a perfect film like Silence alone, and not try to repeat its greatness, invariably failing and forcing guys like me to write cranky comments like this. The series should have ended with the first one, with Hannibal walking off free on some tropical island, a predator on the loose for eternity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silence of the lambs would be hard to top, everyone knew that. And when you think about it, the fact that a director like Demme made it and made it so god damn well is a thing to marvel at. So, did you get excited when you saw the ads- Hannibal is coming.... and he's directed by Ridley Scott. Oh yeah, that's really cool. If nothing else, it will look good. IF NOTHING ELSE. There is nothing else. Hannibal is all style, no substance. Ridley Scott, just like his brother, is a master at creating visual, er, feasts, that fall flat at the story mark. Hannibal is no exception. The film is long, confused and confusing, and meanders without getting to the point for ages. And when it does get to the point here's what it says: Guess what, Hannibal is the good guy! Surprised! What the film appears to be doing is turning Hannibal into some kind of serial killing superhero. We've seen it with Freddy Kreuger, Jason and even Michael Myers. It's a franchise formula for success. Hannibal kills people because he thinks they deserve it. They are the evil ones, not him. Those boorish slobs. Hey, he's just doing us all a favour. Throughout the film you are, if you can retain enough interest, rooting for Hannibal. Perhaps this isn't really a bad thing. After all, There's a bit of Hannibal in all of us. A lot has been made of the high level violence and explicit gore in the film and this is a fair point. The most controversial scene, however, is comical after the shock subsides. like the film itself, the scene drags, limply using shock value and possibly unintentional comicry to hold our attention. It's a great pity that the true moments of violence, which could have been disturbing and scary are self consciously reduced to gross out tactics and self deprecating humour. And THAT, is the true horror at play in this film. What a pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The real weakness of this movie, only partially lies in the use of gratuitous violence and the lack of under development of the new characters. The real fault is that the movie seems to have been a sequel to Silence of the Lambs, when in reality the two movies are as different as night and day. Silence of the Lambs is a much better movie for what it is. Every scene in 'silence' is meant to be there, lending itself to the movie as a whole. Hannibal has scenes in which there seems to be no real reason for them. 'Silence' also gets its scare factor from the twisted mind of Hannibal Lector rather then the unecesary violence that 'Hannibal' depends on.All in all, Hannibal would have been a much better movie without Clarice Starling. This tie to Silence of the Lambs simply over complicates the plot. This, combined with the scare tactics of the screenwriters makes Hannibal a disapointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal was okay. That's the best I can say. I was expecting a very good movie (especially after Silence of the Lambs), and was let down by the lack of psychological intensity that SOTL offered so well. In fact, the best dialogs between Hannibal and Clarice are clips from SOTL that Clarice listens to on cassette tape in the first half of the movie.This movie seemed to be more about how realistically graphic it could be, and not about the story or the characters. Without spoiling, the final scene (the very last two or three minutes) is particularly disturbing and totally unnecessary to the movie. Sir Anthony Hopkins did a fine job reprising his role as Lecter; Moore was dull and shallow as Clarice - this was probably due to the writing, however, as she (Moore) has shined in other films.I gave Hannibal 5 out of 10 stars. They could have done so much better with this movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destined to be a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who has seen Silence of the Lambs over 50 times, I know a classic when I see one. Sure, this movie isn't an 'instant' WOW, but I can guarantee that over time this movie will surely grow to become a classic. Think about it. The first time you saw SOTL, did you REALLY feel that it was as great as it was the 2nd, 3rd, 4th...time? No!! Give this movie a chance. It is one of those movies that each time you watch it you will notice new things, new 'hidden' agendas and messages.Julianne Moore did an excellent job as Clarice and you don't even think for a moment that someone else used to play that role. This movie definitely has potential. For those of you that are looking to be handed every little detail, forget about it. This movie leaves a lot to be thought about and as you leave the theatre, you will see what I mean.To me a good movie is one that leaves you thinking about it long after the closing credits. Hannibal is just that movie. For those of you that can't look deeper than the surface of a movie, there is always Saving Silverman. For those of you that need more from a movie, Hannibal is a sure bet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a clear example of how important direction is even with a wonderful performance from your star. I won't take anything away from Anthony Hopkins who gives a chilling and engaging performance once again as Hannibal Lecter. Rather, the fault lies with the director, Ridley Scott and a weak story. Scott paces the film like the way Hopkins plays Lecter: slow and methodical. It works for Lecter who is creepy and truly terrifying because he is so calm and patient. However pacing the film this way doesn't create for any suspense or terror, but rather it is irritating and boring. The Italian sequences feel empty because we don't have our protagonist Starling there to cling to. Julianne Moore turns in a decent performance, although Jodie Foster is greatly missed. The real loss to this film is the lack of Demme's direction and a decent story.</fullReview>

It was full of very intense scenes that make you wonder what will happen next and keep you on the edge of your seat. I particularly love this one since it features a lot more Hannibal in this one.

		<fullReview>"Hannibal" was one of the most brilliant horror films to have come out in the last decade. It defers from most on a very serious level.

I feel this movie (same as "Silence" and "Manhunter") is it's own film and should not really be compared to the last (or next). Without "Silence" or "Manhunter", people would be able to look at this movie in a much clearer way. What amused me most was how sick (mentally) the audience is... while watching this in the theatre I saw the audience laughing and cheering when someone would die or when blood would spurt from a wound.

		<shortDescription>A disappointing sequel to Silence of the Lambs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted, "Hannibal" certainly has its moments. Anthony Hopkins is excellent in his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter, the charming psychiatrist with some very dark extra-curricular activities. However, despite his noble attempt to carry the film, "Hannibal" ultimately seems to be reaching -- desperately -- for the same praise and fame that was showered upon Silence of the Lambs. In doing so, it resorts to over-the-top, ridiculous gore, and contrived suspense. Furthermore, the casting of Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling is ill-conceived, at best. She portrays none of the multi-layered personality that made Jodie Foster's performance so memorable and realistic. Perhaps worst of all, the makers of "Hannibal" apparently lacked the courage necessary to create a film as intense as "Silence of the Lambs," and instead peppered "Hannibal" with forced humor and campy dialogue.On its own merits, "Hannibal" qualifies as a slightly-better-than-average horror flick. As a sequel, though, it succeeds only in destroying the wonderfully-realistic characters that made "Silence of the Lambs" such a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not the spine tingling intellectual thriller that "Silence of the Lambs" was, "Hannibal" will, in my opinion, go down as one of the greatest horror/thriller films ever. The most graphic movie I have ever seen, the only real flaws are the changes from the novel that were made. The biggest is the absence of Jodi Foster. Julianne Moore does a fine job as Starling, but true fans will miss Foster's performance. Hopkins is flawless as the deranged MD, only adding to the nightmare factor of the character. The hidden performance by Gary Oldman (uncredited) as the Mason Verger, the only surviving member of Hannibal's victims, will leave you breathless from the first scene on. Again, not a great movie for a dinner date, but a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie adaptation of "Hannibal" came off better than I thought. Though you can't help feeling there were many scenes left on the cutting room floor, which may have sacrificed character development (what happened to Spike Jonze as Donnie Barber?) Hopefully, there will be a DVD release featuring deleted scenes. I hate when films are edited for running time. "Titanic" didn't have that problem.Anthony Hopkins is always great to watch no matter what the film is. Gary Oldman, unrecognizable as Mason Verger, definitely has his moments. As for Julianne Moore as Clarice, I actually liked her better than Jodie Foster. I liked that CLarice didn't live up to the expectations of "Silence", and that Guiness listed her as the female FBI agent with the most murders.My major problem, besides the editing and character sacrifice, was the ending. I thought it should have remained true to the book. The Hannibal from "Silence" managed to mesmerize not only Clarice, but an entire generation of filmgoers. *Book Spoiler* Had Clarice ran off with Hannibal as she did in the book it would have proven a triumph of just how powerful Hannibal's seductive evil really is. And the point of the book was how serial killers have captured our collective fascination, from the television profiles to the jailhouse romances they inspire.I do give the movie credit for making a good attempt at turning a difficult book into an effective film. Good job all around to the filmmakers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did Rick Baker work on this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Silence of the Lambs was an over rated film that unjustly went down in film annals as one of the best ever made. Hannibal, on the other hand is being criticized by the so called "experts" as being an inferior film. And while I don't think it is an amazing film, it sure is better than Silence ever was or could ever hope to be. Manhunter introduced us to Lecter, Silence furthered his character and Hannibal gets us inside his head, and I like what's in there. Kind of funny to say about a cannibalistic, psychotic, serial killer, isn't it?There are probably going to be about 1500 reviews in this forum about Hannibal so I will skip the usual boundaries of film review and leave that to better reviewers in here such as M.A.Rogers, who I'm sure will have a review in here somewhere about the film. If you really want to know if this is a good film or not, read his review. All I really want to say is a few things. First, this is head and shoulders above Silence of the Lambs and two, this is some of the best gore I have ever seen in any film, horror or otherwise. And I began to ask myself if Rick Baker was ever summoned to work on this film for the makeup and special effects. I scrolled down the credits and saw that he was not a part of it. Then I came across Greg Cannom's name and although he is not as familiar to me, his name did strike a chord. I thought I remembered seeing his name on Big Momma's House as a makeup guy. So I clicked onto his name and what a surprise I was in for. This guy has done some outstanding work on over 70 productions, including Little Nicky, Back to the Future II, Lost Boys and The Howling. And who did the Howling's makeup? Rick Baker. Greg Cannom must be a Rick Baker protegee. Well what a master this guy turned out to be. Baker will always be the king of makeup with films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th and such, but Cannom has to be the modern day master. I have never seen gore so realistically done in any movie, and that includes some of Baker's greats. There are two scenes in this film that just blew me away. One of course was the now infamous final scene where one character has to eat his own brain. This is so incredible, so gory and so so cool. Where most people were turning away in disgust and surprise, I was glued to my seat and asked myself over and over again: "How did they do that?" The realism in this film is unlike any I have ever been privy to in all the movies I have seen. I applaud Greg Cannom and his crew for making all the disgusting blood and guts that we see in this film. What a trip.As for the rest of the film, it is quite good. I enjoyed Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling and Gary Oldman is priceless as Mason Verger. I wonder if he will be mentioned next year at Oscar time. I doubt it but he is quite delicious as the man without a face. It's strange; Hannibal is a cold blooded killer that has murdered many people. He is fiendish and responsible for ruining many people's lives, yet we route for him. When he is in danger, we want people to help him. And that is what is quite amazing about the character and the film. Clarice has been drawn to him perhaps the same way that we have. We all know he is bad but we want to see him free. Even his final victim is a welcome death ( despite the cruelty of it ) because of how he is to Clarice. We want to see him die. And if that is the case, then there will be plenty more Hannibals to come. I look forward to the remake of Manhunter and to all the sequels that Hannibal will spawn. Silence of the Lambs was an okay film, Hannibal is better but not amazing and Manhunter was quite good. Now I want to see the next film in the series wow me in every way. Not just by feeding someone's brains to them, but with the whole film. If it can't find a way to do that, then a good disembowlment will have to saffice.8 out of 10- Props to Greg Cannom. Excellent work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I expected more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps it is strange to go into a sequel with high expectations, but such is the seduction of the combination of Ridley Scott and David Mamet. Much the same as when Jean-Pierre Juenet took over the helm of the Alien saga, this dynamic duo seemed just the ones to deliver a sequel on par with the original. While they surely didn't fail to the degree of Juenet, "Hannibal" lacks the punch and suspense of Silence of the Lambs. As usual, Scott's eye delivers a fine focus for the film. The crowd shots were handled with his signature grace, the lighting always in step with the scene. Some have quibbled about the graphic nature of several scenes, yet if they stopped to consider the story, they would have just taken another bite of popcorn. However, Mamet's adaptation of the Harris novel, was curious not only due to its deviation from what I felt was the book's more powerful conclusion, but being seduced into writing in the banal quips such as a passing couple stating "Lets get something to eat" to Hannibal's trite reply, "Lets". I actually checked my watch as the movie struggled to make the transition out Italy. Each scene painstakingly blocked to the point that editor Pietro Scalia dared not cut a shred of footage. All in all, if we forget that this is the follow up to one of the best thrillers of the 1990s, that heavy weights Scott and Mamet were at the helm, you are left with a well acted film. Anthony Hopkins has not lost a step in his reprisal of Lecter, Juilianne Moore makes the most of being in the unenviable position of replacing Foster and Gary Oldman delivers his signature ghoul performance as Mason Verger. Marred only by another lack luster performance by Ray Liotta (who has never lived up the promise shown in "Goodfellas"), the cast delivers. However, strong acting seldom makes up for a turgid screen play and poor editing and it fails here as well. There is no reason to give MGM theater prices for the privilege of seeing this on the big screen. Hannibal is little more than a Friday night rental when your too tired to get off the couch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Silence of the Lambs, I can only say that this movie carried on the greatness of Hannibal's character. I think that, independently, this movie is effective in portraying Hannibal Lechter as he was originally in Silence of the Lambs. Without having seen the first part, Hannibal can still be feared and respected, as an established character. Julianne Moore, I thought, played the roll of Clarice Starling well, not in the same style as Jodie Foster, but still very good. I think that she was more athletic, much more convincing as an FBI agent. The plot was great, the camera work was excellent, and the sound was a whole story in itself. The score for the movie was terrific in that it created the right mood and complimented scenes very well. Overall, a great movie.</fullReview>

I went to the movie expecting a disappointment but came out truly impressed. Julianne Moore did a tremendous job in the role of Clarice Starling. Anthony Hopkins showed that he still has it. This movie's only drawback was excessive amount of gore. Compared to Silence of the Lambs, this movie was truly gruesome. But the other attributes of the film countered this flaw. It is a definite must see film and will surely become a classic.</fullReview>

However I have two complaints, one, it didn't have the same dark atmosphere that made Silence of the Lambs and Manhunter so good, and two, although it did stick to the book (if you've read it this is a spoiler) the ending was dramatically different which gave an entirely different feel to the power of Hannibal Lecter's character. Without these two it would most assuredly be a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film and I must say that I was quite disappointed by the flow of the movie. Julian Moore was good as an older, more experienced Clarice. Hannibal is a scary, villainous murderer and vilifies the claims made in the first movie. The line that is trying to be drawn between good and evil is stupid. In Silence of the Lambs, Dr. Lector is made to be one of the most evil, diabolical and brilliant characters around, so in this movie are we supposed to be rooting for him? Give me a break! Also the movie makes one of his victims the bad guy because he wants revenge? Come on! Well acted and freaky, the movie does not seem to agree on what direction it wants to take.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor follow-up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal the cannibal made his long anticipated return to the silver screen last week, but it turns out that the hype did not pay off and this was a pretty poor completion in the eminent Hannibal trilogy.For the past year, `Hannibal,' the sequel to `The Silence Of The Lambs,' which won all major Oscars in 1991, has been the most talked about project in Hollywood. As it is in most cases, though, all of the hype it received does not pay off on screen. It's attempts at getting that feeling of psychological horror that the original payed off exceedingly well really fail. Instead, it comes off as a type of campy, peep show horror film. It resembles more of Freddy Krueger installment rather than a clever, psychological thriller.Everybody's favorite psychotic, Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), is now living in Florence, Italy under the false identity of an educated lecturer. The only of his fourteen victims to live, Mason Verger, whose face resembles a glob of Elmer's glue, has prepared a large reward for anyone who can entrap Hannibal and bring forth him to Verger. Mason Verger's scheme is to feed Hannibal alive to a bunch of large, savage boars. Mason's dominant form of bait is everyone's favorite FBI Agent (no, not Scully), Clarice Sterling (Julianne Moore).Julianne Moore, while mastering the character of Clarice Sterling down flat, lacks to offer the chemistry with Hopkins that Jodie Foster attained as the original Clarice. Anthony Hopkins is his usual brilliant self, on the other hand this guy is brilliant when reading through a TV Guide, therefore he may not obtain another Oscar this time around. In the end, all of the actors, even Hopkins, are put to rest by Gary Oldman and his deliciously devious depiction of the extra bad guy, Mason Verger (even though you won't even identify Oldman with the make up on).The big ending........ Director Ridley Scott, who most recently made `Gladiator,' most likely expected it to live up to the memorable `face lift' from the original film. It only reinforced the fact that `Hannibal' appeared analogous to a `Nightmare On Elm Street' installment.Oldman and the ravishing Florence scenery make up the two out of five stars that `Hannibal' receives. If you really want to see Anthony Hopkins put on a flawless performance, do yourself a favor and rent the original `Silence Of The Lambs'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm in a very small group of people who genuinely liked the book. I even liked the ending. As for the movie, I liked everything about it but the ending. The "shocking twist" wasn't very shocking and I was somewhat let-down. I would have preferred the book-ending rather than what they did with the movie. I didn't really miss Jodie Foster at all. I like Julianne Moore as the new Starling and I really couldn't see Jodie Foster taking on this movie anyway--she's not missed. I do wish there was a little more emotion coming from Clarice, she seemed a little too hardened after 10 years. Anthony Hopkins is different in this film compared to the first. He's a little over-the-top, but it's acceptable and understandable (the book was over-the-top as well). Here we see Hannibal free and living life, doing everything he's truly passionate about, yet he's bored and he needs to play. There were just a few parts in the plot that make little or no sense, but I will not spoil them here. I really missed some characters from the book that didn't make the movie, mainly Margot Verger (Mason's sister) and the swimming eel. There is an eel in the film, but it's shown quite briefly and nothing ever comes from it as it does in the book. I also don't think they fully explained the true relationship and emotions Hannibal and Clarice have for one another, whether it's fear, dread, hatred, love, father-figure, teacher, etc. They could have done a little more with the story had they not been so eager to make the film so quickly. Go see this film for your entertainment, but if you want the real story, read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth the wait. A thriller to out-thrill all thrillers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to movies, I thought I've seen it all. It takes a lot to impress me, let alone shock me. But on February 10th I was literally blown away. I can't give you the details, you'll have to see for yourself. The images from this film will stay in your mind forever.Aside from Roger Ebert (whom Dr Lecter, M.D. will never visit because he has no brains, no heart, no guts, and his head and butt are interchangeable), the only people who didn't like this movie are those who kept comparing it with "Silence of the Lambs" and Julianne Moore with Jodie Foster, or had no clue what was going on and failed to read between the lines. To all of you, put a sock in it. Go read the book.At first I too thought it wasn't gonna be the same without Foster but the truth is, Sir Anthony Hopkins was the center of the first movie, and still is in the sequel. They could have paired him up with any other actress, wouldn't have made much difference for he is the magnet that pulls you in and keeps you mesmerized, motionless, breathless...Julianne Moore does a great job. She doesn't try to imitate Foster in any way. She shows us a different side of Clarice, ten years later. From the moment she appears on screen she IS Clarice Starling, there's no doubt about it. Ms Foster was superb in SOTL and deserved the Oscar but she never comes to mind when you watch "Hannibal". Not once.I guess it's part of the human nature to be shocked, whether it's outrageous comedy (like Andrew Dice Clay; something that taps into deep, dark corners of the human soul), or the magic silver screen. Images can be a lot more powerful and shocking than words. They say words can't hurt you, you can hear something and take offense or laugh and forget about it. But visual perception becomes imprinted in our memory and we live with it for the rest of out lives.Even after the final credits finished rolling my mind was still deep at the bottom of some dark abyss, held there by some supernatural force and I couldn't shake it off. I wished I could put my head in a bucket of cold water and then scream at the top of my lungs until my voice fails me. Never had a movie make me feel like this. Well, maybe a couple came close but this one totally rocked my world. But aren't these the moments we all live for?Ridley Scott presents a masterwork of sheer momentum that rockets seamlessly towards its climax; a razor-sharp entertainment, beautifully constructed, brilliantly shot and guaranteed to chill your blood. Thrillers just don't come any better than this. A real roller coaster, full of hairpin turns, sickening descents and sudden accelerations. I'll go for a ride like this any day.I'm still not quite myself so you have to forgive me, I have to go outside and get a breath of fresh air, do inventory of the remainders of my sanity, if any, and check whether the top of my skull is still in place... See this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a Silence of the Lambs fan, I was very excited to see Hannibal. I've seen all the interviews with Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore, and thought I would be scared to death. I wasn't. Instead I was so grossed out, I almost left the theatre.The great thing about Silence of the Lambs was the dialog between Hannibal Lechter and Clarice. We all knew he was this horrible murderer, but it was his wit and brains that kept us all interested in Hannibal Lechter. The movie Hannibal had very little dialog between Hannibal and Clarice, and instead showed Hannibal as this bloodthirsty killer. Why they were able to put that much blood and other vivid pictures in a movie and still get it released with an R rating instead of NC-17 is beyond me.******************POSSIBLE SPOILER************* The ending with the little boy is way beyond disturbing to me. I think they stepped WAY over the line.Overall, the movie was ok. I wouldn't put it at the bottom of the list. However I definitely think that Silence of the Lambs was much better as far as scary. Hannibal didn't even get my heart racing, just my stomach reeling.</fullReview>

There is no way this great novel could be packed into a 2 hour movie... There was no character development (left out Verger bein a pedophile, Lecter's Mansion in his mind, etc.) AND GOD DAMMIT I LOVED THE ENDING OF THE BOOK! I would love to debate this with all you idiots out there who thought the ending of the book was ridiculous (probably most of which are women... and probably also hated American Psycho... another great novel!) Anyways I am rambling so... Ok movie, great novel... I give props to Moore for being a great Starling, but the best scenes with Hopkins were those flashbacks of him biting that nurse's face off and feeding Verger's face to the dogs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will certainly see Hannibal again and again, so overall I liked it. But I left the theater thinking: how sad that this will be the one movie to be made from Thomas Harris's book; wouldn't it have been nice if they could have brought in Jonathan Demme to tone down some of Ridley Scott's excesses. Of these, the worst for me was how unbearably loud the background music was at times(I am hoping, hoping, hoping this was an artefact courtesy of the theater I was in, and the next time I see it will be easier on the ears). I also would have preferred the slicked-back smarmy bureaucratic Paul Krendler of Silence of the Lambs to the arrogant frat-boy role nonetheless well-performed by Ray Liotta. Julianne Moore is superb as Clarice; the concern about not having Jodie Foster can be laid to rest, and an argument can be made that this vintage Clarice is a better role for Julianne than Jodie anyway.Now I'll issue a SPOILER ALERT - beep, beep, beep. The major alteration from the book is to do away with the evolution of the Clarice/Hannibal relationship into a romance, as Clarice transcends her sense of duty and Hannibal... well, I'm not sure exactly what Hannibal did - perhaps allow himself to feel, however NewAge that sounds - and replace it with a theme of unrequited love in the face of mutual respect. That Clarice's final act of duty is one-upped by Hannibal's self-sacrifice, or at least a piece of himself, is a very nice touch, beyond which it gets rid of that nasty xray problem!!! Well, I for one can't wait for the sequel. Goody-goody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As years have passed, I never had a whole lot of interest in a Silence of the Lambs sequel. Primarily, because I did not think it would happen, and I figured getting my hopes up would have been pointless. I loved the first one and was content with it. Of course, when I knew it was REALLY going to happen and much of the key talent was involved, I was enthusiastic. My heart sank when Jodie Foster dropped out, but I was THRILLED when the ONLY person I would have picked to replace her, the glorious Julianne Moore, was called in to fill her sizeable shoes. I was there opening day, and I didn't avert my eyes from the screen for the duration of the film. The only thing is, I came away feeling a bit puzzled. During a 2 hour period I found myself alternately engaged with suspense, laughing out loud, moved dramatically and even downright confused. Sometimes I experienced all of these feelings simultaniously. I came out feeling a bit confused, because I had just seen a movie that was as brilliantly directed and acted as they come and further elevated by gorgeous photography and a breathtaking music score. And for some reason I felt strangely unfulfilled. Maybe it was the VERY open endedness of the finale, or perhaps it was the overall lack of a cohesive plotline, I do not know. So was it a triumph? Yes and no. It was a bit of a disappointment, but only in the most secondary sense. It FELT like a link, more than decisive chapter. In other words, it felt, in the end, like a predecessor to a third chapter. To be honest, I hope there is one. Not because I am sequel hungry (I shiver at the thought of a "Hannibal Goes To Hell: The Final Silence aka Silence part 10" kind of thing), but I think there needs to be a resolution between Hannibal and Clarice. I almost wish the film had pursued the book's absurd ending-at least there was some closure there. We will see I guess. So all in all, although it doesn't quite live up to it's legendary predecessor, it is safe to say "Hannibal" is a great piece of cinema that will stand as a better film than most of 2001's releases.</fullReview>

Sir Anthony Hopkins is absolutely brilliant again as Hannibal the Cannibal and is the whole movie here. His presence alone makes this movie *** stars already and this time he is very funny and scary at the same time! The scenes in Italy are breathtaking and a feast for the eyes as is the performance of Hopkins. The film is very gory intentionally but is directed magnificently by Ridley Scott. His camera angles and the lighting he used in the gory scenes are a step above any other director out there but maybe Steven Spielberg being the only one who can top him. In conclusion, one must see this movie it is a gem that will eat your heart out! **** stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hannibal" is a great movie that will haunt you when you leave the auditorium. This sequel, or I should say the next chapter Of The Hannibal Lector storyline,it follows you ten years later where Dr. Lecter is still in elusive in Europe under another identity and FBI agent Clarice Starling is still on her job reciving no respect from her colleagues. They suddenly reunite unexpectedly and the fun begins. "Hannibal" will captivate you and will take you on a ride. All you have to do is let yourself go into the world of "Hannibal". Even though the Thomas Harris bestseller was a little different from this, it brings the best cinematic achivement it can,just when you think they can't do it they did. Steven Zaillian and David Mamet have written the best adaptation of this story. Ridley Scott was the best and only director that knew that this was a new movie not another sequel, this movie had a life of its own and we weren't looking for Bufallo Bill this time we get into the real star, Hannibal Lector. Anthony Hopkins will recive another Oscar for playing the Smooth and Devious Cannibal Dr. Hannibal Lector. He played that character with new style and not the same old . You have to remember, people do change in 10 years. Julianne Moore is a knock out as Clarice Starling and will get a award for portraying Clarice. She brings smart-savy characteristics to this character. She is believeable and it's now her role. Jodie Foster was great as Clarice in the original but when she declined, another one had to be chosen. Julianne was chosen and she fits the character, not Jodie's take of Clarice, her own take. She is better than Jodie and should not be treated as "She is not Jodie Foster." She is her own self and she takes Clarice a different way than Ms. Foster did. Ray Liotta and Gary Oldman give outstanding perfomances. It has a excellent acting ensemble ,excellent script, crew, and director. "Hannibal" is a must see!!!Remember the book was different, it always is, but the interpretation into this motion picture was dynamic, you have your own mind and go and see it. Don't take Ebert/Roeper's review or anybody who slanders it, others do it intentionally to make the box office numbers suffer and the hard work of this picture become underrated because they were busy analyzing instead of enjoying. Support it and see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible direction from Ridley Scott</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole movie feels misdirected by Ridley Scott. Personally, I am a fan of most of Scott's films, but I really feel like he dropped the ball on this one. All of the suspense, terror, and intrigue are drained from Hannibal's predecessor to create a film that is just lifeless. How can a movie with so much violence be so utterly boring? How can said violence leave so little impact upon the viewer. This movie will be immediately forgotten by most. I can't help but think that a much better movie could have been made with a different director at the helm. Hannibal would have benefited from the use of some restraint, some subtlety to increase the tension. How can a film like Silence, in which the characters and their interesting relationships are explored against a ghastly backdrop, be followed up with a film that literally has no interesting or profound character interaction. It was filled with the standard cliched detective dialogue that just moves the story along (slowly I might add) to the unsatisfying now-famous ending. For instance, the scene where Mason Verger's disfigurement takes place could have been replaced by a simple monologue from Verger to Starling that would have been a treat for the actors and audiences alike. Instead of being feed a scene that could have been directed by any Hollywood hack, a simple dialogue scene could have been far more haunting and effective. Hannibal the movie is perhaps one of the worst novel to screen adaptations I have ever witnessed (Battlefield Earth withstanding). This movie lacks passion, originality, and most importantly energy. I was happy the movie was over so I could go home and watch Silence again. Even after 10 viewings, I still can get goosebumps. How could Ridley Scott fall so far! (3 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie greatly increased my respect for Jodie Foster, and correspondingly diminished that which I had felt for Sir Anthony Hopkins. Like "Multiple-Miggs," Hannibal's ill-mannered and doomed neighbor in the exquisite "Silence of the Lambs," "Hannibal" splatters the viewer with sights both unpleasant and pointless.I do not take issue with the goriness of this movie per se, but rather with the confused and pointless story, of which the largely-laughable scenes of bloodshed are only a small part. Although I did not read "Hannibal," I have heard that the movie follows the book relatively faithfully, until the final minutes. If this is so, Thomas Harris should bear the brunt of the criticism, as it is hard to envision how any director, writer, or set of actors could elevate such an ill-conceived set of words and ideas above camp and self-parody. Thus, I should add "Silence"-director Jonathan Demme, who wisely declined to bring "Hannibal" to the screen, to Jodie Foster, in listing the people who have enhanced their credibility by just saying "No" to bad movies.The Hannibal Lector of the 1991 movie, conscienceless predator that he was, was nonetheless a paragon of cultured refinement and restraint. His inexplicable desire to consume human flesh, coupled with his fine-tuned aesthetic sensibilities and his unnerving intuitive abilities, all came together in Hopkins' deservedly-Oscar-winning 1991 performance to create a seductive and unforgettable monster. He was an irreducibly evil force of nature, as disturbingly majestic as he was morally repugnant. Ten years later, the moral repugnance remains, but the majesty has drained away, leaving little more than a blueblood Freddy Kruger. While Hopkins does a perfectly respectable job with the execrable material, it is a blasphemy against the gods of Cinema to bring this inferior Lector to the big screen. Though it could be argued that it would have taken a "Saint" Hopkins, never mind a "Sir," to pass up the retirement windfall his "Hannibal" paycheck will no doubt provide, I shed a tear for the premature passing of my favorite movie villain of all time, done in not by the FBI, Clarice Starling, or Mason Verger, but by poor writing and the triumph of greed over taste.The Hannibal I knew and loved would have killed and eaten this movie, (after extensive seasonings to cover the unpleasant flavors,) then rested secure in the knowledge that he had prevented something nasty and ill-tasting from being rudely flung into our faces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why criticize the movie if it is really an adaptation of the book? It is impossible to include in a 2 hour movie all the little insights a book can give such as Leccter's sister, or Margoth or Ordelia. As for all the "infamous" or "slasher movie" scenes people are complaining so much..well...they come straight out of the book, which, in turn, was definitely not as good as "Silence of the Lambs". Anybody who read the book knew that the movie had to be gory becasue the book contains intenmsely gory moments. The movie, directors and actors should be judged based on whether it accomplished to conveythe feelings the writer tried to convey in his book...and I think it did...even with the final 10 minutes, which, in the book were a lot less rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal's back, eat your heart out!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I sat in the theatre waiting for the film to start, I wasn't sure what to expect. As the movie played through, I wasn't sure what to expect! The film definitely had that old Hannibal feeling to it. Although I've heard some people say the brain part was cheesy, I thought it was perfect. The musical score was amazing, Hans Zimmer and Ridely Scot work Brilliantly together. (as they did in Gladiator) I thought I would really miss Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, but Julianne Moore held more than her own in her dynamic performance. The roll suited her well, and I don't think Jodie could've filled out that gorgeous black dress! All in all, Hannibal is not for the weak stomached, but a masterpiece in itself all the same. Also, I just recently heard that this is a TRILOGY!!!! I just went out and bought the film set BEFORE silence of the lambs. It's called Manhunter, I'm just about to sit down and watch it, and it's getting dark out...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, the movie was alright... But for those who LOVED the ending of the book, like I did... This ruined the movie for me. There is no way this great novel could be packed into a 2 hour movie... There was no character development (left out Verger bein a pedophile, Lecter's Mansion in his mind, etc.) AND GOD DAMMIT I LOVED THE ENDING OF THE BOOK! I would love to debate this with all you idiots out there who thought the ending of the book was ridiculous (probably most of which are women... and probably also hated American Psycho... another great novel!) Anyways I am rambling so... Ok movie, great novel... I give props to Moore for being a great Starling, but the best scenes with Hopkins were those flashbacks of him biting that nurse's face off and feeding Verger's face to the dogs!</fullReview>

One scene in particular (the opera scene, for those of you that have seen it) was painfully creepy and lush. Love the dialogue between these 2 characters. SOTL ( an extremely impressive movie) was for frat parties, and Hannibal is for cultured adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will certainly see Hannibal again and again, so overall I liked it. But I left the theater thinking: how sad that this will be the one movie to be made from Thomas Harris's book; wouldn't it have been nice if they could have brought in Jonathan Demme to tone down some of Ridley Scott's excesses. Of these, the worst for me was how unbearably loud the background music was at times(I am hoping, hoping, hoping this was an artefact courtesy of the theater I was in, and the next time I see it will be easier on the ears). I also would have preferred the slicked-back smarmy bureaucratic Paul Krendler of Silence of the Lambs to the arrogant frat-boy role nonetheless well-performed by Ray Liotta. Julianne Moore is superb as Clarice; the concern about not having Jodie Foster can be laid to rest, and an argument can be made that this vintage Clarice is a better role for Julianne than Jodie anyway.Now I'll issue a SPOILER ALERT - beep, beep, beep. The major alteration from the book is to do away with the evolution of the Clarice/Hannibal relationship into a romance, as Clarice transcends her sense of duty and Hannibal... well, I'm not sure exactly what Hannibal did - perhaps allow himself to feel, however NewAge that sounds - and replace it with a theme of unrequited love in the face of mutual respect. That Clarice's final act of duty is one-upped by Hannibal's self-sacrifice, or at least a piece of himself, is a very nice touch, beyond which it gets rid of that nasty xray problem!!! Well, I for one can't wait for the sequel. Goody-goody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As years have passed, I never had a whole lot of interest in a Silence of the Lambs sequel. Primarily, because I did not think it would happen, and I figured getting my hopes up would have been pointless. I loved the first one and was content with it. Of course, when I knew it was REALLY going to happen and much of the key talent was involved, I was enthusiastic. My heart sank when Jodie Foster dropped out, but I was THRILLED when the ONLY person I would have picked to replace her, the glorious Julianne Moore, was called in to fill her sizeable shoes. I was there opening day, and I didn't avert my eyes from the screen for the duration of the film. The only thing is, I came away feeling a bit puzzled. During a 2 hour period I found myself alternately engaged with suspense, laughing out loud, moved dramatically and even downright confused. Sometimes I experienced all of these feelings simultaniously. I came out feeling a bit confused, because I had just seen a movie that was as brilliantly directed and acted as they come and further elevated by gorgeous photography and a breathtaking music score. And for some reason I felt strangely unfulfilled. Maybe it was the VERY open endedness of the finale, or perhaps it was the overall lack of a cohesive plotline, I do not know. So was it a triumph? Yes and no. It was a bit of a disappointment, but only in the most secondary sense. It FELT like a link, more than decisive chapter. In other words, it felt, in the end, like a predecessor to a third chapter. To be honest, I hope there is one. Not because I am sequel hungry (I shiver at the thought of a "Hannibal Goes To Hell: The Final Silence aka Silence part 10" kind of thing), but I think there needs to be a resolution between Hannibal and Clarice. I almost wish the film had pursued the book's absurd ending-at least there was some closure there. We will see I guess. So all in all, although it doesn't quite live up to it's legendary predecessor, it is safe to say "Hannibal" is a great piece of cinema that will stand as a better film than most of 2001's releases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal is back after a ten year hiatus and better than ever! This is one of the best sequels I have ever seen. The Silence of the Lambs was superb and this sequel is its match. Sir Anthony Hopkins is absolutely brilliant again as Hannibal the Cannibal and is the whole movie here. His presence alone makes this movie *** stars already and this time he is very funny and scary at the same time! The scenes in Italy are breathtaking and a feast for the eyes as is the performance of Hopkins. The film is very gory intentionally but is directed magnificently by Ridley Scott. His camera angles and the lighting he used in the gory scenes are a step above any other director out there but maybe Steven Spielberg being the only one who can top him. In conclusion, one must see this movie it is a gem that will eat your heart out! **** stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hannibal" is a great movie that will haunt you when you leave the auditorium. This sequel, or I should say the next chapter Of The Hannibal Lector storyline,it follows you ten years later where Dr. Lecter is still in elusive in Europe under another identity and FBI agent Clarice Starling is still on her job reciving no respect from her colleagues. They suddenly reunite unexpectedly and the fun begins. "Hannibal" will captivate you and will take you on a ride. All you have to do is let yourself go into the world of "Hannibal". Even though the Thomas Harris bestseller was a little different from this, it brings the best cinematic achivement it can,just when you think they can't do it they did. Steven Zaillian and David Mamet have written the best adaptation of this story. Ridley Scott was the best and only director that knew that this was a new movie not another sequel, this movie had a life of its own and we weren't looking for Bufallo Bill this time we get into the real star, Hannibal Lector. Anthony Hopkins will recive another Oscar for playing the Smooth and Devious Cannibal Dr. Hannibal Lector. He played that character with new style and not the same old . You have to remember, people do change in 10 years. Julianne Moore is a knock out as Clarice Starling and will get a award for portraying Clarice. She brings smart-savy characteristics to this character. She is believeable and it's now her role. Jodie Foster was great as Clarice in the original but when she declined, another one had to be chosen. Julianne was chosen and she fits the character, not Jodie's take of Clarice, her own take. She is better than Jodie and should not be treated as "She is not Jodie Foster." She is her own self and she takes Clarice a different way than Ms. Foster did. Ray Liotta and Gary Oldman give outstanding perfomances. It has a excellent acting ensemble ,excellent script, crew, and director. "Hannibal" is a must see!!!Remember the book was different, it always is, but the interpretation into this motion picture was dynamic, you have your own mind and go and see it. Don't take Ebert/Roeper's review or anybody who slanders it, others do it intentionally to make the box office numbers suffer and the hard work of this picture become underrated because they were busy analyzing instead of enjoying. Support it and see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible direction from Ridley Scott</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole movie feels misdirected by Ridley Scott. Personally, I am a fan of most of Scott's films, but I really feel like he dropped the ball on this one. All of the suspense, terror, and intrigue are drained from Hannibal's predecessor to create a film that is just lifeless. How can a movie with so much violence be so utterly boring? How can said violence leave so little impact upon the viewer. This movie will be immediately forgotten by most. I can't help but think that a much better movie could have been made with a different director at the helm. Hannibal would have benefited from the use of some restraint, some subtlety to increase the tension. How can a film like Silence, in which the characters and their interesting relationships are explored against a ghastly backdrop, be followed up with a film that literally has no interesting or profound character interaction. It was filled with the standard cliched detective dialogue that just moves the story along (slowly I might add) to the unsatisfying now-famous ending. For instance, the scene where Mason Verger's disfigurement takes place could have been replaced by a simple monologue from Verger to Starling that would have been a treat for the actors and audiences alike. Instead of being feed a scene that could have been directed by any Hollywood hack, a simple dialogue scene could have been far more haunting and effective. Hannibal the movie is perhaps one of the worst novel to screen adaptations I have ever witnessed (Battlefield Earth withstanding). This movie lacks passion, originality, and most importantly energy. I was happy the movie was over so I could go home and watch Silence again. Even after 10 viewings, I still can get goosebumps. How could Ridley Scott fall so far! (3 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie greatly increased my respect for Jodie Foster, and correspondingly diminished that which I had felt for Sir Anthony Hopkins. Like "Multiple-Miggs," Hannibal's ill-mannered and doomed neighbor in the exquisite "Silence of the Lambs," "Hannibal" splatters the viewer with sights both unpleasant and pointless.I do not take issue with the goriness of this movie per se, but rather with the confused and pointless story, of which the largely-laughable scenes of bloodshed are only a small part. Although I did not read "Hannibal," I have heard that the movie follows the book relatively faithfully, until the final minutes. If this is so, Thomas Harris should bear the brunt of the criticism, as it is hard to envision how any director, writer, or set of actors could elevate such an ill-conceived set of words and ideas above camp and self-parody. Thus, I should add "Silence"-director Jonathan Demme, who wisely declined to bring "Hannibal" to the screen, to Jodie Foster, in listing the people who have enhanced their credibility by just saying "No" to bad movies.The Hannibal Lector of the 1991 movie, conscienceless predator that he was, was nonetheless a paragon of cultured refinement and restraint. His inexplicable desire to consume human flesh, coupled with his fine-tuned aesthetic sensibilities and his unnerving intuitive abilities, all came together in Hopkins' deservedly-Oscar-winning 1991 performance to create a seductive and unforgettable monster. He was an irreducibly evil force of nature, as disturbingly majestic as he was morally repugnant. Ten years later, the moral repugnance remains, but the majesty has drained away, leaving little more than a blueblood Freddy Kruger. While Hopkins does a perfectly respectable job with the execrable material, it is a blasphemy against the gods of Cinema to bring this inferior Lector to the big screen. Though it could be argued that it would have taken a "Saint" Hopkins, never mind a "Sir," to pass up the retirement windfall his "Hannibal" paycheck will no doubt provide, I shed a tear for the premature passing of my favorite movie villain of all time, done in not by the FBI, Clarice Starling, or Mason Verger, but by poor writing and the triumph of greed over taste.The Hannibal I knew and loved would have killed and eaten this movie, (after extensive seasonings to cover the unpleasant flavors,) then rested secure in the knowledge that he had prevented something nasty and ill-tasting from being rudely flung into our faces.</fullReview>

It is impossible to include in a 2 hour movie all the little insights a book can give such as Leccter's sister, or Margoth or Ordelia. As for all the "infamous" or "slasher movie" scenes people are complaining so much..well...they come straight out of the book, which, in turn, was definitely not as good as "Silence of the Lambs". Anybody who read the book knew that the movie had to be gory becasue the book contains intenmsely gory moments. The movie, directors and actors should be judged based on whether it accomplished to conveythe feelings the writer tried to convey in his book...and I think it did...even with the final 10 minutes, which, in the book were a lot less rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal's back, eat your heart out!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I sat in the theatre waiting for the film to start, I wasn't sure what to expect. As the movie played through, I wasn't sure what to expect! The film definitely had that old Hannibal feeling to it. Although I've heard some people say the brain part was cheesy, I thought it was perfect. The musical score was amazing, Hans Zimmer and Ridely Scot work Brilliantly together. (as they did in Gladiator) I thought I would really miss Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, but Julianne Moore held more than her own in her dynamic performance. The roll suited her well, and I don't think Jodie could've filled out that gorgeous black dress! All in all, Hannibal is not for the weak stomached, but a masterpiece in itself all the same. Also, I just recently heard that this is a TRILOGY!!!! I just went out and bought the film set BEFORE silence of the lambs. It's called Manhunter, I'm just about to sit down and watch it, and it's getting dark out...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, the movie was alright... But for those who LOVED the ending of the book, like I did... This ruined the movie for me. There is no way this great novel could be packed into a 2 hour movie... There was no character development (left out Verger bein a pedophile, Lecter's Mansion in his mind, etc.) AND GOD DAMMIT I LOVED THE ENDING OF THE BOOK! I would love to debate this with all you idiots out there who thought the ending of the book was ridiculous (probably most of which are women... and probably also hated American Psycho... another great novel!) Anyways I am rambling so... Ok movie, great novel... I give props to Moore for being a great Starling, but the best scenes with Hopkins were those flashbacks of him biting that nurse's face off and feeding Verger's face to the dogs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will certainly see Hannibal again and again, so overall I liked it. But I left the theater thinking: how sad that this will be the one movie to be made from Thomas Harris's book; wouldn't it have been nice if they could have brought in Jonathan Demme to tone down some of Ridley Scott's excesses. Of these, the worst for me was how unbearably loud the background music was at times(I am hoping, hoping, hoping this was an artefact courtesy of the theater I was in, and the next time I see it will be easier on the ears). I also would have preferred the slicked-back smarmy bureaucratic Paul Krendler of Silence of the Lambs to the arrogant frat-boy role nonetheless well-performed by Ray Liotta. Julianne Moore is superb as Clarice; the concern about not having Jodie Foster can be laid to rest, and an argument can be made that this vintage Clarice is a better role for Julianne than Jodie anyway.Now I'll issue a SPOILER ALERT - beep, beep, beep. The major alteration from the book is to do away with the evolution of the Clarice/Hannibal relationship into a romance, as Clarice transcends her sense of duty and Hannibal... well, I'm not sure exactly what Hannibal did - perhaps allow himself to feel, however NewAge that sounds - and replace it with a theme of unrequited love in the face of mutual respect. That Clarice's final act of duty is one-upped by Hannibal's self-sacrifice, or at least a piece of himself, is a very nice touch, beyond which it gets rid of that nasty xray problem!!! Well, I for one can't wait for the sequel. Goody-goody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best not very good films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As years have passed, I never had a whole lot of interest in a Silence of the Lambs sequel. Primarily, because I did not think it would happen, and I figured getting my hopes up would have been pointless. I loved the first one and was content with it. Of course, when I knew it was REALLY going to happen and much of the key talent was involved, I was enthusiastic. My heart sank when Jodie Foster dropped out, but I was THRILLED when the ONLY person I would have picked to replace her, the glorious Julianne Moore, was called in to fill her sizeable shoes. I was there opening day, and I didn't avert my eyes from the screen for the duration of the film. The only thing is, I came away feeling a bit puzzled. During a 2 hour period I found myself alternately engaged with suspense, laughing out loud, moved dramatically and even downright confused. Sometimes I experienced all of these feelings simultaniously. I came out feeling a bit confused, because I had just seen a movie that was as brilliantly directed and acted as they come and further elevated by gorgeous photography and a breathtaking music score. And for some reason I felt strangely unfulfilled. Maybe it was the VERY open endedness of the finale, or perhaps it was the overall lack of a cohesive plotline, I do not know. So was it a triumph? Yes and no. It was a bit of a disappointment, but only in the most secondary sense. It FELT like a link, more than decisive chapter. In other words, it felt, in the end, like a predecessor to a third chapter. To be honest, I hope there is one. Not because I am sequel hungry (I shiver at the thought of a "Hannibal Goes To Hell: The Final Silence aka Silence part 10" kind of thing), but I think there needs to be a resolution between Hannibal and Clarice. I almost wish the film had pursued the book's absurd ending-at least there was some closure there. We will see I guess. So all in all, although it doesn't quite live up to it's legendary predecessor, it is safe to say "Hannibal" is a great piece of cinema that will stand as a better film than most of 2001's releases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal is back after a ten year hiatus and better than ever! This is one of the best sequels I have ever seen. The Silence of the Lambs was superb and this sequel is its match. Sir Anthony Hopkins is absolutely brilliant again as Hannibal the Cannibal and is the whole movie here. His presence alone makes this movie *** stars already and this time he is very funny and scary at the same time! The scenes in Italy are breathtaking and a feast for the eyes as is the performance of Hopkins. The film is very gory intentionally but is directed magnificently by Ridley Scott. His camera angles and the lighting he used in the gory scenes are a step above any other director out there but maybe Steven Spielberg being the only one who can top him. In conclusion, one must see this movie it is a gem that will eat your heart out! **** stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible direction from Ridley Scott</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole movie feels misdirected by Ridley Scott. Personally, I am a fan of most of Scott's films, but I really feel like he dropped the ball on this one. All of the suspense, terror, and intrigue are drained from Hannibal's predecessor to create a film that is just lifeless. How can a movie with so much violence be so utterly boring? How can said violence leave so little impact upon the viewer. This movie will be immediately forgotten by most. I can't help but think that a much better movie could have been made with a different director at the helm. Hannibal would have benefited from the use of some restraint, some subtlety to increase the tension. How can a film like Silence, in which the characters and their interesting relationships are explored against a ghastly backdrop, be followed up with a film that literally has no interesting or profound character interaction. It was filled with the standard cliched detective dialogue that just moves the story along (slowly I might add) to the unsatisfying now-famous ending. For instance, the scene where Mason Verger's disfigurement takes place could have been replaced by a simple monologue from Verger to Starling that would have been a treat for the actors and audiences alike. Instead of being feed a scene that could have been directed by any Hollywood hack, a simple dialogue scene could have been far more haunting and effective. Hannibal the movie is perhaps one of the worst novel to screen adaptations I have ever witnessed (Battlefield Earth withstanding). This movie lacks passion, originality, and most importantly energy. I was happy the movie was over so I could go home and watch Silence again. Even after 10 viewings, I still can get goosebumps. How could Ridley Scott fall so far! (3 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Messy fast food where there was once a cinematic feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie greatly increased my respect for Jodie Foster, and correspondingly diminished that which I had felt for Sir Anthony Hopkins. Like "Multiple-Miggs," Hannibal's ill-mannered and doomed neighbor in the exquisite "Silence of the Lambs," "Hannibal" splatters the viewer with sights both unpleasant and pointless.I do not take issue with the goriness of this movie per se, but rather with the confused and pointless story, of which the largely-laughable scenes of bloodshed are only a small part. Although I did not read "Hannibal," I have heard that the movie follows the book relatively faithfully, until the final minutes. If this is so, Thomas Harris should bear the brunt of the criticism, as it is hard to envision how any director, writer, or set of actors could elevate such an ill-conceived set of words and ideas above camp and self-parody. Thus, I should add "Silence"-director Jonathan Demme, who wisely declined to bring "Hannibal" to the screen, to Jodie Foster, in listing the people who have enhanced their credibility by just saying "No" to bad movies.The Hannibal Lector of the 1991 movie, conscienceless predator that he was, was nonetheless a paragon of cultured refinement and restraint. His inexplicable desire to consume human flesh, coupled with his fine-tuned aesthetic sensibilities and his unnerving intuitive abilities, all came together in Hopkins' deservedly-Oscar-winning 1991 performance to create a seductive and unforgettable monster. He was an irreducibly evil force of nature, as disturbingly majestic as he was morally repugnant. Ten years later, the moral repugnance remains, but the majesty has drained away, leaving little more than a blueblood Freddy Kruger. While Hopkins does a perfectly respectable job with the execrable material, it is a blasphemy against the gods of Cinema to bring this inferior Lector to the big screen. Though it could be argued that it would have taken a "Saint" Hopkins, never mind a "Sir," to pass up the retirement windfall his "Hannibal" paycheck will no doubt provide, I shed a tear for the premature passing of my favorite movie villain of all time, done in not by the FBI, Clarice Starling, or Mason Verger, but by poor writing and the triumph of greed over taste.The Hannibal I knew and loved would have killed and eaten this movie, (after extensive seasonings to cover the unpleasant flavors,) then rested secure in the knowledge that he had prevented something nasty and ill-tasting from being rudely flung into our faces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of viewing Hannibal on Sunday afternoon, February 11, at a matinee performance. I must say that I was very impressed. Firstly because the actors really carried it off. It is such a dark subject but Agent Starling did not for one minute lose her credibility as an FBI agent and her decisions were based on good ethical and moral insight. We got to know more about Hannibal and what motivated him to a point. Even though he was such an evil man he had the ability to seduce you into wanting him to get away. The Director was brilliant. He did not for one moment dwell on the blood and gore. There was a reason for everything that happened. I for one enjoyed this film more than the first because not one person was innocently killed. There were so many parallels and twists to the plot that seemed to justify. As gruesome as it all was it seemed that in the end it was justified. God forbid. This film is definitely a keeper! As dark as it was and there were points in the movie that I had to cover my eyes it was good entertainment!</fullReview>

What they didn't tell you was how Hannibal always seemed to be free. Why is he so uncatchable? And why would Clarice try so hard to protect Hannibal? He is DANGEROUS. This movie did have some good moments, but the ending disappointed me. All this movie wanted to accomplish was to try to gross out the audience. I laughed during some of the gross parts. It's a movie where you either laugh at the gross parts or just turn your head. I don't know why but it is.

		<fullReview>It is very hard to grade a sequel based on expectations from the original movie. What makes grading this film so difficult was that it's predecessor, The Silence of the Lambs was not only a fan favorite, but also deservingly received the five highest Oscars (best picture, actor, actress, director and screenplay) at that year's Academy Awards. Being a fan of Lambs myself, I have been eagerly awaiting this film since the Thomas Harris novel came out two years ago. The book was not as good as Lambs, but was still intriguing and I was interested in how some of the images would be transferred to the screen.Ridley Scott has been a favorite director of mine for a long time. He is one of the few directors who can make a great movie where anyone else with the materials he has to work with would fail. If you don't believe me, re-rent Bladerunner, Legend and Alien and name anyone else could have made better movies with those materials. In Hannibal, he succeeds again.barely. The Florence scenes are terrific and the movie flows with ease. Scott's major folly may be the one he shares with George Lucas: he relies too heavily on the cinematic shot and does not develop the characters deep enough to give them the justice they deserve.I was suspect of Julianne Moore from her hiring to play FBI agent Clarice Starling, and her performance did little to make me a believer. She did a decent job retrieving Jodie Foster's accent from Lambs, but clearly in both physique and emotion, there was little left from Foster's rendering of Starling. Gary Oldman's portrayal of Mason Verger was closer to the book than I imagined Hollywood could get. Key sub plots about his character were left out from the book however, that made him less evil and more pathetic than he should have been. Ray Liotta and Giancarlo Giannini were both fine in their roles from the book as well. One disappointing character left out of this film from the book and the last movie was Scott Glenn's Jack Crawford. Crawford has been a staple in all of the Hannibal books and his character, while lesser than even in Lambs, was still needed.And Sir Anthony Hopkins.He reprises a role that has defined him as an actor, which is perhaps even tougher to play altogether. Jodie Foster turned down her role in this film publicly because she disliked the script, but possibly also because it was an encore of a role that she won an Oscar for ten years earlier. Why even try to top your best and risk marring it? Hopkins however, delivers his best. Ten years was nothing but a dramatic pause, as he has lost nothing in his interpretation of Hannibal Lecter. At times, he his laughing at the absurdity of the role through his portrayal.but isn't that what Lecter would do anyway? Sadly, I cannot see him winning a second Oscar for the same role, but he deserves nothing but respect for one of the most powerful characters in decades.David Mamet has always churned out great scripts for the theatre; however, adapting books to screen has never been one of his strong points in my opinion. His writing team does a great job of transposing the storyline from the novel, but as is always the case when condensing 600+ pages of single spaced text into a two-hour movie, a lot of the sub plots are lost. This in turn leads to character development that lacks the true nature of the story. Part of the beauty of Lambs were Lecter and Starling's psychological battles, showing Lecter's compassionate father figure beneath the madman and Starling's insecurities beneath the by-the-book, stone faced FBI agent. All of this is lost in the translation of Hannibal the book into Hannibal the movie.and is the true reason why the book ending would not have worked in the film.As for the gore in this movie that has been regularly criticized by both reviewers and fans alike: (SLIGHT SPOILER) a) I think American culture has been desensitized by the violence and horrid imagery thanks mostly to movies like The Silence of the Lambs. The first movie involved among other things: cannibalism, an autopsy of a bloated body dragged from a river with skin removed, the throwing of ejaculate from an asylum inmate into an FBI agent's hair, a decapitated head floating in a jar inside a hearse, broken, bloody fingernails along the wall of an abduction pit, whatever that mush was in the bathtub near the end of the movie, and Lecter's escape by removing the face of a security officer and wearing it as his own. While today we may consider disembowelment and exposed brains repulsive, in 1990 these scenes from Lambs may have been considered gory and lewd material. I guess it's all a matter of perspective.b) One of Thomas Harris' strongest attributes in creating the Hannibal stories has been his ability to give gruesome visions with elegance and eloquence. "A census taker once tried to test me.I ate his liver, with some fava beans and a nice chianti." One of the most memorable lines from Lambs, and in its essence is the character of Hannibal Lecter.a madman, yet a tasteful madman. Some of the elegance that was found in the book is lost in the film, however I applaud Hollywood for not insulting the graceful gore of the book and at least attempting to capture it.In all, I was pleasantly surprised at the finished product that this film has become. I strongly recommend it for those who enjoyed the book and the other movies in the trilogy. Don't expect another Silence of the Lambs, instead go rent Manhunter and realize how far the series has evolved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*********SPOILERS, though I've tried to be vague**************I went into this movie ready for a cheat regarding the violence. What I got was all the violence portrayed in vivid detail, but the back story and character motivations were glossed over or left out completely. I think I would have enjoyed the movie more if I hadn't read the book.Surprisingly, it wasn't the absence of Jodi Foster that bothered me most, though when Clarice plays back taped excerpts from her talks with Dr. Lecter 10 years before, I was mystifyingly irked that they had dubbed in Julianne Moore's voice. I don't know what I thought they would do, but it just seemed to take something away from Foster, and I don't think she deserved that. I could see Foster in this role, I could not see Moore in the first movie. I don't think she could pull off that scene where Clarice is crawling through the dark and we see her only in the night vision goggles of Jame Gumb.Another problem with this type of story is that there is no mystery. We know who all the bad guys are. It was missing that feeling of building toward something.2 main characters, which provide motivation, are completely missing. Both are sisters, one Mason's and one Hannibal's. I think in order to successfully make Dr. Lecter a sympathetic character, and conversely to make Mason a more effective bad guy, you'd have to keep them in.Finally, the final scene is just not believable in the context of this movie. Given the building of their relationship in the book, I could maybe buy Lecter's self sacrifice, but not in the movie. It's just not believable.It's not the worst movie I've seen, but I was disappointed. If you can go in with an open mind you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal is a masterful synthesis of Red Dragon (Manhunter) and Silence of the Lambs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several details from the film Hannibal correlate to parts of Harris' previous two books (and movies) concerning Hannibal Lecter, M.D. The various pictures related to Hannibal on the wall in the FBI basement where Clarice culled past evidence for clues included a rather grotesque image of a man with several wounds as one might incur from wartime weapons. This "war-wounds man" is the secret to how Hannibal was actually caught and arrested in Red Dragon, relayed by the FBI Agent who apprehended him, Phil Graham. Graham, on a routine investigation of persons associated with a murdered college girl visited Dr. Lecter, the girl's psychiatrist. In Lecter's office hung an illustration of war wounds that triggered in Graham's mind memories of a previous unresolved murder case, in which the victim had incurred several of the war-wounds depicted on Lecter's illustration. As Graham made the mental connection, so did Hannibal. And before Graham could do much about it, Hannibal 'chloroformed' him, as he did to Krendler, and Pazzi in Hannibal. A disappointing omission from the film Hannibal is a story from Lecter's youth that provides psychological clues to his reasons for cannibalism and serial killing, etc. Therefore, I highly suggest to anyone who is captivated by the unique 'charm' of Hannibal to read Harris' book of the same name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent performances barely save troubled "Hannibal"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hannibal" is probably the most anticipated sequel since "The Phantom Menace"; like the latter, all that build-up can do nothing to prevent some disappointment. Director Ridley Scott has cast a film of his own vein--rich, operatic, laced with dark humor, and baring little resemblance to the eye of Jonathan Demme, director of the first film. That fact alone squelches most notions of comparison, and encourages the viewer to just sit back and enjoy the current rants and rampages of Dr. Hannibal Lector (played brililantly by Hopkins as older, more subdued, but never less threatening).As for the bally-hoo surrounding Julianne Moore's replacement of Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling, I did not have trouble with her in the role. This has less to do with her performance (which is fine), however, and more to do with her undeveloped character. Like Lecter, Clarice has become older and wiser, but also more cynical. Moore tries her best to fit Foster's mold while aging the character in this natural direction, but she's given little chance. A clear mistake in the film is Starling's lack of presence, especially compared to the good doctor. This problem is inherited from Harris's novel. This mistake can be somewhat forgiven; adaptation must have been troublesome if even fantastic screenwriters such as Stephen Zaillian and David Mamet couldn't pull it off. However, if they had the guts to change the ending (a noticeable improvement over the novel), why not work to develop Starling's character more fully?Less forgiving, however, is a certain lack of energy that casts a pall over proceedings. The scenes shot in Florence (where a local cop, wonderfully played by Giancarlo Giannini, tries to capture Lector) are remarkable in design, construction, and pacing. Outside Florence, the action tends to get muddled in religious ramblings, FBI casework, and a unique style of hog farming.Also problematic is the character played by Ray Liotta, an FBI agent and former lover to Clarice Starling who tries to make work very hard for her. He's synonymous with the Anthony Heald character of the first film. Instead of being ambitious, however, Liotta simply plays a jerk, so slimy that his fate is pretty obvious. Liotta has (and could have) done better, but here again is a lack of character development.When things are all said and done, however, it's Hopkins' dynamic performance that deserves most of the attention (a debatable second: Giannini's Italian cop). He refills Lector's shoes with graceful ease; one could say his performance in last year's "Titus" prepared him nicely. Although a certain aspect of his character is underplayed (which I will leave you to discover), he shows a natural aging of Hannibal that is most pleasing. You might not be able to teach an old dog new tricks, but who cares when those tricks are so perfectly honed.Rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one redeeming feature I found in this movie was the sterling effort made by the talented Julianne Moore to stake a claim to the character of Clarice Starling in the face of a distinctly unhelpful script. Unfortunately, it became a losing battle. Sir Anthony Hopkins gave us a good, but not great, Dr. Lecter, and the rest of the characters ran the gamut from plastic to laughable. I could see no evidence of significant development in any of the major characters. There was little if any of the original movie's cleverness, sinister tone, suspense, or even of the way it reveled in evil. This movie stumbled along, at times through the requisite buckets of gore and horrified expressions, to an almost comic and certainly unbelievable ending. In the face of such acting talents as Hopkins, Moore, Ray Liotta, and Giancarlo Giannini, this was a mighty disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you thought "Seven" was brilliant, you'll love this. I don't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "Seven", this is essentially a gore film/freak show masquerading as art. Many people will fall for the artistic pretension, and declare it brilliant, while many others will see it for the sadly plotless, character-free slasher film that it is. What's most disturbing is that the feeling we got from "Silence Of The Lambs" is nowhere to be seen; that feeling that we were rooting for Lecter almost against our wills. Here was clearly an evil human being, whom we nevertheless wanted to see get away...it was subversive in its way. There is none of that here. The people who die at Lecter's hands are despicable, and therefore "deserve to die". And by the time the character is put in jeopardy (in a very silly, pulp-novel manner by a character who is more evil and twisted than he is), it becomes clear that the subversive creepiness of the first film has been thrown out and replaced with standard horror-film boo-hiss villainy. I have nothing against cheap horror, but in making a sequel to one of the most effective examples of horror as art, they beg the comparison. "Hannibal" doesn't stand up. Considering the talent involved here, this movie had no business not being a brilliant follow-up. What's most shocking is that a screenplay by no less than the team of David Mamet and Steven Zaillian can be so free of cleverness, imagination or meaning. A massively disappointing sequel from a lot of people who should have known better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I NEVER want to see this movie again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, I love horror movies. I read Stephen King like there's no tomorrow. I loved the Exorcist and Seven. But this is one movie that disturbed me so deeply that I personally never care to see it again. Yes, the cinematography and scenery was beautiful. Yes, Anthony Hopkins once again gave an Oscar worthy performance. And yes, Julianne Moore was truly excellent as Clarice. The problem that I had was the fact that there was basically no plot combined with the sickest and most graphic violence I have ever seen in a movie. Also, the psychological motivation for the killing from Hannibal Lector also made this movie very disturbing (yes I have seen and love Silence of the Lambs). I guess that if you have no problem with extremely graphic gore and mutilation then this is the movie for you!!Another thing that greatly disappointed me was that they did not go into Hannibal character much. I was hoping that in this movie we might find out some background info. about his childhood, etc... that fostered his love for killing and cannibalism. However, this movie provides nothing into his psyche. Oh, well, maybe the next one...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Much Thrill Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I eagerly awaited this thriller because I really enjoyed the intense fear in "Silence of the Lambs". There's not much here. The movie lacks the claustrophic, mesmerizing effect that "Lambs" produced. It's like the whole plot had been diced into bits and pieces that don't fit together. The visual style vacillates between brooding atmosphere and glowing panoramics. Hopkins is gallant; Moore is serviceable but there's not much depth in-between. Very disappointed. Even the gore lacks any type of suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the perspective of someone who's never saw Silence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, I never saw Silence of the Lambs. At first, I wanted to rent it to catch up on the story and all, make sure I knew what was going on. The more I thought about it, though, I believed that if the film was anywhere near as terrific as it's acclaimed to be, I shouldn't see it first. And I'm glad I didn't, because I saw Hannibal on its own merits. It is dark, it is pretty ghastly, and, a very frighteningly it was entertaining. I thought it was witty, and dark, and horrid, but in good ways.I'm guessing if you compare it to Silence, you're in trouble, simply because Silence of the Lambs is (presumably) so good. But if you really let this sit as its own film (I'm told it's not even really a sequel, but just the same characters in a different story altogether) it's a pretty good movie. And the finale isn't even as horrible as its made out to be (but I'm a biologist, so I've seen a lot worse). It's not the best horror film I've ever seen. Given the choice, I'd rather watch Evil Dead 2. But I'm glad I saw Hannibal.And now I can finally see Silence of the Lambs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'A more than worthy successor to a classic film"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was damned by critics either way. If the movie followed Silence's original formula they would have called it unoriginal. If it had been fresh, new and unique, the critics would have called it a grave injust to a classic thriller. Fortunaly though the makers of "Hannibal" have opted for a completly unique, scary, original and extremly excting film."Hannibal" starts out 7 years after Silence. Clarice is now a succsseful FBI agent and Hannibal Lecture-famous cannibal, has been on the run since his escape from Memphis. To say anymore would be an insult to anyone who has not seen the film yet(if you havn't go do so NOW.)the movie is so excitng that one never wants it to end. So suspenceful you'll bit your nails the entire time. So gory you'll cover your eyes and put your bag of popcorn as far away from you as possible. Not to mention the film is eerily well acted by the two leads Hopkins and Moore. Although I think Foster was a better Agent Starling, I think Moore is much more appropriate for the present character. She is much more sexy and a little bit more vulnereble, somthing Foster couldn;t have done so successfully at this point in her life. Hopkins is beautiful as everyones favourite cannibal. he is so scary and so mesmerizing that it is impossible to forget.Although I would give the film a perfect '10", it is definitely not for everyone. for starters, th moveie is 10x more violent forcing even the most jaded horror buff to turn their head away in disgust. Alsot the film climax is so completely over the top and unlike anything done ever before, that some viewers liking of the film may instantly dissappear.In conlusion, the film is a more than worthy successor to a classic. It will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.</fullReview>

They turned an all time classic *silence of the lambs* into a LOVE/HATE story between hannibal and Starling, took a psychological thriller and turned it into a sick, disgusting, horror flick! I'm not saying I totally hated this film, because I did like it. It had beautiful scenery, shots of the opera, and some witty humor from the wonderful Anthony Hopkins, but as for the story line and Julianna Moore * Madonna herself could have played a better Starling* a defiente 2 thumbs down!

		<shortDescription>Beneath the skin 'Hannibal' is something unexpected...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a follow-up to its predecessor from the early 90's, we all expected that 'Hannibal' was not going to be a nice family movie. Quite the contrary, the graphic nature of the violence that was included in the film seriously pushes the envelope, and made the stomach of this die-hard movie goer turn more than a little. (As an aside, I can't remember feeling this queasy since I saw my first horror films at around 13 or 14 years of age) However, that being said, and done within the context of the film, I didn't find that the violence itself was gratuitous in nature.Now, for those who like to mull over a story, and find some little hidden themes, I've got a doozy for you. While dressed in the trappings of a suspense-thriller/horror genre, if you imagine for one moment, by climbing inside of Lecter's head, that his behavior is perfectly justified, you may see a much more interesting story than the surface might allow.After seeing the movie, and chatting over it with some friends over dinner (salad for me, thanks) I had some interesting flashes of insight. Go back in your memory and think about each of the actions of Lecter towards the character of Clarice Starling. (I won't detail them here, as I don't wish to spoil it entirely for those who haven't seen it) While some of these actions are more obvious than others, when one separates some of them from the extreme violence aspect there is a rather deep theme that emerges between these two. Romance.No, I don't mean in a puppy-dog, hormonally-induced, Harlequin novel kind of way. But romance based on a mutual respect, and a bit of sometimes grudging admiration that can be seen every bit as valid as the more obvious kind. It was the discovery of just this treasure of underlying theme that raised my opinion significantly about this film.Watch Hannibal....he's charming, polite, respectful, playful, teasing, tender, heroic (in a particular action he performs), thoughtful, and although he might not (or he might!) admit to it.....smitten with Clarice Starling. She's a big girl now, not just an uncertain student any longer....she is a challenge in a world that has been without them for him for so long, and someone worthy of his respect and his attentions. He even ends up committing a horrible act of violence to help her even a score with someone who has wronged her.Now what's not romantic about that? *grin*Seriously though, there is certainly a twisted logic to Lecter's actions in terms of his "victims". However, it doesn't ever seem that someone doesn't get "got" unless they had it coming to them in one sense or another. Lecter even seems to make some of these into object lessons! Ever the teacher, isn't he?So, if you'd really like to see this movie, but are put off by excessive violence, I'd say have a friend come along who's seen it to warn you when to cover your eyes. Pay close attention, instead, to the little things Lecter does as well as says.....think of each action toward Clarice Starling and put it *out* of context into another situation with another set of circumstances......say, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.Most people will read this commentary, and think I'm way off.....a very few will be able to look beyond the obvious and see something far more interesting that was created in this story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today I went and saw the movie Hannibal, sequel to Silence of the Lambs. First of all, this movie is an excellent sequel to a great movie. Though Silence of the Lambs was better, this movie was still incredibly good. For those of you waiting to see Silence of the Lambs first, don't bother. You can enjoy Hannibal without seeing it. For the faint of heart, I have a warning, however: Dear God do NOT see this movie, NO MATTER WHAT!! This is a very gorey movie, and some of it is sick and tasteless. I'd say what, but that would be telling. Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lector. This is good, because not only is he the perfect Hannibal but the movie probably wouldn't be made without him. Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, but this doesn't make too much difference; she's just as good. I recommend this to anybody who enjoys Silence of the Lambs or just wants to see a good horror/suspense/mystery movie.</fullReview>

After the first 10 - 15 minutes, it didn't even phase me that the replacement had been made.I thought the first part of the movie - specifically all of Hannibals actions in Italy - were right on target - classic and fulfilling. Once Hannibal journeys back to the US, I began to regret forking over the money and standing in line. I've got to say though - that I am VERY glad they made the revisions to the book plot line - Clarise may have a bizarre, somewhat questionable facination with Hannibal - but she would never "join" him - and he would never truly want her to. "The world is a more interesting place with you in it, Clarise." He meant that.</fullReview>

(I won't detail them here, as I don't wish to spoil it entirely for those who haven't seen it) While some of these actions are more obvious than others, when one separates some of them from the extreme violence aspect there is a rather deep theme that emerges between these two. Romance.No, I don't mean in a puppy-dog, hormonally-induced, Harlequin novel kind of way. But romance based on a mutual respect, and a bit of sometimes grudging admiration that can be seen every bit as valid as the more obvious kind. It was the discovery of just this treasure of underlying theme that raised my opinion significantly about this film.Watch Hannibal....he's charming, polite, respectful, playful, teasing, tender, heroic (in a particular action he performs), thoughtful, and although he might not (or he might!) admit to it.....smitten with Clarice Starling. She's a big girl now, not just an uncertain student any longer....she is a challenge in a world that has been without them for him for so long, and someone worthy of his respect and his attentions. He even ends up committing a horrible act of violence to help her even a score with someone who has wronged her.Now what's not romantic about that? *grin*Seriously though, there is certainly a twisted logic to Lecter's actions in terms of his "victims". However, it doesn't ever seem that someone doesn't get "got" unless they had it coming to them in one sense or another. Lecter even seems to make some of these into object lessons! Ever the teacher, isn't he?So, if you'd really like to see this movie, but are put off by excessive violence, I'd say have a friend come along who's seen it to warn you when to cover your eyes. Pay close attention, instead, to the little things Lecter does as well as says.....think of each action toward Clarice Starling and put it *out* of context into another situation with another set of circumstances......say, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.Most people will read this commentary, and think I'm way off.....a very few will be able to look beyond the obvious and see something far more interesting that was created in this story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but DEFINITELY not for the faint of heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today I went and saw the movie Hannibal, sequel to Silence of the Lambs. First of all, this movie is an excellent sequel to a great movie. Though Silence of the Lambs was better, this movie was still incredibly good. For those of you waiting to see Silence of the Lambs first, don't bother. You can enjoy Hannibal without seeing it. For the faint of heart, I have a warning, however: Dear God do NOT see this movie, NO MATTER WHAT!! This is a very gorey movie, and some of it is sick and tasteless. I'd say what, but that would be telling. Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lector. This is good, because not only is he the perfect Hannibal but the movie probably wouldn't be made without him. Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, but this doesn't make too much difference; she's just as good. I recommend this to anybody who enjoys Silence of the Lambs or just wants to see a good horror/suspense/mystery movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had moments of perfection (Hannibal's interaction with Clarise, Insp.

After the first 10 - 15 minutes, it didn't even phase me that the replacement had been made.I thought the first part of the movie - specifically all of Hannibals actions in Italy - were right on target - classic and fulfilling. Once Hannibal journeys back to the US, I began to regret forking over the money and standing in line. I've got to say though - that I am VERY glad they made the revisions to the book plot line - Clarise may have a bizarre, somewhat questionable facination with Hannibal - but she would never "join" him - and he would never truly want her to. "The world is a more interesting place with you in it, Clarise." He meant that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The performances in this movie, including the addition of Julianne Moore as Clarice are fabulous. The movie looks spectacular. But I have to say it was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen, despite the gore. The plot was so inane. I can't believe that a seasoned FBI agent would be so stupid as to handcuff herself to a cannibal in a kitchen full of knives. There was no suspense, since no one was really chasing anyone. It was all so contrived. Don't bother unless it is for free.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the perspective of someone who's never saw Silence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, I never saw Silence of the Lambs. At first, I wanted to rent it to catch up on the story and all, make sure I knew what was going on. The more I thought about it, though, I believed that if the film was anywhere near as terrific as it's acclaimed to be, I shouldn't see it first. And I'm glad I didn't, because I saw Hannibal on its own merits. It is dark, it is pretty ghastly, and, a very frighteningly it was entertaining. I thought it was witty, and dark, and horrid, but in good ways.I'm guessing if you compare it to Silence, you're in trouble, simply because Silence of the Lambs is (presumably) so good. But if you really let this sit as its own film (I'm told it's not even really a sequel, but just the same characters in a different story altogether) it's a pretty good movie. And the finale isn't even as horrible as its made out to be (but I'm a biologist, so I've seen a lot worse). It's not the best horror film I've ever seen. Given the choice, I'd rather watch Evil Dead 2. But I'm glad I saw Hannibal.And now I can finally see Silence of the Lambs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'A more than worthy successor to a classic film"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was damned by critics either way. If the movie followed Silence's original formula they would have called it unoriginal. If it had been fresh, new and unique, the critics would have called it a grave injust to a classic thriller. Fortunaly though the makers of "Hannibal" have opted for a completly unique, scary, original and extremly excting film."Hannibal" starts out 7 years after Silence. Clarice is now a succsseful FBI agent and Hannibal Lecture-famous cannibal, has been on the run since his escape from Memphis. To say anymore would be an insult to anyone who has not seen the film yet(if you havn't go do so NOW.)the movie is so excitng that one never wants it to end. So suspenceful you'll bit your nails the entire time. So gory you'll cover your eyes and put your bag of popcorn as far away from you as possible. Not to mention the film is eerily well acted by the two leads Hopkins and Moore. Although I think Foster was a better Agent Starling, I think Moore is much more appropriate for the present character. She is much more sexy and a little bit more vulnereble, somthing Foster couldn;t have done so successfully at this point in her life. Hopkins is beautiful as everyones favourite cannibal. he is so scary and so mesmerizing that it is impossible to forget.Although I would give the film a perfect '10", it is definitely not for everyone. for starters, th moveie is 10x more violent forcing even the most jaded horror buff to turn their head away in disgust. Alsot the film climax is so completely over the top and unlike anything done ever before, that some viewers liking of the film may instantly dissappear.In conlusion, the film is a more than worthy successor to a classic. It will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not realizing that 2 and a half hours had passed is one way of knowing that the movie is doing it's job (in one respect). The sequel was not at all like the first and that was a partial disappointment.'Silence' was filled with suspense and surprise; it teases us like a sensuous woman, whereas 'Hannibal' takes it all off like pure porn.The sights are disturbing- another indication that it is doing it's job, however, many people won't expect this and will feel cheated if they are expecting to see something a little more like 'Silence'.Aside from that the technical and creative aspects of the film were enchanting and respect-worthy.</fullReview>

He definetly carried this movie and prevented me from walking out!!! I can see why Jodi Foster decided not to take the role. As for Julianna Moore...PLLUUEEAAASSEEEE!!!!!!!! Can you say WANNA BE JODI FOSTER!!!! She was a terrible Starling!! They turned an all time classic *silence of the lambs* into a LOVE/HATE story between hannibal and Starling, took a psychological thriller and turned it into a sick, disgusting, horror flick! I'm not saying I totally hated this film, because I did like it. It had beautiful scenery, shots of the opera, and some witty humor from the wonderful Anthony Hopkins, but as for the story line and Julianna Moore * Madonna herself could have played a better Starling* a defiente 2 thumbs down! I think they should have taken another 10 years to come up with a better sequel then this!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a follow-up to its predecessor from the early 90's, we all expected that 'Hannibal' was not going to be a nice family movie. Quite the contrary, the graphic nature of the violence that was included in the film seriously pushes the envelope, and made the stomach of this die-hard movie goer turn more than a little. (As an aside, I can't remember feeling this queasy since I saw my first horror films at around 13 or 14 years of age) However, that being said, and done within the context of the film, I didn't find that the violence itself was gratuitous in nature.Now, for those who like to mull over a story, and find some little hidden themes, I've got a doozy for you. While dressed in the trappings of a suspense-thriller/horror genre, if you imagine for one moment, by climbing inside of Lecter's head, that his behavior is perfectly justified, you may see a much more interesting story than the surface might allow.After seeing the movie, and chatting over it with some friends over dinner (salad for me, thanks) I had some interesting flashes of insight.

I've got to say though - that I am VERY glad they made the revisions to the book plot line - Clarise may have a bizarre, somewhat questionable facination with Hannibal - but she would never "join" him - and he would never truly want her to.

		<shortDescription>From the perspective of someone who's never saw Silence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, I never saw Silence of the Lambs. At first, I wanted to rent it to catch up on the story and all, make sure I knew what was going on. The more I thought about it, though, I believed that if the film was anywhere near as terrific as it's acclaimed to be, I shouldn't see it first. And I'm glad I didn't, because I saw Hannibal on its own merits. It is dark, it is pretty ghastly, and, a very frighteningly it was entertaining. I thought it was witty, and dark, and horrid, but in good ways.I'm guessing if you compare it to Silence, you're in trouble, simply because Silence of the Lambs is (presumably) so good. But if you really let this sit as its own film (I'm told it's not even really a sequel, but just the same characters in a different story altogether) it's a pretty good movie. And the finale isn't even as horrible as its made out to be (but I'm a biologist, so I've seen a lot worse). It's not the best horror film I've ever seen. Given the choice, I'd rather watch Evil Dead 2. But I'm glad I saw Hannibal.And now I can finally see Silence of the Lambs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'A more than worthy successor to a classic film"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was damned by critics either way. If the movie followed Silence's original formula they would have called it unoriginal. If it had been fresh, new and unique, the critics would have called it a grave injust to a classic thriller. Fortunaly though the makers of "Hannibal" have opted for a completly unique, scary, original and extremly excting film."Hannibal" starts out 7 years after Silence. Clarice is now a succsseful FBI agent and Hannibal Lecture-famous cannibal, has been on the run since his escape from Memphis. To say anymore would be an insult to anyone who has not seen the film yet(if you havn't go do so NOW.)the movie is so excitng that one never wants it to end. So suspenceful you'll bit your nails the entire time. So gory you'll cover your eyes and put your bag of popcorn as far away from you as possible. Not to mention the film is eerily well acted by the two leads Hopkins and Moore. Although I think Foster was a better Agent Starling, I think Moore is much more appropriate for the present character. She is much more sexy and a little bit more vulnereble, somthing Foster couldn;t have done so successfully at this point in her life. Hopkins is beautiful as everyones favourite cannibal. he is so scary and so mesmerizing that it is impossible to forget.Although I would give the film a perfect '10", it is definitely not for everyone. for starters, th moveie is 10x more violent forcing even the most jaded horror buff to turn their head away in disgust. Alsot the film climax is so completely over the top and unlike anything done ever before, that some viewers liking of the film may instantly dissappear.In conlusion, the film is a more than worthy successor to a classic. It will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not realizing that 2 and a half hours had passed is one way of knowing that the movie is doing it's job (in one respect). The sequel was not at all like the first and that was a partial disappointment.'Silence' was filled with suspense and surprise; it teases us like a sensuous woman, whereas 'Hannibal' takes it all off like pure porn.The sights are disturbing- another indication that it is doing it's job, however, many people won't expect this and will feel cheated if they are expecting to see something a little more like 'Silence'.Aside from that the technical and creative aspects of the film were enchanting and respect-worthy.</fullReview>

Can you say WANNA BE JODI FOSTER!!!! She was a terrible Starling!! They turned an all time classic *silence of the lambs* into a LOVE/HATE story between hannibal and Starling, took a psychological thriller and turned it into a sick, disgusting, horror flick! I'm not saying I totally hated this film, because I did like it. It had beautiful scenery, shots of the opera, and some witty humor from the wonderful Anthony Hopkins, but as for the story line and Julianna Moore * Madonna herself could have played a better Starling* a defiente 2 thumbs down! I think they should have taken another 10 years to come up with a better sequel then this!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beneath the skin 'Hannibal' is something unexpected...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a follow-up to its predecessor from the early 90's, we all expected that 'Hannibal' was not going to be a nice family movie. Quite the contrary, the graphic nature of the violence that was included in the film seriously pushes the envelope, and made the stomach of this die-hard movie goer turn more than a little. (As an aside, I can't remember feeling this queasy since I saw my first horror films at around 13 or 14 years of age) However, that being said, and done within the context of the film, I didn't find that the violence itself was gratuitous in nature.Now, for those who like to mull over a story, and find some little hidden themes, I've got a doozy for you. While dressed in the trappings of a suspense-thriller/horror genre, if you imagine for one moment, by climbing inside of Lecter's head, that his behavior is perfectly justified, you may see a much more interesting story than the surface might allow.After seeing the movie, and chatting over it with some friends over dinner (salad for me, thanks) I had some interesting flashes of insight. Go back in your memory and think about each of the actions of Lecter towards the character of Clarice Starling. (I won't detail them here, as I don't wish to spoil it entirely for those who haven't seen it) While some of these actions are more obvious than others, when one separates some of them from the extreme violence aspect there is a rather deep theme that emerges between these two. Romance.No, I don't mean in a puppy-dog, hormonally-induced, Harlequin novel kind of way. But romance based on a mutual respect, and a bit of sometimes grudging admiration that can be seen every bit as valid as the more obvious kind. It was the discovery of just this treasure of underlying theme that raised my opinion significantly about this film.Watch Hannibal....he's charming, polite, respectful, playful, teasing, tender, heroic (in a particular action he performs), thoughtful, and although he might not (or he might!) admit to it.....smitten with Clarice Starling. She's a big girl now, not just an uncertain student any longer....she is a challenge in a world that has been without them for him for so long, and someone worthy of his respect and his attentions. He even ends up committing a horrible act of violence to help her even a score with someone who has wronged her.Now what's not romantic about that? *grin*Seriously though, there is certainly a twisted logic to Lecter's actions in terms of his "victims". However, it doesn't ever seem that someone doesn't get "got" unless they had it coming to them in one sense or another. Lecter even seems to make some of these into object lessons! Ever the teacher, isn't he?So, if you'd really like to see this movie, but are put off by excessive violence, I'd say have a friend come along who's seen it to warn you when to cover your eyes. Pay close attention, instead, to the little things Lecter does as well as says.....think of each action toward Clarice Starling and put it *out* of context into another situation with another set of circumstances......say, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.Most people will read this commentary, and think I'm way off.....a very few will be able to look beyond the obvious and see something far more interesting that was created in this story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today I went and saw the movie Hannibal, sequel to Silence of the Lambs. First of all, this movie is an excellent sequel to a great movie. Though Silence of the Lambs was better, this movie was still incredibly good. For those of you waiting to see Silence of the Lambs first, don't bother. You can enjoy Hannibal without seeing it. For the faint of heart, I have a warning, however: Dear God do NOT see this movie, NO MATTER WHAT!! This is a very gorey movie, and some of it is sick and tasteless. I'd say what, but that would be telling. Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lector. This is good, because not only is he the perfect Hannibal but the movie probably wouldn't be made without him. Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, but this doesn't make too much difference; she's just as good. I recommend this to anybody who enjoys Silence of the Lambs or just wants to see a good horror/suspense/mystery movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...King Kong 2001, perhaps? Is this film what we waited 10 years for? Face it, this film stinks. Yes, "Hannibal" is horrible. And that's what the film should have been titled: "HORRIBLE". Ridley Scott (is this the same Ridley Scott who directed "Gladiator"?) has a film that is an excellent example of the sex and violence combo at its worst. I understand the title of the film but even so, this spineless, gutless, pointless and brainless sequel to "The Silence Of The Lambs" should have been rated NC-17 purely on its squeamish factor. The final 20 minutes of "Hannibal" are atrocious and might easily have been ripped from the worst of the Troma Film company's horror movie vault. Extreme violence is served up as fun and jokes in generous doses. "Hannibal" is the classic celebration of the "civilized" cannibal. "Hannibal" is far less intelligent than its predecessor and the suspense dies after the first hour. And how many quips from Anthony Hopkins do we need before we've had enough? Once, twice or three times -- fine, but after that the quips get stale very quickly. I say, "Hooray for the cannibal!"--NOT! About 20% of the movie theater audience howled in approval when some of the most gruesome and gratuitous violence un-spooled on the big screen. And heavy applause came as the end credits showed."Hannibal" weaves a cruel and blatantly racist device. The opening portion of the film illustrates what kind of violence most of America (and its film audience) is uncomfortable with and who America is uncomfortable with, where violence is concerned. Without any real back story, a Black woman (shown as a menace) carrying her baby and a gun can be blown to bits by Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore), but a cannibal who commits serial murders and dismembers can be loved, revered and admired by Starling - who in several scenes is clearly attracted to and fascinated with Hannibal Lecter. What is the REAL point of the major opening scene and the numerous others, other than the fact that violence committed by whites (Arnold, Anthony Hopkins etc.) is condoned and glorified, while violence committed by Blacks (in films like Boyz N The Hood, Menace II Society) is criticized and condemned (as it should be)? As should ALL violence.There is an element of "King Kong" working in "Hannibal". At least one scene evokes Fay Wray being carried by a gorilla atop the Empire State Building. There is an advanced twist on "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover" a 1989 film by Peter Greenaway. Anyone who saw Greenaway's film knows exactly what it is when they see the scene in "Hannibal." And, David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote this?? The screenplay is a disgrace. The film meanders and convolutes its way through a 130-minute maze, with gaping plot holes. Were Mamet and Zaillian on the same thing that Ray Liotta's character is on when they wrote this? Gary Oldman is unrecognizable under tons of make-up as a victim of Lecter's who survives to live like a freak. Two freaks for the price of one in "Hannibal". Step right up! Step right up! You can bet that the movie-going audience will.The best thing about "Hannibal" was Jodie Foster. That's right. Foster, bless her heart, made a very wise choice NOT to return, citing that the "Hannibal" script was something she vehemently disagreed with. Jodie, you played it smart, like the intelligent human being that you are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one question I seemed to ask myself over and over during the course of this film was "Why?" Why ask why? For example, why did we spend a good 45 minutes on a plot point that went no where (Pazzi)? Why did Verger talk like Larry Flint? Why killer pigs? Why was Ray Liotta's character even in this movie, other than to have an excuse for the infamous "dinner scene?" Why did that scene exist to begin with? The movie didn't seem to flow logically to that point, or to any other point in the film. What was the point of the film? Was there an actual plot somewhere along the line that I just missed? My friend said to me on the way home that the whole thing played like an episode of Tales from the Crypt. She could not have been more correct. Go to the film expecting an over-acted, far out, ridiculous, but hysterically funny in parts, campy gory romp, and you will not be disappointed. And you know what? There is really nothing wrong with a campy gory romp. Unless of course you are expecting a sequel to one of the greatest and most intelligent movie thrillers ever made. Kudos to Ridley Scott for making the movie look beautiful. The man makes blood squirts an art form. As a stand alone piece, Hannibal is stupid, silly fun. As part of the Silence of the Lambs legacy, its a travesty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is very different than the "Lambs" in that no precedents need to be set. The film takes off with a vigilance and deconstructiveness to the conventions of fair thriller play and throws and bites at them. The protagonists drive the story with such skill that there is no doubt of their superior intellect. Everyone else is a pawn for the final outcome, where the Starling-Lecter conflict finally occurs, 10 years later as time runs out. Scott has masterfully directed "Hannibal" and has used the mystery and command of one of the best characters ever written for book and film and has driven a whole successful and entertaining plot through the heart of a psychotic killer; the result is gruesome and perverse enjoyment and you you only wish things could be simple and rational.. Sometimes its good for a film to fall completely over the edge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was definitely a movie worth seeing, especially if you're a fan of it's predecessor, Silence of the Lambs. However, although I did enjoy it, I had a fairly large problem with it. It doesn't go anywhere. The movie, while having content, manages to end up at the same place as it is in the beginning. I was expecting another movie along the lines of Silence, and was disappointed on that count. Ridley Scott does a wonderful job directing this, and I was thoroughly impressed with the cinematography. Some of the camera work is quite impressive, and Anthony Hopkins puts on another breath-taking performance as Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore does a good job as Sterling, although there are parts of the movie where they use dialogue from Silence, and it is readily recognizable there that her voice is definitely not Jodie Foster's. But other than that, she fills the role in very nicely. All in all this was a very good movie, although again, it is much more about character development than it is any sort of plot. So if you're planning on going to see it, expecting to see another Silence, make sure you adjust your expectations if you want to get the most out of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that truly leaves you speechless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparisons to Silence of the Lambs are inevitable, as Hannibal had a lot to live up to its truly superb predecessor. As a director, Ridley Scott made the feel of this movie as different as possible, I believe, and with success.Julianne Moore fit into the character of Starling well, staying true to Clarice's cut-and-dry intelligence, yet making Clarice much her own, bringing an odd sensuality to the role that Jodie Foster never showed. Still driven to be the perfect FBI agent, Starling has become so perfect that she is rather destructive, both to herself personally, and to her career. Her ties to Hannibal Lecter and the success that she found in his case the first time around push her toward him once again.As for Anthony Hopkins, he again plays the ironic villian that everyone roots for--a man who commits unspeakable acts of violence, yet possesses remarkable taste and charm. An unrecognizable Gary Oldman is a welcome addition as a former victim of Lecter's out for the ultimate revenge.This movie is touted as a sequel, though comparing it and Silence of the Lambs is like comparing apples and oranges. (It is much bloodier than Silence, and NOTHING can prepare you for the final two scenes!) Once again, however, the character of Hannibal Lecter will shock, horrify, and amuse you all at once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not enjoy this film. I felt the writing was less than that of it's predecessor, and that it resorted to cheap, blatant gore to try to "win" the audience instead. I'm not a puritanical bleeding heart, but one scene was the most de-humanizing thing ever put on film, and it got an R??? Go rent SCREAM and listen to the director's commentary and see what they had to remove from their film to get an R rating, and then ask yourself if HANNIBAL's rating is fair to the rest of the industry. I don't normally pay attention to ratings, but I assumed that it being the sequel to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS that I had better make sure it didn't get an NC-17, because if it had I'd have known I should probably not go see it. My verdict? If you like slow-paced gore and Anthony Hopkins shooting cannibalistic zingers, go see it. If you are even the slightest bit queasy, or don't generally like slasher films, stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently went to the cinema as a fan of Ridley Scott to see his last movie "Hannibal". I knew he's one of the best movie director ever but I didn't know he was that insane.First, I have nothing bad to say about his way of filming, photographing or the way he directs actors. He really knows how to make a character look alive, and that's why the movie is so horrible.From the beginning, you follow Hannibal in his psychotic way of thinking, and you get really involve with that character, brilliantly played by Sir Anthony Hopkins. We get at a point were the audience is part of the action, that's what terrifying. I didn't go to see a movie to see myself as a maniac but as a spectator who wants to stay out of the action.Some scenes are so disgusting that no one could watch it. One of the last scenes will stay in the annals of cinema for a long time because of that.Finally, I would say the is great if we forgot all of these cannibalism scenes and only watch the beautiful picture, music and actor performances. That's why I give 7.5/10 for this motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is very different than the "Lambs" in that no precedents need to be set. The film takes off with a vigilance and deconstructiveness to the conventions of fair thriller play and throws and bites at them. The protagonists drive the story with such skill that there is no doubt of their superior intellect. Everyone else is a pawn for the final outcome, where the Starling-Lecter conflict finally occurs, 10 years later as time runs out. Scott has masterfully directed "Hannibal" and has used the mystery and command of one of the best characters ever written for book and film and has driven a whole successful and entertaining plot through the heart of a psychotic killer; the result is gruesome and perverse enjoyment and you you only wish things could be simple and rational.. Sometimes its good for a film to fall completely over the edge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I adored the book, I can't help but agree that the movie is an improvement. If you have the stomach for the graphic violence in the film then you're guaranteed a good show. The development of the characters of Clarice and Hannibal is delicious, so to speak. Although one does miss Jodie, I have to say that Julianne Moore delivered a fantastic performance true to the character. The ending of the film is perhaps the most pleasant of the many surprises of this film. This is one film I can't wait to see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasn't Silent, that's for sure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was definitely a movie worth seeing, especially if you're a fan of it's predecessor, Silence of the Lambs. However, although I did enjoy it, I had a fairly large problem with it. It doesn't go anywhere. The movie, while having content, manages to end up at the same place as it is in the beginning. I was expecting another movie along the lines of Silence, and was disappointed on that count. Ridley Scott does a wonderful job directing this, and I was thoroughly impressed with the cinematography. Some of the camera work is quite impressive, and Anthony Hopkins puts on another breath-taking performance as Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore does a good job as Sterling, although there are parts of the movie where they use dialogue from Silence, and it is readily recognizable there that her voice is definitely not Jodie Foster's. But other than that, she fills the role in very nicely. All in all this was a very good movie, although again, it is much more about character development than it is any sort of plot. So if you're planning on going to see it, expecting to see another Silence, make sure you adjust your expectations if you want to get the most out of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comparisons to Silence of the Lambs are inevitable, as Hannibal had a lot to live up to its truly superb predecessor. As a director, Ridley Scott made the feel of this movie as different as possible, I believe, and with success.Julianne Moore fit into the character of Starling well, staying true to Clarice's cut-and-dry intelligence, yet making Clarice much her own, bringing an odd sensuality to the role that Jodie Foster never showed. Still driven to be the perfect FBI agent, Starling has become so perfect that she is rather destructive, both to herself personally, and to her career. Her ties to Hannibal Lecter and the success that she found in his case the first time around push her toward him once again.As for Anthony Hopkins, he again plays the ironic villian that everyone roots for--a man who commits unspeakable acts of violence, yet possesses remarkable taste and charm. An unrecognizable Gary Oldman is a welcome addition as a former victim of Lecter's out for the ultimate revenge.This movie is touted as a sequel, though comparing it and Silence of the Lambs is like comparing apples and oranges. (It is much bloodier than Silence, and NOTHING can prepare you for the final two scenes!) Once again, however, the character of Hannibal Lecter will shock, horrify, and amuse you all at once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HANNIBAL, rated R????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not enjoy this film. I felt the writing was less than that of it's predecessor, and that it resorted to cheap, blatant gore to try to "win" the audience instead. I'm not a puritanical bleeding heart, but one scene was the most de-humanizing thing ever put on film, and it got an R??? Go rent SCREAM and listen to the director's commentary and see what they had to remove from their film to get an R rating, and then ask yourself if HANNIBAL's rating is fair to the rest of the industry. I don't normally pay attention to ratings, but I assumed that it being the sequel to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS that I had better make sure it didn't get an NC-17, because if it had I'd have known I should probably not go see it. My verdict? If you like slow-paced gore and Anthony Hopkins shooting cannibalistic zingers, go see it. If you are even the slightest bit queasy, or don't generally like slasher films, stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film followed the book quite well, but I felt you needed to have read the book in order to fully understand Hannibal's motivations for the end sequence. It just didn't seem feasible in the film, because you never knew what was going on inside of Hannibal's head. And they left out Mason Vegers sisters character, which I thought was an integral story line in the book. And the ending in the book just worked better. Here they left it as if another sequel was to be made. The scenes in Florence are magnificently executed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insane movie for insane people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently went to the cinema as a fan of Ridley Scott to see his last movie "Hannibal". I knew he's one of the best movie director ever but I didn't know he was that insane.First, I have nothing bad to say about his way of filming, photographing or the way he directs actors. He really knows how to make a character look alive, and that's why the movie is so horrible.From the beginning, you follow Hannibal in his psychotic way of thinking, and you get really involve with that character, brilliantly played by Sir Anthony Hopkins. We get at a point were the audience is part of the action, that's what terrifying. I didn't go to see a movie to see myself as a maniac but as a spectator who wants to stay out of the action.Some scenes are so disgusting that no one could watch it. One of the last scenes will stay in the annals of cinema for a long time because of that.Finally, I would say the is great if we forgot all of these cannibalism scenes and only watch the beautiful picture, music and actor performances. That's why I give 7.5/10 for this motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful sequel to my beloved Silence of the Lambs. ``Hannibal`` has more gross-out quotient that TSOTL, but the story follows a natural progression from 10 years past.Hopkins deserves Oscar, Julianne Moore definately filled the big shoes left her with the absence of Jodie Foster quite nicely. I felt she portrayed Clarice as best as any other actress could have.I would definately recommend this flick to anyone. Although, the ending is a bit, well.... nasty. The lady in front of me threw up on herself she was so repulsed. Weak stomachs be warned.Great movie -- Great ending.... will there ever be "Starling -- The Silence, Part 3"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing the "Silence"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a lot of fans of "Silence of the Lambs", I, too, had waited desperately these ten years for a sequel. What set "Silence" apart from most other films were the chances it took, and I knew that if a sequel was going to be any good, the creators needed to again take chances.It seems the people behind "Hannibal" took no chances. "Silence" was the first of it's kind, and has inspired a new genre in film. In the intervening ten years, we have seen filmmakers follow "Silence's" lead ("Seven" probably ranking best, "Desperate Measures" the worst). The problem with being a leader is that followers usually try to duplicate the flash, the skin, of the original, and forget the heart of it. The heart of "Silence" was it's subtext: Starling trying to heal the traumas of her childhood.Imitators typically lack the necessary subtext. They usually focus solely on creating a chatty, charismatic villain. "Hannibal" is another pale imitation in that line.I hadn't been able to wait, and had read the book ahead of time. The book was curious and disturbing, and cast more light on an interesting character and his world. The book had a downbeat ending, but made sense if reports were true that the author intended it to be act 2 in a trilogy. I knew it couldn't be sold as is, and wasn't surprised when Foster dropped out. I was still mystified how they would capture the heart of the book on the screen.They didn't even bother. The book, to me, was about the search for family, history, home. The movie is a different creature entirely. True to imitator fashion, they only paid attention to the gorey detail, leaving the core of the piece out. They gutted out most of the main character's motivations, leaving only puppets to serve in their place. That's not Starling up there, nor Mason Verger, or even Hannibal, for that matter. Without "Silence," I wouldn't know who these people were;there's no charm to them, or the movie.If you liked the first movie because of its "creepiness" then you might like this latest offering after all. However, I loved "Silence" because it dealt with communication--or lack of it--between two very different characters searching for a connection with themselves and their world--and in the midst of it all, they connect with each other.I was hoping for that same magic in "Hannibal." I was hoping to see the evolution in Starling's character. In the first movie she was trying to escape her past. In the book, "Hannibal," Harris explained why Starling chose the FBI to escape TO; and why the FBI eventually became a poor choice for her, not giving her the true satisfaction and pride she hoped it would. Also, I hoped to see "Hannibal's" inner world; that was the most attractive part of the book, as disturbing as it sounds. He was such a charismatic part of the first movie because the mystery of his character drew viewers to him. I was hoping to see this inner world and what made him make the choices he made, just as we learn in "Silence" why Starling made her choices."Silence," too gave its secondary characters a life. In "Silence" Crawford is a father figure for Clarice. In the book "Hannibal," Mason Verger is a nemesis for Lector and Verger's evil far surpasses Hannibal's, so that the reader/viewer understands why Hannibal begins to take on human qualities--why Starling was able to connect with Hannibal at all. In this recent movie Verger is reduced to a pathetic plot device to help Starling and Hannibal's paths to cross again.I may have had higher expectations than I should have had, considering the drop out of Foster and Demme, the numerous script changes, and the hoopla surrounding the film. But I hoped--I hoped that somehow "Hannibal" would not only recapture the magic from "Silence" but would build into act II of a story that so obviously has much more to say about not only Starling and Lector's inner demons, but our own inner demons.My verdict: Read the book. Save the movie for the dollar theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasn't Silent, that's for sure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was definitely a movie worth seeing, especially if you're a fan of it's predecessor, Silence of the Lambs. However, although I did enjoy it, I had a fairly large problem with it. It doesn't go anywhere. The movie, while having content, manages to end up at the same place as it is in the beginning. I was expecting another movie along the lines of Silence, and was disappointed on that count. Ridley Scott does a wonderful job directing this, and I was thoroughly impressed with the cinematography. Some of the camera work is quite impressive, and Anthony Hopkins puts on another breath-taking performance as Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore does a good job as Sterling, although there are parts of the movie where they use dialogue from Silence, and it is readily recognizable there that her voice is definitely not Jodie Foster's. But other than that, she fills the role in very nicely. All in all this was a very good movie, although again, it is much more about character development than it is any sort of plot. So if you're planning on going to see it, expecting to see another Silence, make sure you adjust your expectations if you want to get the most out of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that truly leaves you speechless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparisons to Silence of the Lambs are inevitable, as Hannibal had a lot to live up to its truly superb predecessor. As a director, Ridley Scott made the feel of this movie as different as possible, I believe, and with success.Julianne Moore fit into the character of Starling well, staying true to Clarice's cut-and-dry intelligence, yet making Clarice much her own, bringing an odd sensuality to the role that Jodie Foster never showed. Still driven to be the perfect FBI agent, Starling has become so perfect that she is rather destructive, both to herself personally, and to her career. Her ties to Hannibal Lecter and the success that she found in his case the first time around push her toward him once again.As for Anthony Hopkins, he again plays the ironic villian that everyone roots for--a man who commits unspeakable acts of violence, yet possesses remarkable taste and charm. An unrecognizable Gary Oldman is a welcome addition as a former victim of Lecter's out for the ultimate revenge.This movie is touted as a sequel, though comparing it and Silence of the Lambs is like comparing apples and oranges. (It is much bloodier than Silence, and NOTHING can prepare you for the final two scenes!) Once again, however, the character of Hannibal Lecter will shock, horrify, and amuse you all at once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HANNIBAL, rated R????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not enjoy this film. I felt the writing was less than that of it's predecessor, and that it resorted to cheap, blatant gore to try to "win" the audience instead. I'm not a puritanical bleeding heart, but one scene was the most de-humanizing thing ever put on film, and it got an R??? Go rent SCREAM and listen to the director's commentary and see what they had to remove from their film to get an R rating, and then ask yourself if HANNIBAL's rating is fair to the rest of the industry. I don't normally pay attention to ratings, but I assumed that it being the sequel to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS that I had better make sure it didn't get an NC-17, because if it had I'd have known I should probably not go see it. My verdict? If you like slow-paced gore and Anthony Hopkins shooting cannibalistic zingers, go see it. If you are even the slightest bit queasy, or don't generally like slasher films, stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film followed the book quite well, but I felt you needed to have read the book in order to fully understand Hannibal's motivations for the end sequence. It just didn't seem feasible in the film, because you never knew what was going on inside of Hannibal's head. And they left out Mason Vegers sisters character, which I thought was an integral story line in the book. And the ending in the book just worked better. Here they left it as if another sequel was to be made. The scenes in Florence are magnificently executed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insane movie for insane people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently went to the cinema as a fan of Ridley Scott to see his last movie "Hannibal". I knew he's one of the best movie director ever but I didn't know he was that insane.First, I have nothing bad to say about his way of filming, photographing or the way he directs actors. He really knows how to make a character look alive, and that's why the movie is so horrible.From the beginning, you follow Hannibal in his psychotic way of thinking, and you get really involve with that character, brilliantly played by Sir Anthony Hopkins. We get at a point were the audience is part of the action, that's what terrifying. I didn't go to see a movie to see myself as a maniac but as a spectator who wants to stay out of the action.Some scenes are so disgusting that no one could watch it. One of the last scenes will stay in the annals of cinema for a long time because of that.Finally, I would say the is great if we forgot all of these cannibalism scenes and only watch the beautiful picture, music and actor performances. That's why I give 7.5/10 for this motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing the "Silence"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a lot of fans of "Silence of the Lambs", I, too, had waited desperately these ten years for a sequel. What set "Silence" apart from most other films were the chances it took, and I knew that if a sequel was going to be any good, the creators needed to again take chances.It seems the people behind "Hannibal" took no chances. "Silence" was the first of it's kind, and has inspired a new genre in film. In the intervening ten years, we have seen filmmakers follow "Silence's" lead ("Seven" probably ranking best, "Desperate Measures" the worst). The problem with being a leader is that followers usually try to duplicate the flash, the skin, of the original, and forget the heart of it. The heart of "Silence" was it's subtext: Starling trying to heal the traumas of her childhood.Imitators typically lack the necessary subtext. They usually focus solely on creating a chatty, charismatic villain. "Hannibal" is another pale imitation in that line.I hadn't been able to wait, and had read the book ahead of time. The book was curious and disturbing, and cast more light on an interesting character and his world. The book had a downbeat ending, but made sense if reports were true that the author intended it to be act 2 in a trilogy.

		<shortDescription>It just gets better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott and David Mamet bring the Thomas Harris novel and horror to life and to the screen. What would you expect from this group teaming up? Whatever the expectation, it will be met!Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) is an old cannibal victim who is angry that Dr. Hannibal Lecter has been removed from the "ten most wanted list". The FBI was satisfied to leave our favorite meat eater in retirement, but . . . money can buy almost anything. Verger wants revenge and will go to any means to catch his prey. Be careful what you ask for!Anthony Hopkins reprises his Academy Award winning role as Hannibal the cannibal with the same calm coldness as in "The Silence of the Lambs". Here, we get to see more of his personality as he is the central character of this film.Julianne Moore may not be as good at playing Clarice as Jodie Foster, but she holds her own in the smaller role in this story. In a reversal of fortune, Clarice seems to be in the cage most of this movie while Hannibal gets to play in historic, classic, cultural Florence.I doubt that Julianne will follow Jodie's path at the Academy Awards, but there should be a few nominations for this Dino De Laurentiis film. I would think that Hopkins may be challenged for the repeat by Oldman's -- man of 1000 faces -- performance. Nominations for direction, screenplay and supporting actors would also seem to be forth coming -- if this film is not forgotten at nomination time.It was great seeing Giancarlo Giannini (as Rinaldo Pazzi) in a pivotal role in a major American movie. The star of "Swept Away" and "Seven Beauties" from a generation ago brings depth and experience to his protagonist role in the search.My favorite parts of the novel have been brought to the screen in a visual terror befitting the director of "Alien" and "Blade Runner". True, there is significant blood on the screen, however the real horror is reserved for our intellectual discovery of the sociopathic mind. Would you expect less from David Mamet?This film is more like the first Hannibal movie "Manhunter" then "Silence of the Lambs". In this series, it seems that each sequel gets better.Five Stars. I can not wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh my god!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time the 2+ hours of this film were done, those were the words I uttered as I watched the rest of the audience walk out with looks that ranged from disgust to apathy to pure enjoyment. This film takes the characters that we have come to know and love from "Silence of the Lambs" 10 years ago, and transforms them into something beyond themselves.The role that won Sir Anthony Hopkins his Academy Award is taken to every possible extreme in this examination of his character. He is very clearly having fun with himself in this film, doing everything from testing the audience's mettle for the sick and depraved (let's just leave it to say that it is far gorier than its predecessor) to going to great lengths to make a joke in the most obscene of situations, and he is not afraid to resort to cliches of one-liners and demonic facial gestures to achieve the grim effect of a fright that feels so welcome. In spite of the sickness of Dr. Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lector, there is very much a sense that he is the hero of this film (an anti-hero as it may be, but despite his evil, you find yourself more on his side). Lector is given motivation for his actions, not just the rationalization of killing (eating people) through twisted logic, but there is a sense of understanding his position. We see now that he kills not indiscriminately, but according to a selective set of ethics. The last half-hour of the film is without a doubt some of the most frightening (not just because of the gore but also the performances).Speaking of performances, it is hard to imagine this woman is the same Clarice Starling from "Silence of the Lambs." The 10 year history between the two films clearly establishes that Starling has changed in more ways than some would like to believe, and as such Jodie Foster's portrayal, while it would probably be good since there is a background from which she can draw, it would also probably fail simply because there is a distinct difference between the two. The Clarice of the first film is not the same woman here, and as such Julianne Moore does an excellent job in bringing a new perspective to an almost new character. Gary Oldman is pretty incredible two as the horribly disfigured millionaire who happens to be the one survivor of Lector's past onslaughts.Ridley Scott's direction has always been lush in its visual approach, as proven by films like "Blade Runner," "Alien," "White Squall," and his bloodiest movie until this one "Gladiator." His use of grim lighting in this film borders on cliche, but it is handled in such a way that the film could not have survived without those very devices.On the whole, "Hannibal" is an excellent sequel because it brings new perspectives to characters we already know and love, and it does well to introduce new characters without making them seem extemporaneous or gratuitous. However, the film is certainly not for all tastes. The first hour, while entertaining, relies heavily on the act of detecting and locating Lector before it takes a gross turn in the last hour for the gore-filled chase that continues up until the end of the film. The blood is the least of it, but I won't give it away, you have to see just how disgusting this film gets for yourself. Those with weak stomachs should be ready to throw up and wretch. "Hannibal" is a sick movie, but it is a great movie nonetheless. And if you think you can handle it, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

This film is all special effects over suspense. Sure Mamet/Scott tried to develop the Starling role further but ultimately the film failed.Oldman was excellent, Hopkins was laughing (all the way to the bank as he gets a cut of the gross) and Moore was fine. It was just the story that ultimately didn't allow for one to care about either character.I'm sure is will be a "smash hit" in dollars but not in Oscars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is skillfully written, acted, scored, and all other factors that apply. It can even be called equal to it's breathtaking predecessor.That is, until the last ten minutes. Yes, those all too infamous ten minutes of footage that sent a collective groan of disgust through the over crowded theater opening night.It is unfortunate that these blindingly gory scenes ruin many people's view of this otherwise great film. Yes, it's graphic, but during the first two hours, the gore and violence is used to film's advantage, depicting just how serious the crimes of Dr. Hannibal Lecter are. However, the infamous "dinner" sequence uses this shock-horror factor to such a degree that it loses all seriousness and just becomes ridiculous.I was shocked that such great writing talent didn't utilize the lost art of implication to accomplish the same thing (probably much more effectively) that this disgusting version did.Speaking of the kitchen scene, did anyone else notice the copy of "Vegetarian Cuisine" on top of the refrigerator behind Clarice's head? I thought that was kinda funny.Anyway, I do recommend this movie, but just be sure to ignore the last ten minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just as the Chianti jokes have died down, and the ominous slurping sounds friends repeatedly left on your answering machines have ceased, the amiable doctor returns. And what extremely patient little human appetizers we all have been, awaiting to see what Herr Doctor Hannibal Lecter would serve up for us in his Silence of the Lambs sequel...Hannibal doesn't disappoint. I know people are already whining it's not as scary as the first...well, that's true. How could it be? Partly because we already know what's in store for us with the intellectual ripper, and partly because we are so desensitized to the whole genre these days...But, I assure you several scenes in this deliciously tasty horror will have you squirming in your seat and covering your eyes in the armpit of your companion for fear of "seeing to much."Blunt Hint: Be sure to pack your MPB (Movie Puke Bag) for the final scenes-you're gonna need it!Hannibal's story goes...Clarice (Julianne "I saw Ralph Fiennes naked--I really did!" Moore) has heard from Hannibal, again. He's sending little notes- just to say "told you so" Seems Clarice has had a bit of trouble in her post at the FBI and she's about to be served up to the press as a sacrificial lamb if you will... Hanny just wants her to know he's there for her.Clarice's slithering boss Paul (Ray "I don't wanna freakin' talk about GoodFellas Okay!!!" Liotta) Krendler is incahoots with someone hell bent on "getting" to Clarice. Get Clarice, get Hannibal...At least that's what Paul's evil puppeteer, Mason ( Gary "as sicko as ever" Oldman) Verger reckons. Mason's setting an elaborate trap for poor totally suspecting Hannibal.Mason was Hannibal's fourth victim and only survivor...Of course survivor is a strong word. Mason is too vile a human to feel an ounce of semi-bad for . He's a raping pedophile Hannibal had been court appointed to. Hanny was actually doing the world a favor -attempting- to rid the earth of this heinous man. But he failed, and it's now Mason's life mission to hunt down Lecter at any cost and produce a human haggis (of sorts) from the man. And Hannibal's the deranged one...This Mason guy oozes with a particularly strong scent of Eau de Creepay folks! Think, quintessential Boogie Man. Sleeping is going to be tough this week.What's this Mason ? Hannibal has been found? Thanks to his peculiar tastes in hand creme? In Florence? A semi-crooked cop Pazzi (Italian favorite Giancarlo Giannini) has managed to parlay a true matching (17 points) finger print off the old boy and tip of the angry fetus faced victim.You wanna take on Hannibal do you Mason? Okeedoekee, he's coming out of hibernation.Ah, but just who's hunting whom? Hmm? And dear Clarice has always held a very special part of Hannibal's heart...Will he come to rescue her from her awful ongoing scandal? Mmm, could be.Having read the book, I will say, I found the David Mamet script's ending much better. An ending you'll have to see for yourself.Ray Liotta, who is looking extremely handsome these days, plays the sexist Paul Krendler, crooked FBI guy, purrfectly. His final scenes will go down in the history books of horror as some of the most repulsive special effects frames ever preserved onto film- too bold a statement- see Hannibal and get back to me... Since the "work" on Ray's face he's become a a double order of properly seasoned manbeef. Scrumptious!Gary Oldman is barely recognizable here. Argh. But, even under all his makeup the actor shines through. Gar's done some fascinating- albeit whacko -work. If, for some ungodly reason, you're not familiar with him go here, rent Sid and Nancy and then peruse from there - a must see actor...Enjoy.Julianne Moore did an admirable job in the shoes of Clarice. She had that same gollygee- I'm an officer- and just gonna go by the book sir- at what ever cost, attitude Jodi Foster brought to the original role. Her accent wasn't as Holly Hunter annoying either. Admittedly the new Clarice was disturbing for the beginning of the film, in a switching of the Bewitched Darrin's way- you know that unsettling feeling one gets when a major character in the story is suddenly not the same- except no one in the story seems to notice? Of course we were all ready for this rude switch-a-roo as the press made such a stinkfest over Foster poo-pooeing a reprise of her role. Julianne did just fine. Check out End of the Affair for more Julianne in action-and of course Ralph Fiennes' naked.Finally there's our scene and liver stealer, Hannibal...The Sir Anthony Hopkins. There are a handful of sexy older actors...Tommy Lee Jones, Sean Connery, Jack Nicolson, Brian Dennehy and Mr Hopkins. With Hopkins it's all in his brilliant eyes. Though he's probably best known as Hannibal, Hopkins is a consummate actor as comfortable in the role of the human steak connoisseur madman, as playing a writer destined to pen a child's classic (C.S. Lewis) or beneath some make-up in a quality version of Quasimodo. Versatility and talent wrapped in a nice sturdy package of manyum.Okeedokee. Get out and see this. Hannibal is one crispy kidney of a sequel with some tasty morbid bits to keep you engrossed in epicurean conversation for months to come. The way a real horror movie should!Snack Recommendation: Braised Bolognese Belly, Ray Style Sweetbreads, of course, chilled Chianti served in crystal flutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's what NC-17 was invented for. POSSIBLE SPOILERS INCLUDED.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film exactly 24 hours ago, which gave me ample time to think about it, so I'm not just reacting to what I saw."Hannibal" was very true to the book... in that it lacked soul. Both felt like they were done just to satisfy the public's appetite for more Hannibal Lecter.And also, I think that the filmmakers were banking on folks to have read the novel "Hannibal", as there was very little character development. The screenplay, by David Mamet and Steven Zaillian, is extremely lacking, and no actor is given the chance to really expand or contract--except for the Union Station cat-and-mouse sequence, which I think was excellently done. However, there are certain points in the film where I cringed from some b-movie-quality acting. Not throughout the whole film, as there were certain points I enjoyed also. It's an uneven movie at best, a big-budget slasher at worst.Definitely nowhere near as intelligent as "The Silence Of The Lambs", and nowhere near as haunting. Lecter, once a creepy, frightening, wild eyed psychotic has just become a larger caricature of himself. He has become a Freddy Krueger of sorts, and no doubt the teen audience might like that about him...... BUT THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR TEENS. Having to endure damn near four or five minutes of watching a person's exposed and bleeding brain while that person is still conscious and forced to consume said brain was too much. The disembowelment scene was also tripping that line between tasteful and tasteless. True, I had read the book and was kind of interested to see how they would handle these sequences--and I guess I'm guilty of it too. I knew what was coming, so I guess it wasn't as horrific for me, but to the unsuspecting viewer, it will be more than too much for the squeamish.There's hardly any profanity in the film, but when there is, it's pretty damn profane. Calling Starling "country cornpone p***y" is in the book, and I find both to be awkward and unnecessary. True, it does indicate what kind of guy Paul Krendler is, but does his end in the film really fit? In the book, it does because of the development of the character. In the film, it seems gratuitous and unreasonable. They didn't even establish very well (if at all) that he was working with Mason Verger (Gary Oldman in a delightfully scary performance, aided with a ton of makeup), which, in the book, gave Lecter his reasons for doing what he did.In all--wait for the DVD. It's worth a watch, but you need to be able to skip certain things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be the most over-hyped piece of crap to come to theaters in a long time. The first hour of the movie is wasted on a story line that has little or nothing to do with the overall story. There is absolutely no suspense to this movie. It has long periods where absolutely nothing happens and by the end you just can't wait for it to be over. Speaking of the ending...it is almost ridiculous. This movie(such an obvious setup for a second sequel) is almost bad enough to make you forget how good the original was. If not for the acting, I wouldn't even give this movie a 2. Ten years and this is the best they could do. Disappointing.</fullReview>

I'm sure that their minds are not consumed only with hatred, anger and thoughts of revenge.I think it's interesting that such a big-budget production could get away with making a mass-murdering cannibal (who happens to enjoy chianti and has a flippant wit) such a sympathetic character. Are we really supposed to hope that he gets away in the end? I didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ridiculous and Awful Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will be honest -- I came to this film prepared to be let down. Normally, I approach sequels to great films attempting to calm myself into not having enormous over-expectations. This time, I felt no need, seeing as I expected it to not live up to the original.Little did I know that it would not only not live up to the original, it would take everything that was special, haunting, wonderful and meaningful about the original and mutate it into something grisly, awful, offensive, and stupid. This was, to be blunt, an absolutely idiotic piece of filmmaking. The original shows three scenes of "gore" (in quotes because my entire concept of "gore" has been redefined by this "sequel"), and the combined effect of these scenes is overwhelming. You lived with them for weeks afterwards.This new "sequel" piles on heaps of the most ridiculous bloodletting you will ever see. We will disregard the meandering, horribly-paced plot and focus on the aspects of this film which were not simply poor but downright awful. You know, when I saw "The Silence of the Lambs" in the theatre, I didn't see one person cringe, grimace, or cry out. I sat in a theatre filled with people who were utterly speechless, deeply affected by what they saw. It was a rare moment where I sat in a full house and nobody was making even a noise. Seeing "Hannibal" was rather like, I imagine, being a modern-day witness at an actual gladiatorial combat show (pardon my moronic "pun"...I think Hannibal has sucked several years worth of experience out of my brain). Cringing, grimacing, shrieking...and all for the most worthless, brain-sucking, idiotically-crafted non-exercise in "filmmaking" I have witnessed in recent memory.Rent Friday the 13th Part IV! You'll have a much better time!At least it takes its gore with a grain of salt...doesn't place it under a mask of ridiculous pretension and call it art. This movie was the very definition of pretentious. I feel as if I were supposed to bask in Mr. Scott's beautiful panorama's of Italy and think "My, what an Oscar-Contender." Silliness, idiocy.To be perfectly blunt, this movie is an atrocious disservice to the original "Silence of the Lambs." It is fantastically stupid. Perhaps Mr. Scott, faced with the prospect of filming an awful script, decided that he would go for the "deliriously over the top" hideousness many critics blindly adore. If this was indeed the case, and I suspect it may be so, he has missed the point of the original entirely. And while I am perfectly aware of the fact that a sequel cannot simply trot out the original and put it on show a second time, I submit that sequels to great movies must always look to the original for, at the very least, -advice- on how to tell the story at hand. A great movie in the suspense genre has been defiled here. And I, for one who is extraordinarily desensitized to all things violent and gory, left the theatre not feeling nauseous but actually -offended- at having been shown such grisly things as if they were serious art and had a purpose. Frankly, if this had been a comedy, I might have chuckled once or twice. But any reviewer suggesting this is a brilliant black comedy simply doesn't know the meaning of the phrase "black comedy" and might perhaps consider having their head examined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott and David Mamet bring the Thomas Harris novel and horror to life and to the screen. What would you expect from this group teaming up? Whatever the expectation, it will be met!Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) is an old cannibal victim who is angry that Dr. Hannibal Lecter has been removed from the "ten most wanted list". The FBI was satisfied to leave our favorite meat eater in retirement, but . . . money can buy almost anything. Verger wants revenge and will go to any means to catch his prey. Be careful what you ask for!Anthony Hopkins reprises his Academy Award winning role as Hannibal the cannibal with the same calm coldness as in "The Silence of the Lambs". Here, we get to see more of his personality as he is the central character of this film.Julianne Moore may not be as good at playing Clarice as Jodie Foster, but she holds her own in the smaller role in this story. In a reversal of fortune, Clarice seems to be in the cage most of this movie while Hannibal gets to play in historic, classic, cultural Florence.I doubt that Julianne will follow Jodie's path at the Academy Awards, but there should be a few nominations for this Dino De Laurentiis film. I would think that Hopkins may be challenged for the repeat by Oldman's -- man of 1000 faces -- performance. Nominations for direction, screenplay and supporting actors would also seem to be forth coming -- if this film is not forgotten at nomination time.It was great seeing Giancarlo Giannini (as Rinaldo Pazzi) in a pivotal role in a major American movie. The star of "Swept Away" and "Seven Beauties" from a generation ago brings depth and experience to his protagonist role in the search.My favorite parts of the novel have been brought to the screen in a visual terror befitting the director of "Alien" and "Blade Runner". True, there is significant blood on the screen, however the real horror is reserved for our intellectual discovery of the sociopathic mind. Would you expect less from David Mamet?This film is more like the first Hannibal movie "Manhunter" then "Silence of the Lambs". In this series, it seems that each sequel gets better.Five Stars. I can not wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By the time the 2+ hours of this film were done, those were the words I uttered as I watched the rest of the audience walk out with looks that ranged from disgust to apathy to pure enjoyment. This film takes the characters that we have come to know and love from "Silence of the Lambs" 10 years ago, and transforms them into something beyond themselves.The role that won Sir Anthony Hopkins his Academy Award is taken to every possible extreme in this examination of his character. He is very clearly having fun with himself in this film, doing everything from testing the audience's mettle for the sick and depraved (let's just leave it to say that it is far gorier than its predecessor) to going to great lengths to make a joke in the most obscene of situations, and he is not afraid to resort to cliches of one-liners and demonic facial gestures to achieve the grim effect of a fright that feels so welcome. In spite of the sickness of Dr. Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lector, there is very much a sense that he is the hero of this film (an anti-hero as it may be, but despite his evil, you find yourself more on his side). Lector is given motivation for his actions, not just the rationalization of killing (eating people) through twisted logic, but there is a sense of understanding his position. We see now that he kills not indiscriminately, but according to a selective set of ethics. The last half-hour of the film is without a doubt some of the most frightening (not just because of the gore but also the performances).Speaking of performances, it is hard to imagine this woman is the same Clarice Starling from "Silence of the Lambs." The 10 year history between the two films clearly establishes that Starling has changed in more ways than some would like to believe, and as such Jodie Foster's portrayal, while it would probably be good since there is a background from which she can draw, it would also probably fail simply because there is a distinct difference between the two. The Clarice of the first film is not the same woman here, and as such Julianne Moore does an excellent job in bringing a new perspective to an almost new character. Gary Oldman is pretty incredible two as the horribly disfigured millionaire who happens to be the one survivor of Lector's past onslaughts.Ridley Scott's direction has always been lush in its visual approach, as proven by films like "Blade Runner," "Alien," "White Squall," and his bloodiest movie until this one "Gladiator." His use of grim lighting in this film borders on cliche, but it is handled in such a way that the film could not have survived without those very devices.On the whole, "Hannibal" is an excellent sequel because it brings new perspectives to characters we already know and love, and it does well to introduce new characters without making them seem extemporaneous or gratuitous. However, the film is certainly not for all tastes. The first hour, while entertaining, relies heavily on the act of detecting and locating Lector before it takes a gross turn in the last hour for the gore-filled chase that continues up until the end of the film. The blood is the least of it, but I won't give it away, you have to see just how disgusting this film gets for yourself. Those with weak stomachs should be ready to throw up and wretch. "Hannibal" is a sick movie, but it is a great movie nonetheless. And if you think you can handle it, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

Yes, those all too infamous ten minutes of footage that sent a collective groan of disgust through the over crowded theater opening night.It is unfortunate that these blindingly gory scenes ruin many people's view of this otherwise great film. Yes, it's graphic, but during the first two hours, the gore and violence is used to film's advantage, depicting just how serious the crimes of Dr. Hannibal Lecter are. However, the infamous "dinner" sequence uses this shock-horror factor to such a degree that it loses all seriousness and just becomes ridiculous.I was shocked that such great writing talent didn't utilize the lost art of implication to accomplish the same thing (probably much more effectively) that this disgusting version did.Speaking of the kitchen scene, did anyone else notice the copy of "Vegetarian Cuisine" on top of the refrigerator behind Clarice's head?

		<shortDescription>It's what NC-17 was invented for. POSSIBLE SPOILERS INCLUDED.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film exactly 24 hours ago, which gave me ample time to think about it, so I'm not just reacting to what I saw."Hannibal" was very true to the book... in that it lacked soul. Both felt like they were done just to satisfy the public's appetite for more Hannibal Lecter.And also, I think that the filmmakers were banking on folks to have read the novel "Hannibal", as there was very little character development. The screenplay, by David Mamet and Steven Zaillian, is extremely lacking, and no actor is given the chance to really expand or contract--except for the Union Station cat-and-mouse sequence, which I think was excellently done. However, there are certain points in the film where I cringed from some b-movie-quality acting. Not throughout the whole film, as there were certain points I enjoyed also. It's an uneven movie at best, a big-budget slasher at worst.Definitely nowhere near as intelligent as "The Silence Of The Lambs", and nowhere near as haunting. Lecter, once a creepy, frightening, wild eyed psychotic has just become a larger caricature of himself. He has become a Freddy Krueger of sorts, and no doubt the teen audience might like that about him...... BUT THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR TEENS. Having to endure damn near four or five minutes of watching a person's exposed and bleeding brain while that person is still conscious and forced to consume said brain was too much. The disembowelment scene was also tripping that line between tasteful and tasteless. True, I had read the book and was kind of interested to see how they would handle these sequences--and I guess I'm guilty of it too. I knew what was coming, so I guess it wasn't as horrific for me, but to the unsuspecting viewer, it will be more than too much for the squeamish.There's hardly any profanity in the film, but when there is, it's pretty damn profane. Calling Starling "country cornpone p***y" is in the book, and I find both to be awkward and unnecessary. True, it does indicate what kind of guy Paul Krendler is, but does his end in the film really fit? In the book, it does because of the development of the character. In the film, it seems gratuitous and unreasonable. They didn't even establish very well (if at all) that he was working with Mason Verger (Gary Oldman in a delightfully scary performance, aided with a ton of makeup), which, in the book, gave Lecter his reasons for doing what he did.In all--wait for the DVD. It's worth a watch, but you need to be able to skip certain things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be the most over-hyped piece of crap to come to theaters in a long time. The first hour of the movie is wasted on a story line that has little or nothing to do with the overall story. There is absolutely no suspense to this movie. It has long periods where absolutely nothing happens and by the end you just can't wait for it to be over. Speaking of the ending...it is almost ridiculous. This movie(such an obvious setup for a second sequel) is almost bad enough to make you forget how good the original was. If not for the acting, I wouldn't even give this movie a 2. Ten years and this is the best they could do. Disappointing.</fullReview>

The movie touches upon the whole Lecter/Starling love affair, but Clarice is not made a cannibal like she is in the book.One almost feels sorry for Lecter... he's being hunted and the only people he's killing are his less than morally upright hunters.

		<fullReview>Five Favva Beans? (out of five)Well, I've just come back from seeing "Hannibal", the sequel to 1992's "Silence of the Lambs" and I am wired.Every once in a while, there is a sequel that outdoes the original. "Beverly Hills Cop 2" comes to mind and so does "Superman 4". To my way of thinking, "Hannibal" is better than the original and that's going some.I rather liked Jodie Foster as "Clarice Starling", but Julianne Moore handily out performs her. As before, Sir Anthony Hopkins is spellbinding. Add Gary Oldman to the movie as a mutilated multimillionaire/former boy toy, a gilt-edged script and the result is shocking, seductive and eminently entertaining. This movie is more than harrowing, it is absorbing. It pulls you right into its dark and relentless story line.This is going to be more than a successful movie, it is a movie than deserves to be successful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay - for starters, this review may contain minor spoilers, but I will do my absolute best to avoid them. Now, onto the surrounding controversy. The movie is rather different from the book (which works both pro and con). It is violent, but it is not as violent as the critics have been saying, but I do suggest that you need a strong stomach for a few of the more disturbing scenes. And the make-up effects for Gary Oldman are amazing ... simply amazing. You won't recognize him if you've seen him in other films.Okay - onto the film -- the material is original and entertaining, more likely appealing to the masses. It also involves a great deal more thought than "Lambs." It is more exciting and engaging. It also develops the characters a little better than "Lambs." Julianne Moore does a fantastic job of picking up the role of Starling. She does for Starling what Mcgregor did for Obi-wan (except she has a great deal more to do). Hopkins continues and allows the role of Lecter to grow. He continues to be humorous and charming, yet vile and disgusting. He really does a great job creating the classic "anti-hero." Don't try to tell anyone that you didn't like the way Lecter escaped in "Lambs." Although he doesn't offer that same type of deception, he does allow for Lecter to be cynical and amusing. And Ray Liotta is bizarre as Krendler. I think he was a good choice, playing the role with a certain dignity, yet he doesn't appear to be the sharpest scalpel in the hospital (you'll get that joke after the you see the movie).As a summery, the film does entertain and thrill. It is well worth the 9 dollar admission and, if you have the stomach for it, go and see it. The film is dark, romantic, frightening and mystifying. So, in all finality, go out, get some popcorn and a drink, buy your ticket, head down that long hallway toward the theater and find yourself a seat. Then, wait for the house lights to dim and enjoy this film. Now - go escape and have a great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly astounding sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one thing to remember: this is NOT "The Silence of the Lambs." It does not try to be. It stands out as its own film. The negativity toward it (I read four pans today) stems from critics wanting to relive the tone of "Lambs." The novel never promised that, and Ridley Scott's film follows the book very well (save the pointless new ending). Sir Anthony gives his most brilliant perf since "Remains of the Day," and Julianne Moore and Ray Liotta (I'm an 'anti-fan' of both) were surprisingly very, very good. If you take an open mind to your local cineplex, you might be very surprised. Soak in the amazing art/set direction, the seamless, artistic editing (JFK's Pietro Scalia has quite a style) and --uh--visceral effects. The gore factor is really minimal compared to teen slasher films...save the brutally visual ending. A brilliant film!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lives up to Silence of the Lambs?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well first off I would like to say that the movie was great and Sir Anthony Hopkins played the infamous cannibal quite well again. I read the book about a year ago and I loved it, the ending to the book was a twist and I loved it, the ending to the movie was different but it was still a good ending.I am thinking that Ridley Scott could have kept more of the book inside the movie, especially the ending. So what if people who read the book were disturbed by the ending but that's what Thomas Harris wanted. People need something new and disturbing in movies, that's what makes them so great. But enough about the book, now how about the movie. Through the whole movie, I couldn't wait until the exact part the Hannibal met up with Clarice, and Ridley Scott did that part greatly by not having them physically meet, but on the phone, with Hannibal's first victim in the movie.Julianne Moore played Starling's part perfectly to. She didn't make you think that Jodie Foster should be playing this part and not her. But does Hannibal really live up to Silence of the Lambs? My answer to that question is of course, yes. It is the perfect sequel probably because of the ten year wait for its arrival. The character of Lecter stays the same and the part of Starling stays the same. If you don't think that keeping the characters the same in movies, besides tha fact that they learn more, then you have problems. I suggest anyone to first read the novel, and then go out and see the movie. If you hate reading, well then you miss a great book, but then at least go out and see the movie if you loved Silence of the Lambs.My rating out of ten: 8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal in no way compares to the first two movies, Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs, which blow this movie away.There are some great scenes in this movie like the dinner with Clarice and the pigs scene, but this is not enough to carry the movie. The plot and characters are one dimensional and predictable, and the movie as a whole rates only a bit higher than normal slasher movies.I'm sorry to say this since I love Gladiator, but Ridley Scott sold out when he dumbed this movie down for mass consumption.Save your 8 dollars and rent Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five Favva Beans? (out of five)Well, I've just come back from seeing "Hannibal", the sequel to 1992's "Silence of the Lambs" and I am wired.Every once in a while, there is a sequel that outdoes the original. "Beverly Hills Cop 2" comes to mind and so does "Superman 4". To my way of thinking, "Hannibal" is better than the original and that's going some.I rather liked Jodie Foster as "Clarice Starling", but Julianne Moore handily out performs her. As before, Sir Anthony Hopkins is spellbinding. Add Gary Oldman to the movie as a mutilated multimillionaire/former boy toy, a gilt-edged script and the result is shocking, seductive and eminently entertaining. This movie is more than harrowing, it is absorbing. It pulls you right into its dark and relentless story line.This is going to be more than a successful movie, it is a movie than deserves to be successful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Julianne Moore is not Clarice Starling for the first hour, she is someone closely mimicking the blueprint mapped out by Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs, and doing a damn poor job of it. But remarkably, I found her "effort" something to appreciate. From her first scene, waking up in the van, her eyes are set in "must be different from Foster so I'll look determined not unsure" mode. Later on though, her performance becomes more believable and you stop comparing her to her predecessor. As far as Sir Hopkins' performance goes, I have to say he's fantastic in everything he does, but it is inherently true that those who fell in love with his Lecter portrayal in Silence, may be in for a BIG disappointment with Hannibal, but this is no fault of his own. It's misdirection, a choppy script trying to pull action out of its a**e, among other things. Whomever decided to adapt the script this way needs to be fired. First of all, the movie does follow the book quite accurately in most places, but in the spots where it deviates, the viewer is left bitter and unsatisfied, ESPECIALLY with the ending. In the book we still see Lecter as this sort of omnipotent, cultured being, who just happens to eat people (just as we did with Silence), but in Hannibal that reflection is shown maybe 20 minutes out of the entire film, the rest showing him as this animalistic, cannibal beast that we should love only because his name is the title of the film. Any Lecter lover, would be p***ed at this portrayal, because it demeans and belittles the character.To Jodie Foster: Good choice for turning this project down.Gary Oldman is fantastic as Mason Verger. His portrayal was sinister and methodical and that's exactly as it should be for a character of Mason's definition. As far as the Mason Verger makeup f/x is concerned, the entire latex and foam surfacing over his face doesn't match his natural skin tone, which you can see when he opens his mouth (the lips) and his eyes. This makes the makeup just look ridiculous and overdone.All in all, if you've never read the book or seen Silence of the Lambs, the film might be nice for a weekend outing, but when looked at through the eye of a fan of the Lecter series, it might be a good choice to wait for cable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wishing Jonathan Demme Had Directed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hannibal" was certainly thrilling. Some scenes were grotesque - but in an intriguing way. Hopkins was wonderful, and Moore was very good. Many scenes had so much tension that your eyes felt taught. But there was something missing.The film is not subtle. "The Silence of the Lambs" built a lot of its tension on words and some on actions. You got into Lecter's head and watched him get into Starling's. But in "Hannibal" you don't have that kind of subtle interaction. It's brash, and bold, and a Ridley Scott film - complete with "Gladiator"-esque motion-shaking shots and other camera tricks.If Jonathan Demme had directed, I think that the psychological intrigue would have been more prevalent, that you would have feared Lecter's words more than his actions. That's the movie I really wanted to see.Two final notes: Gary Oldman is a treasure. Ray Liotta should not have been in this movie. Man, what a waste of screen time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie went nowhere, but at least it dragged</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my friend first told me that the book wasn't even that good, I first thought that this movie was going to suck, for lack of a better word. But I remembered that it was a Ridley Scott picture, which gave it hope in my eyes. Not that he is the greatest of directors, but Gladiator was a great picture, and it's hard to believe that he would regress so much in less than a year.As I was walking out of the theater, this same friend said that the book was SO much better, and I can't stress SO enough. This movie went nowhere, but at least it dragged. At least I had the pleasure of sitting through a long, dull picture in an uncomfortable movie theater. If only you could be so lucky?This just goes to show you how even the most skilled directors can't turn bad material into a good movie. Look at John Woo's Mission Impossible 2. But at least MI2 had good action scenes toward the end. This movie was supposed to be gory and violent. 2 disturbing scenes, the wild boars and the brain scene, which lasted a total of 10 minutes tops, does not make an entire 131 minute picture into a gore feast. But I will say that I did enjoy the flashback scene with Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman. That was rather entertaining. And oh yeah, the brain scene, which was rather disgusting, was pretty amusing.If you've already seen the movie, I feel for you, as you should feel for me. For those of you who haven't seen it, but have seen Silence of the Lambs, keep it that way. And for those of you who have even seen Silence of the Lambs, I'd highly recommend that you stop by a video store and pick up a copy. You'll then understand why this movie was so overly hyped, as it is a work of art.I'm not even sure if this movie deserves a rating this high - 2.</fullReview>

Nearly 24 hours ago, I pushed the director's cut (technically not yet released, but I have friends at Blockbuster)of Manhunter into my V.C.R. for the first time. I sat and watched, enthralled. Afterwards, I put in Silence of the Lambs for what may be the 100th time. I sat and watched, enthralled. Friday rolled around. As soon as I could get away, I anxiously drove to the theater and purchased my ticket. I sat and watched, enthralled. Hannibal, while almost completely different in tone than its two predecessors, is absolutely brilliant. Some of the gore is over the top, but it is important for viewers to see that Hannibal Lecter, M.D. doesn't shy away or flinch at all in the face of what general morality says we should revile. The dialogue and music were excellent. There was only one thing that I think could have been improved upon: the man-eating hogs could've been developed more. If you aren't squeamish, I recommend seeing Hannibal at once.</fullReview>

Julianne Moore is a passable Starling, but, rightly so, this is not Clarice's movie, it is Hannibal's. But having Hopkins on screen for so long does ruin the mystique somewhat; it is nothing like seeing him behind the glass in SOTL. And the ending does become something of a mess.

		<fullReview>I can't believe this was made into a movie. This was a horrible story and the characters from "Silence of the Lambs" deserved a better ending than this. Let me start out by saying that there were many good things in the film. The way it was shot was very pretty, especially the scenes in Italy. I even thought that Julianne Moore did a good job in her role. I feel very sorry that her performance is not based on her own ability, but how she compares to Jodie Foster. Pazzi was also a wonderful, and maybe the only complex character in the film. I also liked the opening drug bust scene. After that it seems to get a little flat, in fact very flat. The story showed too much Hannibal and thereby gave us too much of a good thing. Hannibal Lecter is a character that we are fascinated with, yet we know we cannot like. We cannot like him because of his killer nature, but he intrigues us. In this film we really see the dark side of him and it ends up being too much. His actions become predictable and some of his lines are meant as comic relief, when clearly there should be no comedy in this movie. There were a few moments of nervous laughter courtesy of Mr. Verger, but should there have been? I don't think this movie should have had any comic relief. The gore present in this movie is a replacement for any psychological tension brought about by the previous film. Gone is the fierce questioning of Starling by Lecter that we know pained her so much. Also gone is the creativity and cunning in which Lecter was able to kill, (talking Miggs to death.) This film was just not near as frightening as the previous. People will see it because they have waited ten years to find out what happened, but I hope that it is not the phenomenon that its prequel was. I myself will pretend that Hannibal was last known to be, "...having an old friend for dinner."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delicious sequel to Silence of the Lambs. First, I'm not going to compare the movies because many others will and I think movies should be judged on their own merits.That said, I truly enjoyed the movie and believe that it will become more popular over time. I don't think that it is (immediately) a movie that one falls in love with. Ridley Scott style is front and center and engulfs the movie in dark shades of blue and black. Hans Zimmer does a great job setting the tone without getting in the way.The acting, Anthony Hopkins was Anthony Hopkins - a true craftman, Julianne Moore - well this lady is a star (and we truly need more woman who can do a performance like this... bravo). Giancerlo Giannini plays the first antagonist to perfection ... I am unfamiliar with him but would like to see more of his work.This is a movie to see and enjoy. Where it fits into movieland will take many years to sort out but I can certain recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This doesn't even come close to the greatness of Silence of the Lambs - this is nothing more than a glossy slasher flick - quite a disappointment!You don't know whether to laugh or vomit at the gratuitous gore that is prevalent in this 'film'.One word of advice - don't plan on keeping your popcorn down if you fully watch the last scene...Wait for it to come out on video...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe this was made into a movie. This was a horrible story and the characters from "Silence of the Lambs" deserved a better ending than this. Let me start out by saying that there were many good things in the film. The way it was shot was very pretty, especially the scenes in Italy. I even thought that Julianne Moore did a good job in her role. I feel very sorry that her performance is not based on her own ability, but how she compares to Jodie Foster. Pazzi was also a wonderful, and maybe the only complex character in the film. I also liked the opening drug bust scene. After that it seems to get a little flat, in fact very flat. The story showed too much Hannibal and thereby gave us too much of a good thing. Hannibal Lecter is a character that we are fascinated with, yet we know we cannot like. We cannot like him because of his killer nature, but he intrigues us. In this film we really see the dark side of him and it ends up being too much. His actions become predictable and some of his lines are meant as comic relief, when clearly there should be no comedy in this movie. There were a few moments of nervous laughter courtesy of Mr. Verger, but should there have been? I don't think this movie should have had any comic relief. The gore present in this movie is a replacement for any psychological tension brought about by the previous film. Gone is the fierce questioning of Starling by Lecter that we know pained her so much. Also gone is the creativity and cunning in which Lecter was able to kill, (talking Miggs to death.) This film was just not near as frightening as the previous. People will see it because they have waited ten years to find out what happened, but I hope that it is not the phenomenon that its prequel was. I myself will pretend that Hannibal was last known to be, "...having an old friend for dinner."</fullReview>

You got into Lecter's head and watched him get into Starling's. But in "Hannibal" you don't have that kind of subtle interaction. It's brash, and bold, and a Ridley Scott film - complete with "Gladiator"-esque motion-shaking shots and other camera tricks.If Jonathan Demme had directed, I think that the psychological intrigue would have been more prevalent, that you would have feared Lecter's words more than his actions. That's the movie I really wanted to see.Two final notes: Gary Oldman is a treasure. Ray Liotta should not have been in this movie. Man, what a waste of screen time.</fullReview>

But I remembered that it was a Ridley Scott picture, which gave it hope in my eyes.

This movie went nowhere, but at least it dragged. At least I had the pleasure of sitting through a long, dull picture in an uncomfortable movie theater. If only you could be so lucky?This just goes to show you how even the most skilled directors can't turn bad material into a good movie. Look at John Woo's Mission Impossible 2. But at least MI2 had good action scenes toward the end. This movie was supposed to be gory and violent. 2 disturbing scenes, the wild boars and the brain scene, which lasted a total of 10 minutes tops, does not make an entire 131 minute picture into a gore feast. But I will say that I did enjoy the flashback scene with Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman. That was rather entertaining. And oh yeah, the brain scene, which was rather disgusting, was pretty amusing.If you've already seen the movie, I feel for you, as you should feel for me. For those of you who haven't seen it, but have seen Silence of the Lambs, keep it that way. And for those of you who have even seen Silence of the Lambs, I'd highly recommend that you stop by a video store and pick up a copy. You'll then understand why this movie was so overly hyped, as it is a work of art.I'm not even sure if this movie deserves a rating this high - 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Anthony Hopkins is amazing. This film is completely and utterly a mind trip that takes you to a very frightening place. But it's one hell of a ride. I was very concerned that Juliann Moore was not going to be able to live up to the wonderful character Jodie Foster had created in the masterpiece that was Silence of the Lambs, however, I was pleasantly surprised and very pleased with her performance. I've always enjoyed her and this is no exception. But of course the main force here is Sir Hopkins. His performance is beyond words it's that great. He continues right where he left off, making us hate him and feel some sort of affection and connection with him at the same time. Gary Oldman, who is completely unrecognizable, is wonderful, as always. And I cannot end this without mentioning two other aspects of this film. One is the music. It's so hypnotic and beautiful and truly plays upon your emotions. The next is every scene shot in Florence: stunningly beautiful, gorgeous beyond words. The historic buildings and landmarks plays into the spooky and beautiful aspect of this film. And lets not forget how scary it can be. Watching Lecter cut open a man or eat body parts is...yell, extremely disturbing and scary. But he wouldn't be Dr. Lecter if he wasn't enjoying someone for dinner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made, fun film if not compared to Silence of the Lambs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Hannibal with high expectations, I'd been waiting for it since I saw the first preview trailer god knows how many months ago. Let me first start by saying that I wasen't disappointed, however it also wasen't anything like what I expected it to be.First off, it's really not a scary movie like Silence of the Lambs was. It has a few tense moments but they rarely end with a jump and by the end you're not really fooled by the slowly-building music anymore. It may not be a particularly scary movie but it's certainly a horror movie. I had heardall this stuff about how horribly gory it is but I was surprised at how little gore was actually shown, apart from the ending of course. The rest of the gore was usually just really quick cuts, dark scenes and jumpy camera angles, so while you know what's happening your never get a really good look at anything.The acting is superb, hands down. Anthony Hopkins once again fills the shoes of the intelligent, subtle, creepy Hannibal Lecter. He manages to maintain the base character he established in Silence of the Lambs while adding to, or even enhancing him with new aspects you wouldn't have thought would fit Hannibal. The most noteworthy is the comedic aspect which, while it seems odd, fits Hannibal's charactor quite well. There are several scenes which will definatly have you chuckling. Julianne Moore certainly does a fantastic job in place of Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling. I believe that the she really studied Clarice's character very in depth in preperation for this role. She seems very comfortable playing the part and does an excelent job making the character her own while adopting many traits that Jodie Foster established, and the audience expects from Clarice.The overall story and feel to the movie is much more lighthearted than Silence of the Lambs. You can tell that everyone involved in the making of this film was having a blast just being a part of it, especially Hopkins. It's not the gritty, realistic crime thriller that Silence of the Lambs was. But more of an exciting, well-paced chase film. You've got Giannini, Moore and Oldman's characters all trying to get Hannibal and Hannibal just messing with them as soon as they get close. It makes for one hell of a good time at the movies. The problem is that it probably won't appeal to people who want another Silence of the Lambs. I loved Silence of the Lambs, and hoped that Hannibal would be like it. I didn't get that, what I got was a really good film that didn't NEED to stand on the shoulders of it's predecessor.***WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD***Well, I have to say SOMETHING about the ending since in my oppinion they went WAY overboard. I thought that they should have put in something more intelligent (no pun intended) than just an ultra gory finale. I find it hard to believe that Liotta's character could actually survive having his entire brain exposed. I don't know if this is true but I heard somewhere that the human brain can't be exposed to anything but PURE oxygen (filtered by the lungs). It seems like the numerous chemicals and toxins that are in the air would almost certainly kill him the second his brain was exposed. Also I heard that the brain is actually more liquidy and would more than likely spill out when Liotta's character starts leaning around after his "lobotomy". Of course that would have made the scene even more gruesome and unpleasent. I thought that they should have spent more time thinking up a psychologically creepy ending instead of just a big grossout.***END SPOILERS***All in all Hannibal is a damn good time at the movies. It's not Silence of the Lambs and I don't think it's Oscar calliber material but it certainly has many redeeming qualities of it's own. I would've given Hannibal an 8 but because of the ending I lowered the score to a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No wonder Jodie Foster wanted nothing to do with Hannibal. This is just a bad slasher movie given the tarnished gloss of a big budget, major actors and studio support. Unlike the superb Silence of the Lambs or the undervalued Red Dragon this movie lacks anything like tension, credible characters or a gripping plot. Instead we get the usual Ridley Scott lush visuals and buckets of gore so over done as to be laughable.

		<fullReview>In fact, don't eat afterwards either. I felt that Julianne Moore was too weak to play Clarice, but at the same time, too gutsy. My view of the character will forever be changed. This movie will be profitable because of the gore and effects, the lure of Hannibal and the unjust casting of Moore for those who revere the Talented Ms. Foster. But the script needed some serious reconsideration due to the massive implausibility shown in various scenes. But hey, who the hell am I to judge?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one thing that I urge to all of you, it is to see this movie without any expectations. Remember, this is not Silence of the Lambs; this is Hannibal... and the movie is very close to the novel (although the end is completely different). It's difficult to review this film without revealing too much, but I can tell you that everything that pertains to Hannibal is really good (the scenes in Florence are amazing). Anthony Hopkins jumps right back into character and once again makes us feel for this sophisticated psychopath. The story line pertaining to Clarice Starling isn't as exciting (she spends most of her time in a stuffy office reviewing case files), but it has nothing to do with Julianne Moore's performance because she did the character justice. As to the general feel of the movie... well, some would say it's gory, but I didn't really find it to be. Granted pigs eat humans, and humans feast on humans, but there really isn't anything that you wouldn't expect from Hannibal. I was expecting a little bit more from Ridley Scott (especially when Mason Verger recounts past events), but who am I to tell him what to do?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After being initially floored and shocked by the movie, my feelings have since faded into disappointment. The unprecedented gore in the film made for a tremendous spectacle, but Mamet's script just didn't capitalize on the potential of the storyline. Hopkins was brilliant as expected, and Moore did a commendable job replacing Foster, but Hannibal just didn't have the intelligent suspense that made Silence of the Lambs so excellent. Standing alone it is still a good movie, but as a sequel to a Best Picture winner it just doesn't live up to expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine sequel, very respectful of the original and the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of possible angles to discuss here: the faithfulness to the book, except the very absolute ending and the lack of one character; the faithfulness to the original characters, story, structure, and tone, even with a new Clarice Starling and a new director, Gladiator's Ridley Scott; perhaps how the film stands on its own. I just saw it a few hours ago, and my head's still spinning with how to (ahem - no pun intended) digest it all.I guess I'll start with the basics: Julianne Moore holds her own versus Jodie Foster as Clarice, but she gets much less screentime than Foster did in the original - this is Hannibal's story. Giancarlo Giannini is terrific as the Italian cop who struggles between greed and justice, and makes the predictably unwise move to take Lecter one on one. Gary Oldman is unrecognizable as Mason Verger, Lecter's only surviving victim, and seeks sadistic revenge. Unfortunately the makeup does start to look like a mask over time - his eyes are impressive however. And Tony Hopkins? Well, he's clearly having fun here, and writers David Mamet and Steven Zaillian have worked hard to give him all the good lines, while trying to stay within the boundaries of Thomas Harris' book and the original film. Obviously, this is Anthony Hopkins' career defining role, and he slips back into it easily.While the film is a bit long at 133 minutes, it manages to maintain a good deal of suspense throughout. The gore stays offscreen for most of the film, but when it strikes, it appears in disturbing flashy bursts, mostly saving us from the brutality, until the end. And all I'll say about it is that you've never seen anything like the dinner scene with Lecter, Starling, and her slimy boss, Krendler, played by Ray Liotta.When did Ridley Scott become a genius, and brother Tony Scott become a hack? Gone are the trademark full face shots from Jonathan Demme, replaced by a lot of the epic grandeur that we saw in Gladiator, especially the scenes in Italy. In fact, many of the fast paced scenes, such as the introductory drug bust were shot in the same gritty style as Gladiator's battles and (of course) Saving Private Ryan.PS - I'm one of the many people who has been gushing over the fact that Steven Soderbergh released two great films in the same calendar year (Traffic and Erin Brockovich), but will all the same people grant as much praise to Ridley Scott by releasing Gladiator and Hannibal within 8 months of each other?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As enjoyable and watchable as Hannibal is, and as much as I wanted to like it, I was disappointed. It's a completely different film from its predecessor and that, I think, is the main problem. Whereas The Silence of the Lambs was a gloomy and realistic Serial Killer pic, Hannibal plays more like a glossy, jokey comedy-horror. And I wasn't scared at all!!!It was great to see Anthony Hopkins back in the part, and hear his Lecter voice again, but this time he plays it more like a caricature. You end up rooting for him instead of fearing him. Julianne Moore is one of my favourite actresses, but she seemed a bit out of place and I did miss Jodie Foster. Clarice doesn't seem to have a lot to do for a large chunk of the film, so she's just left to skulk around her darkened office. Ray Liotta was fine, but it's an unrecognisable Gary Oldman that'll stay with me long after the credits finished. His disfigured make-up is truly amazing. You'll never look at a baked potato the same way again.As for director Ridley Scott - enough with the overhead fans already! They're in almost every scene! He gives the film a wealth of glossy visuals which are pretty to look at but take away from the gothic realism that Jonathan Demme gave Silence of the Lambs. David Mamet and Steven Zaillian's script does have a few choice lines but considering they're probably two of the best screenwriters around, I was expecting something stronger. I just wasn't expecting to have my sense of credibility to be given such a work-out. Also, Hans Zimmer's choral score was no substitute for Howard Shore's unsettling themes for Silence of the Lambs.Despite all that, I did enjoy Hannibal. As a 'movie blockbuster', it was fine. I just expected something a little scarier...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, strong, beautiful, violent and extremely scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sequel to the critically acclaimed 1991 Academy-Award winning thriller "The Silence of the Lambs" is dark, strong and extremely scary and beautiful of our sophisticated killer and anti-hero: Dr. Hannibal Lector.The story brings us to Florence, where the beautiful city is perfect and in contrast with the admirable and evil Dr. Lector. It is the evil within the beauty in this film.The acting is stunning. Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins returns to play Dr. Hannibal Lecter for a second time and has a lot of screen time in this film. Oscar-nominee Julianne Moore fills the shoes of Clarice Starling from Jodie Foster, who won an Oscar for the part in "The Silence of the Lambs".Gary Oldman plays Mason Verger and he looks scary as HELL in this movie considering the make-up that he had to wear and he portrays the character more evilly than Hannibal in this film and he dies of a horrible death.The rest of the cast is out there and they make a lot more effort to put on their good performances. The music by Hans Zimmer and it is frightening, disturbing, violent and emotionally beautiful and I love his score for The Ring, Inception and THE DARK KNIGHT Trilogy and his other musical scores as well.The film is directed by Ridley Scott and his style is very amazing and spectacular as hell. The script is written by David Mamet &amp; Steve Zallilian and the dialogue in this film is just simply wonderful and I have not read the books by Thomas Harris, but the movie is more scarier.Overall, "Hannibal" is a successful sequel to "The Silence of the Lambs" and I have no problems with the violence and disturbing images in the film.This film is not for people who are sensitive about things in a movie including blood, violence and romance.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All hype and no scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third Hannibal movie the fist one was Man hunter made in 1986. It had a remake that was more popular Red dragon. Man hunter is a very scary movie. And this one is just overrated crap. Red dragon was a great deal better. Red dragon is one of the scariest movies ever. And this one is just pooh pooh. The prequel Hannibal rising is better and that one is not very good. For a movie that was said to be scarier then A nightmare on elm street 2 Freddy's revenge and Friday the 13th 2 I was very disappointed. This not a scary movie. It has a week script. It as good actors. They just wasted there talent. The best thing about this movie is that it is a precursor to Red dragon. This movie is not scary and it has an awful ending. Don't see this movie. It is a wast of time and money. It is not scary. It is just stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made thriller, but too gruesome in some places!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extremely hardcore thriller, Of course telling the continuing story of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lector. Julianne steps In as Clarice, and in my opinion does a very good job of it! Of course Anthony Hopkins achieved his goal of portraying the terrifying Hannibal Lector. I did have a problem with the last 10 minutes of the film, things got wayy too gruesome and grisly! The filmmakers showed us way too much! Ray liotta did a pretty good job in his role also. Gary Oldman played a horribly deformed former victim of Hannibal Lectors, and gave a commendable performance! This movie really does leave you scared out of your mind, I'll praise it for that. I really did like the movie overall, my only complaint is the EXTREME gore in the last 10 minutes. I'm surprised that didn't earn it an NC-17 for violence and disturbing gore. Suffice to say, if you have a queezy stomach, steer clear!!! 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Book is better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It should be noted that the book is a powerful work providing the back story of Hannibal Lecture, specifically related to his youth and young adulthood. In addition to being a war story, the text is also a love story, with elements of both creating a fascinating interplay that provides understanding into the mechanisms of how Hannibal Lecture eventually became a "monster".The screen rendition of the book "Hannibal" was merely OK. The deviation from the author's conceptualization as contained in the book was egregious. However, it was interesting to see a visual representation of many of the themes contained in the book. In that sense, the text is primary and the movie is simply a visual supplement. Alone, I doubt that the movie would be more than 4/10 stars since it only scratched the surface of the book's deep and compelling nature. (02.12.08 nf)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hello Clarice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Belated Day 14 Of My 31 Days Of Horror.The film starts out with Clarice Starling played by Julianne Moore who after a drug bust gone wrong has been coming under fire for the death of another police officer. Paul Krendler played by Ray Liotta is assigned to work with Starling because Starling Has been assigned to work with Mason Verger played by Gary Oldman who was a patient of Dr. Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins and is the only one who survived and has to live the rest of his life with a disfigured face as he wants to exact revenge on Hannibal Lecter.A little while later Inspector Rinalldo Pazzi played by Giancarlo Giannini wants to bring Hannibal Lecter to the police to collect a reward for $3,000,000. However Hannibal Kidnapps him and kills him before Pazzi Can collect the reward money.The climax of the film takes place at Mason's Mansion as mason wants to feed Hannibal to his wild boars. As Starling kills all of his men Mason is thrown to the wild boars and dies. Hannibal takes care of Starling as Starling has been shot. He drugs her and Krendler as they sit down to have dinner. Hannibal then cuts the top half of Krendlers skull off as he cuts off a part of his brain and serves it to Krendler. Starling handcuffs herself to Lecter as Lecter grabs a meat cleaver, Cuts his hand off and escapes on a plane.This film is great. It has wonderful pacing and a good story. This film also has standout performances by Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter Ray Liotta as Paul Krendler and Gary Oldman as Mason Verger. But there is one thing about the film that bugs me and that is Juliane Moore as Clarice Starling. The way she interprets this character is negative, dull and a little mean spirited whereas Jodie Foster did a much better Job coming off as more Charismatic and More of a happy spirit back in The Silence Of The Lambs. Whis this sequel is not as good as The Silence Of The Lambs It still is worth a watch.Rated R For Strong Gruesome Violence, Some Nudity And Language.2hrs 11min/131min.3 uses of the F-word.***1/2/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tribute to Dante Alighieri - without tears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great thank to Patrick Cassidy! "Vide Cor Meum" I kept in my soul.To portray Firenze that way was not the only really great idea - to get to Europe, to the cradle of the renaissance, and to use an anthropophagous M.D. to present and represent some key aspect and applied ethics in medieval times. "Avarice, hanging, self destruction" - "I make my own home be my gallows." It still works. Be aware of Renaldos, Masons, Pauls...Julianne Moore gave an outstanding "Goodbye" to the phantom 'Clarice Starling' that almost became real by that magnificent work of her predecessor. She never tried to copy something from her, and she did not "trample" on "her". I felt a deep silent satisfaction - just a little bit like bliss - seeing her in her beautiful unpretentious black dress at the end of this two hours stripped from pride, weapons and the connection with the cannibalism, that she let ran after the last attempt to imprison it. You cannot catch this, much less if you're trying to use cuffs.Incipit vita nova.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, actually</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this movie, I read many reviews panning it. Many people said that it was a pretty weak sequel for a great movie like "The Silence of the Lambs", but I have to say that even when "Hannibal" doesn't have the same strength of the excellent film directed by Jonathan Demme, it does many virtues that deserve to take in consideration.Too be honest, I found many lines and scenes from this movie to be quite cheesy and somewhat forced, but the overall film had a very good effect on me, mostly because of the solid direction of Ridley Scott (With many beautifully done scenes and a magnificent atmosphere, that not many horror films had) and the good performances done by the entire cast.I specially liked Anthony Hopkins and Juliane Moore's performances: It's mostly for their excellent job that this movie worked, I also appreciate the dark comedy elements included here; those good qualities were more than enough to make this movie a worth-watching(Though flawed) experience.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only 6.5? I'm shocked! I'll admit that "Hannibal" was not on the same level as "Silence of the Lambs", but how could anything be? Still, I feel this movie has a lot to offer, in terms of action and also character. After all, we get to see Hannibal as the main villain and out in the open. Julianne Moore is not Jodie Foster, but none the less did a good job. Gary Oldman did a fantastic turn as a former patient of Hannibal's whose now hunting him for revenge, proving once more that he's one of the most underrated actors in the history of cinema. Rounding out the cast is Ray Liotta, who I think did a great job despite what others have said as an arrogant FBI official. In addition to the performances, Ridley Scott creates a haunting atmosphere that's amplified by Hans Zimmer"s score. So, if you can stomach the gore (no pun intended), and if you really loved SOTL, check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Doctor Will See You Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Make sure you finish your popcorn early when viewing Hannibal for the first time. While most of this film is based on suspense, there is certainly plenty of gruesome horror by the end. Anthony Hopkins revisits his infamous role of Hannibal Lector in this disturbing sequel to Silence of the Lambs. Julianne Moore revises Jody Foster's character of Clarice Starling. There are also several other new friends to mEAT in this terrifying chapter of the Hannibal Lector tale. Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) is out for revenge for the torture that Dr. Lector put him through many years ago, leaving him grotesquely disfigured. He may have found him with the help of the Italian detective Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannni). Meanwhile, Clarice is also searching for Hannibal after being embarrassed by the FBI for a botched mission. Who will get to him first? Or is it possibly Hannibal who truly has the upper hand? You'll have to watch to find out. Brilliantly directed by Ridley Scott and excellent editing by Pietro Scalia, this film is truly terrifying in the most fun way. The story is engaging, as it is disturbing. You'll be telling everyone you know about it, especially the final scene that brings new meaning to the term "food for thought."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the previous of these delightful films, I was disappointed by this one. When it finally gets to the proper gore after over an hour of the characters basically just talking, you have lost interest with the plot and can't wait to get the film over with. I can honestly say I fast-forwaded most of the movie and just watched the ending, much to my dismay.However,the beginning is what moved my vote up though. The film starts off pretty good, but drastically declines and loses its good quality about half an hour into the main plot. If you are thinking about watching this, just don't waste your time expecting something that doesn't exist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recall reading Thomas Harris' Hannibal novel and thinking there was no plausible way it could be translated into film. It wasn't any fault to the novel which I thought was excellent in a macabre kind of way but simply because 'The Silence of the Lambs' is a gritty ultra-realistic masterpiece while 'Hannibal' is a demonic fantasy of a nightmare. To be clear I really enjoyed the novel but there are simply stories that don't translate to film. I was wrong in a way. Ridley Scott has truly done the best he could have with 'Hannibal'. It isn't as good as the novel or God forbid 'The Silence of the Lambs' but was that a real expectation? What we get is a slickly made and very well acted picture. It's gory, gruesome, and it goes way over the top but on those terms it works.What is it about Hannibal Lecter that fascinates us? I had my doubts that he would work behind the glass. Hopkins' performance is his worst turn as Lecter but that is really because the character as written isn't as interesting as a free man. The Hannibal in 'Red Dragon' and 'Silence of the Lambs' is much scarier because of the psychological damage he does. The character worked so well in 'Silence of the Lambs' because we knew he was building up to that ending. His eight years behind Plexiglas were spent devising horrible plans. The delight he took in destroying people without touching them was scary. Blood for the sake of blood isn't scary. Ironically, I don't think Hannibal Lecter embodies a sense of true evil as some do. The gentlemanly quality was the most frightening thing about him. He's the kind of spider that knew exactly how to lure in the fly. In 'Hannibal' Lecter is reduced to being nothing more than a boogeyman. It's disappointing to say the least. Gone for the most part are his predatory cunning, Machavellian problem solving, and mind games. There are moments when Hannibal slashes a knife much like a Freddy Krueger might. What Hopkins does though is make the best of the situation. There is a great wit to this performance. Hopkins is having a good time savoring the dark humor in the script. I also like that his Lecter here looks like an animal rather than the thin sickly man behind the glass. Hopkins delivers but in a different way. I found that this Hannibal has contempt for the world around him and smirks at whatever people threaten him with. Of course he lives but his freedom comes at a satisfying price.Julianne Moore is very good as Clarice Starling. One of the highlights of the 'Hannibal' novel was Harris' characterization. I like the fact that Clarice is bruised and views the world with disillusionment. I like the fact that there isn't a Jack Crawford figure to father her anymore. What I wish though is that Clarice was tempted by evil even in the least bit. Moore's Clarice although scarred still has that sense of right and wrong. I agree with Ridley Scott's decision to change the ending of the Harris novel. I must bring up the infamous ending of Harris 'Hannibal'. Is Lecter meant to be rewarded with Clarice? I don't know if I see it in those terms. In an odd way though 'Hannibal' is very faithful to the core concept behind their relationship. Clarice is the one thing Hannibal can't bring himself to fully destroy. That being said I'd like to see more evolution to the ending Scott envisioned. I don't know what this Starling thinks of Lecter. It seems as if she views him in this strict sense of right and wrong. Foster's Starling allowed herself to become dangerously close to Lecter. Does she love him? Did she ever? I don't want the answers to these questions but I'd like Scott to acknowledge that these questions exist.Oddly enough the best performance and relationship in the film belongs to Gary Oldman's Mason Verger. Hopkins and Oldman only share the scene for a brief moment but the moment is so satisfying in summing up Lecter. Verger was a pedophile who Lecter hypnotized into mutilating his face and hanging himself. Harris is wisely very vague in detailing the fine points when Lecter was active in Baltimore with his practice and in his prime. Verger is a brief hint into the horrors of this past. Verger was a much more interesting character in the novel and I am severely disappointed that Verger's sister Margot is omitted from the film. However, the Verger character is fascinating. Oldman's performance is multi-faceted. He's a pathetic being, he's funny, and yet we question who is the real monster in 'Hannibal'. Hannibal himself is a straight edge and has no internal or external conflict of identity or interest. Mason Verger is a character of many contradictions and is evil. We hate Mason's evil more though because he hurts others to do his will. In a odd way we view Lecter as not good but the only honest man in this world. Oldman's performance is key to this interpretation and he knocked it out of the park. He should have received mild Oscar consideration.</fullReview>

Anthony once again did a deliciously scary job as Lecter, and Julianne, in my opinion, made a better Clarice than Jodie Foster. The movie was more psychological than scary. It was better than the book, especially the ending. If you haven't seen it, then you need to. A rare sequel, that may be better than its predecessor. The actor and actress' made this movie reach its full potential. Ray Liotta did a great job as the jerk of the movie, Paul Krendler. This movie has a great many cat and mouse scenes between Clarice and Lecter. A great movie that deserves major praise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When The Silence of the lambs was released in 1991, everyone loved it. It even won best picture. Anthony Hopkins won best actor. Lord knows he deserved it cause even when I see him in a film now days I get worried. He was that good. Jodie Foster also won for best actress. She was brilliant too. and it won other awards that the film truly deserved. Then eight years later, Thomas Harris wrote Hannibal, and the film was released two years later.Everyone was expecting this movie to be like The Silence of the lambs. And unfortunately nobody was feeling it the second time around. I don't see why. There is only a couple of flaws. some critics hated it and some said it was alright.Being the harsh critic I am, I didn't see many flaws. Well, for starters, Jodie Foster isn't in it. Julianne Moore didn't do a bad job at all. She just wasn't Jodie Foster. Another thing is that the film doesn't have the smart conversations between Clarice and Lecter. Those are pretty much the only flaws in the film. Anthony Hopkins is of course spectacular. Hannibal is a little more gruesome than the original. And that was one gruesome film. The end to Hannibal is absolutely disgusting. So the movie isn't as good as the original. I had a very good time with it though. If only Thomas Harris was still alive. I would love to see more of Dr. Lecter.The sequel takes place ten years after Silence of the lambs. Clarice(played by Julianne Moore) hasn't spoken to Dr. Lecter(played by the always brilliant Anthony Hopkins) since the day she was promoted. But since then Clarice has gotten fired do to a shooting. Now Hannibal is living in Florence. And there are three different people trying to hunt him down. Clarice herself, an Italian cop(played by Ginnacarlo Gianni), and a survivor of Dr. Lecter(played by Gary Oldman). They all have there reasons for looking for him. The Italian cops is for the $3,000,000 reward. The survivor wants him for revenge. Eventually, Hannibal travels back to America. In which he sort of teams up with Agent Starling and has to save himself.So as I mentioned earlier, this isn't as good as the original. But it is very entertaining, and a bloody good time. This movie will make you cringe, gasp and other things. These are good films. Hannibal is underrated. And it comes in second place for me. That's what I think.Hannibal: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much of a sequel, but a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though it does not bear an ideal resemblance to silence of the lambs, Ridley Scott's Hannibal is still entertaining in a kind of moody thriller way. Sometimes it's creative sometimes it's clumsy but it abides. Just don't make this a TV dinner movie if your dinner is liver and fava beans.It is four years since last we saw Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter, but circumstance will bring them back together. She finds out that he is on the loose in Venice. The local police chief goes after him seeking the reward money, and one of Lecter's old patients is after seeking revenge for ruining his life and body. Starling has her own reasons for trying to find the world's most extraordinary man-eater. It turns out that Hannibal is seeking Clarice as well. Who will find who first?The film is generally well paced, and engaging, but like so many movies it fails to conclude properly. The last half hour is poorly scripted, clumsy, and not very climatic, although there are some freaky moments.In terms of horror, I think Hannibal is on the same level as its predecessor. Neither movies are actually that scary, but they occasionally reach a fairly high level of disturbing. They are both intriguing movies. This one is a little less so than Silence, but it's a sufficient piece of thriller filmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disclosure of All That Had Mystique In Its Predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We must give credit to Ridley Scott's sequel to the matchless original Jonathan Demme film for the audacity of its wickedness. The Silence of the Lambs was a masterwork because it was fundamentally a character-driven drama that, in part by means of its medium as a police procedural, organically unfolded into gruesome territory. Hannibal is a disclosure of all that was mystique in its predecessor, such as that it is stomach-turning in its barefaced depictions of horrific brutality, comparable to mondo-style exposure of expired anatomy, soaked in blood, guts, brains and screams of inconceivable agony. As a high-tech police procedural as well, one that opens with a bloody shootout between Washington, D.C. police and vicious drug dealers with submachine guns, it is truly a merging of two cinematic worlds. This is what makes Ridley Scott's Hannibal so entertaining as a movie.For example, there is an FBI team of scent specialists. When Clarice obtains a letter from Hannibal conveying sympathy for the disastrous drug bust, the result of which was the shootout, but also jeering her into tracking him down, this sophisticated team finds that he was very prudent not to leave anything on the letter that could impart a trace to his whereabouts, but it is also covered with some distinct brand of perfume which is sold in a very small number of shops all over the world. What a way to merge the unabashed double- tasking brilliance of the title character with such technically evasive criminal bureaucracy.Taking the place of Jodie Foster is Julianne Moore as FBI agent Clarice Starling. We do not miss Foster so much as we miss her portrayal of Clarice as a na?ve, eager and guarded cadet, but that is actually a plus for this film. Julianne Moore's Clarice is by now very seasoned, more pessimistic, having been through an overwhelming lot in the ten years since we met her as the ambitious idealist running from childhood memories. Now, she holds the record of having killed more people than any other female FBI agent. The twisted antagonist, Mason Verger, is played with vile drip by an unrecognizable star. Screw it, it's Gary Oldman. We all know now anyway. The key to this element of the story and of the Hannibal character is that any arch enemy of his can only be several times more degenerate. It could never be the other way around.Yet, it is Verger who is bedridden from paralysis in the hospital wing of his mansion. It is he who is nourished intravenously. His surviving eye is watered by a salty drip as a replacement for actual tears. He can move in a motorized wheelchair after being hoisted into it by brawny entourage and his abused doctor Cordell. He is enveloped by specialists and underlings to help him in a variety of fashions, and uses them to hunt down his long-standing adversary. He has formed a website offering a $3 million reward for the location of Lecter, with a Swiss bank as his go-between.When I said before that this film discloses all that had mystique in the previous movie, I also meant in a more pivotal sense its title character. On one hand, we are unnerved by Hannibal's air of mystery because the most perfect portrayal of a villain of which we should all admit we can possibly think was in the predecessor, wherein only his mind was free to journey and pierce being incarcerated behind the impenetrable glass of his subterranean vault-like cell, and that was more than enough. It was so incredible how capable he was and how almost nightmarish it was to be in his unruffled, elegant presence that we felt it was a wonder that there was any way he could be incarcerated, that he could somehow transcend the obstacle of physical captivity. Now Lecter moves freely, and though we cannot help but be riveted by whatever we can get of him, that detaches part of the fascination. In any case, Hannibal, as an intellectual force to be reckoned with, has not lost so much impact as to be ruined and rather than his charm being diminished, we feel that it is now a terror to be within his now unforeseeable proximity. There is still, especially since by the time of this film's release Hannibal was a cult icon, that morbid sense of humor fulfilled when he first appears. In this case, it is when Giancarlo Giannini, who plays an Italian detective, is investigating the disappearance of a library curator, and meets his "replacement," who is none other than?Scott's ultra-modern visual style, as it tends to in his latter work, runs out of steam in certain spots, capturing stylistic coverage more than using camera and editing language as, for instance, Demme did, but we can tell the scenes of dialogue written by David Mamet, the Mason Verger villain character is a first-class fusion of talent and devilish imagination, Julianne Moore's Clarice is a realistic depiction of how a person in her shoes would have changed in a decade, Ray Liotta gives a persuasively degenerate performance as the sleazy and corrupt Department of Justice employee who disgraces Clarice, and though Anthony Hopkins makes Lecter enthralling every second he is on the screen, he hardly needs to. The character speaks for himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right this film isn't great but isn't horrible bad either saying this I may of liked it more if it was not the predecessor to such a great film as Silence of the Lambs. One of my main problems was the new actress playing Agent Starling, after Jodie Fosters excellent performance in Silence of the Lambs. But Julianne Moore can not keep the country accent of starling for even a sentence i would of preferred it if she didn't try and use the accent in stead of making a fool out off her self for using it. On a nicer note Antony Hopkins it very good again as Hannibal Lecter and the rest of the cast (except Ray Liotta who really should stick to films about gangs and the mafia) are strong and believable.On whole the story line is strong but no were near as disturbing as Silence of the Lambs. After saying all of this the film is just about watch able ever with Julianne Moore instead of Jodie Foster. But don't expect to be seeing another masterpiece like Silence of the Lambs.Thank you for reading my first review I'm sorry if there are any grammar mistakes I'm only 15.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hannibal" is an utter disappointment, full of boring scenes that are supposed to convey mounting tension and reeking of banality; it completely does nothing to honor "The Silence of the Lambs", its far superior predecessor. Instead, this story takes a turn for a crime drama/gory slasher that, although strong in style and with some decent performances, doesn't present nearly any of the intelligence or tension that "Silence" so effortlessly created."Hannibal" certainly has its jumps and shocking gore effects, but there's just something so disappointing and lacking in the story. Instead of being an engaging character study like the first film, "Hannibal" is an ill attempt at a clever cat and mouse game between Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore, who is nothing like Jodie Foster. Why is she here? Where is Jodie???) and Hannibal Lecter. The result is somewhat of a mess, with only some mild scares. It tries to rely on shock value and it's sort of an insult compared to "Silence". Hopkins and Moore are strong but Moore can't do Clarice Starling justice and the story falls flat on its face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When people speak?or write?or complain about Hannibal,first they state a true thing?that the movie is not extremely good, it is not a masterpiece?they are, of course, entirely right in stating this; but then they state something completely wrong: that, not being a masterpiece, the movie is extremely bad, is rubbish, trash,etc..This is false. Hey, pals, even Ebert's scale has more steps, as a matter of fact it has 7 steps ?4 , 3 ? ,etc.. I believe "Hannibal" has at least this one quality: it is thrilling. This is something, for a movie that otherwise sets itself for anything. Some will find its flaws disgusting and disqualifying ;others will find them extremely and involuntarily comic and parody. Some write about it with a kind of amused anger, or with an amused disgust. Tocilescu considers "Hannibal" an author movie; an author horror movie. I think Scott tried to make " Hannibal" more Italian by giving it this campy "giallo" note.The same Tocilescu thinks that "Hannibal" it's a horror. It is not?not even in Scott's presumable intention?it's a crap melodrama. (But then again, Tocilescu believes that THIS Scott was the author of The Hunger (1983) !Maybe this says enough about the pal's familiarity with the Gothic ghetto!) Tocilescu liked "Hannibal" because it's ornate. It is; ornate crap.It lacks the dimensions, the proportions, the range, the scope; it looks cheaply ,poor and made on a very low budget. One must be a very bad, a very _ungifted director?to make a film this bad, and so bad this way. All the actors are wrong. Hopkins is wrong, but he seems very comfortable with such stupidities ,as if it's his second nature. The FBI damsel is rubbish; but then she always is. She is as rubbish as in "Psycho" (another film she did a lot to spoil). Nobody from the cast or crew seems to have enjoyed doing the movie. What is particularly revolting is Scott's attitude towards the subject?his complete lack of perspicacity of any kind.After all, what makes this movie look so wrong? It is, if this explains anything, the wrong tone. It is the self-complacency. It is the obvious inability of Scott not only of handling?but of merely seizing its subject and idea. It's the crap content, the cheap mythologizing ,the abuse of prestige, the cheap trick of using brands and labels instead of characters. Lecter is here like JR Ewing in the "Dallas" films. "Hannibal"'s viewers are not shown a character, or at least an interesting mask, or a masque, or a persona, a fitting convention?no.They are shown a label, a brand. This is extremely wrong.But then again, poor Hopkins uttering those banalities about Alighieri ,as for a class of imbeciles?too gain his admission in the Florentine scientific elite ?--we are suppose to believe that those philology specialists were impressed by the fact that he knew the who's who of Dante's poem ?;even worse are though Hopkins' attempts at reciting something in Italian?it's not only ugly?it is scabrous ?.The movie has this bizarre campy look, as if it were a "giallo" spoof?in fact, that's what it is perhaps?the "giallo"?wanna-be version of Lecter's career.I've found particularly repulsive Hopkins' crap Italian accent. The man sounds like an English soccer player after his first week in Italy. It is abhorring. The score is good?yet not for a "giallo"?but it works in the American scenes.I am one of those who believed that Hopkins is a great actor; yet,I am quite amazed by the resignation and mildness with which he accepts so many rather phony parts.An excellent IMDb writer, FilmFlaneur, remarked this characteristic of Hannibal?its ugliness.I have first read about Hannibal in Cahiers Du Cinema?it was only a very short and periphery notice, a few words about how bad, stupid and ridiculous this movie is?the prestigious CDC thus said that Hannibal is crap, rubbish. It also wrote how bad is for the film the Italian characters speaking English with that useless Italian accent pretending they were speaking Italian.I began this comment intending to rate it positively, to find something in its favor; I see that I mainly accumulated opinions and facts against it. As a matter of fact, I would of liked to be able to say that "Hannibal" is to Scott's cinema what The Agony and the Ecstasy is to Reed's?a concession deliberately (I hope) made, a less good movie, a descent into commercialism ,etc.. But I see this is not the case with "Hannibal", which is simply crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Grotesque!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say at the outset that "Hannibal" is not a sequel to "Silence of the Lambs." Once you realize that the two works stand on their own it is much easier to appreciate the two. To be sure, "Hannibal" is infinitely more obvious than it's predecessor. "Silence of the Lambs" was more Clarice's story whereas this one is Hannibal's. Nor is there any compromise whatsoever in Julianne Moore's performance. She is quite simply, excellent. Jodie is not missed at all. Anthony Hopkins does a masterful job of recreating Dr. Lecter. The soundtrack which is positively beautiful while outlining some of the most grotesque scenes of violence I have ever witnessed only add to the wonder of the production. The shots of Florence are spectacular. Top notch!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest super hero movie of all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to draw a parallel here. I bought this film in the USA many years ago on a business trip. Watched it for the first time with jet lag at 2am in the morning in my hotel room. I've watched it more than a dozen times again since and it has become probably my most watch DVD in my 200+ collection since then. Every time I see it I see something else, it has so much depth that so many other "good films" strive to plunge too and so often fall short. It's a love story first and foremost. We have a monster who only dines on "the free range rude". Those who will pursue their own interests with no regard for anyone but themselves. That he's sick by human standards there is no doubt, but like a vigilante he plucks from society those that would harm people who he loves, or his own, lives. Like in any good super hero vigilante movie there is a dame in distress. This dame is special as she too is a "fighter for justice". The music is beautifully atmospheric, the locations and sets stunning as Florence should be. Everything in the screen exudes sophistication, like our "super hero". His "special powers" being his intellect, his love of the fine things in life, his ability to dissect the human brain not just physically but psychologically especially. At the end of the movie he confronts his love who has one goal and that is to re-imprison the man who loves her. That she has feelings for him too is shown with beautiful subtlety in this film. In a scene with her at home having a hard drink we see a tear in her left eye as she thinks of him listen to his tapes, this is repeated in another scene, the faint tear in the left eye. Finally she cries that tear in the end scene when she apparently succeeds in cuffing him to her when he's kissing her for the 1st time. In one of the greatest acts of love ever seen on the big screen that bring a love story and a horror story together to stunningly he cuts off his own hand rather than hurt or mark the woman he loves - even though he is a cannibal and a monster. Julie Ann Moore is superb, as is Hopkins again. Moore &amp; Ridley Scott have joined with Hopkins in taking this film far beyond it's Oscar winning prequel. I find it strange that this film lacked the attention of the previous, and I can only concluded that the superb performance of Hopkins and the new level of shocking horror were what the general mass appreciated, in this film the beauty and love shine above the horror. It has hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal... Not a great film/story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I totally dislike stories that are not plausible. Lecter came back to America to "help" Starling out with her dilemma regarding her suspension. Like he could really do anything. It makes more sense for him to have returned because of his "love" for her. Which he is. Now the infamous "dinner scene" was just an insult to my intelligence. First off, he "fixes" up Clarice and her bullet wound. Fine. Gave the appropriate drugs to help her pain and healing. She wakes up and finds, very nice and neat, on the desk all her stuff. Cuffs, money...etc. Too convenient. Lecter disconnects the phone because he knew Clarice's nature would be to try to call the police. Why did he not just rip the phone off the wall to ensure no outside intruders? He just disconnected it where a child could put it together very easily. Clarice make the call to the cops and that limits Lecter from having "quality" time with her, which he has been aching to have. Remember, he does love her in his own sick way. He literally has only minutes to be with her before he has to escape. WHY? He is so smart and in love with her. He would never let that happen where she would call for help. He wants to eat the guy's brain and talk with Clarice. If he is to convince her to love him, without the use of drugs, he needs TIME...period. Time he did not allow himself to have.Now the cops are on their way. Time is short. He traps her with her hair and the fridge and ask if she could ever love him. The OBVIOUS answer is NO, NO, NO. Why would she? Dumb on Lecter's part. Makes no sense. He needed time and or drugs to get his way with Clarice. So he can hear the answer he longs for. If "no" is the obvious answer, maybe he never should of come to America, but I will talk about that in detail a little later in this writing. Let me go back a little now.In "The Silence of the Lambs", the thing that I liked a lot about Jodie Foster's performance is that she was respectful of Lecter but, immensely afraid of him. Even between 6 to 10 inches of glass or steel bars separating them. She feared Lecter, which made me fear Lecter. Watch the movie again and see what I mean. Total fear yet controlled and respectful. I was scared every time she spoke with him. In "Hannibal", Clarice is actually face to face with her worst nightmare and totally unafraid. This guy would in a second eat your face off and she attacks him like he is the bully neighbor you grew up with. She was drugged, I understand, but she was relentless the whole time. If a big dog chased me and I had a gun, I am brave because of the weapon yet I still would be afraid. The foreign cop guy in the beginning of the movie was afraid of him but, very greedy and it cost him his life. Clarice tried to get him with a knife and fist and then cuffs. She was relentless. It made me not afraid of Lecter. We all should be. He is capable of ANYTHING.Finally, Lecter escapes by mere moments from the police, minus one left hand. We are talking moments. Seconds. He is on the 10 most wanted list. Everyone in America is after him. All the airports have his picture, the state line, the damn Mexican border. His likeness is out there plus the now distinguishing mark of a missing left hand. Yet, he is able to board a plane for overseas, no problem. I am to assume he is on the plane days later after the dinner scene. It's not like he was in hiding for a while to let the "heat" die down. No disguise and no left hand to the airport for a flight overseas. I defy you to walk across the street after robbing the local 7-11 or gas station, and get you hand cut off and be able to board a plane for anywhere. STUPID, STUPID, STUPID. That part makes no sense. Even if he dressed like a priest, all people with casts, or splints, or missing left hands would be questioned by airport officials.I like the beginning of the movie. It's after he arrived to America, the movie goes downhill. Keep the story simple consistent to real life regardless of the extreme circumstances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Different From Its Predecessor, But A Great Film, Nonetheless!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sir Anthony Hopkins reprised his legendary role of the evil but brilliant Dr. Hannibal Lecter in Ridley Scott's epic thriller, 'Hannibal.' Upon its release, the film met with considerable critical disappointment, most likely because of Scott's differing directorial style. Jonathon Demme's Oscar-winning masterpiece, 'The Silence of the Lambs,' was a taut, gritty horror film; the film's terror derived largely from the sheer rawness of its graphic imagery.With 'Hannibal,' Ridley Scott has instilled into his film much beauty. It, indeed, remains exceedingly violent, but this violence is stylised. As a result, the film fails, in that regard, to terrify the audience as its predecessor so successfully did.But the film succeeds on a different level. It is an in-depth psychological journey into the "monster" of Hannibal Lecter. Though omitting Thomas Harris' difficult-to-adapt ending, 'Hannibal' remains loyal to the long-awaited novel of the same name, which met with similar controversy upon publication.The acting performances are quite good. The Hannibal Lecter we meet in the streets of Florence, Italy is understandably very different from the monster we observed at the Baltimore insane asylum years earlier, and Hopkins adjusts his performance suitably. When Jodie Foster refused to reprise her role as FBI agent Clarice Starling, Julianne Moore ('The Hours,' 2002) stepped forward, and she presents us with a hardened and more experienced version of Foster's Oscar-winning character. Giancarlo Giannini ('Man on Fire,' 2004) is brilliant as the corrupt cop determined to claim a reward for Lecter's capture, and Gary Oldman ('Air Force One,' 1997) is exceedingly chilling as the wealthy, facially-disfigured former patient of Lecter who desperately seeks revenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it just doesn't work for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are moments of Hannibal that are genuinely creepy and effective. But they are few and far between. For the most part, the over the top gore turned me off to this movie. It seemed almost comical. In reality, Silence of the Lambs was probably just as gory. Yet that movie was grounded in reality. Hannibal is more like a grand silly opera. It just doesn't feel real or believable.But the real reason that Hannibal doesn't work is that I don't think the character of Hannibal Lechter is scary when he's on the loose. I'm not sure I can articulate why. Maybe he's frightening in Silence of the Lambs because of all that potential is pent up in a tiny cell. But for whatever reason, the idea of Hannibal Lechter on the loose is scary, but the reality of seeing it in a movie just doesn't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting, Unfortunate Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this was a magnificent book, and a brilliant series, I wish they would have made the movie ending the same as the book. But then, if they had, people would not have seen the same effect as the did in the book due to a time rush. Hannibal and Clarice have a beautiful, yet complicated relationship, which many would have viewed as sloppy if rushed and squeazed into a 2 hour 11 minute movie. As it is, I spend my happy little free time explaining the slightly difficult to understand ending of the novel, which had unlimited space to thoroughly explain their love. You see, Thomas Harris loves metaphors and mystery, and his novels do as well. They were made for those who would, "see beyond his plight," in terms of the Good Doctor. So, sadly, the movie leaves shallow, less thoughtful, and/or closed minded people seeing a ravenous cannibal killer with a crush, and a decadent, bad girl FBI agent in a twisted love plot, and the Lecterphilles who fell in love with the complex couple completely in a state of disdain. We loved the book because it wasn't afraid to say what was meant to be, it had INTEGRITY. Where is the movies? I guess it's a good thing Sir Anthony Hopkins is a seemingly wonderful kisser.KW</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art-house horror with Euro-style depravity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's sequel to "Silence of The Lambs", based on the Thomas Harris novel, is a very different fish to its source. "Hannibal" is an art-house horror film with some Euro-style depravity.Let's get the script out of the way first -- it's not great. "Silence" was tightly constructed. "Hannibal" is a series of sequences that aren't knitted together tightly. It's as if David Mamet and the other uncredited writers (there were plenty) were instructed to create a loose foundation on which to hang a cavalcade of perversions.The perversions on display are strong and putrid, and nothing is more putrid than the Mason Verger character, brought to pernicious life by Gary Oldman. Verger is a wealthy pedophile who tangled with Lecter in the past and got his face ripped off. Now on a mission to make Lecter pay, Verger concocts an elaborate scheme to lure Lecter to his mansion and feed him to wild pigs. This sequence, when it finally transpires, is priceless, and worth the admission price.Julianne Moore replaces Jody Foster and does an adequate job of breathing life into the Starling character. Ray Liotta, as a creepy cop, takes his "Unlawful Entry" character and pushes him way beyond psychopath level. One of the film's finest scenes sees him become dinner for the discerning serial killer. Hopkins is a more debonair, worldly Lecter this time, a wanted man somehow living an improbable, charmed life on the bohemian fringes of modern Milan.Scott's imagery is glossy and all the sicker for it because the subject reeks so strongly of rotting creative carrion. The score, by a variety of contributors acts as a perfect classical counterpoint to the film's grisly events.Though I'm not sure I like it as much as "Silence", I recall its horrors more vividly and warm to its corrupt tone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this film, it has a haunting, menacing tone all the way through, and will scare you and sicken you - exactly what a Hannibal Lecter fan wants to see... It could not have the same impact as Silence of the Lambs - we know the main characters now and have some idea what to expect, and that, along with a couple of gruesome scenes (gratuitously so, many people have said) are what have made "expert" reviewers disregard this as a mediocre follow up.Anthony Hopkins performance is fantastic as you would expect, and Julianne Moore does a very good job too, and the Italian guy who plays Inspector Pazzi is very good** Possible vague spoiler ** My one criticism would be the ending which leaves you unsure exactly what has happened and wondering what happens next. The whole film sticks more or less to the story of the book, apart from the fact that Mason's sister is written out of the film. For some reason it was decided to completely change the ending and come up with one that is not really satisfactory. ****I have seen this film many times now and I am still impressed. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best one of Hannibal Lecter's films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal Lecter is a fascinating character, he's not the typical mass murderer or a regular psycho. No, he's a refined intellectual, a genius, a classy and seductive gentleman and on top of that, a violent killer who also happens to eat his victims, or somehow toy with them. His particular nature is more reflected in Hannibal than in any of the other related films (Manhunter -Michael Mann, 1986; The Silence of the Lambs -Jonathan Demme, 1991; Red Dragon -Brett Ratner's remake of Manhunter, 2002). For example when he lives in Florence and becomes a curator of a well-known museum, or when he goes to the Opera, or when he provides Dante Allighieri's references to inspector Rinaldo Pazzi; or when he sends a subtle note (with a beautiful drawing attached) to Clarice (brilliantly played by Julianne Moore, better than Jodie Foster, in my opinion) with an exclusive fragrance in it; the things he says, the things he does,the things he eats, the music, the shots of Florence (specially the ones with the pigeons in the main square or when the hit-man chases him) his brutality towards Mason Verger, Rinaldo Pazzi and Paul Krendler. To sum up, Ridley Scott was extraordinarily accurate on depicting Lecter's essence on this picture.Same thing about Clarice, only that she's a troubled mind as far as her identity, her job (the complex relationship with her sexist co-workers and with the CIA itself), with her past and with her life in general, makes her a more complex character than the Foster's one. When this two beautifully written and directed characters converge, you get an extraordinary experience, where Mason Verger, the giant hogs, Florence, Krendler (and his roll at what turns out to be one of the wickedest romantic dinners in movie history, for sure) and whatnot, can't be left in second term when viewing and reviewing this film.The ending it's remarkable. Lecter's choice clearly states that there's a human behind the beast, with weaknesses and feelings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the worst quasi-horror films ever. It's putrid, disgusting, obnoxious, and full of "HAM" as in the style of acting. Hopkins is so overboard here that nothing could save this mess of a pile of trash, not even Ridley Scott's wonderful visual sense. He must have been on a mental vacation. Everybody looks like they are overwhelmed with the grotesque plot, which is merely an exercise in gore, and gratuitous gore at that. This is an example of pornographic horror. There's no suspense other than how the next scene might out-gore the last. How did the writers come up with this abomination? Only a twisted mind could somehow turn the grisly serial killer Hannibal into a quasi-hero of a sort, and turn his terribly deformed victim seeking revenge into the villain, and then also think it's okay to partially decapitate an FBI agent because he's a womanizer. I was hoping against hope that, if the killer hogs didn't get the doctor, then perhaps somebody with a modicum of decency would find a way to fire a bullet into his head. What a filthy creep, who deserves nothing less than to have the ghosts of his victims rise up against him and take him to hell where he belongs. Where is Joe Don Baker when we need him? One big stick and Hannibal sees the stars of eternal rest. Now that's a happy ending for sure. Forget this horse manure and get the original MANHUNTER with Wm. Petersen instead, it's a lot better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is well shot and has a strong atmosphere, yet it falls short of the expectations it builds up in the first half. Anthony Hopkins is good as usual, although sometimes one has the impression that he is bored of playing Hannibal. Julianne Moore is wonderful and almost outdoes Hopkins at her best. Ray Liotta is also excellent as her FBI superior who had/has a crush on her. Giancarlo Giannini also excels in his role.I don't know why, but there is a feeling that something is missing here. Perhaps the writers just didn't give it their 100% or they fell into their own trap of building up more than they could eventually follow up. Anyway,this is an enjoyable film because of the atmosphere and also because it gives some introspection into the character of Hannibal Lecter, uncovering some of his past.Gary Oldman is "seen" here in a really scary incarnation and it alone adds some morbid feel that makes this film able to compete with its predecessor in terms of sick and disturbing images. Yet,this was obviously a misfired project that should have been worked out more carefully. Perhaps because Scott was just finished with his great success "Gladiator", he didn't have enough time to work on this one properly. So he added some impressive photography and art, together with the eerie mood and some intense scenes and packed it all up convincingly into a film that is only halfway the thrill one expected it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spoilers. SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is one of the very greatest thrillers ever made, and when this sequel appeared people were blown away looking forward to it. But - Hannibal and his disgusting methods of thrills has really lost about everything since the early 90ties. Anthony Hopkins is still in the performance as the psychotic cannibal doctor Hannibal. Jodie Foster did a very smart move thanking no to playing Starling again, this time it's the far less skilled actress Julianne Moore. We also meet Gary Oldman as a mangled, old rich-man and Ray Liotta as a detective. The movie is directed by Ridley Scott, Jonathan Demme were also a smart kiddo.Hannibal Lecter is living in Italy by selling paintings. Although the top notch agents are hunting him, he is living peaceful. But; a not too good looking Mason Verger are hungering for great vengeance over Lecter, after he made him spoil his face totally with a knife. Wanting this terrible revenge he has to tempt Hannibal back to America, but how? Only in one way; Lecter's only weak point, Agent Starling. The woman he loves...The movie is really not much of a exciting piece of film. It's NEVER elegant, nor smart or genuine. Although the dialogs and acting works okay, same with the directing the movie is really one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. The movie alone is a bit better then okay, but being the sequel of a masterpiece, it's really a nothing. Hopkins has lost about every little twinkle and is never that frightening, he's just a wannabe psychopath! And if you want to see something as pathetic as wild and aggressive pigs going craze and Liotta eating his own brain...well...see it! STARS: 3-2/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you watch this film expecting Silence of the Lambs 2, you will doubtless be disappointed. The plot ping-pongs between a disgraced Starling (played by Julliane Moore, almost re-inventing the role for herself) rummaging through the FBI archives in Washington, and an Italian police officer who stumbles across Lecter in Florence - Anthony Hopkins can still deliver the goods, but his performance is not nearly as impressive as it was in "Lambs". Also, like an annoying and somewhat irrelevant buzzing noise in the background, is a disfigured victim of Lecter's played by an almost unrecognizable Gary Oldman.The plot is fair, but occasionally sloppy and certainly lacks the tension that made the original so enthralling. We see much more of Lecter, but the character is simply regurgitated from "Lambs" rather than expanded - there's even dialogue from the original played back on a dictaphone. The excessive violence in the film does nothing except shock and adds nothing... the famous "brain" scene which you'll have no doubt heard about was used as a major means of selling the film to a young audience (certainly I recall my classmates being very excited by it) and does nothing for the film as a whole, and the same goes for the rest of the explicitly violent content that the first film managed without.Still, it's a fair story, the acting is good, and the chance of seeing Hopkins as Lecter again is no doubt enough on its own to entice some. But it will never better "the Silence of the Lambs".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wished I hadn't bothered.Missed Jodie Foster immediately, but, I have to tell you, I'm not surprised she backed out of the project, and am even more surprised that Julianne Moore agreed to do it.Flawed from the get go. **Spoilers**Clarice Starling has gone down hill, and Lecter is back to put her on top again. This was just gory for gore's sake--man eating pigs and all. I didn't doubt for one second that Liotta's character was going to get it in the end. But, the way it happened was just too hokey to be believed. Cutting his head open, exposing his brain, and having him sit at the table while it's being prepared. I'm not usually so squeamish, but, I did turn away. Also wasn't surprising that once we found out how the Italian Investigator's ancestor had died, he'd be dangling out a window with his bowels hanging out in no time at all. Then, there's Lecter's former patient. The now rich beyond belief guy who Lecter earlier had convinced to preform self mutilation on his own face. Now, he's out to seek revenge. What took him so long? If he was mentioned in "Silence of the Lambs," I don't remember it. But, 10 years later, there he is. Why wouldn't Clarice have interviewed him in "Silence"? Then, his "nurse" dumps him in the pig pit as well, when Lecter is escaping with Clarice. I didn't get that. Maybe it I missed something crucial in the earlier half of the movie, but, to tell you the truth, by the time the scene came around, I really didn't care and was just glad it was winding down. Then, of course, there's the very ending scene where Lecter is on a plane and feeds Liotta's brains to the kid he's sitting next to. In the book, this could have been a very chilling read (having not read the book, I'm only speculating) but after the blood spurting gore fest I'd just sat through, I just found the whole thing gross. Anthony Hopkins should have followed Jodie's lead and bailed. There was no tension in this film, not like "Silence." It was just was just a horror flick, to me.I wouldn't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The book was better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie left out so much, and was VERY dissappointing. Needless to say, Anthony Hopkins was still absolutely brilliant, but the movie itself was missing a few vital aspects that completely screwed the plot over.First: Julianne Moore shouldn't have plated Clarice. She looked hideously ugly when she cried, and isn't of the same calibur as Jodie Foster.Second (MAJOR PLOT HOLE): Clarice's mom is supposed to be dead. Why did Hannibal talk about Clarice's mother being a "chambermaid" in a hotel after the death of Mr. Starling, then? The whole REASON that "The Silence of the Lambs" was named as it was is because Clarice went to live on a ranch with an uncle after her father was killed in the line of duty. She wouldn't have been adopted by her relatives if her mother had still been alive and supporting them by cleaning hotels.My apologies... this has just been on my mind, driving me crazy.In short, read the book. That is all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal, though a horror movie, is one of my personal favorites. Certainly not for the content (cannibalism) but for the way it was so beautifully presented. Everything about this movie was a 10, from the story, the excellent score, even the lighting (which gets overlooked as a secondary character in most movies). It was true to what I felt were the the character's feelings, something I did not find in the book written by Thomas Harris. I liked the book, but I loved the movie.The story is set some years after Silence of the Lambs and finding both Starling and Lecter at turning points in their lives, on a collision course to each other. In this movie, despite his horrific acts, I couldn't despise Lecter as I did in Silence. It brought back some old saying that not all monsters are hideous and obvious to the naked eye to my mind. The ending, which was different from the book's, was the best ending I could have hoped for. It was a point in the movie about Starling's convictions and her loyalty to doing the right thing. I'm glad that the writers didn't sacrifice them to be true to the book. All the actors, the despicable and the loved characters, did a fabulous job. Julianne Moore was a better Starling than Jodie Foster in my personal opinion. Gary Oldman deserves special note for his performance as Mason Verger. I've seen Oldman in a lot of roles, but his role in Hannibal is by far the best.GO see this movie! It's right up there with Gladiator and Black Hawk Down, two of Ridley Scott's other films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: Spoilers flow like Chianti.I have seen The Exorcist, I have seen The Omen, I have seen The Sixth Sense, I have seen the face of Death in Bergman's Seventh Seal - yet I was still unprepared for the bone-chilling horror I experienced in Hannibal, watching Julianne Moore's acting. Julianne Moore played Jodie Foster, while Anthony Hopkins played a psycho butler. (No really, my brain hurts...)Ridley Scott, the creative director who helmed Alien, Blade Runner and Gladiator, fell asleep during production and let a monkey take over.Julianne Moore should publicly apologize to everyone who saw Hannibal and wash Jodie Foster's car for a year.Jodie - I don't blame you for turning this role down, honey! Seeing this revamped version of her character, we realize that gone is the complex fledgling FBI agent we empathized with in Silence, to be replaced by a domineering, emasculating cyborg - Clarice Starling has morphed into RIPLEY! (No small blame aimed at this particular director!) - which accounts for Moore's pants, at least. (And lest we forget, it was Ridley Scott who also embarrassed us with G.I. Jane in 1997.) Granted, the passage of a decade would see changes wrought in any character, but Starling's 'character' is missing in action in this movie, replaced by a stock sheaf of clichés and woman-empowering rhetoric. The film-makers have gone and done what the Highlander poofs did: compromised everything that came before, by everything that comes after. They even re-wrote the film ending in a vain attempt to draw Jodie out, but she made a correct decision in staying away, as the re-worked film ending is even stupider than the book's ending.Ray Liotta phoned it in. Maybe it was the fact that Lecter was ultimately going to slice open the top of his skull to eat his brain, which prompted Hair &amp; Makeup to neglect giving him a decent HAIRSTYLE for this movie.Scott Glenn - where are you?Thomas Harris, author of Hannibal, the followup book to Silence Of The Lambs, perpetrated the same sin that Michael Crichton committed in his Jurassic epoch - wrote the same book with a bigger bank account. Oh, he also put in some crazy unbalanced rubbish because.. well, because people were expecting him to put in some crazy unbalanced rubbish. Like the book, from which the movie-makers drew about 50% of their storyline, the film is. *predictably* gruesome. Evisceration? Coming right up. Biting people's faces off? - you betcha! Blood spurting from severed arteries as if from a fire hose? Oooo!, sign me up for that! Whereas Jonathan Demme's taut psycho-thriller, The Silence Of The Lambs, took us on a seat-gripping psychological foray into the masterfully manipulative mind of Hannibal Lecter, suddenly we end up in Friday The 13th: The Hannibal Years - a slasher film for the faux-cerebral.The Saviors of Hannibal: the eponymous anti-hero himself, the droll, dread Anthony Hopkins (Violent Ham No.1) and that delectable chameleon of cinematic cheesedom, Gary Oldman (Violent Ham No.2), playing Mason Verger, a disfigured previous victim of Hannibal's. Even with substandard directorial cohesion, weak dialog and Julianne Moore, some actors just can't be stultified: any words in the mouth of the artisan Oldman turn to sweet, sweet, insane love-juice, whilst Hopkins savors each syllable like his now-infamous Chianti, deploying weight and depth by merely inflecting his voice, as other actors need to achieve these same standards of craft by screaming, shooting or taking off their clothes; as some insecure directors need to achieve this same level of impact by spending $40 million on computer-generated effects which waste everyone's time and are irrelevant to the storyline, George.As in any Hollywood sequel trying to secure the widest, dumbest demographic, punches were pulled all over the place: The film completely ignored Mason Verger's penchant for drinking the tears of children that he taunted into weeping. Even Eric Cartman went further than Ridley Scott, licking the tears of misery from Scott Tenorman's face after he tricked him into eating his parents in a chili con-carnival.In the book, Lecter and Starling sit down to a luxurious supping on detective Krendler's brain, not simply one piece fed to Krendler. Though that was the best scene in the movie by far, it wasn't nearly enough to make me vomit more than once.Rather than regarding Hannibal Lecter as the psychopathic murdering swine that society would be apt to regard him as, the movie LEANS on the viewing audience to regard him as the 'hero' ('anti-hero' is merely a euphemism to assuage your consciences).At film's end (again, in a wayward departure from the book), Lecter cuts off his OWN hand rather than Starling's, to escape the 'arm' of the law (- couldn't... resist). So we are shown that, though Lecter is a calculating, psychopathic, pan-sexual, cannibalistic butcher, he still has a heart of gold when it comes to his unrequited lady love - well, ain't that precious?After all the hype surrounding the 'long-awaited' sequel - snicker - the throaty-voiced hype, as always, far outweighed the quality of the belated, bloated product.In a more concise interpretation of the above discourse: Eat me!(Movie Maniacs, read this unabridged review at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/Hannibal.html)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing above mediocre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a sad, multi-million-dollar extravaganza of Ridley Scott and his poorest exhibition of standard Hollywood fare.With a budget of $87 million, you would think ... or rather, hope ... that more could be done to further the masterpiece of the original, "Silence of the Lambs." Unfortunately, the subject of Starling's focus this time is first, a grossly disfigured surviving victim of Lecter's savagery, with only a secondary, almost off-handed half-glance of attention at Lecter himself. I found the climaxial scene featuring Ray Liota's...thoughts...to be among the most disgusting piece of cinema I've ever witnessed. What was the point of that? With "Silence of the Lambs," we were handed a creative, crafty, intellectual masterpiece of psychological theater. With "Hannibal," we are force-fed pure and absolute Hollywood Eye Candy without even the merest drop of water with which to wash it down.The psychological aspect is still present, but Julianne Moore's reprisal of Jodie Foster's original role as Clarice Starling did absolutely nothing for this production. I found her portrayal to be shallow and plastic as a Barbie doll which is not anatomically correct. The cinematography in this movie; the sets, the scenery itself, was far superior, but the plot was just gods-awful. Had Mr. Scott spared us the mind-expanding scene with Ray Liota, it may have been a much better finished product, but with the inclusion of that scene I found it about two steps above "Killer Clowns from Outer Space." It took away from the suspense and beauty of Lecter's sickness so much that it rendered the entire film as unenjoyable, to me.Without those three elements: Moore, the Liota scene, and the horrid little troll of a client; this would have been a top notch production. But the disgusting visuals, to me, robbed this work of its potential for beauty and elegance. If you loved the original for its psychological edge and eloquence of plot, then this movie will be a horrible disappointment. If you did not like it for the absence of gore, then this movie will make you a happy audience member. As a sequel, it is a mere shell of the original masterpiece. As a stand alone movie, it falls flat on its face. In comparison to the original, it is a sorry, slip-shod production which does not even rate the label of "sequel."I suggest "Red Dragon," and "Silence of the Lambs," even "Manhunter" (not one of my favorites), but do yourself a favor and skip this one.All in all, this movie rates somewhere around a 3.1/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how clever was Jodie Foster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the rightfully celebrated `Silence of the Lambs", a sequel was unavoidable. A most unfortunate matter. Director Ridley Scott took a huge box office and cinematic achievement, a fantastic idea and a promising cast, and than threw them all together, creating a long, boring, insignificant and pathetic film. After the first ten minutes the immanent question `Has Mr. Scott ever watched Silence of the Lambs?' pops to one's head, where it will stay for another 2 full hours. In `Hannibal', the dreadful Dr. Lecter has no character, no motivation (besides an over developed appetite) and a specially, no psychological persona or identity. This fact is so clear, that even a gifted actor such as Anthony Hopkins is (in lack of a better phrase)- ineffective.`Hannibal' is, therefore, a film about an unstable man who enjoys fried human brain with a glass of Chianti, and not a film about the essence of evil, about fears that were never faced and about the mysterious paths of human abnormality. In order to make the viewers to over look this lack of substance, Scott gives us the standard special effects, thus lowering his film to the same level as Jon Woo's `Face/off'. In the latter, the result was bearable, as Woo never pretended to do nothing but another summer time thriller. Also, his effects are much better.BAD BAD taste. At least we got `Red Dragon' to save the dignity of this trilogy.</fullReview>

Hannibal started out ok, but quickly turned into a really sick and twisted show of splatter and I quickly got bored with it.Julianne Moore did ok, and was a fair replacement for Foster, allthough I would rather have seen Foster in it (I now understand why she turned down the script).Hopkins did NOT do ok. Lecters magic was gone. I wasn't cought by his arrogance and mysticism like in SotL.Gare Oldman delievered the only really good performance in this movie.Ridley Scott (director) have succeeded in creating a below-average splattermovie with almost NO plot. All the sick splatterscenes were not nessesary (eating peoples brains?)...Maybe I'm getting old (just turned 31), but I find the art of assumption much more interesting...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott's best work after "The Duellists"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's most impressive film was his first regular movie "The Duellists". "Hannibal" is a close second in his body of work. (For those who thought "Gladiator" was great cinema, I would encourage them to see "Barabbas" made many decades ago without all the high tech special effects of "Gladiator".)The DVD tells us that Scott was asked to direct the film by producer Dino di Laurentiis after Jonathan Demme "passed" the offer to make the sequel to "Silence of the Lambs". Scott's "Hannibal" and Demme's "Silence of the Lambs" are as different as chalk and cheese.Though Demme won a clutch of Academy Awards, Scott's movie lifts up the content beyond a psychological cat and mouse caper with crazy murderous villains thrown in to one that adds philosophy, literature (Dante), and good music by Hans Zimmer.From the choice of music of Strauss and Bach to the special effects of the brain-eating scene, this is a work of maturity that is totally missing in Demme's film. Demme's film had concentrated on the thriller formula that limits the entertainment to the acting and story. Scott's film delves into the deeper elements of behaviour than the bizarre. Scott presents an unusual love story, where one would chop off one's hand for someone you like enough not to hurt. Scott's film present a fascinating subplot on Dante's vision of Judas' avarice. "Hannibal" offers pyschology (Starling looking back while running), philosophy (the Judas syndrome in human relationships, "you are not afraid of my face but you were afraid when I spoke of God"), and black comedy (hanging of Inspector Pazzi is initially met with laughter of tourists).While Demme presented a Hannibal that is warped, devious and cunning, Scott's Hannibal is more human than the "normal" good guys out to put him behind bars. It is unfortunate that Julianne Moore's Starling has to be compared with Jodie Foster's interpretation of the character. If their roles were switched, the outcome of both films would have been disastrous. Moore is presented as an attractive woman at several points of the movie, while Foster was seen as a cold professional with no interest in sex. Moore is more conscious of her womanhood (she puts "post-it" sticker to cover her breasts in the drawing sent by Hannibal").I do not know how much David Mamet contributed to the script of Hannibal--but the end-product has a script that is far superior to the Demme's film. I love films with scripts written by Mamet and this was no exception.The final scene on the plane was as interesting verbally as the end of "Silence of the lambs" was physically (Hannibal's walk in Africa).I recommend Hans Zimmer's interview on the DVD version. Zimmer is emerging as the best composer for cinema after Ennio Morricone. This film is probably Zimmer's best work after "The Thin Red Line".All in all, I consider "Hannibal" a more sophisticated work than "Silence of the lambs" with richer entertainment value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm so sick of critics picking on Hannibal, go watch Driving Miss Daisy if you can't handle this. Critics don't speak for the horror fans, they never have and they never will. Hannibal is great! Everyone bashes it because it's supposedly too gory. Well hey gang, it's a HORROR MOVIE! The special effects are excellent, the plot is great, it's scary, funny, well acted, and a very worthy sequel to Silence. This movie is chocked full of brain eatin', face peelin', pig attackin' FUNTIMES! Good horror movies are few and far between, and Hannibal is definitely one of them. If you like horror movies you're gonna love this, if you don't like horror, why the heck would you watch it? Grab something with the delightful Whoopie Goldberg instead, she has never eaten a brain in her films, nor endured a wild pig attack. Also recommend Return of the Living Dead, the Shining, Re-Animator, Hellraiser, Jaws, American Werewolf, Friday the 13th pts 1-4, the Romero trilogy, Aliens, the Evil Deads, Chainsaw, Nightmare on Elm Street, Howling, Creepshow, Halloween, all that good stuff. Hannibal is for horror fans, NOT legitimate film critics, which we are not! Leave the poor little feller alone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the scenery like most of the people praised about, but that's about it. What was so gory about? The original was more gory. It wasn't as strongly contented either. (A PG-13 would be pushing the envelope too much.) The original was dark with a thrilling atmosphere, this isn't dark neither with a thrilled atmosphere, just silly. People also called it violent, I've seen worst than this. Some of the acting was great, especially Hopkins' role as Hannibal (of course not paring up to his excellent role in The Silence of the Lambs). There is one other good thing to it, they didn't use the ol' "Silence of the Lambs 2" title. I was hoping for it to be decent, like what we always ask for when we are about to see a film, but instead, we got an over-hyped, typically merited for a sequel film. The script and plot are alright, but nothing special. The "I'd like to eat your wife for dinner" line was pretty good. The plot isn't so bad. There's been worst. And the plot is were Hannibal moves out of the country to continue his cannibalism that was delayed for about a decade. Don't buy it, trust me, it'll dissapoint you, just rent, no, just buy it's proceeder The Silence of the Lambs.</fullReview>

Maybe for love of the actors' previous films? Maybe even to justify Ridley Scott's half-hearted attempts with this piece?Hannibal does not live up to its predecessor. That's fine. But, it should still be able to stand on its own - unfortunately it falls, hard and flat.If this had been penned and attempted to be sold without the support of the success of the previous movie, we'd have a direct-to-video release or something that would never have made it onto the producer's desk to begin with.When looking for holes I go play golf or eat some swiss cheese. At the same time, I don't look for them in movies - nor do I look for cheese in movies.Juliane Moore has been an asset to many good films in my opinion. In this role she is able to hold her own, but that isn't what this movie called for. Unfortunately this production very much needed Jodie Foster. Like others, I also agree Ray Liotta's character was drab and poorly portrayed - I quite enjoyed him in other roles. Even Anthony Hopkins I found just rolling through this film without much care for the character he was playing. Time... Yes, 10 years have passed. But characters and the story should still be painted in such a way that the viewer "cares" - I didn't.Hannibal was truly one of the most disappointing movies of the year. With its limited production time and hurried editing, they really should have delayed the whole thing to fit into Foster's schedule and a few more drafts on the screenplay.The first deserves a prized position in anyone's movie collection. Hannibal deserves a complete pass. Sorry, but there are far too many brilliant movies being made to let this one take up valuable space in my collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hannibal", a truly revolting film, in which all manner of offal is extracted from living people, was less harshly rated in America than "Showgirls", which showed pubic hair and nipples. It's not just America. "Hannibal" failed at first to get an R rating in Australia, while the French film "Romance" (released around the same time) did not. There wasn't so much as a drop of blood in "Romance", but there WAS sex. I forget who was responsible for the quip: kiss a tit, and it's R; lop one off with a sword, and it's PG.Actually, the censors have an argument on their side. People under the age of fourteen or sixteen or whatever should not (so the argument goes) be exposed to EITHER sex and nudity OR violence and gore; but since audiences are more likely to WANT to see soft porn than degrading images of disembowelment, the latter does not require the same degree of vigilance. Market forces alone will limit the amount of disgusting violence in cinemas; government intervention is needed to reign in sex.You'd think so, wouldn't you? Yet the truth is precisely the opposite. Horrific films make far more money than erotic ones, and - this is almost impossible to believe - it's PARTICULARLY teenaged males who will pay to see them. Does this worry you? It should. About 40% of the footage in Hannibal is such as would put a properly-constituted person off his food, and there is clearly something wrong - perhaps only something mildly wrong, but something wrong nonetheless - with an individual who takes pleasure in seeing such things.What makes "Hannibal" particularly disgusting is that the human mutilation is unrelieved by humanity. There's no warmth or feeling for the characters, as there was in "Silence of the Lambs" (which by and large spared us the gruesome images to begin with). Nor is there anything else to distract us: suspense, comedy, a story, a puzzle, a point of view - and THAT'S what worries me. This time the spectators really DID come to be titillated by razor-to-the-face violence. What else was on offer? If you don't want to see entrails you'll find yourself looking at your watch. I'll grant that the original film probably generated some interest for its sequel, although anyone who'd seen the original would know that it spoke eloquently for itself and required no sequel; and that the images are what we've come to expect from Ridley Scott: pretty, in a soulless kind of way, and agreeably devoid of meaning and expression. -At least, I presume there are SOME people who find such emptiness agreeable.Pay no attention to the fact that one of the writers is David Mamet. What is it with this guy? Why are his scripts so good when he directs them himself ("The Spanish Prisoner", "The Winslow Boy") and so terrible when someone else does (this tripe, and "The Untouchables")? Is it yet another testament to the incompetence of Ridley Scott and Brian DePalma? Does Mamet keep his best work for himself? What's going on?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a cheap horror flick ? la Roger Corman, "Hannibal" is enjoyable and OK. But as a sequel to the incredible "Silence of the Lambs" it's just terrible.The style, elegance and terror one felt watching "Silence" is gone. This sequel is a parody of the Hannibal Lecter character and it's a shame that Anthony Hopkins actually enjoys destroying the mystery and suspense around the good doctor. Lecter becomes just another typical crazy mass murderer, although you can laugh at this one because he's so ridiculous.Julianne Moore is a credible Clarice and she does her best in filling Jodie Foster's shoes. Ridley Scott's direction is for once uninteresting and predictable. The script by Mamet and Zaillian has its good moments of comedy but becomes pretty boring and cliche-filled after a while.But what could one expect? A lousy book can only be turned into a mediocre movie. Facts of cinema. Guess my rating...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, maybe not the worst film ever, but VERY disappointing. The screenplay was poorly paced, Clarice was reduced to nothing more than a constant piece of expository dialogue, and I found myself consistently looking at my watch. Sir Hopkins does not appear to take the role seriously anymore by the end of the film, and it rubs off on the audience. Truly banal writing, and a severely unworthy followup to its predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This sequel is much more of a dark comedy, it's somewhat disappointing to see Lecter turned into a comic book character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you think Hannibal Lecter, the menu that usually comes to mind is liver, fava beans and a nice chianti. But after seeing Hannibal, the B-grade follow-up to 1991 Best Picture-winner, The Silence of the Lambs, the only foods that came to mind were ham and cheese, as in, "what hammy performances" and "what a cheesy film." Where Lambs was a disturbing, gritty, realistic exploration of the criminally insane mind, this sequel is much more of a dark comedy. Instead of despising Lecter, we're made to despise his victims. Lecter, while still menacing, has become like Godzilla; as he eats everything in sight, we actually root for him. The plot inches along as it little-by-little works-up to the movie's main showdown between Lecter, and Mason Verger (Gary Oldman under a ton of make-up), a millionaire pedophile who lost his face, and the use of his legs, in one of Lecter's attacks. Verger is truly difficult to look at, but that doesn't stop Scott from giving us lots of long, lingering close-ups.In the last act, it only gets worse -- nearly everything is played for sadistic laughs and, as Starling helps save Lecter from the diabolical revenge plans of Verger, his only surviving victim, the movie resembles nothing more than one of those odd-couple, buddy-action pictures: "She's a tough-but-vulnerable FBI Agent, he's a serial killer; together, they're fighting crime!" The main attraction, Anthony Hopkins, doesn't disappoint. He has a lot of fun with his unleashed Lecter. Julianne Moore does a passable job as Starling. Jodie Foster's absence is hardly noticed, mainly because the script doesn't give Agent Starling very much to do -- when she's not running around with a gun, she's just sitting in a Fox Mulder-ish basement office watching and listening to tapes of Lecter. Don't get me wrong, "Hannibal" is decent entertainment, especially for those who enjoy twisted humor. But after two serious films ("Hannibal" is actually the third in the series following "Lambs" and 1986's underrated "Manhunter"), it's somewhat disappointing to see Lecter turned into a comic book character.</fullReview>

A must see for every... adult. i never take ratings seriously, but this time they are totally right. For a teenager like I, the movie produced me a lot of emotions, that honestly, i could not handle in a first momentA Silence of the Lambs fan must be pleased with this sequel, that brings back Doctor Hannibal Lecter into action, a part of him that we saw rarely in the first movie. "Hannibal" shows us an almost unbeatable Lecter, in multiple situations. The plot just keep the viewer at the edge of his seat, as the next movement of Lecter is unpredictable. Lecter makes us suffer, laugh, cry, and enjoy, everything in a single movie.Without being perfect, "Hannibal" is an excellent movie, and a must see for everyone with the stomach to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen this at the cinema a couple of days ago, I am still stunned as to how AWFUL this film was - what were they thinking of??!! I have read one review which stated that this film was a "thriller with no thrills" which sums it up perfectly, gone is the suspense and the good vs evil battle of "The Silence of the Lambs" to be replaced with a tedious, annoying mess. Lecter has been turned into a camp joke, and not a funny one at that, while Julianne Moore as Starling seems to spend most of the movie talking through clenched teeth and giving a simpering look. I'm not sure who should be blamed for this - Thomas Harris for writing a very poor sequel or Ridley Scott for his laborious direction.My respect to Jodie Foster &amp; Jonathan Demme for having nothing to do with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the most unpleasant film I have seen for many years. It qualifies for the definition of pornography in that all the plot was simply a device to allow the violent gruesome titillating scenes. No character development occurred, no moral agenda was pursued (other than rudeness (or inadequate culture) should be savagely punished, and the florentine/religious backdrop was a spurious cover for visual violence.Many "video nasties" had more thought and development and, as we saw with Emmanuelle, a large budget and good cinematography do not stop a film lacking substance or avoid it being distasteful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note: this post contains a slight spoiler in the last paragraph - so please don't read if you haven't seen the movie yet.Breaking box office records in its first week of opening wasn't such a great feat when you consider no-one had seen a preview.Whilst deserving an Oscar for "best scenes of Florence", Hannibal sadly fails on almost every other level. Anthony Hopkins, playing the pschopathic killer a second time round, does what he can with a part that is badly written this time, whilst Julianne Moore as the FBI agent languishes limply in comparison to her 'Silence if the Lambs' predecessor, Jodie Foster.Director Ridley Scott has never been at his best with thrillers - psychological or otherwise. he is basically visual - whether in the futuristic settings of Blade Runner or Alien, or in the visual delights of Gladiator or even White Squall. Black Rain and Someone to Watch Over Me, his earlier crime thrillers, were quickly forgotten. The only thing that raises Hannibal above them is some professional Hollywood-style photography and the hype created by the earlier, much better, Silence of the Lambs.In 'Lambs' there was a nail-biting psychological tension between Hannibal Lector and agent Starling. Moore plays a far more laid back Starling and the dynamic is little more than a vague attraction between two brilliant minds. It is particularly sad to see two great actors fail to generate any chemistry - something not beyond Scott to give (as he did, for instance, in Thelma and Louise with Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis).The first two hours drag interminably as we watch the paceless detective work waiting for some sort of climax. When the climax comes, it at least keeps us awake, but hardly worth the wait. One scene, with the frying pan, was done better and more entertainingly in the low-budget, anti-establishment Troma movie, Terror Firmer. In Hannibal, we simply get a dose of predictable gore that probably isn't quite enough given that the movie's appeal is forced to rest on it. After making a few good movies, Ridley Scott put to rest any doubts one might have let linger whilst watching Gladiator - dollars now take the leading role and any pretense at artistic endeavour for our money's worth has barely taken a bit part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should not have watched this film! Well I did, otherwise, I wouldn't be able to judge it, of course, however I went at it with obviously the wrong perspective. I have grown to like films involving the scary Hannibal Lecter character with more emotional depth, not plainly gory scenes.Here we are: the *violence* is what disturbed me the most of this film, compared to the other two in the trilogy. I hate overt violence depicted in films as such violence causes real violence we live through in our daily lives. Scientific studies prove this, no need for me to ramble about this here. The Hannibal Lector trilogy had, in my humble opinion, the original aim of trying to grasp hold psychologically of the horrors a man like Hannibal Lecter has inside him. In this film, "Hannibal", all is perverted to mere flashy effects (e.g. the brain-eating scene: repugnant, absolutely repugnant), poor characterization of the persons (the disfigured Verger, why were there minutes and minutes and minutes we have to look at his horrible face??) and a very clear intention of making even more money, the easy way, this time.I am not alone, another commenter here has also expressed his disgust and I commend him for that. This film could have so much better. It ruined the trilogy. I threw my DVD away as soon as I had watched the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I finally came to like this one the best of the three in the series...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie some time back and had a few problems with it but didn't think they were worth addressing. I was content to just settle for the parts of the movie that appealed to me and overlook the rest.But now that I have seen The Forgotten (starring Julianne Moore, for which I will write a review as well), I think it it time for me to deal with my problems with the movie, especially my earlier disappointment with Julianne as Jodie Foster's replacement. I had tried after watching Hannibal to do some soul searching as to why I had a negative reaction to Julianne, or, better said, disappointment that Jodie didn't do the sequel. Well, OK. The truth be told, I was right the first time. I found Julianne a disappointment.... Then.I think the reason why those of us who were disappointed that Jodie Foster didn't return felt that way because she projected an air of vulnerability and a certain, well, humanness that Julianne's Clarice seemed to lack. Jodie's Clarice was a woman trying to fit in a man's world the best way she could, while Julianne's Clarice had the air of a hard-boiled feminist type who thought she could get ahead of (or at least hold her own with) her male counterparts with just raw ambition and bad attitude. But if that was the image that Julianne was trying to project, why the scene where she breaks out sobbing? A part I conveniently overlooked in my biased opinion of her as a person, by the way.Well, after seeing Julianne's performance in The Forgotten I am ready to give her the benefit of the doubt and attribute my negative impression of her portrayal of Clarice to bad writing, or worse--to someone in charge of production who may have had an agenda of some sort. I think Julianne did the best she could with what she was given. Actually, I have come to see that I should like Julianne's Clarice better than Jodie's... she lived in the real world of the FBI, and suffered accordingly.Before I get on with the strengths of Julianne's character and her real-life portrayal of what it can be like to work for the Bureau, one little point that struck me as gratuitous: Hannibal cutting off his own hand at the end. Sheesh. What a cheap shot. Well, I imagine that was not thought of as a problem since that was going to be the last of the Lecter appearances in film, chronologically speaking, even though it was shot before the final one, so they didn't have to deal with him being one-handed in the future sequel. (Or was that just a screw up and the final sequel had to therefore take place before the amputation? Maybe I am giving someone too much credit here.) But c'mon, give me a break. Would Hannibal handicap himself living as a fugitive the way he was going to be? I know he respected/had the hots for Clarice, but would he be capable of such selflessness even with her? And where did she hide those handcuffs in that little number she was wearing anyway? Hannibal was much too intelligent, too astute, too observant, to have overlooked a pair of handcuffs concealed on her person. And while he was an M.D. and could sew up bullet wounds, I have a hard time imagining he could have reattached his own hand with only one hand left with which to work. Like I said. Gratuitous. What a shame, since the movie had so much potential to live up to.OK, now that I got that out of my system, I want to get to the heart of the matter: Who made the more realistic FBI agent? Jodie's Clarice or Julianne's? Well, if you believe that honesty, integrity and high moral character ever rule in the agency and that ALL the bad guys are on the outside, then you believe in Jodie's fairyland agency world. But if you believe that there are agents who stand by their oath, who refuse to bend the rules beyond a certain point and love and respect the Constitution and are penalized for it career-wise, then you believe in Julianne's Clarice. You know that it is possible to do your job by the book and still get knifed in the back by your own superior, as did happen in the movie. In fact, Julianne's Clarice did her job so well, and took her oath so seriously, that she even begged Hannibal for the life of her dirty double-crossing boss. Now THAT is commitment to one's sworn duty, isn't it? And that is what inspired me about Julianne's Clarice and the movie itself. They both were honest and showed us what is present reality as well as what can be if we pursue greatness--even in the face of adversity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it wasn't for Hopkins' performance, this movie would have been one of the worst I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing about this movie that I can be absolutely sure of, than it must be that this is one of the most controversial movies I've ever seen. I don't think any other movie has filled so many viewers with such disgust and horror as "Hannibal" did. Personally I could cope with all the extreme and explicit violence and gore, but I'm convinced that many others had to make a quick run to the toilet when seeing it all.What shocked me more than all the gore was the overall quality of this sequel. I really wonder why Anthony Hopkins ever said yes to it. OK, his performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter is still stunning. I really love him as the graceful, distinguished gentleman who now lives in Florence, Italy, working as a curator for a museum. The average villain in other horror movies is a brainless idiot (sometimes literally), but not in this case. Hannibal Lecter loves fine art and culture, good food and wine,... and I can really appreciate that. But it's the rest of the cast. Which idiot decided that the best replacement for Jodie Foster would be Julianne Moore? I know Foster didn't want to participate in the sequel (smart girl), but I'm sure there must be another way to replace her. Why didn't they say Julianne Moore was her sister who wants to continue Clarice's work after she died in a tragic car accident? I know, that's not great either, but at least I wouldn't compare her to Foster then. But what bothers me even more is that Julianne Moore and Anthony Hopkins may well be the only two actors worth mentioning. All the others were, to put it nicely, rather unconvincing and superfluous.I can understand why the studio chose Ridley Scott as the director. OK, the man hasn't always made great movies (for instance G.I. Janes was pretty awful), but he sure has proved to be able to make really good movies as well (Let's think of Gladiator and Blackhawk Down). I've always given the man some credit, but with this movie he only proves that sometimes his bad taste takes it over from his talent. The same for the guy who wrote the script: David Mamet. He has talent, no doubt about that. He wrote the scenarios for movies like "The Untouchables", "Glengarry Glen Ross", "Wag the Dog", "Ronin"... all very good movies, but I really wonder why he had to add so much gore and such an awful first 45 minutes to the movie.All in all this movie really shouldn't have been made. "The Silence of the Lambs" is a modern classic, the kind of movie we don't get to see enough, but also the kind of movie that should be left alone. It's the kind of movie that needs no sequel or prequel (in my opinion no movie does, but TSOTL even less than others). If it wasn't for Hopkins' performance, I would have hated this movie like I haven't hated many other movies before. Now I give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He just isn't scary anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Silence Of The Lambs was a great film. I think that one of the reasons why was because they stuck so closely to the book. Anthony Hopkins deserved that Best Actor award as no other actor has. Jodie Foster had been a child actress in Disney films and had been one of the few child thespians to make a successful transition to adult roles. She is one of the few people to ever win TWO Best Actress Oscars for The Accused and Silence Of The Lambs. I don't think that there was ever an ending in a movie that left us hanging more then the one in SOTL. (I'm sorry to leave you Clarice, I'm having an old friend for dinner). Like millions of others, I waited for the sequel. Thomas Harris finally wrote it and Anthony Hopkins reprised his most famous role and Julianne Moore took over for Jody Foster as Clarice Starling. SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT!!!!!In the book I cannot say how disappointed I was by the ending that Thomas Harris wrote. After all, Lector is a despicable killer and I wanted him brought to justice for his horrible crimes. At the end, he and Clarice become lovers!!!WTF!!He killed those two innocent guards in SOTL and cut off one of their faces. Hannibal is an excellent film in so many ways, especially in the way they showed the beauty of Italy. Julianne Moore is a fine actress who does a good job of filling Jodie Foster's boots. She is different in her interpretation of the role, BUT lets remember that Starling is different now. She is no longer the young naive FBI agent, she is older and harder and Moore does a great job of showing that. Maybe the problem I have with this film is that Hannibal Lecter just isn't scary anymore. When Silence Of The Lambs was first released, there was the Jeffrey Dahmer case that made it so terribly real. Hopkins was terrifying and the creature of our worst nightmares. However, our society sort of glamorized him if you will. Hannibal Lector sort of became a cultural icon, a folk hero of sorts. In this film, we are so familiar with him and what he did that he just isn't scary anymore, and that takes a lot out of it. He is almost a campy "superhero" sort of icon. You laugh and feel nostalgia but, you don't feel afraid and that defuses a lot of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What idiot gives "Hannibal" one out of ten? That is probably the first thing everybody is thinking, when reading the title.But: There is a good explanation for that.***Minor spoilers ahead***1. Hannibal is no longer Hannibal. He is a totally changed character. And that is not, because he is free. This is bad acting, directing and writing.2. What happened to Clarice Starling? Is she brainwashed? When did it happen, that she forgot the feelings she had, while looking at the pictures of the bitten nurse?3. Worst directing in an A-movie. Why the hell must Ridley Scott (whom I admire for "Blade Runner" and "Alien") show the scene where Hannibal bites the nurse? It is in comparison much, much worse than the scene in "Silence of the lambs". Or the brain opening sequence... What was that for? You would not have to show it. Just for the effect. More is more. Wrong answer Mr. Scott. Take a close look at "Red Dragon". Brett Ratner did a brilliant job. His movie follows the high art of direction, which Jonathan Demme did in "Silence", what makes "Red Dragon" an ingenious prequel. Not as good as "Silence". But close behind.4. Stupid script: The whole revenge-plot is crap. And the worst they (Whoever. I blame them all.) did, was creating a hero out of Lecter. Do you remember the line: "He only kills people for revenge.", which Starling tells some coworker in order to defend(!) Lecter. (Excuse me, if it is not the correct English line, I only saw the movie in German) He is a killer for gods sake. Yes, he is charming, educated, intelligent, well dressed, polite, but a serial killer.There are so many other things I could cite, but I dislike "Hannibal" so much as I adore "The silence of the lambs".Of course I know that there are worse films than "Hannibal" but for an A-movie and the pretension, it gives to itself, I rate this 1/10 for being boring, stupid and worst made of all A-movies of all time. So please, do me a favour and don't give any money to Ridley Scott and Co.</fullReview>

Congratulations, Dino de Laurentiis! (la Strada, Army of darkness, Manhunter, Flash Gordon) He created a mania after the great legendary Manhunter and awardwinning Silence of the lambs and paid Anthony Hopkins ca. $20 million to return as Lecter. He released it simultaneously worldwide in order to prevent the nasty truth of seeing daylight. Also he contracted director Ridley Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson who very successfully collaborated on Gladiator a few months before. Dino trapped millions and millions of people and apparently got away with it too. He even got an academy award this year for outstanding performance over the last fifty years. He should have stayed with Federico Fellini and should have retired after Army of darkness, instead of trashing the movie industry with Hannibal and Breakdown and Conan. This unbelievably dumb movie even topped the dvd sales ranking! Get real. I'm not going to be sodomized again by Red Dragon on which Laurentiis, Scott and Mathieson collaborate once more, AND that for all sake is a REMAKE of Manhunter. I'd rather see Manhunter three times in a row than Hannibal once.rating: genuine 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent Film, On An Epic Level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal is probably the most underrated sequels I have ever seen. The reason being is that everyone expected to see a sequel, when all they really saw in this film was a movie that was totally unique and stand on its own. I think many of the people who saw this movie and didn't like it, were simply disappointed by their own shallow sense of expectation. This time round it is Hannibal's film, and that being said, of course it is going to be much darker than the first two films, which were essentially great crime thrillers. But Hannibal is more of a drama and character study into the mind of a man, a witty cultured, romantic, sophistocated man, who just happens to be a homicidal sociopath, and his obsession and love for a woman(Clarice) who admires and respects him, but can never return the love he feels for her. I was also surprised by the epic feel the movie carried with it as well, almost on a very grand scale. I guess you make an epic film with any any type of subject matter, you don't need it to take place over a long period of time, or have it be about some great historical leader, or even include a war or a famous sinking ship, as long as you have the right script(intriguing and original storyline), the right actors(the acting all around was first rate), and excellent directing(kudos to Ridley Scott who gives an epic feel to all his movies). This film is destined to be a classic.</fullReview>

The movie and the book are quite different, so I don't think one spoils the enjoyment of the other. The book does what the movie just can not--gently and completely explores the inner workings of Hannibal's mind. It is an amazing feat, one that Harris should certainly get more credit for producing.Also, The endings of the book versus the movie do present very different pictures of Clarice as a person--either of which I think is a valid interpretation of her character. Please read the book AND watch the movie and decide for yourself. It is really worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Return of High Gothic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Hannibal' seems to me to be a stately, elegant Gothic throwback. It is most certainly not very well understood, either in intention or execution. I thought Anthony Hopkins was superb. Some of his exchanges revealed the spark of humanity inside the amoral monster, the struggle to reconcile the unquenched passion squirming beneath Lecter's clinical facade. There were moments of great subtlety. 'Hannibal' is great for all the ways in which it confounds most people's expectations. And, yes, I agree that the score and cinematography are absolutely stunning. There is even a kind of twisted beauty in Mason Verger's ravaged form - wonderfully inhabited by the supremely versatile Gary Oldman. I wished there could have been some place in the movie for a reflection on the Mischa(Lecter's long-dead infant sister)-Clarice relationship, which to me added texture to Lecter's character and explained in part the underlying reasons for Lecter's haunted obsession with Starling. The film survives its absence, but it could have been an added bittersweet touch. All in all I am glad that 'Hannibal' deviates in style and tone from the much-admired 'Silence'. In many respects, while I respect what Demme did, I simply like Scott's film more. I like it for its relative moral ambiguity, and I am thankful that Scott retained several of the novel's more ghoulish scenarios (death by pig? - every great Gothic story needs its outlandishly fiendish set-piece) - though, of course, others could have been included (the disinterment of Starling's father, for example, would have been compelling had it been committed to screen). 'Hannibal' is a victory for anyone who has wanted to see intelligent, elegant macabre storytelling realised in cinema, and been so sorely disappointed for the general lack of it. Rather than decry this film, I would prefer that there would be more like it.Finally, speaking of things Gothic, I would compare the tone of this film to some of the best works of the masterful Edgar Allan Poe. In particular, I would suggest reading 'The Cask of Amontillado', a story of a man who plots an act of cold-blooded revenge against another who has ceaselessly slighted him. Its resolution is both disturbing and poetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal Lector, M.D. --HERO?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start with, Hannibal is an exceptional film. As for those who say, "Its no Silence of the Lambs", they are right. Silence of the Lambs was an Academy Award winning Best Picture. Can you name any other Best Pictures to garner a sequel? Didn't think so. No its not Silence, its different, its darker, its better.With that said, lets start with the good (Vices the bad, because the movie isn't perfect). Sir Anthony Hopkins is once again brilliant as Hannibal. Oscar worthy? Definatly. Julianne Moore is a more sexy, smarter Clarice, a nice change. (Though not to take away from Jodie Fosters excellent turn at her). The direction is amazing, Ridley Scott can take on Cannibals, Gladiators, Aliens, and Thelma &amp; Louise, and make them all destined classics.Now for the gripes. The novel Hannibal, by Thomas Harris is one of my favorite all time reads (I rank the novel right at the top along with almost anything by the great Dean Koontz). The ending in the movie was changed from the book. The DVD presents Hannibal with two quite different endings (both 100% different from the book). I almost hated the ending shown at cinemas. As we watch Hannibal we look at him as the hero. Maddenly Brilliant. He's better matched along side Indiana Jones than Charles Manson. Keeping that in mind we want Hannibal to, Firstly get the girl, secondly to escape plight with no injury, and thirdly we want those who want to hurt him to pay. The movie, following its climax, gives us this and more.....minus the first two points. (incidently the book gives us all three).So, for all you true Hannibal fans out there, I recommend the following: Read the novel first. Watch the film (at night with all lights out of course) and if you have the DVD, check out the alternative ending (Its gives us all points except the first...a little better).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I've seen in quite a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I anticipated a great movie, after I liked the first part a lot, but in the end I left the movie with 15 minutes of the film to go. I don't know if the film lost through the translation to German, but most of the dialogues were somewhere between ridiculous and unnecessary. Add a Clarice Starling that in my opinion was acted not all convincing, most of the anticipation had been replaced with disappointment after the introduction. By far the worst part of the film for me was the course of the story in the first 30 to 40 minutes. I don't want to spoil any details if you haven't seen it yet, but there is no logic in it all. I don't know what the author thought about the possibility of several coincidences, but they could have replaced the first part of the film with Starling and Hannibal meeting in the Australian Outback by chance without getting any more unrealistic. In the latter parts of the film they mix in some scenes of ultra extreme and very pointless violence without any meaning to the development of the characters or the story. I left the film early, but I'm sure my idea of the ending is very close to what really happened. Definitely a movie I would recommend NOT to watch...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like an unfinished script for a 3 month TV series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was poor by Ridley Scott's standards. In essence, this is a dumbed-down script adapted from a strange book that, on screen gives the audience an impression that a fantastic director has been rushed in to direct a film adapted from a book that has been based on a script written to encourage young people to make films. It's a sloppy screenplay, the film looks like it's been cut together from a 5-10 hour movie to fill approximately 2 hours of screen-time. It also looks like Scott has had to cut down scenes dramatically to give the film a sharper, more audience friendly look (like Gladiator- also directed by Scott). However, where Gladiator suited Scott's talents, Hannibal does not. Scott is better at visuals than he is at directing actors, Hopkins looks bored this time round, as does Oldman (barely noticeable after his make-up), as does Liotta - in a very Liotta role, and Moore is not really given any opportunity to act, she just merely looks dull, upset, and acts like a betrayed tough FBI agent as the screenplay prompts her to. The violence that appears randomly in this film gives the audience the impression that the film-makers want the audience to feel like they are watching violence in a manga cartoon rather than a film, it's pointless to take this film seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A worthless film. A useless film. No, I'm not talking about Vincent Gallo's recent comments at cannes about THE BROWN BUNNY, I'm talking about this piece of puke that I made the mistake of renting a couple weeks ago. I guess curiousity killed the cat. "How bad could it be?" I thought. I don't shy away from violence, and I'll say it for the record that HANNIBAL is actually less graphic than people have made it out to be. But the depths of stupidity and complete waste of cast and director is unforgivable. Why Anthony Hopkins would ever choose to do this film is beyond me. Didn't he say he was going to quit acting a few years ago because everything he's made thus far was a "piece of sh#@." Well, he can add one more to the top of that list. Jody, baby, you made the right decision in avoiding this trash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst theatrical movies of the year, if not all time. Anthony Hopkins belittles himself by even appearing in this joke. I can't believe David Mamet and Ridley Scott's name appear on this travesty. The best career move Jody Foster ever made was turning this one down. Julianne Moore was as emotionless throughout as a female Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was of course, his brilliant self. He is a crippled victim of Hannibal and the make-up is so good, I didn't know it was Gary until the final credits. but eaten by trained boars??? Give me a break! Rumor has it that he didn't want his name even mentioned in the credits. And frying and feeding his own brain to Ray Liotta...I was laughing at the absurdity, no make that stupidity of this flick at this point. I haven't seen so many people walk out of a movie since Who's That Girl.Pay someone else to go for you if you must, but miss this one AT ALL COST!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want my money back...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal must be the most God-awful movie I have seen in a long time. In fact, I want my money back. What a waste of time. No plot, minimal character development, questionable motives, poor dialogue, sub-standard acting. What else can I say? If you haven't seen it don't bother. I wouldn't even hire out the video and if you happen to come by it on TV... change the channel. The only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see whether the gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype (which quite frankly is why they added it). If you want to see some gug eating his own brain, then fast forward to that bit.What was the purpose of this movie? Its like someone just asked 'I wonder what Hannibal is up to these days' and we just went along for the ride. He is free in the beginning and he's free at the end. In between is a lot of self-indulgence on the part of Anthony Hopkins and the film makers. Julianne Moore tries valiantly to inject some life into her Clarice, but they gave her a sub-standard script and as far as I'm concerned she was set up to fail.In my opinion this is just a very very bad story in every sense of the word. The only reason it made so much money was because of the senseless violence they added, which at the end of the day leaves you more with a feeling of contempt than the horror you are supposed to feel.I give it a big fat RASPBERRY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Synopsis: the sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal is a big budget production that totally fails to deliver; not only is it not as clever as its predecessor, it is not even a splatter or suspense or horror movie, just a totally boring time waster. Do not be fooled by the media hype, and particularly the stories about people throwing up in cinema and being mentally scarred for the rest of their lifes because of the brain - eating scene: in the movie it just comes across as laughably bad SFX. Why so many people in this forum are claiming that H is "not all bad" and "worth watching on the big screen", etc., is beyond me; and it is not "so bad it's good" either, it is just plain boring. I normally respect other people's opinion, but in this case I have to say that they clearly can not tell **** from Shine - Ola. Maybe they have fallen prey to the media hype, maybe they have never seen a Ridley Scott movie before and were impressed by his excessive use of back lighting, smoke and the ubiquitous AC fans. H is totally devoid of suspense; instead we get endless scenes of Lecter swanning through an English - speaking Firenze, a totally unconvincing and uninvolving plot with more holes than a fishing net (after seeing H, I actually lay awake half of the night trying to find all the holes in the plot, and when I wrote them down I quickly filled 6 pages in small type before forcing myself to stop). Rather than wasting your time and money on seeing it on the big screen, I would advise you to wait until it comes on TV in a couple of years; and then to go to bed early.1 / 10.Below are a couple of extra bones I have to pick with Hannibal:- H _is_ the sequel to SOTL, despite what some people in this forum are claiming. And even though SOTL was a very tough act to follow, there are sequels which _are_ en par with their predecessors (SOTL itself was the sequel to Michael Mann's "Manhunter", based on Thomas Harris' "Red Dragon", and even though the first episode was a very enjoyable film, SOTL was even better; another example would be the Alien series initiated by H's director Ridley Scott -- so much for the theory of diminishing sequels). In any case, being a sequel is no excuse for a film being utter crap.- This movie has a renowned director, it is based on a novel by the same author as SOTL, the cast is strictly A - list, great cinematography, big budget, first - rate script writers, yadda, yadda, yadda, and the end result is simply a fart in the church. So what went wrong? I think a lot of the blame has to go to the film's producer, Dino DeLaurentiis. Here is my interpretation: DDL produced "Manhunter", which, despite of all its qualities, was a commercial flop. Disappointed, he gave the rights for the Hannibal Lecter character to Orion -- for free, allowing Jonathan Demme to make SOTL, and the rest is cinema history. DDL then had to wait for ten more years (he is now 81) until Thomas Harris finally came up with the sequel novel. I think at this point DDL had lost all interest in making a good movie and was desperate to finally get his slice of the the cake before he pops his cork.- Another aspect that I find thoroughly annoying about this flick is that it is being given so much undeserved hype in the media; I mean, it is boring, yet one of the highest - grossing productions ever, so there is no need to give it free publicity. And while most reviewers harp on about how Dantesque the scenes in Firenze are and why Jodie Foster did not participate, the simple fact that this movie is an utter, utter, UTTER flop goes unmentioned. But there is more: not only is Hannibal being hyped through the roof, it is also being used as a media agenda setter for a plethora of "documentaries" (usually the left - overs from similar productions in the wake of SOTL) about serial killers, cannibalism and profiling. However, not only does H not even pretend to be realistic; Lecter has also ceased to be a serial killer (he now only kills out of necessity, or to help Clarice Starling), profiling is not even mentioned (because we already know HL, so there is no need to create a profile) and there is also no cannibalism: Lecter feeds the drugged - up Paul Krendler his own brain, so that makes it (erm) unaware vivo - auto - cannibalism. Try making a documentary out of that.- Much has been said about the acting: mainly whether Julianne Moore can replace Jodie Foster, and Anthony Hopkins (who plays the lead Hannibal Lecter) is usually given a lot of praise. I think all of these discussions are moot. There are several of my favourite actors in this movie (namely Liotta, Oldman and Moore) but the script simply does not give them anything to work with. Same for Hopkins: there is no development in his character, and he is not being challenged in any way. And by the way, he plays nearly identical characters in all of his movies, only that in H he has to do the odd bit of murder and is getting paid the tidy sum of $ 11 Million to do it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not bad because it's gross (as most people say) - it's just plain boring!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter, now a free man, entices FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) back into one of his little games as he is pursued by Starling and the FBI. A few disgusting scenes, such as a brain-eating sequence and face-peeling flashback montage, were heavily criticized upon the film's release, but its main problem is that it just isn't on the same level as the superior (if overrated - "Se7en" is better) "Silence of the Lambs." I am not a huge fan of Jodie Foster but her absence here is vital to the film's failure - Julianne Moore is a fine actress and smart woman, but she somehow doesn't seem to be thinking as much as Foster, whose face always indicated that there was deep concentration going on inside her brain. Moore just reads her lines, fakes a pretty bad accent and manages to convince us that we're watching a different character. Actor changes in the Bond films really don't matter because Bond has no true chronology - there's no reason to believe that Brosnan is the same Bond as Connery since they live 40 years apart from each other in a different day and age, and it's never been really proven that they are the same as each other.Moore is supposed to be Foster which is a problem since she's nothing like her. Sir Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter isn't as likable in this film, or constrained and mysterious. There's no intrigue. Both Ray Liotta and Gary Oldman are given little to do in a very stereotypical film, which is surprisingly different from its predecessor, and surprisingly directed by Ridley Scott ("Alien") despite the fact that it...well...sucks.All in all a waste of time. "Red Dragon" (2002) is much better and far more respectable to the original than this boring mess (I had a hard time sitting through this, and not because of the gore).2/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Massive Disappointment that Fails to live up to Expectations,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal is a very mediocre movie with a poorly developed storyline, despite a fantastic cast. For the most part, I don't feel like a sequel to Silence of the Lambs was necessary or even wanted, that movie was perfect the way it is and it's not a story that needed any continuation or further development, that's exactly what this movie does and it never manages to captivate it's audiences like the first movie did. It seems to forget the main thing that made Lambs so good, and that is the intense dialogue and discussions between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, these talks offered real thrills, instead all of their dialogue is simply to provide development in the story and spoon feed the audience, this movie goes for visual horror instead of verbal, which is much less powerful and also simply disgusting, no one wanted to see the graphic images that are shown in this, the last twenty minutes go way too far, and particularly the last scene is just too much, it isn't frightening, it is repulsive. The cast is outstanding, Anthony Hopkins is still dazzling as Lecter, Julianne Moore was a terrific replacement as Starling and Gary Oldman is unrecogniseable as Mason Verger, it had a great set up and big talent behind it, and with Ridley Scott directing it seemed like a sure thing, but it all comes down to the script, and I think this film is poorly written, it tries too hard to be bigger and better than its predecessor and it wants to disturb its viewers too much. It certainly has its moments and the performances are great, but Hannibal is ultimately a huge disappointment that I could not recommend unless you want to see the whole film series. A vengeful victim puts s bounty on Hannibal Lecter, but things do not go according to plan. Best Performance: Julianne Moore Worst Performance: Ray Liotta</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad film, but quite a big let down after Silence of the Lambs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is actually going to aim to judge Hannibal as a film on its own merits, rather than comparing it constantly to Silence of the Lambs. On its own, Hannibal is not a bad film, in fact while heavily flawed it is a fair and better-than-average one. However, it is an example of a sequel/adaptation where it is very difficult not to compare because Silence of the Lambs is such a brilliant film and a masterpiece of its type, and there were things that that film excelled in that Hannibal came up short in in comparison.Starting with what is good with Hannibal, the film looks great. The Italian locations are gorgeous and give a real hauntingly dreamy and macabre atmosphere. The photography and editing are also very stylish, complete with an appropriately brooding colour palette. Hans Zimmer's score is powerful stuff and adds so much to the atmosphere of the film, some of it is creepy and enough to make the heart race. It is not the overly-loud, overly-bombastic, dirge-like and one-note kind of the music that can be heard in some of Zimmer's later film scores(i.e. Man of Steel).Ridley Scott directs with assurance and with superb technical skill, also succeeding in giving some of the Italian scenes a chillingly dark quality. For about two thirds of the film, the gore while a lot of it is handled reasonably tastefully and the action is very violent without being too gratuitous and is also pretty efficient. The script is uneven, but a good amount of it is intriguing and there is delicious black humour aplenty too, a lot of it coming from Lecter.Again, the cast are not consistent as such, but most are fine, with the top honours going to Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman. Hopkins reprises his most iconic(and one of his best) role and does an impeccable job, again he is funny and creepy if occasionally going overboard which occasionally hurts the tension. Oldman is unrecognisable here thanks to some truly astounding make-up(couldn't tell it was him a lot of the time) and gives an extraordinary performance, Verger is more interesting and dimensional in the book where it was much easier to feel sympathy for him, but Oldman's interpretation is truly loathsome while giving a touch of campiness and affecting dimension. Frankie Faison is charming, and Giancarlo Gianini is great as the film's most rootable character.Julianne Moore disappoints however, she had the daunting task of replacing Jodie Foster(big shoes to fill) and does bravely. What really worked against Moore was the rather flat way Starling is written here when the writers could have embraced the opportunity to expand the character from the much more interesting way she was written in The Silence of the Lambs. Moore is a very good actress, but was rather bland here. Ray Liotta also felt out of place, a little annoying and sometimes he didn't seem to know what he was doing.More disappointing was that what worked so phenomenally in Silence of the Lambs came up well short here in Hannibal. The story starts off very engagingly and compellingly, and the Italian scenes fare very favourably with some really entertaining bits, but once back in the United States gets somewhat convoluted as a result of trying to do too many things at once and too weird and dark for its own good, especially in the third act. It does fall short on suspense and mystery while the chilling psychological resonance that was one of Silence of the Lambs' high points is missing. If some of the scripting didn't get as heavy-handed as it tended to, if the pacing(which was at times very ponderous) was tighter, if there was more chemistry between Hopkins and Moore and if some of the second half was less ridiculous, this would have probably been at least halfway solved.The characters could have been better written and developed, the most interesting character is Verger(and there is much more to him in the book with his sister Margot) and Pazzi the most sympathetic, other than that Starling and Lecter's personalities and characters could have been expanded upon(something I think should have happened seeing as it's a sequel) and the rest of the characters are bland stereotypes. The ending is also a let-down, far too over-the-top and even those with strong stomachs when watching films might find themselves repulsed.Overall, problematic and vastly inferior follow-up, but has several good qualities and isn't that bad. Just that it should have been much more considering the potential, source material and talent. 5.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sequel to the critically acclaimed 1991 Academy-Award winning thriller "The Silence of the Lambs" is dark, strong and extremely scary and beautiful of our sophisticated killer and anti-hero: Dr. Hannibal Lector.The story brings us to Florence, where the beautiful city is perfect and in contrast with the admirable and evil Dr. Lector. It is the evil within the beauty in this film.The acting is stunning. Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins returns to play Dr. Hannibal Lecter for a second time and has a lot of screen time in this film. Oscar-nominee Julianne Moore fills the shoes of Clarice Starling from Jodie Foster, who won an Oscar for the part in "The Silence of the Lambs".Gary Oldman plays Mason Verger and he looks scary as HELL in this movie considering the make-up that he had to wear and he portrays the character more evilly than Hannibal in this film and he dies of a horrible death.The rest of the cast is out there and they make a lot more effort to put on their good performances. The music by Hans Zimmer and it is frightening, disturbing, violent and emotionally beautiful and I love his score for The Ring, Inception and THE DARK KNIGHT Trilogy and his other musical scores as well.The film is directed by Ridley Scott and his style is very amazing and spectacular as hell. The script is written by David Mamet &amp; Steve Zallilian and the dialogue in this film is just simply wonderful and I have not read the books by Thomas Harris, but the movie is more scarier.Overall, "Hannibal" is a successful sequel to "The Silence of the Lambs" and I have no problems with the violence and disturbing images in the film.This film is not for people who are sensitive about things in a movie including blood, violence and romance.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sequel to The Silence of the Lambs is more creepy than thrilling, and sometimes a little hokey. Moreover, while Moore is an exceptional actress, it just feels different with her playing Starling. Furthermore, the plot is not as sophisticated as SotL.That being said, the film is entertaining in more of a comedic-horror way. Hopkins is deliciously sinister, the supporting cast is very talented, and there is a classic scene involving the human brain that is worth adding to your pop-culture tool belt. If you're a fan of Hannibal the Cannibal, you should set aside time to see this flick once, although you shouldn't go into it with high expectations.For more reviews and a kick-ass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I were to choose between which Hannibal movie I'd rather see, one directed by Ridley Scott or Brett Ratner. I'd choose Ratner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean seriously. This movie is stupid... Okay, I might be a little bit too harsh. I did like a few things about this movie. The problems with this movie are within the writing and there are a few good things to say about this movie. So here is Hannibal.So the plot of this movie is that while Clarice Starling is in the FBI Hannibal Lecter is in Florence, Italy with an alias he has seemingly used since the events in Silence Of The Lambs and a detective begins to go on his trail. Clarice then starts to get mail from Lecter and the FBI is on his trail.So what is wrong with this movie? How about the fact that they included Clarice Starling in this movie as set-up for 20 minutes only to switch subjects to Hannibal in Florence. There is also the fact that only one person dies by a serial killer 54 minutes into the movie. I don't look for this stuff in these movies, but FIFTY-FOUR MINUTES.Then there is also the fact that in those 20 minutes there is a scene where Clarice stops a gang and kills a mother carrying a baby along with the baby. My complaint with this scene is aside from character development what purpose does it have to the story? It doesn't fit the story and nobody really mentions it.And I complained about this in both of my other Hannibal reviews and I'll do it here. ANTHONY HOPKINS IS ABOUT AS SUBTLE AS AN ATOMIC BOMB. Nowhere does his un-subtlety kill the character more than in this movie. He does a good job, but everything he says and does as Hannibal (a half hour of this is where he's supposed to be among the people blending in) screams "killer".Do I have anything else to complain about? Aside from little things like turning Hannibal into an anti-hero and the villain being a quadriplegic (I'm not making this up) then no there isn't much.Onto the positives. The actors are okay, the person playing Clarice is no Jodie Foster but she does do good with what she's been given. The only bad performance is Gary Oldman and that is because he is over the top.I also find the visual style in this movie good. Call it that or the locations for where they shot it. I just find something about these locations that are really good. However, good locations does not make a good movie.So if you want to see it then that is fine. I would recommend that instead you watch Red Dragon with Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes. This movie is okay if you don't judge a movie based on what I criticized it for. It is not as bad as some of the other movies I have seen (at least there was something good to say about this movie) but that is faint praise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I've seen "Hannibal" I was horrified with what I've just seen, felt cheated, hugely disappointed and the only thought on my head was that they've ruined everything, and it was the worst sequel ever given to a huge success. "The Silence of the Lambs" is the prime example of a well-built thriller, with horrific elements and it's crafty, intelligent, disturbing and fascinating, all in one package and to me seeing the following film with high hopes of getting something similar was the rule. It ended and I told everybody I knew of how awful I thought it was. But time heals everything or almost everything and I decided to give another ride and it turned out for the best. Again, it's still inferior to what Jonathan Demme's created with perfection."Hannibal" goes ten years later from the first film when Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore, replacing Jodie Foster) has the chance to rebuilt her career (after a disastrous task force operation that killed several people) when an old victim of Hannibal Lecter's atrocities claims to have new information on him. The victim is the millionaire Mason Verger (played by an unrecognizable and uncredited Gary Oldman) is the only survivor of Hannibal's ferocious attacks (a goof from the film, those who watched TSOTL know that he attacked a nurse who also survived but lost one eye and part of her face and the most incredible is that this film recreates such scene but they still keep mentioning that Verger is the only survivor) who uses Clarice as a bait to catch Lecter and he has a scary plan of revenge waiting to be used on the doctor. Parallel to those events we have an Italian inspector (Giancarlo Giannini) who is suspicious of a respectable figure that we audience know is Lecter, and the rest I'll leave it open to you.On the words of Jodie Foster, who turned down the offer of being in it, this movie isn't about saving lives which "Silence" was and that's why she was part of it. "Hannibal" is about showing the human being in its worst conditions by seeking blood, revenge, money, lust and with no chance of redemption. It's all about getting ahead of something, chasing what he or she wants and feel good about it. And once again Hannibal can play both bad guy and the good guy and more layers of his personality are shown when we see his attack on Verger. Crushing our senses with gory sequences but barely making us thrilled or deeply interested like Demme's film "Hannibal" has tiny bits of audacity, surprise and intelligence, sadly intertwined with the grotesque, appealing to mass audiences. The plot isn't great like it should have been considering the predecessor Oscar winning film and even with screenwriters like Steven Zaillian ("Schindler's List") and David Mamet ("The Untouchables) they couldn't make something decent of their credits. The dialogs aren't memorable or eloquent like Ted Tally's amazing script (he returned in the franchise with "Red Dragon", great!). Walks off with gripping scenes like the inspector's tragic fate; the pigeons forming Hannibal's face in the Piazza; the sequence in the shopping mall or Clarice and Lecter meeting in the final moments; and the notorious brain eating scene.Ridley Scott's name as director of this is a mere formality to gather good box-office, he's just here because Demme turned down the script given to him and because he was contracted for it, it's not an author's project and it's clearly visible that his direction here wasn't so great. It's too mechanical, contrived, faulty. As for acting Hopkins lost the touch a little but he's still the best Lecter that there is (Brian Cox in "Manhunter" is good while Gaspard Ulliel as the young Hannibal shows some variations of what the man used to be, quite decent); Moore is a good choice for the irreplaceable Foster, she worked hard, but we still can forget the unbeatable first film; Oldman is fully hidden behind the makeup, and the almost inaudible voice, but he's the best of the main cast playing an invalid character that holds plenty of power and evilness that is beyond belief for someone who is almost a living dead. But the best acting in the movie goes to Frankie Faison returning as Barney, revealing some secrets of his relation with Lecter. His scene is probably one of the greatest in the whole thing.With some missing parts on the puzzle and a losing' end that almost went nowhere "Hannibal" manages to be a good film more for its entertainment values than for its intellectual values. Sometimes it's all we need. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie Many Loved To Hate... Reasons For Which Are Beyond Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You need only say the name "Ridley Scott" and those enlightened enough to even know of such a person will automatically divert their trail of thought to 'Gladiator' (2000). I can't see why, but I would suspect that this is a common occurrence due to the appeal it had (I am yet to see such an 'appeal'), presented by Russell Crowe's limp-wristed war cries and his "flattering" Roman outfit. Ooh, yah, everyone does love an awesome sword fight, huh? Certainly, that Oscar win for 'Best Picture' will definitely oppose my argument, but that movie for me is the single dollop of mud flicked on the pristine whiteness that is the imagination of Mr. Scott. As a representative ambassador to the perpetual abundance of talent within Ridley, that film is most certainly not the one I would have presented. That position, I believe, belongs to 'Hannibal' (2001). Following the colossal success of its 1991 predecessor, 'The Silence Of The Lambs', adapted from Thomas Harris's best-selling 1988 novel, this sequel 'Hannibal' was vastly anticipated. Harris's successive novel of the same name was also hugely anticipated, and, upon release in June 1999, was met with a generally positive reception. The irrefutable delectability of the talents involved in its cinematic adaptation enticed audiences greatly. Even to the extent of an internationally record-breaking release in February 2001, garnering itself a Guinness World Record for "the highest box-office gross for a film with an over- 18 rating on an opening weekend." Its success seemed inevitable - Anthony Hopkins reprises one of his most celebrated roles, a screenplay adaptation by literary masters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian, John Mathieson's glorious cinematography encapsulates the fluently remarkable scenery of Florence in all its architectural perfection, and the delightful addition of director Ridley Scott and his eye for aesthetics. Of course, no-one will care about that. No-one has for ten years. And that is primarily the most infuriating concept; the gross philistinism that these critics have with their deprivation of this film's deserved reputation of meticulousness. To them, it's wiped clean off the Earth! Over-shadowed by 'Silence', of course. That's to be expected. But one can still acknowledge brilliance even if it does sit on the Second Place stand of the winners' podium. Director Ridley Scott can be credited for other, first-class, achievements, such as the captivatingly terrifying claustrophobia of 'Alien' (1979). But the immediate and unimaginative connection people make between his work and 'Gladiator' (2000) is just irritating. Of all of Scott's directional achievements, 'Hannibal' remains as his greatest. While its predecessor relied on Dr. Lecter's rather grotesque, skin- crawling interaction with FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster in Oscar-winning form) behind the safety glass of his colourless cell to get its chills from the audience, this sequel was more challenging. With Hannibal Lecter gloriously at liberty in Florence, he appears so much more suave, charming. Elegant. He becomes the man he showed himself to be when deprived of the company of his cannibalistic counterparts. It accurately follows the concept that he could be walking across the road from you and you'd be oblivious. Only one thing disturbs his freedom: corrupted police Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi. Blinded by money, he foolishly stalks Lecter after learning that his alias, "Dr. Fell", curator of the library of The Palazzo Capponi, is a façade. Giancarlo Giannini plays this character well, a character that can be personified as the manipulative snake in the Garden Of Eden.The screenplay for me is quite the highlight. The story of this all is rather basic, but enjoyable nonetheless. It may well be simplistic, and unarguably unrealistic at times, but it has a comfortable pace. It unravels itself gradually and lets the thing evolve nicely from there on. A story of corruption, revenge, hatred, and avarice, this film is such a wonderful experience to endure. Also, it is immersed deeply in revolting characters, their characteristics shown so clearly as to disallow any ambiguousness. What you see really is what you get. In addition to this, it is scattered with snide insults. From the spitting venom of the hideous Mason Verger (Gary Oldman, plastered in astounding, intricate facial make-up) to the sophisticated verbal assault of Lecter. Anthony Hopkins seizes this new opportunity of a "free Lecter" admirably, at last able to confront Clarice Starling outside of his cell. In the film's finale (a scene I treasure in my memory eternally), amidst the setting of the immaculately sartorial dining room, Hopkins has the greatest chance to really bite. The dialogue written, similar to the chastising Lecter gave Starling in 'Silence' ("A well scrubbed, hustling rube with a little taste."), is spiteful. Truly. So vindictive and obvious is it, rubbing the salt directly into the wound, so to speak, that it almost seems thoughtful. The finale is the best part of the movie, where Julianne Moore really shines as Starling. Having been rather blunt earlier in the film's pursuit/set-up, here she shows her immovable incorruptibility as Starling, showing no weakness despite the acid that is shot at her most personal features by Lecter: her pride as an Agent. The script really nails that, belittling her, unpicking every fibre of her capabilities in a stunning array of composure and patronising. This is an ending that I can only stand alongside 'The Usual Suspects' (1995) for levels of sheer awe and satisfaction. Granted, 'Hannibal' may not be as good as its predecessor 'Silence' in some ways, but don't forget about it. It redeems itself, I kid you not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave up on this after about an hour. I thought it was pretty awful, despite a supremely talented cast who do a good job with the roles provided them.First, I was left shaken by the opening credits -- faddishly black and white, shuddering images of pigeons, instant cuts, and all the rest of it. I'd be ashamed to have my name seen in such a context.Next, the opening scenes. A paralyzed man with a horribly disfigured face seen mostly in close up so that you won't miss a bit of puffy misplaced meat. As he explains, he was one of Lecter's perverted victims. After stringing him up by the wrists, Lecter cut chunks from his face and fed them to the dogs.Then, the scenes which introduce us to Special Agent Clarice Starling. A shoot out erupts, for which she is not responsible, and it gives director Ridley Scott a chance for half a dozen slow-motion deaths with blood all over the place and smashing cars and shots that last a good nanosecond and when the smoke clears, we get to see the resultant carnage. The fourteen-year-olds should enjoy all the action and gore.Finally, the scene in which the media make a cause celebre of the incident because one of the bad guys held an automatic in one hand and a baby in the other and was shot to death by Starling. Starling then in chewed out by her superiors at the FBI. A terribly hoary cliché by now.That's all in the first twenty minutes or so. The rest of the movie brings in Giancarlo Gianinni, doing very nicely as a policeman in Florence, and the return of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. As far as I could tell, it's a routine mystery with elements left over from the original.I've read the book, which was a neat divertimento with no particular literary value. I enjoyed it. I don't enjoy it when a film, lacking in originality, first gives me a headache then bores me.The original movie, from ten years earlier, was a fascinating and grisly piece of work. "The Silence of the Lambs" was quite well done for its type. This is what is known as a "sequel" and it stinks. It approaches in content the current crop of movies that belong to a new genre that can only be called "torture porn."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal is one of the few movie sequences that we like to adore. Of course it is no Silence of The Lambs, but the cast is equally awesome and the story is well developed.Dr. Hannibal Lecter hasn't changed a thing since Lambs. He's the same freak old man starving for human meat. Clarice Starling is well portrayed by the actress Julianne Moore, who makes it perfect believable to the same girl from lambs. Sadly we have to close our eyes to some situations, like Hannibal, a fat tub of lard in his sixties, is completely able to get away with murder in Veneza right after killing Insp. Pazzi.Despite that, the film is very satisfying and there are lots of tense scenes that sticks the spectator to the edge of his seat. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Producing a sequel to "The Silence Of the Lambs" was never going to be an easy task. But then again, delivering an outing as bland as this one is quite a remarkable achievement in itself. Veneered with some pictorial elegance, as was expected from director Scott, it tries in vain to compensate for a narrative as limp and ponderous as Mason Verger, Lecter's wheelchair-bound nemesis. In its discomfiture to adopt a right footing, the film is forced to duly provide a few gory moments shamelessly reducing the brilliant and dangerous psychiatrist we adored into a gastronomer boogeyman as scary as toasted bread. Ultimately, trapped by its inept plot line and having nowhere to go, the film concludes with an ending which must rank amongst the gravest mistakes in the history of cinema. Pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, who green-lighted this? I mean this is seriously completely unwatchable, from the lack of any kind of real plot to the stumbling, clumsy pacing to the atrocious ideas and "psychology" displayed here - there's just nothing good here at all. I mean, the main villain is a mangled homosexual cripple who will make you want to look at car crash victims as an alternative, and his ingenious plan is to feed Hannibal to a bunch of hungry, rabid hogs. That should be enough for you to skip this stinker by itself, but when you add in a horrible Ray Liotta and a climax that involves watching him stutter through his lines with his brain hanging out, it becomes a certifiable national disaster. This movie is just terrible, and I'd be willing to bet that the director and producer are the ones who really got lobotomized here. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well, i saw silence of the lambs since long time ago, and i thought it was a good film, but not MAGNIFICENT, as many labeled. The thing i disliked the most about it was the end, when Buffalo Bill could have easily killed agent Starling but in a classic Hollywood move something near to impossible happened and at the very last millisecond the good guys won. however I was quiet impressed with the central character in that movie, besides Sterling... yes, I mean by Dr. Hannibal Lecter.Many years passed and only until now I saw the "sequel" Hannibal. I am not sure why I waited so much to see it, when actually I've heard many people talk good about it but I didn't care about it. Only till now that the fourth part came out I decided to see all of the films again, starting with the Silence of the Lambs, which left me exactly the same impression as before, and now Hannibal, which actually was a little bit of a disappointment.The film goes more into the fiction realm, where Dr. Lecter transform from being a cannibal into a super-cannibal. He gets super powers, super strength, stealth movement. Some scenes remind me of the suspense you feel while watching Aliens; Scott's masterpiece.I must say the film is not completely bad, there are some good scenes, which fulfill their purpose of shocking the audience. Good examples are the hanging of judas, the pigs eating their dinner, and maybe a little bit too exaggerating the brainz scene. But these are mixed in between with too many Hollywood flaws, as the rambo scene at the beginning of the movie, the super-cannibal-man speed and stealth, and the worst: Agent Starling, waking up after days in comma, and walking down the stairs without taking off her high heels...Silence of the lambs was simpler, and that's what made it better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And of course, Sir Anthony Hopkins in title role. There is little more to ask for when you need suspense, drama, murder and egocentric villains. This is pure entertainment, and to be honest, I found it superior to "Silence of the Lambs".A bit less timid and more slick, but beautiful imagery of Florence, the Duomo, Dante Alighieri's monuments. Dr. Lecter is now a curator at Dante's museum, and intends to garner revenge on Inspector Pazzi (well-portrayed by Marcello Mastroianni). Also a nice cameo with Francesca Neri as his young, desirable wife. Julianne Moore is very good and underplays the role as Clarice Starling except in the scenes with Ray Liotta, as he is a detestable and contemptible bureaucrat.You will feel as if you are in Firenze, and will truly enjoy this prequel. I consider this a do not miss, and hope Mr. Hopkins will again reprise his role as the uncatchable and indomitable Dr. Hannibal Lecter, eminent surgeon and villain. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is this underrated so?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal is just as good as Silence of the Lambs, probably even better in my opinion. I can see why people might not like this movie as much but come on, it deserves way more than a 6.3 (AS OF 2/24/08). Hannibal was very different in this film, but also very similar. He has much more screen time, and in my opinion is much more sophisticated in this film. He is still played by the excellent Anthony Hopkins. Clarice Starling is thankfully played by Julianne Moore in this. The biggest creepy element about Lecter here is that hes not in the U.S. anymore but tapes and recordings of him still are and give a sort of eerie element. There are a lot of people after Lecter in this movie. The first and foremost is the FBI (mainly Clarice Starling). Also we have a rival of Lecter's, a victim who survived his torture named Mason Verger (Gary Oldman). We also have an agency in Italy after him, mainly Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini). Even Starling has a rival, Agent Paul Krendler(Ray Liotta). Everyone is well played and the kills are unique. Lecter really does a good job in this film of being evil yet being a protagonist. I recommend this to fans of the first who are open-minded enough to give this a chance. If you have an open mind you will enjoy this as much as if not more than the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love all of the first three 'Hannibal' films. They're all part of the same world, they all tell wonderfully creepy stories, and yet each one is very different from the others. I think this is because each director has his own take on the books of Thomas Harris, but they all respect the material and stay true to its unique character, and the character of Hannibal Lecter himself. This film, the second in the series, has been undeservedly brushed off and belittled as hopelessly inferior to the first. Granted, 'Silence of the Lambs' is a great movie and a hard act to follow; 'Hannibal,' though, is a rich, beautifully photographed film that I think surpasses the initial entry in many ways. Director Ridley Scott seems to instinctively understand what is called for, and he uses all his considerable directorial skills to bring the Harris book successfully to the screen. The shoot-out at the fish market which opens the film is a superior action scene, a stylistic tour de force which re-introduces us to Clarice Starling (now played by Julianne Moore). Scott especially relishes the scenes in Florence and at times the atmosphere, the operatic music, and again the gorgeous photography make you feel as if you're watching Italian cinema. The illusion is furthered by Giancarlo Gianinni, who is cast to perfection as the Italian police inspector Pazzi. He has a superbly expressive face, sad eyes and a fascinating air of world-weariness. He sounds like he's speaking Italian even though it's English. Mason Verger (an unrecognizable Gary Oldman) is a disfigured victim of Lecter's who now seeks a particularly loathsome kind of revenge. Oldman has twisted fun with the horrific Verger; there are times when you want to cringe and laugh at the same time. In fact, that is one of 'Hannibal's' best qualities, the black humor that permeates the film and keeps it from becoming oppressively morbid. A throwaway line early in the film is typical- Starling tells an assistant she's received a letter from the Guinness Book congratulating her on being the female FBI agent to have shot and killed the most people. And of course at the center of all this is Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal. Both actor and character seem very much at home in the Florence setting, and the scenes between Hopkins and Gianinni are wonderful to watch. Eventually, Hannibal returns to America and is captured by Verger's men, or does he allow himself to be captured? One is never quite certain with Hannibal. Verger's plan backfires and he meets a gruesome end, which sets up the film's true climax and the scene which has earned it its greatest notoriety. Paul Krendler is a Justice Department lawyer and Starling's real nemesis in the film. Portrayed with sleazy venom by Ray Liotta, Krendler might best be described as the misogynist from hell. His only interest in Starling appears to be how he can get her in bed. He is also taking a large bribe from Verger to trap Lecter. When that plot fails, and Starling is rescued and sedated by Lecter, Krendler becomes a hostage to the doctor; there is then the unforgettable scene where the top of Krendler's head is removed and part of his brain stir-fried with shallots. Ever the gracious host, Lecter obligingly feeds some of it to Krendler himself. The actual ending of the film left many in the audience puzzled, as it seemed out-of-character for Hannibal (just as the ending in the book seemed uncharacteristic for Starling, to Jodie Foster at least) and for some, that is the film's fatal flaw. But it is more an epilogue than anything; it doesn't substantially detract from the mesmerizing masterpiece that has preceded it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST Hannibal Lecter film....just give it a chance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is just amazing....as a Ridley Scott fan Im biased yes but I never ever get bored of watching this film and since buying the Special Edition a few years ago I watch it at least every 6 months without fail.To those who don't like it I suggest this....get the book, read it. Then watch the film straight after. OK, the film does chop bits out of the book (as just about any book-to-film does) but the film 'captures' the book brilliantly and then you've got Ridley Scott's amazing visuals. After watching the film all I could think about was going to Florence - I still haven't made it for one reason or another but I will one day! And its not just the film, the great acting, the amazing visuals...one of the best parts of this film is the....sound! The soundtrack is fantastic - I have to admit that without the soundtrack it would not be half as good as it is...If you like the film go and buy the CD - and if you can, try and track down the 2xcd set (Ive got both of course!) Most people think that Silence... is the better film. You wont catch me watching Silence.. again and again and again. Not that its a bad film...its a very good film but it doesn't stand up to Hannibal! On watching it again the other day I would say that Hannibal does start slowly...indeed Ridley Scott on his commentary even admits that he ummed and ahhed about the shootout at the start but couldn't think of a way round it. Give it a chance though and Hannibal will suck you in...and you'll be obsessed as I am about the film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is the relationship between sadistic cannibal serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lector and dedicated FBI agent, Clarice Starling. The change in actresses from Oscar Winner Jodi Foster to Oscar Nominee Julianne Moore was not that difficult to accept. Julianne is fantastic and more attractive than Foster in this role. She controls her accent. I loved the scenes at Union Station in Washington D.C. It is really one of my favorite train stations in the world surpassing Grand Central and Penn in New York. The casting is first rate with Gary Oldman as the vengeful Mason Verger who attempts to revenge Dr. Hannibal Lector in his own sadistic way. Well, I won't spoil anything by revealing any more but I love Ray Liotta in this film. The scenes in Florence, Italy were quite breathtaking but I wish Hannibal would face his fate rather than get away with his vicious crimes. Hannibal is a fictional character and Sir Anthony Hopkins as him does justice to the role. Nobody else could play Hannibal the Cannibal in quite the same fashion as Hopkins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***ONLY A LITTLE SPOILER***The sequel to 'Silence of the Lambs' is a dark, strong, creepy and beautiful story of the sophisticated killer and anti-hero Hannibal Lecter. The story brings us to Florence, where the beautiful city is in perfect contrast with the evil and admirable Lecter. It is the evil within the beauty. This also comes to sight in Lecter's 'Romeo &amp; Juliet'-like relationship with Clarice Starling. Towards the end he asks her: "Would ever say 'stop'? If you love me, you'd stop?"; the beauty within the evil.The acting is superb, though Julianne Moore sometimes struggles with Jodie Foster's unfair legacy as Clarice Starling. Moore is not as strong on screen as Foster was, but what does it matter? The story is NOT about Clarice Starling, but about Hannibal Lecter; Clarice got her story told in 'Silence of the Lambs', and with 'Hannibal' we get a story about this fascination figure Hannibal Lecter. 'The Starling Story, part II' was never the intention (or the need). Hopkins is simply great! With such calmness, stylish taste of art, and sophisticated evil, he brings more life to the character than any actor could ever do. Gary Oldman is a great choice as the vengeful Mason Verger. He does a great job, and the character is even more evil than Hannibal himself.The score done by Hans Zimmer is frightening and disturbing when it has to be. But it's also beyond beautiful; it's filled with such emotion and sensibility, which will leave you almost crying, especially during the opera sequence ? Again, the beauty against the beast.My only small catch with the film is a special scene towards the end. It is so sickening and gross but completes the terrifying picturing of Hannibal the Cannibal.'Hannibal' is a beautiful horror film. It should not be watched by the ones, who expect graphic violence, blood and more blood. Sure it has it scenes, but it's not the main focus.'Hannibal' is within no doubt one of the most underrated films of all time. It has great acting, a strong story, beautiful locations, emotionally strong moments, a beautiful score and the indirectly manipulation psychological horror, which we all love the sophisticated cannibal for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hannibal" dares to take audiences where "Silence of the Lambs" feared to tread. The avidly awaited sequel to the 1991 suspense thriller differs vastly from its impressive predecessor. Indeed, Oscar-winning actor Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as the diabolical Dr. Lecter, a notorious serial killer with a taste for human flesh, and Hopkins reincarnates Lecter in another frightening but flawless performance. Julianne ("Boogie Nights") Moore easily erases any memory of Jodie Foster as serious, straightforward West Virginia country girl FBI Agent Clarice Starling. British "Gladiator" director Ridley Scott replaces American director Jonathan ("Beloved") Demme. Whereas Demme took a 'just the facts' approach, Scott turns it into "Blade Runner 2." David ("The Untouchables") Mamet and Steve ("Schindler's List") Zaillian substitute for "Lambs" writer Ted Tally. Chiefly, "Hannibal" details everything "Lambs" left to your imagination. While "Lambs" curbed its violence, "Hannibal" indulges in a gore fest of special effects. Yes, Dr. Lecter cooks a bad guy's brain and feeds it to him. Yes, carnivorous 500-pound wild boar hogs with elephantine tusks crunch on human heads. The only thing "Hannibal" shuns is the depraved sexual perversions of "Lambs." "Hannibal" picks up ten years after "Lambs." The criminally insane Dr. Lecter has been masquerading around Florence, Italy, under a false name. Confidently, he awaits his appointment as curator of the renowned Palazzo Capponi museum. Cut to Clarice. She has become the FBI equivalent of "Dirty Harry." The Guinness Book of World Records lists her as the Fed with the highest number of confirmed kills. Unfortunately, she takes lots of flak when a drug bust backfires on her. Clarice had to gun down a crack-dealing mother wearing a baby strapped to her chest. The FBI hangs her out to dry. Meanwhile, Lecter's only surviving victim, disfigured pedophile millionaire Mason Verger (Gary Oldman of "True Romance") plots to kidnap Hannibal and feed him to the hogs. Verger learns the best way to lure Hannibal out is to put Clarice in jeopardy. Nevertheless, Hannibal suspects Verger and proves difficult to fool. Similar to "Gladiator," "Hannibal" follows its anti-hero full circle back from Italy to Washington. Not only does he stylishly disembowel a greedy informant who sought to cash in on Verger's $3-million dollar reward for Lecter, but also he comes to Clarice's rescue after the badguys shoot her."Hannibal" is a wide-open, anything goes, no-holds-barred chiller. Clarice performed the heroics in "Lambs," but Lecter handles those duties in "Hannibal." Remember how Arnold Schwarzenegger's cold-blooded "Terminator" got converted into a good guy in "T-2?" Basically, Scott and his scribes turn Hannibal into the good guy. Specifically, Hannibal's violence redeems instead of condemns him. Everybody he Cuisinartes deserves his or her demise. Arguably, "Hannibal" glorifies one of society's worst fiends, but no actual serial killer on record compares with the witty, urbane Dr. Lecter. Although it lacks the suspenseful tenacity of "Lambs," "Hannibal" emerges as an enthralling sequel that the squeamish should shun until prime-time television tones it down. Ultimately, "Hannibal" qualifies more as an art house horror spectacle than an inspired but straightforward FBI thriller like "Lambs."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal must've changed his diet to cheese, because this was one "cheesey" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always fun to learn the "tastes" of the world's most famous cannibal, and "Hannibal" elaborates nicely. But putting the subject of suspense (the man himself) full stage makes in unsuspensful and boring. Not to mention the story is just plain awful.Blood, guts, brains, and more brains made it hard to see the beauty of the movie. Not to mention half the time the film was too dark to see what the h*ll was going on.The Story: Hannibal Lecter has been found residing in Florence Italy, ten years after his escape from custody. Out to get him is his old acquaintence Clarice Starling and his only surviving victim Mason Verger. Verger wants revenge on the Good Doctor and plans to do so by capturing him and feeding him to a group of boars (WTF???). But not if Starling finds him firstIssues: **The editing was horrible**, the scenes were either dragged out too long or not dragged out long enough. **No suspense** I forgot 20 min in that it was a movie about a killer. **Cheesey Story** Man eating boars? Get real, surely someone like Verger could've plotted a more realistic means of revenge. **Gore** The gore was pointless and excessive **Other** Hannibal Lecter is in a major European city, with his picture floating around all over the internet. But no one recognizes him? ~.^Okay with: ***European setting*** Florence is such a beautiful cityGood slasher flick, not a good thriller</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Farce.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I wasn't a huge fan of SOTL, I could see how it was a good movie. It worked in a lot of ways.Hannibal took what worked and put it through the garbage disposal.See, many people will bash this movie for being gory. It isn't the gore itself that is reprehensible about the movie, its how it is used. The gore just seems to be used as tacked-on shock factor. Just in case we couldn't tell someone is dying a horrible death, the movie is so kind to give even those who are barely aware what is going on in the film to understand that someone is dying.And that's a big problem with the movie. It's as if it is written for someone with no sense of nuance. It's like how a 3 year old thinks a toy has COMPLETELY disappeared and has no idea where it has gone if you hide it under a blanket.It is completely amazing to me how Hopkins expects Hannibal to work. Apparently Lector is this mind-stunningly intelligent psychiatrist who just happens to be a tragic hero who eats his victims. I mean, he's not so bad. He only kills bad people! But don't hold back on our account, Mr. Hopkins. I don't think he could have made it more obvious that he is an over-the-top creepshow. I mean, who cares if it is believable at all that someone this obviously disturbed was a successful psychiatrist who seduces his victims to mutilate themselves or worse? Then again, you weren't exactly nuanced in SOTL either.Now to Julianne Moore. I don't know if the whole setup of the movie was just some strange masturbatory fantasy about Lector and Clarice falling in love, but it sure seemed to come out that way. In SOTL, Clarice developed from someone who feared Lector, to someone who could stay strong in the face of mental manipulation and stand her ground against Lector- and even genuinely grow as a person. Now, apparently, Clarice has been reduced to some doe-faced damsel in distress. This isn't Julianne's fault. However, I'm fairly certain she was cast for the role just because of the blank look on her face in the whole movie.Gary Oldman plays a man who you're supposed to think is repulsively disfigured. Though, you learn quickly, that his mind is just as warped. This is another "Let's make it obvious to the viewer" tidbit thrown in. The movie has no room for an intelligent viewer. There ARE ways of showing that someone could be mentally scarred without cheesily implying that from the way he looks. Then again, if the movie didn't show this man as heavily scarred, you might just believe that Hannibal isn't some kind of superhero in disguise. I mean, every superhero needs a nemesis that in some way the superhero is responsible for, right? You see, his character is the lone person to sully the otherwise superhuman record that Hannibal had of not leaving people alive.Oldman's character and the way Hopkins plays Lector go hand-in-hand, in some disturbed way. I mean, only the most mentally deficient patient could possibly be taken in by someone as so obviously deranged as Lector (or at least how Hopkins plays him).The rest of the characters are rounded out in typical fashion in that they are merely props to try to convince us that, in the grand scheme of things, this psychiatrist cannibal isn't such a bad guy after all! However, since all movie viewers are obviously stupid, let's make sure we remind them every now and then that Lector is an evil person- by showing him disembowel someone or making some lame pun about how he's going to devour someone. There's only one actor that could make these one-liners more obvious. Arnold.If you're looking for a 21st century adaptation of B grade 80's horror kitsch, watch this movie. If you're looking for a movie that is a more intelligent thriller in comparison to Hannibal, watch Deuce Bigalo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Is this Clarice? Why, hello Clarice" Hannibal Lecter's comeback in 2001's Hannibal was a real treat (if you know what I mean) when I saw it in theaters back at the time of it's release, and remains so till this very day. The return of this iconic and creepy 1990's character really gives me the shivers every time I think of the final dinner sequence (tip: approach this with an empty stomach), or whenever I dwell into the twisted relationship between the two lead characters.If anything, this feature is more of a character study that dives into the sick souls of two individuals gone wrong than anything else. Watch this one with caution, and with an open mind; but beware: Mostly like the original Academy Award winning The Silence of the Lambs, the violence in this movie is very graphic, and not for the fainted hearted. Its there for a purpose when all is said and done, so I would recommend the ride despite the guts and gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part three in the Hannibal Lecter series(beautifully stylistic but less substance)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hannibal" is directed by Ridley Scott.it takes place after the events in the Silence of the Lambs.Here we have the great Anthony Hopkins reprising his Role as Hannibal Lecter,serial killer and one time psychiatrist.and Jullianne Moore takes over as FBI agent Clarice Starling.in this movie Hannibal comes out of hiding to bait Clarice.The movie starts in Florence Italy,where Lecter has been living in disguise as an art scholar.however events force him back to America.once there, he of course baits agent Starling and he himself becomes the focus of revenge by a former patient who barley escaped being killed by Lecter.Gary Oldman plays the former patient.the movie is very stylish with beautiful photography and scenery,especially in Italy.we are shown the old buildings with their impressive architecture.the movie is very well lit,giving the perfect atmosphere.the movie on the whole focuses more on style than substance and the fact that Lecter comes out of hiding takes away the air of mystery the film could have had.so,the film while beautiful to look at,seems hollow at times and incomplete.it can also be slow and overly dramatic at times,lacking the pace of the previous incarnations.Lecter is also played more for camp in this film,with his witty one liners.he just doesn't seem as frightening here .The acting is very good in the movie,especially by Moore,who inhabits the character of Starling with the same affectations mannerisms and accent as her predecessor,Jodi Foster.despite it's failings,i still enjoyed the movie- more so than"silence"but less so than "RedDragon Or "Manhunter".i would have to give this movie an 8/10,for its beautiful style and the acting of Jullianne Moore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ridley Scott's screening is obviously a great movie. Hannibal Lecter is a legendary character. I was fascinated about the relationship between Dr. Lecter and Agent Starling. It's strange how a killer, who eats his victims with such a serene face can have this attraction to Starling. Clarice Starling has a dilemma: on one hand she is the incorruptible FBI agent, who wants her job back - which means capturing Hannibal, and on the other hand she absolutely worships Dr. Lecter's intelligence: 'Tell me, Clarice, would you ever tell me "Stop" ? If you loved me.... "stop" ?' 'Not in a thousand years' Professional killers like Hannibal Lecter shall never be in FBI's hands, and Clarice Starling shall always love H.L. I would really enjoy a "Silence of the Lambs 3", of course with Anthony Hopkins starring Hannibal Lecter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie in its own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most enjoyable aspect of this movie is that, contrary to what the working title might suggest, it does not try to be Silence of the Lambs 2, and anyone who went into the theater with that expectation was probably either pleasantly surprised (as I was) or sorely disappointed.Lecter and Starling are the only characters (aside from Barney) who have returned from the previous movie, but they have changed quite a bit in the meantime. Starling has become a much tougher, hardened agent than in her previous appearance as an FBI trainee, while Lecter has managed to blend seamlessly into Florentian culture, and even to gain respect among scholars as a Renaissance historian. Moreover, the script does not feel forced (thanks to Thomas Harris' brilliant writing), but rather flows naturally as a continuation of Lecter's actions from before his incarceration.In addition, the storyline shows significant contrast at times to its predecessor. One of the overarching themes in "Silence of the Lambs" was that appearance often hides true nature. This is exemplified by Lecter's dissection of Starling's psyche (the 'accent she tried so hard to shed'), by Catherine Martin, the anonymous victim who turned out to be the daughter of a US Senator, and especially by the nature of Buffalo Bill and the motives for his crimes.However, "Hannibal" develops the exact opposite idea, that one should not necessarily assume appearances to be deceiving. There are a plethora of vivid examples: Mason Verger, who despite his ghastly appearance seems quite jovial for most of the movie before revealing his monstrous side; Pazzi, the descendant of an infamous Florentine traitor, who himself engages in treachery to his own demise; Paul, the arrogant asshole who turns out to be just as backstabbing as you expected him to be. This theme culminates at the end of the movie with Hannibal once again mocking Clarice's devotion to the FBI, and her vain attempt to prove her own incorruptibility by serving those who are themselves corrupt. "All you would need for that, Clarice, is a mirror." While popular opinion often dictates that the sequel to a great movie detracts from the mystique of the original, "Hannibal" is in my opinion an ideal model for how to make such a sequel. There is continuity without redundancy, and while "Silence of the Lambs" is a clear-cut thriller, its framework is used to construct an elaborate and comprehensive moral tale which becomes a great movie in its own right.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though it isn't as good as 'The Silence of the Lambs', 'Hannibal' is definitely worth watching. Anthony Hopkins was absolutely brilliant in this movie, though i say he could have been crazier (he acted insane in the first film, why not the second?). And although it sucked that Jodie Foster wasn't Clarice this time around, the role of Clarice was still very good-- Clarice was very innocent, which was a good thing. She SHOULD appear vulnerable when she is chasing down Hannibal Lecter. He's a very scary guy.Silence of the Lambs had more suspense, but if you're into more violence, i'd say this film is better. it could have been more of a psychological thriller, but personally, i like more blood and gore :)</fullReview>

The Mason, who cut his face skin himself, has a hatred for Hannibal Lecter as he raises many pigs which can eat human. But, his ready of revenge was nothing after all;his revenge got failed because of Starling's disturbance. And when you see this movie, you'll see the most disgusting scene in Lecter series. That is the scene that people eat human's brain. It's not horrible, but just disgusting movie. Hannibal never shows us his genius about crime and only his cruelty shows brightness.I've never seen the Lecter series as its novel. If I get those, I want to see them. But, I don't want to be disappointed again. As I mentioned, the movie just make the original worse. Am I only one who feel it seems his genius madness became as a psycho person?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Return of the Cannibal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good sequels are truly hard to find in cinemas these days, when one considers the loads of commercial garbage we are bombarded with in an attempt to destroy our sense of taste or intelligence. One might have had such a fear to the follow-up to the immensely successful "The Silence of the Lambs", the third film in motion picture history to pick up "the big five" at the Academy Awards. The primary fear for continuing the morbid misadventures of Anthony Hopkins' twisted genius would be that the memory of the original would be horribly tainted by a turgid sequel. Fortunately enough, producers were wise enough to avoid such a fate by rounding up an incredibly talented supporting cast and crew to make Hopkins' reprisal of his signature role a true success. The involvement of a director of such high caliber as Ridley Scott likely helped the success of the project immeasurably. A sequel after having not directed the first might seem an odd career choice for the man just academy award nominated for directing "Gladiator", but Scott's entire career is full of such eclectic choices, and one must be very thankful he did, for he adds a truly unique touch filled with endless class to Hannibal. Scott's impeccable eye for impressive architecture continues on from "Gladiator", as the scenes filled in Italy are incredibly beautiful, almost magical in a way, shot in slow motion with a hazy camera lens, as if in a dream. The entire film has a very detached, almost clinical touch, making it much more realistic as a crime drama rather than the typical adrenaline coursing Hollywood thriller, which makes it all the more unsettling. Yet through the suspense, tension and moments of genuine horror and disgust, there's an ever continuing sense of perverse beauty, as if Hannibal's sordid lifestyle is almost a work of gruesome art in a way. Scott deserves multitudes of praise for tying together such an impeccably crafted and truly beautiful, however morbid, film. It goes without saying that Hopkins is nothing less than astounding reprising his signature role as the cannibalistic Lector, both immeasurably creepy and captivating in turn. But despite the title, the film is not centered entirely around him -Hopkins' back up players, when given their moments to shine, also show their immense talent. Julianne Moore is wonderful, almost luminous as Clarice Starling, the FBI agent who captured Hannibal's perverse interest so entirely. Whether she is a better or worse Starling than Jodie Foster is a matter of opinion, but Moore certainly cements her status as an immensely talented and incredibly beautiful actress regardless. There's also a rather poignant surprise by the presence of a completely unrecognizable Gary Oldman, uncredited as a horribly disfigured past victim of Lector's who survived his attack. It is a testament to Oldman's incredible ability to disappear seamlessly into his characters when I, being a tremendous fan of Oldman's work had no idea he was in the movie until the end credits. In fact, Oldman would have walked away with the show were it not for Hopkins, but both appalls and impresses in order, managing to make a truly frightening yet fascinating performance shine through the disgusting prosthetics, making a truly horrifying portrait of a twisted old man. Ray Liotta is also a strong presence as a sarcastic co-worker of Starling's, and especially shines in his final scene, without giving anything away, those who have seen will understand. Hannibal is one of those rare sequels which measures up in quality to its predecessor. Scott has crafted a truly horrifying, yet perversely beautiful and endlessly fascinating film, with Hopkins reprising his immortal role backed by a truly talented troupe of actors to tremendous effect. Fans of "The Silence of the Lambs" or just a good criminal drama should certainly seek out Hannibal - he may be horrifying, yet one can't look away.-9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The follow up to the masterpiece, The Silence of the Lambs Anthony Hopkins is back as the psychotic and criminally insane yet brilliant Dr. Hannibal Lecter and as this will come as no surprise, he was terrific and terrifying with his portrayal of one of the most shocking villains ever brought to screen. Changes were made however with the director and leading lady. Veteran Ridley Scott replaced Johnathan Demme as director and Julianne Moore replaced Jodie Foster. Jodie Foster not reprising her Oscar winning role surprised and actually disappointed me a bit considering she's my favourite actress but I have to say Julianne Moore was really good in her place as the FBI agent. Its wrong to compare as to who was better because Moore played the part on a different behalf. Ridley Scott is an excellent director and really gave the film a different look, still that same thrill and erieness but with the European scenery and the chilling score from Hans Zimmer, Scott truly made this film a different colour in comparison to the Silence. The one real problem with this film is the separation between Hopkins and Moore throughout a majority of the film unlike in the Silence in which Foster engaged in conversations with Hopkins that made the film so memorable. Its very different in this film. So don't compare it to the Silence. It's still a terrific feature with a thrilling story that kept me glued to my seat until the shocking ending.</fullReview>

I can be one of the few who sees his movies as beautiful paintings, made with a lot of heart but with a lot of brain, and its' difficult to find that tin a modern director (because Ridley had been all his life a modern director, even when he did The duelists).Taking the original novel and making it all his, I advise that both are completely different (yeah, they have the main characters, but the comparisons end there).

The acting and cat and mouse game between Hannibal and Agent Starling is done very well in both movies. Julianne Moore holds her in taking over from Jody Foster and of course Anthony Hopkins is simply, Anthony Hopkins. He's one of the great actors of our generation.However, when I saw this movie I was simply disgusted and disturbed. Without going into further details, the beginning of the movie with the crack mom getting killed with her baby attached to her really disturbed me and it went down hill from there. It's really unfortunate the impression this movie made on me that has great actors, well played roles, and wonderful scenery.The only thing that stands out in this movie, to me anyway, is the disgusting and disturbing nature of many of the scenes on this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a lover of the Thomas Harris books and of silence of the lambs i expected Hannibal to be mediocre by comparison, albeit ridley scott in the directorial role. But as much as SOTL did for plot and intensity, Hannibal did in much greater measure explore the world of Dr. Lecter.To see what would be widely regarded as a revolting and grotesque human being capable of unmeasurable acts of cruelty and violence, out in the free world where he displays decorum and humility is about as frightening an experience as i could imagine. And moreover Ridley Scott captures this magnificently. Many Hollywood directors have tried and failed to capture the feel and dramatic cultural differences between ancient and contemporary cities and the way this film is shot is purely breathtaking.But back to point and its short. Brett Ratner and Red Dragon sees Dr. Lecter back in prison, and as he was in SOTL a background character, although rather significant, but the whole feel of the film once again loses the dichotomy of lecters abhorrent nature and attempts to capture the more important characters and plot lines like SOLT, the tooth fairy, Clarice and originally buffalo bill. Interesting characters yes, but Hannibal is the only work to really show the depth of Dr. Lecters nature and the film was accurately entitled so.Love the story and suspense of Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon was in my opinion another SOTL but with different storyline and Hannibal was by far the most intriguing and terrifying look at how any person cannot be judged by their appearance or mannerism. Beautiful and scary work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you do not like horror movies (as some reviewers clearly do not) you will probably will not like this movie. On the other hand, even fans of the original Silence of the Lambs who can stomach gore will enjoy this well done sequel.Although, naturally, with a different director there are changes in the approach to the characters and the presentation of the action in this movie. However, there are no compromises. Anthony Hopkins returns in his most memorable role as Hannibal Lechter. The screenplay benefits from the addition of accomplished writers David Mamet and Steven Zaillian. Julianne Moore is a stunningly perfect replacement for Jodi Foster's lead character and real Italian actors are used for the scenes shot in Florence. Viewers also will not forget the performances of Gary Oldman and Ray Liotta playing characters unlike any of their previous roles. Basically, you have to admire someone on this list, making this film definitely one to watch.That being said, you should remember that this picture gets an R-rating because of the violence. Director Scott displays his penchant for slow, quiet moments punctuated by sudden, shocking gore. Instead of the eerie suspense of the original Silence of the Lambs, we get a more brutal sense of evil. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Dr. Lechter represents an unstoppable force of impending doom, his demented will, uncanny ability to survive and to elude, and his dangerously clever intellect drives the story from place to place, putting all the other characters in peril.If you can stomach the blood and guts shock, you will appreciate the subtle horrific presentation. However, if you want something more in the way of a classic, Psycho-styled, suspense film, stick with the original Silence of the Lambs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HANNIBAL, in my opinion, is an excellent film which is sometimes very gory. I thought that Clarice (Julianne Moore) looked very beautiful in all the dressy clothing she wore, especially the fancy, black dress she had on during the time she was at Dr. Lecter's (Anthony Hopkins) house. Also, I really liked the boars that were in the barn towards the end of the movie. They looked really adorable, even though they're wild animals. In addition, if you ask me, the Pazzis (Giancarlo Giannini and Francesca Neri) looked very nice in the attire they wore to the opera. When Clarice yelled, "F.B.I," at the fish market, which is where she confronted Evelda (Hazelle Goodman), I really felt good and smiled. I must say that I absolutely loved the fish market scene! Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that Hopkins and Moore deserve a Golden Globe for their smashing performances as a psychotic serial killer and a disgraced F.B.I. agent. Now, in conclusion, to all you Anthony Hopkins or Julianne Moore fans that have not seen this excellent film which is sometimes very gory, I highly recommend it! You're in for a good time as well as some pure chills and thrills, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, turn down the lights, lock all your doors and windows, kick back with a friend, and bon appetit!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's exactly what the infamous Hannibal ate in the sequel to the classic Silence of the lambs.Jodi Foster was very wise to not reprise her role.Ugh.......this has to be one of the most disappointing sequels ever!Clearly the author wrote this novel for the pure fact to make money.What I like to say to the writer and those in Hollywood responsible for making such a horrible movie is, "I want my money back".Again, keep in mind, I love "Red Dragon" &amp; "The Silence of the Lambs".This however should be called, "Hannacrap", because that's exactly what I saw.I guess there's two plus hours of my life that I'll never get back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of the Lecter Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many circles today, it's almost heresy to dare to claim that Ridley Scott's HANNIBAL is anything but inferior to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I've always disagreed. Ridley Scott's HANNIBAL is by far the most unique and grand of the Lecter films, becoming a superb work that combines Grand Guignol with a beauty-and-the-beast storyline.What this film truly is is a very different kind of sequel, like BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN was to FRANKENSTEIN. This film has no intention of really imitating its predecessor - but rather to go in a whole other direction and along the way chuckle a bit at the success of its predecessor.Ridley Scott's direction is at the top of his game here. The movie flows with an elegance that is perfectly fitting the central figure, Hannibal, and his lifestyle. The cinematography is beautiful, and Hans Zimmer's score is lyric and gripping.Anthony Hopkins returns to recreate the role he made famous in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and is, of course, phenomenal. In this film we see Hannibal Lecter's romantic side, and by all means, Hopkins does a terrific job with it. This is really Hannibal's film all the way, and he's not afraid to take center stage.Julianne Moore, playing the role of Clarice Starling, does a serviceable job. Her performance is by no means as epic as Jodie Foster, but in a sense, Moore seems more fitting to the film than Foster would have. The rest of the cast is fairly well rounded out with veteran actors, and all do a fine job.The single best moment in the film is Clarice and Lecter's last moment together - both are at their best. It's extremely romantic, and it works. It really works. While the ending author Thomas Harris gave it would have been more darkly appropriate, the ending Scott has given it definitely doesn't disappoint and nicely resolves on the theme of "impossible romance" that he sought to give the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clarice Starling has become infamous in the FBI for having such a high death rate to her name. After a blood bath shot out on a drugs raid to arrest Evelda Drumgo, she is being reviewed on whether she is a worthy member of the FBI. She receives some reprise when she is asked to look back into the Hannibal Lecter case when new information is brought forward. The only surviving victim of Hannibal, Mason Verger, has information on Lecter, hoping that it will re-open the case. Verger is horribly disfigured in the face when Lecter had Verger cut his own face off.Meanwhile in Florence, we are brought into the new life of Hanibal Lecter. He is in a temporary job at the Capponi Library, when the former employee has mysteriously disappeared. On the case of the disappeared man is Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi. Rinaldo becomes suspicious of this new man, and after doing a background check finds that he is Hannibal Lecter. What interest Rinaldo more is the reward on Lecter's head, three million dollars. The reward is set up by Mason Verger. Verger has made its sole purpose to find Lecter and make him suffer a slow, painfully gruesome death. When Lecter finds that he has been found out, he returns back to America to face Verger and return to his one love; Clarice.Much like many sequels, this doesn't reach the pure brilliance of 'The Silence of the Lambs', but its still a very strong movie. Like the 'Silence', this is a hunt film, this time the hunt is for Lecter after he escaped from custody in 'Silence'. Hannibal is very different as well, as its not a thriller. Instead we have a dark twisted love story. Lecter is in essence an art socialite, he does live the elegant life, and this is seen through the elegantly stylish cinematography; 'silence' was about Clarice, Hannibal is about Hannibal Lecter, its his world we are seeing. Ridley Scott's direction is just perfect and he is suited very well for this movie; as Demme didn't reprise this sequel of his film.The violence of Hannibal, while it is confronting, isn't always in your face. We never see a lot of violence, but when we do it does come right at you. many have said this only relies on the violence, but it actually organically emerges from the story. We do open on a bloody shot out on the drug raid, but then no violence for ages. There isn't much blood till the end with the infamous 'brain sequence'. The story focuses mainly on the relationship of Lecter and Starling. They are like soul mates, but can never be together; its a love-hate relationship. Anthony Hopkins easily slips back into the role he made so famous. He still has that unnerving feel every time he talks, though doesn't quite have the confronting dialog he was given in 'Silence'. Julianne Moore fills in as Clarice very convincing, she has the same strength that Jodie Foster brought to Clarice in 'Silence'; though i was a shame Foster didn't reprise her role, but Moore takes the role and runs with it. Gary Oldman is chilling as the disfigured Verger, the first time you see his face is abit shocking, but its draw back is you don't get chills from it when you see his face again; so it does lose that impact.Though this isn't as thrilling as 'The Silence of the Lambs', this is still a great film. Its moody and dark, but is a great drama about the strange relationship between Starling and Lecter. A great watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noble intentions, so-so sequel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ten years later, Anthony Hopkins made his return as Hannibal Lecter.Unfortunately, director Jonathan Demme and actress Jodie Foster(Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs)weren't with him.Ridley Scott and Julianne Moore are not bad replacements, but you just can't help missing the original guys.Scott takes the script, and makes the movie his own:while Lambs was an unsettling, almost gore-free psychological thriller, the sequel is among the goriest things made recently, not to mention it's got a sick sense of humor, particularly during the last ten minutes.An impressive thing is the Italian location:since I live in Italy myself, I really enjoyed the scenes set in Florence, one of the most beautiful cities in the entire nation.As for the acting, there are actually only three performances that really deserve a viewing:Gary Oldman(uncredited) is amusing as Mason Verger, Lecter's only surviving victim, as is Giancarlo Giannini as Rinaldo Pazzi(his surname is the plural form of "pazzo", which means "crazy"), the cop who uncovers Hannibal's true identity in Florence.But the winner is of course Sir Anthony himself, making the fascinating cannibal a character that justifies a ten-year hiatus.The movie belongs to him, and he makes sure you'll be satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An atmospheric masterpiece - highly underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've rarely seen a motion picture with such a dense atmosphere - let alone such a magnificent score. Lightyears away from it's predecessor SotL. Graphic - yes - but at the same time so subtly spine-thrilling. Lector's fascinating, ambiguous character is perfectly acted out by Hopkins - something not accomplished in SotL (though it being a good movie). There we see almost only the repugnant side of Hannibal caged in his supermax cell - with much of the plot centering around other (too obvious)things. Here we get an excellent character study of Lector. Lector is fascinating...the viewer almost succumbs to this gentleness and sophistication.Though there are flaws in the acting - especially Ray Liotta (Superb in Good Fellas) is a let-down, whereas Moore is excellent (glad, Foster turned down the role) - the brilliantly shot, beautiful pictures and the score are creating such a stunning atmosphere that I consider those and other flaws negligible.Easily the best part of the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pathetic. A Disgrace. ***SPOILERS***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw "The Silence of the Lambs", I was awestruck. I thought, "Hey! I need now need to see "Hannibal." I. Was. Wrong.Unfortunately, Jodie Foster didn't reclaim her Oscar(registered trademark)- winning role as Agent Clarice Starling. That role went to Julianne Moore. Moore's acting is not what one would expect from such a great actress. Her acting is mediocre at best. She tries at Jodie Foster's West Virginian accent too hard, and turns out sounding more like a man than she does a woman.Anthony Hopkins, one of the few things I liked about this movie, returns as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the cannibalistic psychologist . His acting is much better than Moore's, but nothing compared to his Oscar(registered trademark)-winning role as Dr. Lecter in "The Silence of the Lambs." Hopkins delivers a better performance than most actors do in mediocre films. Ray Liotta plays the part of Paul Krenzler. I don't understand why he's in this film. Sure, he puts pressure on Starling about Lecters whereabouts, but that's about all he does besides *SPOILER* eating his own brains. The plot... pointless. It really never develops, except for the final meeting between Clarice and Dr. Lecter. That is the only thing in this movie that develops. Anything else, never goes anywhere. Clarice's meeting's with Lecter's victim end abruptly, and you suddenly see him *SPOILER* right before he dies.Director Ridley Scott. Great director. Bad movie. The "Aliens" and "Gladiator" director didn't execute high quality work, as he should have. Other than that, that's the only negative thing about Scott's directing.*SPOILER* As entertaining as the "Brains for Dinner" scene was, it was highly stupid. Also unrealistic. Another unrealistic part of this movies was *SPOILER* the man-eating pigs. I raised pigs. They're stupid. They can't learn anything besides how to eat, sleep, and wallow in the mud."Red Dragon", "The Silence of the Lambs" and "Hannibal" prequel, is much better than the "Hannibal" *censored* I saw. But "The Silence of the Lambs is still much better, though. To sum it all up, I did not enjoy "Hannibal", and want the two hour I spent watching it back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One more proof that THERE SHOULD BE NO SEQUELS TO GREAT MOVIES</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hannibal", the sequel to the legendary "The Silence of the Lambs" takes place some years later. We have again Clarice Starling here (this time played by Julianne Moore), who this time is searching the world for the escaped and highly dangerous Hannibal Lector. She is not the only one. Mason Verger, once being a patient and one could say admirer of Lector (and became obsessed of him), wants to take revenge for something Lector did to him years ago (which I will and can not reveal here).Although I really admired "The Silence of the Lambs" for its quality and shocking moments, I tried not to have too great expectations and watched "Hannibal" for its sake and partly for the cast (Anthony Hopkins, Ray Liotta and of course Gary Oldman) which leaves almost no wishes left. "Almost" because of Julianne Moore, but I'll come back to it later. Unfortunately I have to admit that "Hannibal" not only cannot compare to the quality of "The Silence of Lambs", it does not even reach the level of "average". There are one or two surprising moments in the plot but are they neither scary nor shocking, they sometimes just look ridiculous and most of the time simply disgusting. Although "Hannibal" has some kind of a plot (people hunting Lector for personal reasons) until the last second you just don't get where it's aiming at. There is no structure: No preface, no climax, no resolution. People just get together, part, meet another people and now and then somebody dies. The hunt for Lector leads to nowhere and I'd say there is only one highlight, when Lector and Clarice meet at last and he does something very strange but beautiful to her (we're not talking about sex here). But all in one the movie is boring, celebrates the cleverness of Lector and the (emotional) coolness of Clarice from time to time but besides this doesn't even make the effort to deal closer with the four protagonists, their feelings etc. That's why the viewer cannot feel with them and after ? hour asks himself: "Why should I worry about them at all if even the script doesn't?" Talking of the script: Either it was not finished or changed so often by so many people that one just doesn't understand what they wanted to say with this film.A word about the cast: Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as usual and just a pleasure to watch. Ray Liotta has an unthankful role as Starling's boss for reasons I cannot reveal but if you see the movie you'll understand why. Gary Oldman shines through this movie mess and even manages to save his ridiculous role (with his unique sarcasm) and give it some dignity, but actually has an unthankful role too. The worst thing about "Hannibal" is Julianne Moore. Jodie Foster wasn't a very emotional Clarice, too, but still she is a great actress, she could add a dignity, sex-appeal and a fragility to this role that Moore can only dream of. Julianne Moore is just a bad actress, lacking class, charisma and basically everything that is human ? I think if you replaced her by a dummy and let someone speak her lines from off screen you wouldn't notice a difference. And by miscasting the leading role the producers basically ruined the movie from the beginning on. All in one I'd say that the only reason (or three reasons) why you should see this movie are its male protagonists, but "Hannibal" is just boring and dumb and cannot in any way be compared to "The Silence of the Lambs". In fact, this sequel is an insult to the first film. So if you want to see a good movie, do yourself a favour and watch the original instead. Don't, just don't ever do a sequel to a great movie ? when will Hollywood learn that at last???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Renaissance Dracula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the most first, great misunderstood film of the decade. So many enter expecting the original and thus come out disappointed. Why? First, they ignore that this is a Ridley Scott movie. Second, this plays on a different atmosphere much like how Cameron changed tones when he made 'ALIENS'. This is your only spoiler warning...The first time, Demme played off of the "perverted America" concept. Hannibal ran as a parallel to the activities going on "on the outside". He serves as Foster's personal "think tank". The two existed in a parallel world where we experienced with them, not just watching them. Hence Demme's method of actors looking AT the camera and not PAST the camera--which is what Scott--enthralled us.With 'Hannibal', the entire experience is reversed. Scott runs a narrative parallel to reality while the actors exploit this differently. Giannini expertly occupies the Scott's space like Curry in 'Legend'. Moore acts, knowing what we should hear (pity about the accent). Oldman knows where our perspective comes from. He is a pro at living in these parallel universes having done so in 'JFK', 'Rosencrantz', and 'Professional'. Unfortunately, Hopkins misunderstands Scott with his holier-than-thou attitude. Thus he's only half as effective this time. That's puzzling since he dealt with Attenborough in 'Bridge Too Far' under a similar style of direction.Further than that, 'Hannibal' is also concerned about extravagant taste. Renaissance art is rife with such romanticized depravity that the film incorporates that aspect. Hence the Florentine setting.Some things to be said about Scott's crew--the 'Gladiator' ensemble. Zimmer isn't as rich this time and Mathieson hasn't proved himself a worthy follow-up to Scott's prior photographers. Fortunately, after the poor sound editing that was 'Gladiator', we get the 'Face/Off' team to make up for it and Pietro understands Scott all the way.There is some self-reference involving Scott as Hannibal, the manipulator, but not as daring as 'Legend'. There it was Mia being the subtle manipulator. Yes, there's also the play-within-play and film-within-film. Big deal.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing "Silence" and with also turning into a Gary Oldman, I was geared up hoping this film would be brilliant.Sadly it wasnt. I think the problem was that the script changes sevral elements of Lector's and Starling's characters and also Jodie Foster turned it down. If she had done the role instead of Julianne Moore, I truley believe this film may have rated better. Rather than the chills you recieve from "Silence", "Hannibal" is more grotesque, showing more blood, guts and violence.Sir Anthony Hopkins did not seem as menacing in this film as he was in "Silence". Gary Oldman is chilling and completely unrecognisable as Mason Verger and like all his roles, Oldman plays this one perfectly. The only time you recognise him is in a flashback and even that is blurry!Overall, I give it a 5/10!H xxxxx</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*I absolutely loved this gripping, intense classic. It actually ruined other movies for me, as I have not before or since enjoyed a film this much. Ridley Scott, needless to say, is a genius. The cast is amazing(Gary Oldman is my favorite actor)Anthony Hopkins, Ray Liotta Julianne Moore, et al. I am tired of hearing people whine about Foster, as she would neither make or break any movie in my view.Julianne was not only an acceptable replacement, she was better in the role of Starling. Also, for those of you who p**s and moan about the gore, consider this: The title character is a cannibal, and the movie had a provocative script. A "slasher film" usually has bad writing, directing, and acting, and thus uses blood and guts as its only means of keeping an audience. On the other hand,when a movie(ala Hannibal) has all the goods, the brutality is a hell of alot more intense and realistic. I saw this on its opening weekend, and I ofcourse own the dvd. When, less than 2 years later, Red Dragon was released, I saw it and was thoroughly DISAPPOINTED! I wish Dr. Lecter would feed Brett Ratner's face to dogs, sautee his brain in butter, shallots, and caperberries, then throw his remains in a pit of wild pigs. Bret Ratboy should stick to Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker movies. Anyway, see Hannibal. If you did, see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really excited to see The Silence of the Lambs when I first got hold of it, but when I watched it, there was nothing there that made me think "WOW", because let's face it, there is nothing WOW about this film, maybe the scene when Hannibal swaps faces with a police officer, I did feel a tad excited and then that's it, it has a weak ending and the movie just has a weak plot. The only thing which held this films together was Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, because it's a good Psychology film, but it's no masterpiece and doesn't derserve a best director and best picture awards. When Ridley Scott released Hannibal I was quite pessimistic about it but I got dragged along and what I got was nothing but pure genius for 125mins. Everything about this film was just excellent, the scenes in Venice would have done me, because it was so beautifully shot and in alot of parts of the film, it takes away the story and concentrates on beauty and life. It brings a much darker presence than Silence of the Lambs ever did, and a more gripping story, because the music played just right to every scene. There is nothing more I can say except that this is what Jonathan Demme should have made, but he didn't and I really hope people know that because I shall argue forever how much better this film actually is compared to Silence and the ok Red Dragon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** SPOILER WARNING ***After reading so many negative comments about this film I felt compelled to respond. Perhaps having read Harris' book is a huge advantage, but I found it easy to accept this film as a continuation of the original. In it we see the natural evolution of the main characters.HANNIBAL takes place 10 years after SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (SOTL). Things have changed for both Lecter and Starling. Lecter is free of the asylum while Starling has had 10 years of FBI service under her belt. This would make her a very different character from the young rookie we met in the first film. And, for me, it made the casting of Julianne Moore easily acceptable. She brings a sense of jaded maturity to Clarice that I found highly appropriate. Her performance hits all the right notes. In fact, her decision to take this role grows more courageous over time.And Hopkins' Lecter is just as compelling this time around. I found watching his transition from semi-retirement to terrible violence amazing to watch. The character still exudes power and magnetism at both behavioral extremes. I was so caught up in the ease with which Lecter flowed from scene to scene that I was truly jarred by the climactic dinner scene. For me, this was a pleasant shock and surprise. Sir Anthony gives a truly amazing performance.The simple fact that HANNIBAL is not limited to the dungeons and basements of SOTL should provide a clue to its uniqueness. Director Ridley Scott imbues this film with an operatic feel. The lush cinematography is amazing, as is the soundtrack. SOTL was a brilliant thriller, a crime story. HANNIBAL is a tragedy - yes, even a romantic tragedy. In that sense, prepare yourself for difference in order to truly appreciate this film. Once you do that, I'm sure you'll find it well worth your time. See and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Film And Better Than Silence Of The Lambs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal was the a much anticipated film of 2001 and many couldn't wait to see it since it's the sequel to the overrated Silence Of The Lambs (1991). They saw it and thought it was crap. I disagree. I think it's better than Lambs. This ain't a classic, but it's seriously underrated. I even read a review of this, which got no stars at all!The story is set 10 years after Hannibal (Anthony Hopkins) escapes the mental hospital, and he now currently hides in Italy. Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is still looking for Hannibal after failing a case that ended in disaster. She has a lead on Hannibal, but Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), Hannibal's only surviving and deformed victim, follows Clarice's lead and convinces corrupt Italian cop Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) to capture Hannibal for him.The acting in this is very good and Ridley Scott gives Hannibal Lector a more savage view than Jonathan Demme did in Lambs. I haven't seen Red Dragon (2002) yet, but this will probably still be the best out of the trilogy. Ray Liotta gives a good performance as the cop harrasing Clarice and is the victim of the famous "brain scene". Lambs is more disturbing than this, but you should give this one a go to and remember that it's a different story, so don't expect a repeat of Lambs.Rating: 3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Hannibal' is a love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, 'Hannibal' has not been received with much understanding. Die hard 'Silence of the Lambs' fans had waited ten years for a sequel, and no doubt they expected a comparable film in terms of genre and tone. Afterall, if you're looking for a really creepy film, look no further than Lecter's 1991 exploits. The name itself is synonymous with 'horror' to most people concerned.Enter Ridley Scott's take on 'Hannibal,' and the audience is introduced to a very different film. Lecter is no longer imprisoned, and thus no longer bitter. He is free to enjoy the finer things in life, with a little cannibalism on the side. The audience must understand that Lecter is not a psychopathic killer. He has better manners than the lot of you combined, and will only be truly terrifyingly ruthless when he is backed into a corner. Did you expect a horror movie with a newly-freed Hannibal Lecter?'Hannibal' is a love story. The beautiful cinematography and glorious musical score from Hans Zimmer should cue you in to this change of tone. This film--often very mellow--flows like water from beginning to end. The script is filled with memorable dialogue. For a sample, jump on over to imdb's memorable quotes. Tossed and turned into one package, all of these elements mold a film that is truly wonderful to behold.And every now and then (especially towards the end of the film) 'gruesome' is the order of the day. Needn't I spoil these moments for you. You will be disturbed. However, the violence never overwhelms the story and the character development. Even after the film's most disturbing moment (you know), we are treated to a very touching moment that, in my mind, overshadows the violence it proceeded.What we are left with is a very unique film--a combination of a twisted love story, and twisted violence. And it is too elegantly done not to like.Dismiss all expectations and let 'Hannibal' work its magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What on earth were people expecting?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the criticisms the film is beautiful in both the Vistas of Florence and the terrific score by Hans Zimmer. Ridley Scott should rightly be regarded as the greatest living British director and some latitude should be given considering the source novel, love it or hate it the translation is as close to the novel as possible. It is churlish and ignorant to call the film responsible for portraying Lector (film spelling) as "camp" both the novels and Hopkins portrayal are close in tone. So what were people who read the books to expect from the film version of the novel where Lecktor is free to indulge his peccadilloes and to wander indiscriminately, his incarceration adds tension and menace and offers less chance to portray Lecktor as camp, but the novel Hannibal does not give the director freedom to conjure this element and remain faithful to source. It would have been worse in the hands of Ratner or anyone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as gory/disturbing as some make it out to be - may contain SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HANNIBAL is the fourth film in the series and made third. I've always thought it was the third film, but I've just learned that there was a prequel to Red Dragon called Manhunter. I'll get that movie soon so that I'm complete on the series. I've also bought the books just so that I can compare them to the comments on these movies so far. I've found that it's better to see a movie first and then read the books - doing it the other may jeopardize your enjoyment of a movie. So the series in chronological order is: Manhunter, Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, and Hannibal.First off, I did not find HANNIBAL as gory or disturbing as other viewers. Maybe I'm a little desensitized compared to them or they're just wimps, I don't know. I do considered myself normal and a little sarcastic so that may shed some light on where I come from. The scenes that usually bother people are: 1. The scene on the balcony between Dr. Hannibal Lecter and Commendatore Rinaldi Pazzi and 2. The dinner scene with Dr. Hannibal Lecter, FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Moore), and Justice Department Official Paul Krendler (Liotta). They are grahpic, I'll grant that, but not over the top like some viewers have said here. Again, you are the best judge of whether you can handle it or not, but I'd say if in doubt, go for it - it's definitely not going to scar you for life... after all, it's just a movie and if you let it bother you then you have other problems.The acting in this movie is great - contrary to what other people have said, Moore did a good job as Starling. I would have preferred to have Jodie Foster back like most people, but Julianne Moore did a very good job as did Anthony Hopkins as usual. I was surprised by Giancarlo Gianinni (Commendatore Rinaldi Pazzi) - he did a good job in a supporting role. Gary Oldman as Verger was good as well - it only took me a few moments to recognize him under the make-up.Some people have wondered what the music is in the opera scene and have searched without success for it. Contrary to the information you will find here, it's not an existing opera. It's just a piece written especially for the movie. The text is based on Dante's "La Nuova Vita." If you want the music, buy the soundtrack - it's Track 2 I believe.Don't let other reviews steer you away from this movie. Silence of the Lambs was good, but very hyped in my opinion. I actually prefer this to it and Red Dragon above all. I give this one 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beautiful camera work, scenery and music!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot has been said about the storyline of this film, and I think it's fair to say you either love it or you hate it. Still, I was a bit disappointed about the fact that not many people have said anything about the mise-en-scene, the beautiful camera work, the scenery and the music in this film. For instance, I was very impressed with the way the city of Florence (Italy) is portrayed in this film as quite a dark, somewhat eerie place, but so beautiful at the same time. Maybe you have to know this city to really appreciate this fact, but I think anyone has to admit the scenery is very impressive. The other thing that really grabbed me is the music, especially the opera scene in Florence, where the "Vide Cor Meum" is performed.This opera is based on Dante Alighieri's La Vita Nuova (The New Life), specifically it is based on the sonnet "A ciascun'alma presa", in chapter 3 of the Vita Nuova. The music for the Vide Cor Meum is written especially for this film, by Patrick Cassidy, and is produced by Patrick Cassidy and Hans Zimmer. According to the official Hannibal site, Media Ventures liked the piece so much that they encouraged Patrick Cassidy to complete an entire opera around it! I hope this is true, and would love to hear it when it's finished. I guess all I would like to say is, whether you like the storyline or not, maybe you could still try and appreciate other things about it. It takes so much more than just a good story for a film to become a masterpiece!</fullReview>

THe acting was well done, the story was well-written for it's genre, but hearing or watching the story isn't worth the awful images that are thrown in your face.

		<shortDescription>What an unexpected surprize (No spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had waited some time to see this film, not being a big fan of The Silence of The Lambs, which I found unentertaining, not scary, not suspenseful, and especially poorly acted by Jodie Foster. The awards reaped by that film completely baffled me. What a bore.What tipped me into finally seeing Hannibal was completing the oeuvre of Julianne Moore who was so stunning in 2002 in her two oscar-nominated roles. I had always thought of seeing Hannibal for completeness sake regarding Ridley Scott who in my opinion has not yet even reached the level of acclaim that he truly deserves. At any rate I was pleased to see that the movie did not degenerate into a slasher film but caught me off guard as to the romanticlly-inspired thematic approach. Suffice it to say that I was shocked in an unusual way as I personally found that this was a somewhat calmly enjoyable film of a completely different dimension and character than I had expected. Anthony Hopkins played this role not a a sequel but as a separate, evolved character and Moore although far superior to Jodie Foster's Clarice was still a bit uninteresting.The scoring and photography of this film are on par with anything that has come out of Hollywood in the past decade. A must-see for fans of well-crafted films and superior filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior Sequel To Silence Of The Lambs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***Hannibal was a cinema masterpiece and that is no understatement. Movie producers take note, this is the way to make a film. I believe Hannibal should be a benchmark for the future production of films.I was not a big fan of Silence Of The Lambs but Hannibal just entertained me thoroughly-I am just glad I wasn't eating anything whilst watching it.Anthony Hopkins is back as Hannibal Lecter and he is extremely convincing in the role (perhaps too convincing). Julianne Moore takes on the role of Agent Clarice Starling and does just a good a job as Jodie Hopkins. Giancarlo Giannini does a wonderful job as Inspector Pazzi who matches wits with Hannibal (if you can match wits with an intellect like Hannibal). I must also mention Ray Liotta who plays a bureaucratic government pencil pusher called Paul Krendler.The first half of the film is slow but I think this helps rather than hinders the film. Slow spots in a film are sometimes crucial to maximizing the effect of the storyline later. Every good film and book has slow spots to balance out the action or horror.Giancarlo Giannini has the screentime for the first half as he engages in a battle of wits with the wicked but intelligent Hannibal and the scenes-although slow-are superb.The second half of the film finds Hannibal back in the United States where he continues his bizzare relationship with Agent Starling. The relationship between Hannibal and Starling is indeed one of the most bizzare relationships ever on screen. Both are very convincing in their roles.Let us not forget Gary Oldman as Mason Verger, one of Hannibal's early victims who is now disfigured (his face will give you nightmares so those of a nervous disposition close your eyes when he comes on). Mason originally gives Starling a lead on Hannibal but we soon find out what his real agenda is. It's hard at first to know whether to feel sympathy or disdain for Mason.The script is fantastic and as I said earlier, the slow parts help rather than hinder the movie. The tension is amazing between Inspector Pazzi and Hannibal and Starling/Hannibal.The film is very powerful and effective although it does leave a bad taste in the mouth a few days after viewing with three truly disturbing scenes.The first scene shows a flashback to Mason Verger becoming a victim to Hannibal and it is unpleasant. The second disturbing scene involves some wild razorback pigs and Hannibal and Mason Verger. This is a powerful scene that will shock you. Something happens to Mason Verger which is really awful and at this point, it was hard not to feel some sympathy for him. The third and possibly most disturbing scene involves Hannibal and someone's brain. I won't spoil it-watch the film.This is an intense film because I think it is realistic. My personal feelings about any type of serial killer is that we should ignore their existence and not glamourize them. However, in real life that is rarely the case and people do build up a rapport with killers like Hannibal. The most interesting thing in the film is the relationship between Agent Starling and Hannibal. Underneath, there is clearly respect even though they are two different breeds.The other interesting thing about this movie is how everything is not black and white. A lot of people who see this film find themselves siding with the very guy we should be booing-I guess that says a lot about us humans. Hannibal could well be considered an anti-hero in these films whilst the 'good guys' pursuing him are often looked on as the villains.All in all, a masterpiece even though it leaves a bad taste in the mouth for days. This is essential viewing for ALL movie fans (adults only of course).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Butchering of the Novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The novel, "Hannibal" was a truly brilliant book -- both terrifying and beautifully written, it actually gave the reader sympathy for Hannibal Lecter. The movie, however, had none of the beauty but all of the horror, depicting in loving detail all of the scenes of graphic violence, but including none of the back-story which gives such a well-rounded portrait of Hannibal. About half the movie was remarkably faithful to the book, but then it began to stray, and the ending was discordant and bore no similarity whatsoever to the book. It was an ugly movie that transformed Hannibal from a stunning portrait of psychosis to nothing more than a horror-film villain. I regret going to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please, save your money or go rent "Silence of the Lambs" and "Manhunter." This was a tragically weak film based on a horrendous book. To say that some of the things in this movie bend the realm of reality is a huge understatement. The real disaster in this film, is letting Hopkins' character run wild w/out purpose. In the first two movies, Hannibal was more of a minor player that you anticipated seeing more often. In this film, you grow tired of seeing a cartoon version of his original character. I don't know if it was fair to attack Riddly Scott for this film, because he did get the weakest of the books to do, but I will attack him anyways. I believe Scott is one of the most simplistic film makers working today. His movies all tend to be aimed at a 7th grade mentality. This movie is hollow, without any soul and a complete waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hannibal is simply awful. It fails in every imaginable way. The script is filled with plot holes and cliches, the direction is directionless, the special effects (especially near the end of the movie) are laughably bad, the performances are flat, the movie is overly predictable, and most importantly it is a thriller without thrills. But it has gore. But I say gruesome is not enough for a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, a wonderful, intense, scary movie. I hesitate to call it a sequel, because the characters return in name only. It is appropriate that a different actress play Clarice Starling, because she is not the same strong character from the first film. Julianne Moore's lacks even the physicality to pull off the role. In a movie filled with flaws, the one unforgivable flaw is that it just isn't scary. My wife was the real test. She hates horror and suspense movies. She could barely sit through Silence of the Lambs. She had no trouble sitting through Hannibal, except boredom. This is the worst sequel to a classic film since The Sting II.</fullReview>

Personally, the only thing I liked about this movie was I so easily fell asleep in it...twice. The sad thing is, the plot moved so slowly, I didn't miss anything. The first five minutes or so were great, then it gradually got slower and more tedious to sit through. As for the "gruesome" scenes, they weren't that good, realistic or gory as people said they were. I would comment more specifically, but it would be giving something away, what little you could give away with this movie. Also, I didn't like Julianne Moore's portrayal of Claire Starling. The acting wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs. Overall, I can't see why so many people liked this movie, and I hope they never try to make another one like it. If you do decide to see it, however, do not start it with high expectations, or you'll probably be let down like I was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible film, worst I've seen EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not know how anyone could have liked this film. "Silence of the Lambs" is one of the best films of all time, one of my top ten, so I ventured to this film on opening day. When a film is a sequel there is naturally expectations, especially a sequel to a best picture. Along with the horrible acting of Julianne Moore the major problem was the fact that the story line was not developed AT ALL and the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice was not explained. Love? well, in the "Silence" there was a definite special attraction and companionship, but without explanation, "Hannibal" has the two in a romantic, sexual relationship. Where did this come from? Why? The movie seemed more Freddy Crougar than psychological thriller and the focus was on the gore rather than the meaning behind it. The flagrant use of advertising (Gucci) was literally the worst I've ever seen in a film. This movie is not even worth any more of my time because it was the WORST film I have ever seen. The only thing friends could say to explain the movie was "Well, it was explained more in the book". Great. I'll go read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Continuity, Mr. Mamet, continuity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Hannibal when it opened in theatres on February 9, 2001. Last night I rented it on DVD and was perplexed at what I saw as a pretty poor plot flaw. What's more annoying is that the screenplay was co-written by David Mamet, one of the best writers in the business. I can't be assed with all this spoiler pedantic nonsense so if you haven't seen the film or read the script go and put the kettle on.Hannibal has been traced to Uffizzi Galleria in Florence by a local corrupt cop Pazzi. Outside waiting to bundle him into a truck and into the fiendish hands of Gary Oldman are Pazzi's own two professional henchmen. Pazzi is killed in a historical yet ironic fashion, which prompts said henchmen to rush into the Galleria, whereupon Hannibal slices and dices Hairy Henchman #1 with his usual panache. Henchman #2 (bald) trips over the body and has a nano second of screen time as he grieves for Hairy Henchman #1, with whom he obviously has a closer relationship than baddy buddies. wink, winkFlash forward and yet again we find Hannibal trapped and cornered by nemesis Oldman and assorted Italian Henchmen. But wait, who is this familiar henchman amongst them? Why, it's our old bald baddy buddy from the Galleria who has had no previous connection with the Oldman gang. Needless to say, Hannibal goes on the old bite and flight routine, yet manages to throw in a quip to bald henchman about him wearing same disgusting after shave as his dead brudder, before garrotting him with his usual culinary panache.Now there's nothing to indicate that the bald buddy baddie has fallen in with the Oldman gang, yet he manages to make the flight from Florence to Washington, hook up with the Oldman gang, and nobody stops to ask, 'Who's the bald geezer?' Now, obviously I am pedantic in the way I watch films. It's been a long time since I was able to willingly suspend my disbelief, but this jarred out as a sore thumb to me. My best friend Jimmy, not the most dedicated of cineastes, also spotted the flaw, with the immortal phrase "When did HE join the man eating pig gang?" So it can't just be me and my pal, which begs the question what the chuffing fudge was going on with the studio, the writers, the script editor, the continuity girl/bloke and the director that no one thought, "Oops, that doesn't quite play right. Should we go back and fix it?"Otherwise, it's a brilliant movie. It's in all-time favorite top three. I just wish they kept the part about Hannibal's sister. It explains a lot about him and the way he connected with Clarice. My advice: read the book, then watch the movie. I like the movie ending a lot better than the book. It agrees with the characters and makes more sense. For the uninitiated this review probably doesn't make much sense, so I suggest you go read the book, watch the movie and come back and reread it. Ya hear?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was flawed from its inception. It is based on a book that was uninspired and poorly written. Hannibal Lechter, a captivatingly paradoxial character in Silence of the Lambs, has been reduced little more than an 80's slasher villain in Hannibal. As the audience we soon learn that the movie does everything to justify Hannibal's grisly killings and we are to believe that the maneater is some sort of misguided hero.. Unfortunatly, in a feeble attempt hide the failings of it they resort to shocking the audience with scenes of depraved violence. If they make another movie, expect to see Mr. Lechter chasing a newly wedded bride down with a cake knife and forcing her to eat her husband's intestines (shaped like a wedding cake complete with frosting) who will no doubt deserve what he got due to some shady real estate transaction. There is a very good reason that Demi Moore turned this pile of rotting medical waste down.. You would be wise to do the same.</fullReview>

Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors, but not even he can save this utter turkey of a film. This last time I was this bored was watching Arnie's The Sixth Day. The only reason Hannibal didn't get turned off half way through was because I'd heard it was sick and twisted (which, incidently,it isn't)and wanted to see what the fuss was about. What you've got here is a Upper Class re-make of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, sanitised to please the (supposed) intellectuals of the world. The final scene (SPOLILER) where Hannibal opens up Roy Liotta's head and feeds him his brain in front of a drugged Starling stinks of the final meal in TCM. There is no story, there is no pace, there is little originality, and the acting SUCKS. Once again Hannibal Lector invokes as much fear as Mickey Mouse, the guy who wants him dead is the only character that works. Agent Starling is a complete fart. Why the hell would she want to save Hannibal???? Utter, utter crap. This film should be banned under the Complete Waste Of Time Act.

		<fullReview>It's sad that moviemakers have to make movies with so much gore. The scariest movies leaves something for the imagination. It's sad that some people in the audience laughed at the "last meal" for the FBI agent. You always hear folks ask why tragedies such as Littleton happen. You can look no further than movies such as this and the music kids listen to to find the answer. It's time for America to demand more of the film industry than the likes of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever been on the outside of an inside joke? That is my feeling watching this film. There is absolutely nothing entertaining or suspenseful about this film. The movie is long, slow, boring, and pretentious. In fact, it is just about torture to watch. How this comes from a director who made three films I love (Blade Runner, Alien, and Gladiator) is beyond me. I just don't get the appeal of this film at all. Is there something I'm missing?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really disappointed to see this movie. I didn't know what to expect, but I was told - BY ITS PRESS BOOK - that there would be a lot of blood and flesh and so on. This, with a good script, can possibly mean a good film. So, I went to see it and, for my surprise, this was one of the most predictable films I've ever seen. From the beginning, I knew who was going to die, who was going to succeed etc. So, I hoped there would be a lot of blood. But... no! Some intestines and brains, I expected something disgusting, that would make me throw up all my popcorn. All I got was hungry after a very boring film. Don't waste your time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disastrously absurd, incredibly pales by comparison to Silence of the Lambs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just spent 130 minutes of an agonizingly bad experience at the movies. I'm a Ridley Scott fan, but I hate to admit this has to be his worst film ever, it seems as if he was in a rush to finish it, and added a bit of his trademark slow motion ala Gladiator here and there just to make sure the directing wasn't so dull and commonplace.To me, this story was meant to be totally real from the start, and that's what made it frightening and thought provoking. Nevertheless, Hannibal is filled with unbelievable events at every turn, dozens of them, so much that at one point I had the feeling I was watching Friday the 13th with a $90million budget + big marketing $$, not to mention an Oscar winning (and absolutely deserving) predecessor. I was specially displeased with the image it portrays of Italy and its people: a wretched third world country with a moronic police force.The story ended up being nothing at all like the original, with absurd transformations in the characters. I understand 10 years have gone by, but Clarice is nothing AT ALL like the old one, no wonder Jodie Foster wasn't up for it (whether it was the money she was asking for as rumored, or not), and she wouldn't have been appropriate for the role anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Naturally I enjoyed Anthony Hopkins performance and Julianne Moore was an OK replacement for Jodie Foster. The film had a promising start with the good Dr Lecter playing around with the poor Italian police inspector and agent Starling returning to the Lecter case.But then... ... the whole thing turned into a silly farce and I can't understand how director Ridley Scott and Hopkins could spoil the Lecter character with the pointless babbling, idiotic brain-eating etc.The horror-filled excitement you felt watching "Silence of the Lambs" is completely gone when you sit down and watch this one. The intensity between Starling and Lecter from the first movie is non-existent in "Hannibal" which is just another mediocre horror flick ? la Roger Corman.Hopefully they won't find another Hannibal-script for Tony Hopkins. One bad sequel is enough...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horrible sequel to a brilliant movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you loved Silence of the Lambs for its intelligent thrilling qualities than DO NOT WATCH its sequel. Silence's Lecter was frightening because his brillance was the focus of the movie, not the details of his gory means of dispatching people. He was refreshingly different because he was not an atypical slasher. Hannibal's Lecter on the other hand is shown in all his gory details. He is free from his cell and stalks and slashes like any other b-movie horror villain. He appears and disappears at will without explanation.Another key draw for Silence was Foster's charisma which underlined the audience's connection with her. Moore's Starling illicits no emotion from the audience. Credit to a plausible accent, aside from that Moore portrays a character that we as an audience really do not care for and in the end we really don't care about her relationship with Lecter.This movie is also incredibly boring and slow. Any type of tension is drawn out as we wait and wait and wait to see what Hannibal does next. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to waste our lives for an extra 45 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Sucked!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok lets start with some general comments. Don't pay to see this at the theater, Maybe pay $1.00 at a discount theater. Dont pay $3.50 at Blockbuster- it is still a waste of money. Watch this on TNT or the USA network in 4 or 5 years because you are not missing anything if you wait.Hannibal does not compare to Silence of the Lambs. The movies do not even resemble each other. Ridley Scott fell on his sword on this one and that is sad after brilliant movies like Gladiator and Clay Pigeons.Why Hannibal Sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!1. The character Mason Verger was an insult to my intelligence. Someone that rich could afford plastic surgery. It takes more that a disfigured face to make a motion picture scary or suspenseful. This character was a joke. It was especially stupid the way he trained the pigs to eat Hannibal, what was that all about??2. Julianne Moore was o.k. But her character failed to parellel Foster in SOTL's. Moore was cold and basically a fema-Nazi while Foster was less Macho and more down to earth. Which doesn't suprise me coming from Ridley Scott. Hence Thelma and Louise and G.I. Jane.3. The movie tried to create too many sub-plots without any development of the character. Although this movie could be condensed into a 30 minute sketch on the Sci-Fi channel based on the content of the movie. It dragged on for around 2 hours.4. There was one scary part in the film. Out of 2 hours you get 1 minute of true suspense. There is no theme or direction that this movie creates. It tries to be gory but ends up being senseless and gory--like something you would see on USA "up all night"5. One good note: Anthony Hopkins played his part excellent. He did the best he could with this piece of crap plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The worst movie sequel since Batman and Robin. Though I wasn't expecting a taut thriller on par with the brilliant Silence of the Lambs, this movie fails to even entertain in escapist fashion. This monstrosity is a complete waste of time and thoroughly unpleasant to watch. It's no surprise that Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster wanted no part of this turkey, though even their replacements, Ridley Scott and Julianne Moore, have seen much better days. The story is stupid and cartoonish and even Hopkins, who was excellent in Lambs, plays Hannibal as a bad caricature of his previous performance. Moore seems to be sleeping through the movie, apparently as bored as I was. Gary Oldman is completely wasted and Ray Liotta gives a typical one dimensional performance. Boring, ugly, uninspired. I'm glad it's over and I never want to see it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, not as violent sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to reports of critics running out of the theater, I was prepared for this ultimate violent movie. Not so.(SPOILERS!!!!!)Okay. So Ray Liotta eats his own brain. So Hannibal cuts off his own hand because he is infatuated with Clarice. So he disembowels someone at the same time hanging the man. All this could have been done with a little more show. Compared to the second movie (Silence of the Lambs. Manhunter being the first) this is like Silence of the Lambs light. Hilarious at times, hannibal being the hero of course. A love sick puppy. However in this movie you come off feeling Hannibal isn't all that bad compared to that freak in SOTL. There's so much more suspense in SOTL that this is the reason I left disappointed. SOTL took several weeks to finish because at the time it was probably the most scariest movie I'd seen. (Evil Dead is the most scariest I've seen nowadays. I've tried twice now to watch it again but just can't) SOTL still gives me the creepies. Hannibal is just plain fun to watch. Gary Oldman however is rather tough to look at. Great in the makeup dept. These guys should get an Oscar for this one. Moore plays Clarice simply perfect and it's Jodie's loss that she wasn't in this movie. But Jodie did a better job in spots in SOTL. Overall, if your looking for a violent gory movie. This movie isn't it. If your looking for a love story (minus the brain scene) perhaps you might like it. ;) Having never seen Manhunter I can't proclaim this movie the best to watch. But it's easier to watch Hannibal than SOTL. SOTL is just gross. Hannibal we get to say go Hannibal go!!!! Kill those Sons a b_____'s!!! They are so RUDE!! 7/10</fullReview>

We both loved Silence of the Lambs so we were expecting great things from this movie. I have never been so bored in my entire life! I knew I was in trouble when I looked at my watch and the movie had only been on for 20 minutes!!! It felt like hours!The plot, if you could call it that, lacked all imagination. There was no psychological edge to it as there had been in Silence of the Lambs. While the killings were inventive, the film went for gore over substance. There was no suspense; if you had seen Silence of the Lambs the one part of the movie that may have provided some suspense was blatantly obvious.My advice to all of you who haven't seen it yet, don't bother....wait for it to come out on video and rent it if you must see it...you won't lose anything by watching it on video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gruesome cat and mouse chase. Hannibal Lecter is back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott will be blamed for not doing justice to the Thomas Harris novel. The scenery is beautiful. The soundtrack was neither distracting nor foreboding. The gore was graphic, but not totally stomach turning. The story line dragged a bit in areas and was very predictable in others. The viewer keeps waiting and waiting. The script itself was intriguing and somewhat intelligent, but so laking compared to "Silence of the Lambs".Sir Anthony Hopkins was brilliant in his reprisal of Hannibal Lecter. Quite comical with his smirk and 'okie dokie'. His historical rantings seemed so flawless and his manic threat always a concern. Julianne Moore seemed very hollow as Clarice. She lacked the urgency of Jodie Foster. Ray Liotta is so easy to dislike. Gary Oldman as Mason Verger is a masterful piece of work.This is a stunning movie, but just not as great as you wanted it to be. Some people will argue that this movie is just above the average slasher flick. I disagree. The good acting redeems the weak treatment of the novel. Maybe this film is a victim of itself. By all means give this movie your attention. 'Okie dokie'?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having heard about how disturbing this film was said to be, I was loath to pay to see it myself, since the best way to make a stand against gratuitous and/or gory films is to boycott them. I had, however, travelled to stay the weekend with a friend, and he really wanted to go. We both came out of the cinema wishing we hadn't bothered. The film is very flawed, with little of director Scott's talent on show except his willingness to take chances with shocking material. Having read the book, I can say that Hannibal is a very mundane and unimaginative adaptation. Neither Hannibal's nor Starling's characters are developed to any depth,leaving me wondering what the film was really all about. What has Clarice been up to during the last ten years? She appears to still be single - why? Surely this is intriguing? Why this huge self-sacrifice to her career? We are told that not a day passes when Lector doesn't cross her mind; so how has this affected her? In what ways has Lector's freedom manifested itself in her psyche? And what of Lector himself? We are given no insight into his personality or actions, either those of his past or those seen in the film. Clearly he is a man of brilliant intellect and extraordinary sensibility, yet we are given nothing of what he wants out of life, what he cares for, beyond superficial details like his love of fine foods and art. If this is meant to engender a sense of mystique to him, it is misguided since without any understanding of a character's motivations, an audience cannot hope to empathise with them. I was left feeling no involvement, watching a chain of events occur, and nothing more. What part had Clarice played in Lector's life over the ten years past? Had he grown to love her? Had he been following her career, following *her*? The details are scant indeed, coming along sporadically and even then only in the form of mere hints. The mystery of Hannibal had already been set up in The Silence of the Lambs - a sequel *demands* a payoff. There were such details in the book, such as what had made Lector the monster he is, Clarice Starling's life and 'loves' etc. but the screenplay simply omitted these.I noticed a couple of technical flaws i.e. an unjustifiable jump cut and a shot that went out, and then back into, focus, which are, frankly, unforgivable in major studio productions; given that this is a film that will inevitably get nominated for Academy Awards, such faults mustn't be glossed over. Finally, and most importantly, I must comment on the justifiably controversial aspect of this film, its graphic horror. I knew what was in store, yet I was still deeply disturbed at actually seeing the brain-eating scene. I felt I *ought* to walk out on it, not because I couldn't stomach it (though some may not be so hardened) but because *it seemed wrong* to be sat watching such images. The power of film is unquestionable - think advertising, think wartime properganda - so it would be insane to ignore the possible effects of everyday people sitting down to such images as graphic as those in Hannibal, in the name of entertainment. *This scene was unjustified in the book*, but *no one's* imagination is good enough to deliver the impact that actually witnessing something, with one's own eyes, can. I contend that *in a book*, such horrors, while having some power, are generally harmless, but to enable such things to be *seen* can actually endanger society. I am not saying that seeing horror films can make a person kill (though even that can be persuasively argued) but I *am* saying that society will grow increasingly desensitized, which will make us increasing less able to empathise with the suffering of others *in the real world*. Moreover, children *will* get to see Hannibal on video - don't be under any illusions about this. With the murder of poor Jamie Bulger, *by children*, so much in our minds again recently, isn't it time society made a stand of some kind against such films getting made, if they are certain to get seen by children once they are released onto video? Another point is that of where horror films are heading? Alien was shocking in '79, Starship Troopers in '97(?) - rated 15 in the U.K.- with its casual decapitations and limb-rending, already old hat, and now the slicing, frying and eating of a living man's brain? To conclude, I would say that Hannibal is a very poor adaptation of an enjoyable, quite clever, horror story; there are several plot holes (how did Starling free herself from the fridge, how did she fix the telephone, et al) and some technical flaws. Characterisations are wafer thin, the style and art direction, score, and even the acting are no more than competant; the final horror scene is gross, utterly gratuitous and morally reprehensible. I would seriously urge everyone to do themselves a favour and go see something else. If you do, you may also be doing the *decent* thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Ever....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself to be a reasonable person. I like lots of types of movies. I even thought "Charlie's Angels" was mildly entertaining. But this movie was so incredibly disappointing. I fully understand why Jodie Foster and Jonathon Demme refused to have anything to do with it. I only wish that Anthony Hopkins had been so wise. While his performance was not exactly bad, it certainly was far from the compelling acting he has done in the past in movies like "Sense and Sensibility" and SOTL. But the movie overall was terrible. Thomas Harris let the success of the first one go to his head and wrote an awful book that was turned into an even worse movie. The only reason I even went to see this one is because I had been told that the ending was changed from the book, where Starling runs off to South America with Lecter after sharing his meal of choice. But instead of improving the ending, they only slightly altered it, so as to not destroy our impression of Starling and leave room for another poor sequel.The gore is gratuitous, the story slow and boring and the suspense totally lacking. Whereas the original movie was one of the most terrifying movie ever made, along the lines of Hitchcock's classics, this one lacked any fear factor at all. It only made you turn away because it was so gory and grotesque that no one wanted to look. Ridley Scott should be ashamed, especially after the accomplishment of "Gladiator" which may not have been an amazing overall accomplishment, but was thoroughly entertaining nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to Hannibal without high expectations because I did not want to hype the movie to the point where it would let me down. However, either way it would have because this movie was abosutely awful. The only positive was that Julianne Moore did a great Jodie Foster impression. The rest of the movie was poorly written relying on shock value to get the viewer to forget that crap they were watching. SPOILER ALERT Ridley Scott's attempt at making Hannibal the hero fell way short because his evil far outweighs his apparent love for Clarice. As in the book, where Clarice becomes a cannibal at the end, here Scott refuses to go that far and makes Clarice dedicated to the FBI to the end even though she is supposed to hate them. The shock value got to the point of being ludicrous and stupid by the end. No craft was put in to this movie. In Silence of the Lambs it was what we had to imagine for ourselves that made it so creepy, but here, we do not have to think, we are just shown gruesome scenes that we can get sick over.All in all, this film gets a 1 out of 10 and I recommend Manos the Hands of Fate over this movie any day.</fullReview>

This brings me to Ridley Scott. Just because someone makes a few big budget, fiscally successful movies doesn't mean that their a wonderful director. Under those guidelines, Jerry 'Satan' Bruckheimer should receive accolades. Again, it's not really a mystery that Jonathan Demme wasn't at the helm for this one. Then there's the controversy over David Mamet receiving a writing credit. What a ploy! Mamet did a first draft of the screenplay which was (obviously) completely dumped by the guy who wrote the final draft.Please, avoid this rubbish.</fullReview>

This brings me to Ridley Scott. Just because someone makes a few big budget, fiscally successful movies doesn't mean that their a wonderful director. Under those guidelines, Jerry 'Satan' Bruckheimer should receive accolades. Again, it's not really a mystery that Jonathan Demme wasn't at the helm for this one. Then there's the controversy over David Mamet receiving a writing credit. What a ploy! Mamet did a first draft of the screenplay which was (obviously) completely dumped by the guy who wrote the final draft.Please, avoid this rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just about the worst ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talk about a completely stupid and ridiculous movie. It was a waste of my time and a waste of my money to even walk in the theatre to see it. Silence of the Lambs was one of the if not the greatest movies of all time, and this so called sequel completely destroyed the story and the character, Hannibal Lector. There was no plot, and the remnants of it was rediculous. The violence was not as disturbing as it was funny. It was so badly filmed and put together that I had to laugh. There was nothing even redeemable about it at all. I have gained a lot of respect for Jodie Foster for refusing to be in it. Oh, and that's another thing. Jullianne Moore had neither the looks, nor the acting ability to pull off Agent Starling. And the ending had to have been the most pointless, mindless thing I have ever seen. If you are reading this to determine if you want to see it. I say go ahead and enjoy laughing at probably the worst movie made for the masses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel that defiles the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I completely understand WHY this movie was made. Silence of the Lambs was an incredible film - a gruesome thriller with a superb story and high jump-factor....What I don't understand is why THIS movie was made... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed to reprise his role as Hannibal the Cannibal in this terrible and dissatisfying film.There's no possible way to spoil the movie any further than going to see it could, but for those of you who prefer to waste your money, DON't READ ON. The film is absolutely horrible. It's so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore becomes a non-issue. The only way to truly enjoy the film is to set your watch and leave the theatre exactly two hours into the film, because up until that point, it's quite an interesting thriller. The reparte between Moore and Hopkins is comparable to Hopkins and Foster, and the performances by the other characters are pretty good. But literally at the two hour mark, the film degrades into nothing but a cheesy D-grade horror flick...it's sick, and it's stupid and almost like the crew ran out of filming time, and threw together an ending in one day of filming.Initial buzz over the Thomas Harris' book's unsatisfying and bizarre ending led director Ridley Scott to order a re-write... and, honestly, having seen the film AND read the book's finale, I don't know which is worse.Please - don't waste your money OR time on this film, unless you're prepared to leave EXACTLY at the two hour point, because that's the ONLY way you'll feel satisfied about the saga of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter... continuing the mystery that made the first film, and the wait for this one, so great.</fullReview>

This film is just dreadful, not because of any violence or graphic mutilations. It's actually quite tame in that regard. The story moves at the speed of a lazy snail. I have the feeling that director Ridley Scott just phoned this one in. The actors are all fine they just needed some direction. The music score is also very annoying. It's especially noticeable since so little is going on in the film. It does look good but that's not enough reason to see it. By the way did I mention that it's BORING?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Hannibal last night and it is officially one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is bad on so many levels it is hard to know where to start. The writing was poor, it wasn't at all true to the charachters created in the first movie (and I watched Silence right before going to see Hannibal). Anthony Hopkins did his best with what he had, but this Hannibal Lecter was unbeleivable compared to what we know he can do. Also, I feel Hannibal Lecter himself would have been dissapointed with this movie. It was crass, unrefined, and he would have found it rude. There was none of the delicious subtlety we were hoping for, only bloody gore reminicent of a bad B-horror movie. It was crude, and disgusting. Julianne Moore was a completely unbeleivable Starling, with none of the spunk Jodie Foster gave the character. It was painful to watch her try to fill Oscar winning shoes, and to be honest she should not have tried. The cinematography was poor, the lighting, the directing, etc. The only redeemable factor was the music... watch for the piece Anthony Hopkins composed. All in all, if you curiosity requires you to watch this movie please wait for video, it isn't worth your money or time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that "Hannibal" has a Best Picture-winning predecessor only serves to make this unimaginative gore-fest look that much more pathetic when held up to the original. Wooden acting, characters and situations, a disjointed plot that never gains any momentum, topped off with gratuitous, stomach-wrenching gore make "Hannibal" one of the most disappointing films to come around in some time. Its hollow recreation of the cat-and-mouse banter of the first film (which benefited greatly from the chemistry between Hopkins and Jodie Foster) rings false, presenting the audience with no new wrinkles in their relationship. Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling seems painfully aware that she has big shoes to fill after Jodie Foster wisely passed on the script. She never seems comfortable in the role, while Anthony Hopkins, reprising his classic role, seems like a guy doing an extended imitation of Anthony Hopkins playing Hannibal Lecter. I wish I could say something more positive about this film, given that I've really enjoyed the work of everyone involved previous to this film, but man, this movie sucked.What's unfortunate is that people might look at this film as a 'gory romp' or a 'bloody thrillride' while a film like, "I Spit on Your Grave" or "Friday the 13th Part IV" would be held in the lowest contempt by the same people. For all intents and purposes, "Hannibal" is nothing more than a low-end slasher flick with a whiff of window-dressing intellectualism and higher production values. Truly awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After running to the Ziegfeld Theater at 12:30AM this Morning to see this, I can't help but feel cannibalized by such a dreadful movie.The movie was a complete flatline. Not once did I feel for any of its characters and the suspense I've been craving since "Silence," has remained unsatisfied.It starts off desperately trying to make you forget Jodie Foster, by pushing Julianna Moore on you as Clarice, and judging by this performance, she is absolutely a mediocre talent at best. Certainly not worthy of a headliner.Hopkins was true to form, as well as Gary Oldman, but neither of them could save this awful script. It was as if a 1/2 hour TV episode was stretched to fill 4 hours and minus any good suspense a TV episode would have.As great as Ridley Scott's work was on Gladiator, he should absolutely be ashamed of the boring nonsense he pulled with this one.I found myself waiting for something...anything to happen.This is very hard to admit being a Hopkins &amp; Oldman Fan, but, Hannibal, is truly not worthy of your time or money. I am sure this will be #1 on the box office this week, but that will not change the fact that Hannibal is Horrible. I simply cannot recommend this movie in good conscience.If suspense is what you crave, seek elsewhere or watch "Silence of the Lambs" again</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Possible spoilers ahead)Ridley Scott's Hannibal can not match it's predecessor Silence of the Lambs or even it's original Manhunter, but it is pretty good as a thriller. Sure there isn't a Jodie Foster, but now it's actually interesting to see Julianne Moore as a Clarice Starling 10 years later. Here, she's back on the track of Lecter, played to still brilliant greatness by Sir Anthony Hopkins who returns as the Socrates meets Zombie man, who is now free in Florence Italy. But she is not only trying to get him back in jail, but also to save him from revenge by the faceless Merger (played in almost unseeable ease by Gary Oldman).Plenty of unintentional laughs (sample: I've been to America, and I've had many good meals there), but suspense helps out along with fine performances despite the flaws of being a little less intriguing. Warning though, some scenes are very gruesome; seeing Ray Liotta's skull pop open like Homer in that Simpson's episode and then seeing Lecter feed him his own brain is the most gory thing I've seen since the creature baby from Eraserhead. Based on Thomas Harris' novel. A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the film did indeed have several drawbacks, the removal of Jodie Foster and Jonathan Demme for example, Anthony Hopkins was superb as the Good Doctor, finally let out of his "plexiglass prison", showing the audience and Clarice just how monstrous he could be. Julianne Moore's portrayal of Clarice Starling is one often slated, and I fail to understand why, as she brought the human side of the character to life in much the same way as Jodie Foster did in "Silence".Often ignored is Giancarlo Giannini, playing Commandatore Pazzi. Much like Kevin Spacey in "L.A. Confidential" you wonder how he ever became a police officer.The F.B.I. are portrayed as heartless, backstabbing politicians in this film, and was one of the things that I thought was immensely unconvincing. It is, however, fun to see Paul Krendler get what's coming to him in the now infamous scene. I'll say no more on that...The two words which make this film great: Anthony Hopkins. His performance is flawless, and even in the face of impending death he still finds time to insult the rude.This is the sequel to "Silence", but you must remember that "Silence" is about captivity. The well in Buffalo Bill's basement, the true "Billy" trying to break free, Dr. Lecter in solitary confinement etc. "Hannibal" about freedom. Lecter is "out there", and no-one knows where he is until he reveals himself. He lives in a large, roomy apartment, which I found interesting to note, and he walks down the streets of Florence with reverence.Ridley Scott did very well with this film, especially looking at his other titles such as "Alien" and "Black Hawk Down", you would consider material such as this out of his range, but, in my opinion, he did superbly.9/10 Excellent</fullReview>

The plot however is extremely predictable and the acting of the stars is mediocre in the case of hopkins to atrocious in the case of moore. in spite of the absolutely disgusting subject matter and the extremely graphic depiction of it, I was half hoping Hannibal would eat Starling just to see if she would actually show some emotion, but my guess is she would not. spoiler beyond this point - although it would be impossible to spoil this film any more than the director, writers and actors already have done. the final scene is easily the most vile and perverted ever put on film. hannibal has once again escaped starling's clutches (by axing his own hand off, to escape the handcuffs starling used to bind him to her - instead of axing off her hand.) prior to that he had made a dinner which included portions of ray liotta's brain. apparently he had some left over and had it included in the meal he secured for himself to eat aboard an airplane while escaping. he then offers a portion of the brain dish to an 8 year old who had not liked the food served to him by the airline. Hannibal says "my mother always said you should try new things." That is absolutely sick.i know it's unlikely that anyone will read this review given the other 123 pages but please avoid this movie.</fullReview>

I understand that even killer has complex human emotions, but Dante has nothing to do with killing a man like that. If a man who masters literature and history could judge other people's life as his wish, then how should we estimate Hitler? I know it's just a film but since Anthony Hopkins' performing is too great, I couldn't help but feel upset for quite a while. We all admit Godfather is great, because whatever he did he insist his principle that family profit is most important, he also had his love and hate but if he showed up with Dante that would be totally unreasonable. I don't like those script writers who add metaphysical meanings onto slaughter just for making a film looks more mystic and attractive. And that female FBI upset me too, why she saved H while she knew she couldn't control the situation by herself? The director did a good job, as well as composer Hans Zimmer. But for me the problem is they are too moderate, I mean, the way the camera rolls, the scenes switch, and the actors perform, just too Hollywood. Everything goes so smooth that I even could hear a voice that says: Look, what a good film am I making! I would answer, yes, congratulations! But why do you make it again?</fullReview>

If you are on top ten most wanted, it is informed all around the world. The other thing that does not make any sense is how Hannibal was able to get on a plane after the FBI knew that he was in America. If you are on top tens most wanted and you are within the certain area, there will be traffic stops and extreme security to makes sure that the person does not getaway. I could not stand this movie.

He's been good (no eating people) and he's living in Florence under a different name. But, through a series of very involved circumstances, he is forced back into "business". Clarice Sterling (Julianne Moore) is on hand to try and stop him. The film is slow, much too long, quite dull at first--also, the plot is needlessly convoluted. What keeps it watchable is beautiful wide-screen cinematography; good acting by Hopkins, Moore, and Ray Liotta; a VERY gruesome climax. But mostly, I was bored and uninterested. The story just doesn't have the kick the first one had...not one scary sequence is in this. So it's OK--but nothing special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Disappointing Sequels in History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal (2001) ** (out of 4) Sequel to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS takes place ten years after the events in that film. Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) finds herself disgraced after a drug raid goes horribly wrong and she's left out to dry. Meanwhile, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), the fourth victim of Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), is offering a reward for the escaped maniac so that he can deliver some vengeance. To call this one of the most disappointing sequels in the history of cinema really wouldn't be going too far but you really can't blame anyone involved with the production of the film. I think 100% of the blame must go to the Thomas Harris novel because even David Mamet couldn't bring this thing to the screen. I think Jodie Foster made the right choice in refusing to take part in this film for a number of reasons. I think the biggest problem with the movie is that the story is just so stupid that it's really hard to take it very serious. The entire stuff dealing with Lector being in Italy doesn't make for any drama as there's no suspense, you don't care about any of the supporting characters and in reality everything is just so blandly done story wise that you don't really get drawn into any of the events. Even the stuff with Starling is pretty boring as we see she's fallen on hard times yet we never really get to feel anything for her character outside of what we know about her from the first movie. This sequel really doesn't try to expand on the character outside of us being told and shown what events have happened to her over the past few weeks. The original film really dove into her character and we got a full idea of what shaped her life. You'd expect this film to take that and go somewhere new with it but we're given nothing. After the brilliance of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS it's just shocking to see how far this film falls. What's worse is that 1991 masterpiece really delivered two of the most memorable characters in film history but this sequel makes them rather dull and lifeless. Whereas the first film went for suspense this one here seems more happy to just try and shock the viewer with outrageous gore scenes. I love horror movies and gore but whenever there's so much of it it's usually covering for the lack of something else. The gore scenes are all extremely graphic but they're well-made and you can't help but think that director Ridley Scott was trying to pay homage to the Italian gore films of the 80s. Performances are all rather mixed but Oldman comes off the best as the messed up loony searching for Lector. Hopkins is pretty good too but I think it's safe to say that the character was much more chilling when locked up. I found Moore to be rather boring in the part as she isn't able to bring any life to it but I'm willing to say that a majority of the blame can go towards the screenplay. Even Ray Liotta is wasted in his part. The ending has become a firestorm for controversy and you can add me to the list that feel it's just stupid. HANNIBAL might look good but sadly it's a complete miss on everything that made the original so great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Worst Films Ever Made...........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HANNIBAL is about little else besides self indulgence and, of course, profit. I did not read Thomas Harris' book, because it seemed like an obligatory cash cow sequel to the successful SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Well, if the book is anything like the movie, that is exactly what it is. HANNIBAL is an overproduced product, a colorful display of big name talent that can be easily sold to the masses for $8.00 a ticket. Now, I know that most people would contend that the majority of mainstream American films would fall into that category. What with the endless drift of action films or teenage sex romps, true, but what the difference is is that Ridley Scott seems to think that HANNIBAL is an epic masterpiece, instead of the pulp trash it actually is. There's the rub. The subject matter is so tawdry and lurid, but yet held to such high esteem by Scott and his crew.The massive waste of talent is another unforgivable aspect of HANNIBAL. Consider the fact that the novel was adapted by no less than renowned playwrite David Mamet and Oscar winner Steve Zaillian, if in fact they distilled the best elements of the book into the screenplay, then the book is far worse than I can even imagine. The on screen talent does not get off any easier. Julianne Moore, who replaces Jodie Foster, is a good actor, but is reduced to a rat in a convoluted maze. Giancarlo Giannini, who plays Inspector Pazzi, turns in the best performance of the film, but should have saved it for a more worthy project. Ray Liotta can tear the screen apart with the right material (see the recent NARC), but is used poorly here. Anthony Hopkins seems tired and weary in rehashing the character that made him a household name ten years ago. You should know your movie is in serious trouble when Gary Oldman's appearance does not liven things up!The bulk of the blame should fall squarely on Scott, however. HANNIBAL is one of the most glaring examples of overdirecting in a film in recent memory. His busy overblown style may have worked for BLADE RUNNER and LEGEND, but not here. It is especially distracting because this is the "sequel" to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. In SILENCE, the director, Jonathan Demme, used closeups and tight angles to create a tight unventilated feeling, something that Scott undermines, which would make viewing the two films in sequence jarring (although I never plan on watching HANNIBAL again). HANNIBAL is a good example of why Scott did not win best director for GLADIATOR.The plot of HANNIBAL is the stuff of comedy, except that it has such a sadistic overtone that it makes it hard to laugh; although, during the finale as the audience gasped in horror, I fell onto the floor unable to contain my hysteria. It is an ending that this film deserves, it reinforces what little respect Harris and Scott have for their audience. Little, if any. They serve up cheap gore in place of any logical conclusion, easy outs instead of answers. HANNIBAL insulted my intelligence and if there is one thing a film can do that I cannot forgive, it is that. 1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical example of what happens when you try to "improve" a novel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal was doomed right from the start. While the novel was a long time coming, it just didn't have the oomph that The Silence Of The Lambs or Red Dragon contained. Clarice Starling is not the best character to base anything around, in fact. Compared to her predecessor, she's about as interesting as a thumb tack, even if Lecter thought otherwise. But Thomas Harris must have thought "hey, let's put Lecter in Italy, turn Clarice's life upside down, and have the entire world go after them by degree".Thus begins the first and most difficult problem in Hannibal - by the time it is over, there is not a single character other than the titular one whom you won't hate. The film does absolutely nothing to fix this, either, and bringing Paul Krendler into the sequel without his quick introduction in The Silence Of The Lambs doesn't help matters, either. In the end, one assumes Krendler hates Starling for the hell of it. It would have been far more interesting to have Will Graham trying to hunt Lecter down, considering what went on at the end of Red Dragon (a point glossed over by both film versions).Reading past this paragraph might ruin the film for you even more than Jodie Foster's bitching over the script already has.The biggest problem with the film version of Hannibal is the same one with Manhunter. In essence, the film has no respect for the source material. The essence of Hannibal was Clarice having to choose between her loyalty to law enforcement as a concept, herself, or what her father represented to her. The choice she eventually makes, with the help of Lecter, in fact, is one of the most jarring and bizarre twists you'll ever experience in print. In the film, Lecter simply cuts off his own hand and makes a dash for it. Join me in a chorus of "ho hum" if you will. I'm eternally grateful that I read the novel before I watched the film.The Verger clan was also poorly represented in the film. What the hell happened to Mason's lesbian, steroid-munching sister who wanted Mason to be a sperm donor for her love child? And don't get me started on the poor dialogue coaching. My girlfriend, who was born and raised in Italy, found the Florence scenes more laughable than horrifying. Lecter's pronunciation is so poor that it's a wonder he didn't get arrested within an hour of disembarking from the plane, and this can be fairly and squarely blamed upon the producers for not having the good sense to hire an Italian dialect coach. It cannot be blamed upon Sir Anthony Hopkins - he makes a decent piecemeal out of a badly scripted part. Which brings me to another point - Lecter is nowhere near as frightening out of captivity as he is in. When he was behind bars, he was able to make trained psychiatrists burst into tears, but out in the world, his methodology is about as subtle as a nuclear strike on an outhouse. There is no sense that he can crawl under your skin and infect your mind. Hell, if you're quick and strong enough, it seems there is little he can really do to you.Another interesting plot thread that was dumped from the film was Mischa, Lecter's baby sister. One wonders when reading Hannibal if the disappearance and apparent gassing of Mischa is what made Lecter the elegant psychopath that he is. Granted, it is mostly in the brain's chemistry, but hey, having your little sister taken from you and finding her as little more than a pile of bones is enough to influence anyone into murdering numerous people. It also makes Lecter seem like a deeper, more complete character than the facade offered here.Julianne Moore makes a decent Clarice Starling, but she underplays the character as opposed to Jodie Foster's overacting, which creates two highly conflicting impressions of the character. After reading the novels, I've never had much sympathy for the character, but this helps a theory of mine, in that Lecter is Harris' answer to Tolkien's One Ring. Essentially, Lecter is a vortex that uses other characters' weaknesses to suck them in, chew them up, and spit them out. In Harris' novels, Graham, Starling, and Verger are like the Ringwraiths, in that they are rare examples of people who've been swallowed by the vortex and lived to tell about it, although neither of them are particularly happy about it.The essential problem with the film then, and to a lesser degree with all three of the other films (or rather especially so in the case of the frankly appalling Manhunter) is that they take a novel with great depth, only to make something very devoid of substance with it. The De Laurentiises tried to add a "happy" ending to Hannibal. What they created instead was an abomination the likes of which hasn't been since since The Matrix's wholesale piracy of Doctor Who and Hong Kong cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hannibal" is the long-awaited sequel to "The Silence of the Lambs", the 1991 Oscar-winner for Best Picture. This film picks up 10 years after the events of the first and now Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore, replacing Jodie Foster) is being shunned by the FBI because of a recent assignment gone terribly wrong. Dr. Lecter (Hopkins), now in Italy, learns of Starling's problems and the chase re-starts as a crazed former patient (a disfigured Gary Oldman) tries to capture Hopkins and feed him to wild boars. Of course, Starling is trying to get to Lecter first and imprison him once again. The film is very well-made and Hopkins is super as usual. Julianne Moore is also surprisingly good as Starling, but losing Foster was too big an obstacle. Oldman and Ray Liotta are appropriately slimy and in the end they both get theirs. The film is somewhat difficult to watch because Lecter's antics are actually shown in "Hannibal". This turns the film into a genuine shock-fest that is little more than a stomach-churning experience to the movie-goer. "The Silence of the Lambs" used intelligence to convey its message, while "Hannibal" uses gimmicks that get tiring and sickening after a while. Overall the film is watchable and interesting, but is nothing special and is not in the same galaxy of films as its predecessor. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Eating or Bad Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that most readers will instantly disagree with me I will begin with stating that I did not like The Silence of the Lambs and I just do not get the adoration. To me it's a mundane, overrated bore with telegraphed irony and deus ex plotting.My hopes for Hannibal were low, and still I was disappointed. People tend to forget that up until the success of Gladiator Ridley Scott's career was on a steep downward trajectory as the 90s had not been kind to him. I don't think the man deserves his "legendary" status as a director and Hannibal is proof that he sometimes has no idea what to do with material, however poor. The substance is lacking, and so is his style.With Lecter free to roam the world enjoying his fiendish life to the fullest he assumes the identity of Dr. Fell a library curator in Florence. His foil, Clarice Starling, meanwhile is in trouble with her bosses after a botched stakeout ends in multiple deaths. Hideously disfigured pederast Mason Verger uses his family's wealth and power to have Clarice reassigned to Lecter's case and plans an epic revenge on the cannibal. As this plot slowly, slowly, slo-owly builds a charisma-free detective in Florence tries to apprehend Lecter for himself and claim the big reward.There is zero tension, no atmosphere, and little in the way of danger or threat. It's fun seeing Lecter do his thing, but there's hardly of it. Florence is shot and lit in such a flat and dull way that it really could have been Scunthorpe or a rough area of Glasgow. Scott hardly ever shoots flat, but I really do think that a 2.35:1 anamorphic aspect ratio and a different cinematographer would have made a world of difference, as well as trimming a few useless minutes here and there.It's obvious that no one involved in making this movie had any real clue what to do with the material. Outside of a few amusingly disturbing moments, Hannibal has no bite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Withered sequel...with Hannibal our new Freddy Krueger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overdue follow-up to Jonathan Demme's "The Silence of the Lambs" from 1991 reportedly cost a bundle to make, yet it looks grimy and ugly throughout. Where did all the money go? Ridley Scott directed from Thomas Harris' lackluster bestseller, bringing back both escaped killer Hannibal Lecter and FBI agent Clarice Starling, though only Anthony Hopkins returns from the original's stellar cast. Hopkins retains his evil panache, but it's the Freddy Krueger syndrome: more of him is really less. Julianne Moore is a weak Clarice, and our first glimpse of her--asleep in a van next to a block of dry ice!--is immediately disconcerting not only because this is Jodie Foster's role, but also due to the fact Moore changes positions in the long-shot. Scott goes for a straightforward approach, yet this is nothing more than a thriller in shorthand. We get none of the mystery or suspense of the previous film, everything here is laid out quickly and then slashed at (probably the best moment is the opening, which has an icy kick). The entire ending, much discussed here I'm sure, left me groaning. It's shock-stuff gone too far. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very disturbing film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains several spoilers. If you do not want to know of them stop reading now! I watched this film to see how it compared to silence of the lambs. The former was very well done. However, this film should not have been made. The reason(s) I say this is towards the end of the film. When Dr. Lecktor removes the skull cap of ray liotta and frys part of his brain and feeds it to him is in my opinion sick! Also when he is on the plane and shows the Asian boy his lunch you know it is going to be very depraved. Because on top of a piece of lettuce are several pieces of brain matter. As the film fades you know Lecktor is going to get the boy to eat the brain matter as the film fades out. This film should not have been made in my opinion. I personally feel that they should have stopped at Manhunter with William Petersen because Dr. Lecktor was caught and behind bars where he should have been in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott's Long Awaited Sequel to The Silence of the Lambs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julianne Moore stars as an older, hardened Clarice Starling who holds the Guinnes record for most kills by a female FBI agent. After an arrest takes a wrong turn and the media firestorm which erupts because of it, Starling is forced off the job which piques the interest of her deadly old acquaintance Hannibal the Cannibal Lecter. This sets off an international manhunt and the involvement a police inspector in Rome who has a young wife with expensive tastes and a wealthy child rapist whom Lecter had previously disfigured and maimed as a public service. Gary Oldman plays the mutilated Mason Verger to loathsome perfection although the actor ultimately had his name removed from the credits over a dispute concerning his placement on the marquee. Julianne Moore feels like a natural extension of the character Jodie Foster originated just as Gaspard Ulliel would feel like an organic extension of Hopkin's cannibal in Hannibal Rising. Hopkins himself is nothing short of riveting as Hannibal. You can't take your eyes off him for a minute and director Ridley Scott fills every frame with his natural skill and artistry. Hannibal may not enjoy the same reverence of The Silence of the Lambs but it will likely become a classic in the genre on it's own considerable strengths.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hopkins, who is electrifying in almost anything he does, reprises the mastery he brought to Silence of the Lambs. Scott's elegant, shadowy atmosphere and deliberate pacing make the film a delightfully spooky experience. Director Scott has used his considerable talent to dress up this film into an artful, visually impressive affair. More character study than thriller, it can stand on its own merits. It's probably not exactly what you wanted, but it just might be enough. No wonder lesser minds hate this movie: it's radically different from Silence a bloody, suspense-driven, darkly comedic love story between good and evil, a florid, grandiose thriller manifesto on why polar extremes need each other to survive. At its supreme best, Hannibal is a voyage into the depths of existential horror.An intriguing, fresh, firm and attractive endeavor that neither tries to borrow nor duplicate the atmosphere of its predecessor.Hannibal is a gruesome beauty-and-the-beast tale, in which the noble heroine keeps her virtue and her soul, while the monster battles his appetites and finds his own soul, single-handedly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sophisticated Idiocy !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate vanity, stupidity, blood, complexity, pointlessness, and bore. And it happens to be that this movie contains ALL OF THE ABOVE ! So the first movie, (The Silence of the Lambs ? 1991), was a success. It was thrilling and psychological, being exciting and deep (the equation of perfect entertainment in my book). It won the Oscar, the box office, and led to a wave of similar movies. Sure in all the 1990s next serial killers horror thrillers, you'll find something, if not many things, affected by this movie. According to that, I wondered how they didn't make the sequel earlier ?! Though, according to the sequel itself, Hannibal (2001), I lamented why it was made in the first place !! First of all, the structure of the movie as a thriller wasn't any unique or that thrilling. For the first, really weary, 2 thirds; we follow the attempt of idiot inspector to capture the title character; which you know by heart it will end with the inspector murdered or eaten, and we watch Clarice doing nothing but reading, reviewing photos and talking in phones. In the final third you'll not find great chase, hot sequence or worthy climax. So, where's the excitement then ?!Moreover, the script assembles a long list of idiot deeds, then the direction plays them with great confidence. Therefore the final picture is a mix of idiocy and vanity (a very very bad mix if you ask me !). For little instances : The character of Mason Verger is in a wheel chair. Why ? Ahh, it's told in the book which this movie is based on that Lecter broke his neck with a noose. So why our movie didn't show that or even refer to it by a line ?! Clarice is living with someone. Who is that? The movie doesn't answer. Clarice is framed for forcing her to leave the case, but with what? Something that was never clearly explained (with a mention of Palestinians !). Verger hired people to raise wild boars for him. OK. So why they make him hear their voices with recorded human screams ?! Someone is killed right in the street, between tens of people, and nobody notices. And the most comic; while Lecter knows that he became one of the 10 most wanted men on the planet, he lives in Europe WITHOUT ANY DISGUISE WHATSOEVER ??!!Then to another crime : the dialog. It was so damn sophisticated for its own good. While I'm a scriptwriter, short stories' writer, and a book worm myself; I didn't understand a thing ! With the endless lectures about Dante, Verger's talk about "How Clarice shies when the name of god is mentioned", Lecter's reiterative theory about Clarice as a dove (!), and Lecter's long totally incomprehensible chatter on the phone (especially the part of "you're cold, warm, cold" !?!) I got dizzy and board. It thinks itself so profound, inspiring or symbolic, while it ends up as purely factitious crap. It's whether something that needs a dictionary, and the best code breaker you can find!, or a mess of ramified high talking. Both ways, it gives the headache, with no paying off !Originally what was the movie's point ? That child molesters and bribed police officers are more bad than crazy cannibals and serial killers ??? (I beg to differ !). Why Lecter was having an infatuation over Clarice ? It's a shame that this movie which builds itself on this question doesn't answer it appropriately. And I missed what was the fact of the relationship between Lecter and Clarice eventually (A love story !! HOW ??!!)?even bigger shame for this movie !There are horrible images along the way. Some of them were given freely I think; like the photos at Clarice's office. Then, why to show the grisly face of Verger over and over again, in full lighting and close-ups, while the effect can be more scary in the dark, with less appearances for his face ?! And to top everything; I must mention the unforgettable scene when Lecter gets Paul Krendler, played by Ray Liotta, to eat his own brain. This is like horror farce! It did remind me with a scene in one of Friday the 13th movies when a man was killed by pulling his spine out his body, though he was left screaming ! As a whole, and with its mentality, (Hannibal) pushed me to believe that it was an exploitation movie done with big budget and names !Scriptwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian, along with director Ridley Scott, made a movie that drawled and feigned about being a well cultured one, with meanings or at least good diving into its characters and world, while it's actually an empty horror / thriller. Again, I hate it when a movie is vain. I hate it when a movie is stupid. And I feel incredible hatred when a movie has the 2 marks together; as it is in the case in hand. Now imagine when it wins the box office as well (as it did in 2001) to know what hell I lived after finishing this movie ! (Hannibal) isn't enjoyable, in any way. And that's comparing to (The Silence of the Lambs) or (Dude, Where's My Car), or while not comparing it to anything. Maybe I'm stupid viewer. Or maybe this is stupid movie, sophisticatedly stupid one !</fullReview>

He was brilliant, the rest of the cast was lousy and the way they brought the script to life was awful. I may be slightly crazy but Hannibal was first and foremost a true love story and this trash didn't even come close.I will say this, if you truly want to get your money's worth then don't waste your time with this film. Go out and buy the book, and you will be truly pleased then you could probably think that I am truly crazy for saying that this is a love story. Another thing, the highlight of this whole film culminates in the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far superior to the overrated The Silence Of The Lambs, Ridley Scott's ten years on sequel of Thomas Harris's gruesome novel is fairly faithful to the original story.Jodie Foster is not missed for one second, as Julianne Moore comfortably makes the role of Clarice starling her own. She is nothing more than excellent in the role.Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as ever as Doctor Hannibal Lecter, and what makes this film more appealing is the fact he is on the prowl all throughout where he was confined in a cage in Silence Of The Lambs. This is also truly darker than any other Lecter movie, more darker than Manhunter.The music score by Hans Zimmer is brilliant. Especially the scene where Lecter, Pazzi and Pazzi's wife are watching the opera in Florence and he uses this music again when Lecter returns to America. I also liked the small adventure that Lecter has with Inspector Pazzi which ends in a rather brilliant gruesome conclusion before he leaves for America.One of the best films of 2001.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie with a bad reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie is totally underestimated. After seeing 'the Silence of the Lambs' I didn't expect much from 'Hannibal'. I thought the Silence was rather boring. But I did watch this and was impressed. Yes, there is gory scenes in the movie, like the brain-eating thing, but I didn't really find it as disgusting as everyone says. As a movie I think this was much more beautiful than it's two prequels, but the only positive comment I've ever heard about 'Hannibal' was from my father. What I wonder is why Jodie Foster didn't act in this movie. Not to offense Julianne Moore, I think she was actually much better in the role of Clarice Starling than Foster was, but it's always confusing when the actor changes. The best thing in this movie was, of course, Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter. I doubt that there's anyone who could do the role better. The other actors were good too, like Gary Oldman as Mason Verger. As a movie, 'Hannibal' was one of the best horror movies ever and I can't see why it's gotten so much critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HANNIBAL is the ultimate in serial killer films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People compare "Hannibal" to "Silence Of The Lambs" which, if they want to play that game, is better than SOTL. Director Ridley Scott (Alien, Bladerunner, 1492: Conquest Of Paradise) is at the director's seat in this stylish, visceral and shocking live action painting of a horror film. This movie takes place almost a decade later from SOTL. Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore), once famed but now discredited by the FBI gets contacted by a weary, yet refined Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). She trails after him to Florence, a stylish and archaic city full of recorded history from containing some the world's most famed writers and artists.Starling is not the only person that is hunting Lecter. Apparently, a deranged and wealthy lunatic, that survived Hannibals attacks, wants vengeance in the most deranged way no sane or insane man can ever think of. There is a crooked police officer, with an unwanted history of his own, that trails after Lecter as well and uses and abuses people to get to him for his own lusts and greed. A unique pattern develops here which I found particularly interesting and controversial- a theme that I and others believe cost "Hannibal" from getting any Academy Award nominations. You see, all of the noticeable Hannibal stalkers, with the exception of Clarice, are rotten and evil to the core. This makes Hannibal, an "anti hero"- evil for evil. That is one of the reasons why I believe "Hannibal" got no Academy Award nominations, which I vastly disagree with, in my outspoken opinion . The technicals such as lighting, camera, sound, editing and special/ visual effects are all intricately weaved in stark detail and are all "top score". The original score is well spun also and fabulously composed. The directing and writing is above and beyond description. Ridley Scott, in some wave lengths, crosses artistic lines with Stanley Kubrick. Scott's style of directing, is far beyond measure as he is a natural born artist- it shows in fantastic fashion. I'm an artist/ painter as well, since I was age seven. So, I know artistic genuine quality, detail and integrity when I see it- and Scott "is it". The violence in this film is, to say the least, visceral and extreme. It is well directed, crafted and executed by Scott. It is 100% realistic and the continuity is 100% applicable, possible and on target. We see Hannibal, not as a one dimensional human eating machine in SOTL, but a "three dimensional" killer that has other interests and agendas. This is excellent because the writers make Dr. Lecter out to be a well refined, structured, focused and "well seasoned" man of high intelligence, strength and dexterity. This film is not for the faint hearted and simple minded thinkers. You would have to watch this film more than once to understand the detailed concepts. "Hannibal" weaves a detailed web of the Macabre, a type of horror style that originated from such writers Edgar Allan Poe and HP Lovecraft. It also creates a "busy live action painting" of betrayal, dark humor, extreme violence, sadism, opera, forbidden affection and intelligence. Just when the viewers think they have seen it all, the film takes the stunned viewer to the "vomitorium" in the third act. That said and in one scene, in the "vomitorium", made audiences groan and 'reacte'. I'll never forget that segment and that moment."Hannibal" got no Academy Award nominations which, in fact, contradicts everything they stand for. You see, the Academy Awards always talked about how they want and like "realistic" and "plausible" motion pictures about ordinary or conventional 'people, places or things'. Well, "Hannibal" has a significant amount of those qualities and qualifications, but it didn't get nominated anyways. This has made me very disappointed in them. There is no excuse for that. None. Their decision to cross "Hannibal" off the list of getting Oscar knods was merely, in my opinion, 'clear politics' and I haven't watched the Oscars since. The film should have got, at least, 4 following nominations: (1): Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), (2) Best Screenplay, (3) Best Director, (4) Best Original Score."Hannibal" is a revolutionary horror film- a trend setter. Many people were majorly or minorly disturbed by the film and that is another key factor I respect about the movie. It put a "marker" in peoples minds. The film is controversial for touching issues that people don't want to talk about or too afraid to face. The films brings it up from the deep confines of either denial or unawareness. The film is intensily realistic and a masterpiece of monumental proportions...Five stars out of five.Tom Millan "Indie Filmmaker"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot:Based on the novel Hannibal starts off ten years after Silence with Lecter still on the loose and Clarice an established agent in the FBI. After screwing up on the job Clarice played in the sequel by Julianne Moore is forced to take a case dealing with Hannibal Lecter. This case is brought up by Hannibal's fourth victim the very wealth and disfigured Mason Verger played disturbingly by Gary Oldman who has put out a 3 million dollar reward for anything leading to the capture of Hannibal Lecter.Hannibal who escaped to Buenos Aires in Silence now lives in Florence(not surprising he did mention Florence in Silence) and is recognized by a detective who plans to capture Lecter for the reward.However not knowing what hes dealing with is killed in the process and tells Hannibal about Mason Verger.While questioning the detective his cellphone rings and after ten years Clarice and Hannibal make contact. Now after conversing Hannibal decides to go back to the U.S and play cat and mouse with Clarice after she is temporarily discharged after District Attorney Paul Krendler plants evidence that Clarice has made contact with Lecter and is later found.Finding out what Krendler has done Lecter follows him to his beach house and drugs him. When Lecter asks Clarice to meet at Union Station Masons henchmen follow and capture Lecter in front of Clarice. Hannibal being captured and Mason ready to make him suffer backfires when Clarice goes to free Lecter and succeeds but gets shot in the process. Leaving Hannibal to save her and takes her to Paul Krendlers beach house where Lecter has planned dinner.Yum!Clarice who wakes up dizzy elegantly dressed calls the police and heads down to dinner with a heavily sedated Krendler and Lecter preparing dinner.Later we find out whats the main course is Krendlers brain. After dinner Lecter cleans up in the kitchen and Clarice decides to knock out Lecter with a candle stick Lecter overpowers her and gets her caught in the refrigerator door. As he kisses her she cunningly hand cuffs him with her and Lecter simply grabs a meat cleaver and asks "above or below the wrist".We see Hannibal strike down the cleaver but we later find out he cut off his own hand. In the end Hannibal escapes and is on a plane. Review:This was a great movie. Anthony Hopkins was scarier than in Silence because now he is out in the open and not in cell. Though Jodie Foster didn't return for the sequel Julianne Moore did just fine with her accent and tough attitude considering she isn't a trainee anymore.Some great performances by its supporting cast such as Gary Oldman as Mason who seems very disturbing and psychotic. And Ray Liotta playing Krendler a real a**hole.I heard that Jonathan Demme would direct this but Ridley Scott is obviously the better choice he kept SOTL's original style but gave it more life with his camera work in Italy and making Clarices workspace look more creepier than ever and Hannibal's new look with the clothes and not the jumpsuit.Written by two great writers David Mamet(Glenngarry Glenn Ross,Spartan,Wag the Dog) and Steven Zallian(Schindler's List) this film succeeds in every way possible with no faults. Id recommend it to fans of Silence and people interested in seeing a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest mistake most people make is that they compare this movie to "Silence of the Lambs". But please try not to, try to see this as an individual movie, this way you'll enjoy it more and maybe then you'll see how wonderful this movie truly is.From the excellent "action movie" like beginning till the tense and gross ending this movie knows how to scare you, excite you, amuse you and disgust you.Some people say the Hannibal character isn't scary enough because he isn't behind glass this time. I have to disagree. The way he stalks and make inspector Pazzi(Giancarlo Giannini) feel very uncomfortable is done very well and really scary. There's only one thing in the movie that scares me more and that's Mason Verger (an unrecognizable and brilliant Gary Oldman) His face is absolutely disgusting in a good way.Getting Ridley Scott to direct this movie was a great move. The atmosphere is really good and dark. Hans Zimmer delivers a nice soundtrack that really sets the mood. But what's even better is the cinematography. The scene's in the movie are beautiful and it's like you're watching a moving painting. (Especially the Florance, Italy scene's)Absolutely wonderful!

		<fullReview>While hard to compare to its predecessor (Silence of the Lambs was a true masterpiece) the reintroduction of Hannibal Lecter, M.D. has truly been worth the 10 year wait.The film strikes a very different tone from the outset, and this is down largely to director Ridley Scott. He and Sir Anthony Hopkins are having fun with this character and Hannibal (film and character) is very funny, albeit with a dark slightly twisted sense of humour. Hannibal is, essentially, the hero here and you like him and route for him to the end (which is quite different from the book.)I will not go into plot as most people have probably read the book and saying more could only work to spoil the enjoyment so I will now just tackle the actors and production. Needless to say the film looks spectacular. The Florentine sets are breathtaking, but what else would you expect from the director of Blade Runner, Gladiator and Thelma &amp; Louise - we know Ridley Scott can deliver the visuals.As for the actors, Hopkins delivers the goods as we have come to expect from him. But here he is having a blast with a character he clearly enjoys inhabiting and he is rarely more powerful and commanding a presence than he is in this film and Lambs.An unrecognisable Gary Oldman (and uncredited it the opening titles and on posters) holds his own as subvillain Mason Verger, Lecter's only surviving victim and the flashback of his mutilation is well handled. The film does provide plenty of gory surprises.As for the key question, what of Julianne Moore? We all know how good an actress she is (Magnolia, Short Cuts, Boogie Nights) but can she fill Jodie Foster's Oscar winning shoes? The answer is yes! You will not give Foster a second thought in this film as Moore is Clarice Starling from the moment she appears. She is not trying to be Jodie Foster, she IS Clarice Starling. Hannibal is more a cat and mouse chase than the one-to-one Silence of the Lambs and it is difficult to imagine Foster playing this side of the character. That is the key, showing a different side to the character gives Moore something to work with more substantial than just being Jodie Foster. Personally I love both actresses but I wouldn't want Foster in this role (having seen it) if you paid me. This is Moore's part and she equips herself well.See this film, marvel and then see it again. It may not quite be the masterpiece of Silence of the Lambs but it's close and it's a lot more entertaining. You'll laugh, you'll sit on the edge of your seat, you'll say "now that's just plain sick!"Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good sequel, better than The Silence of the Lambs in my opinion...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hannibal starts with FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) involved in a drugs shoot-out where her partner is killed &amp; she herself kills a woman carrying a baby. Her bosses at the FBI aren't happy &amp; decide to make her disappear by putting her back on the Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) case as he is still a wanted man. The FBI has recently received new information from Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), a child abuser &amp; Lecter's 4th victim whom he cut the face off &amp; fed to his dog. Now horribly disfigured Verger thinks of nothing but revenge &amp; provides Clarice with information that leads to Florence where Italian police inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) has discovered that Dr. Fell an arts academic is in fact the notorious cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter. However instead of going to the FBI Pazzi decides to sell the information to Verger, Lecter soon finds himself on the run from Mason's men, the FBI &amp; several large flesh eating pigs...This English American co-production was directed by Ridley Scott who, to some extent, had the almost impossible &amp; thankless task of making a sequel to the multi Oscar winning hugely successful horror/thriller The Silence of the Lambs (1991) which I myself thought was a great film. Persoanlly I actually think Hannibal is a better, more entertaining film that I would rather watch than the slightly overrated original. The script by David Mamet &amp; Steven Zaillian was again based on a novel by Thomas Harris &amp; is a different sort of film to the original with enough variation to stand on it's own, it moves along at a fair pace although there are a few slow patches here &amp; there. While watching Hannibal I was thinking beauty &amp; the beast, it uses elegant classical music &amp; features the beautiful Italian city of Florence along with it's impressive architecture. While at the same time Hannibal also features plenty of nastiness, spilled guts, cannibalism, corruption, greed, murder &amp; betrayal. I thought it made for an excellent &amp; interesting contrast &amp; I thought it worked extremely well. Most of the character's in Hannibal come across as bad guys although the central figure of Hannibal is as fascinating &amp; alluring as ever, even though he's a ruthless cannibalistic killer you like him, I'm not sure why but it's true.Director Scott does a great job &amp; that divide between the exquisite &amp; the sleaze creates a good atmosphere, the film is fantastically shot &amp; has lots of style. There are numerous great scenes here, from killer pigs to the infamous dinner at the end. The special effects are very good &amp; I honestly didn't recognise Oldman under all that make-up. There's some decent gore here &amp; it's maybe a little gory for the average viewer, there's slit throats, stabbings, shootings, cannibalism &amp; 'that' scene at the end that freaks everyone I know out even if I mention it!With a supposed budget of about $87,000,000 Hannibal is extremely well made although I have to say I was very surprised to learn that it cost that much although it is suggested that there's at least another hour of footage that was cut from the final version so maybe some of those $'s ended up on the cutting room floor. The acting is great, Hopkins as Hannibal is class, Moore does OK as Starling &amp; fills Jodie Foster's shoes well enough.Hannibal is a good film, no actually it's a very good film &amp; I think it's a more entertaining film than the original. Despite it's slightly overlong running time &amp; the odd dull patch I liked it, it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that. A sequel Young Hannibal: Behind the Mask (2007) is a prequel that features Hannibal Lecter as a teenager so no Anthony Hopkins...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the worst, but not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed some of "Hannibal". It felt like it did have some closure to "Silence of the Lambs". But they waited too long for the sequel. It had some memorable scenes. Especially the end, but I won't give it away. Um, as for the movie, I wouldn't want to see it again. I've never been into the "Silence of the Lambs" trilogy. It's just me maybe.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You are all wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am sick of all these "Hannibal is garbage" comments... It is a great movie that shows us a different part of Dr.Lecter, a more human side that is capable of love. I for one, liked this better than "the silence of the lambs" ..it has a warmer feeling, a cultural side, filled with some kind of pleasurable "aroma"... Anthony Hopkins puts out a remarkable performance and I like Julianne Moore so much more than Jodie Foster. The movie presents the Lecter character in all his splendor and as it shows the strange feelings that this brilliant mad man has for Clarice (the female officer that intrigued him from the very beginning), J.Moore fits perfectly in the role. More beautiful, more feminine than Jodie. Also, the main character, Hopkins, the guy I want to see, in this movie, is in the center of the action, he is the hunted one, he IS the action. In Silence of the Lambs he appears for 15 minutes ( he won an Oscar anyway:) ). Overall, I felt Hannibal a lot closer to what I like than the first Lecter movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many problems to count</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had so many things wrong with I'm not sure where to begin. The biggest flaw in my mind is simply that Anthony Hopkins wasn't scary as Hannibal Lector in this one. In The Silence of the Lambs he was like a wickedly intelligent, caged animal who'd strike horribly if given any opportunity, not necessarily to escape prison, but just because he was a psychopath. In Hannibal, as a free man he spends almost all of the movie just being a normal person, attending shows, working, travelling, drinking his Espressos, etc, and there's just nothing intense or creepy about any of it. Given the fact that Anthony Hopkins is also visibly a decade older and a good bit heavier than he was in the original, he seems rather harmless, just like any guy you'd pass on the street.Another somewhat major problem with Hannibal is that the plot was really lacking. It seemed as though the events of the movie were just an excuse to reunite us with the two characters. You do have to appreciate the lengths with which the film=makers went to, to make sure that every person killed in the movie was done so in some uniquely, and often outrageously gruesome way. But what left me the most disappointed however, was the fact that director decided to scrap the book's somewhat cool, albeit far-out ending in favor of... basically no ending at all. What they gave us here as far as I can tell, didn't answer anything, didn't resolve anything, didn't sum anything up. The movie just kind of stopped going after two hours and they rolled the credits.Hannibal the movie was totally style over substance, almost a complete reversal from The Silence of the Lambs. Here again, we have a highly anticipated sequel that costs about 8 times as much, but totally doesn't live up to the original in terms of the finer points, like possessing a little meaning, depth, or intensity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hannibal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>10 years after the first time we saw probably the most evil film villain, he returns to terrorise us even more, and trust me, he just as bad, maybe worse than before. Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins in his Oscar winning role) escaped some years ago from his cell, it is Clarice Starling's (Julianne Moore, instead of Oscar winner Jodie Foster who refused) to find him. They became concerned with him again after a call from a survivor of his monstrosity, Mason Verger (a surprising and hideous Gary Oldman), and Hannibal's put on the police's most wanted list. Throughout the film Hannibal does many horrifying things, but I don't remember him eating anybody, unless you count the ending when he has part of a man's head. Also starring Ray Liotta as Paul Krendler. In this film, the three most horrifying things Hannibal does is slid and hang a man from a theatre hall roof, cuts Liotta's head open and makes him eat part of his own brain, and the last moment, a kid on a plane eats a bit of this brain! Sir Ridley Scott truly captures almost the same horror that Jonathan Demme did. Sir Anthony Hopkins was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 3 on The World's Greatest Actor, and Hannibal Lecter was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains. Good!</fullReview>
