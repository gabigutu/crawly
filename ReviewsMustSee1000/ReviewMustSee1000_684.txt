		<shortDescription>This movie should be on everyone's "must-see" list</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A touching yet humorous tale, THE FISHER KING brings together amongst the best performances given by Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges, as well as Terry Gilliam's finest directorial effort. Solid supporting performances by Amanda Plummer and Mercedes Ruehl round out a great film that ranks among my personal favorites.Bridges portrays an arrogant radio shock-jock, who's big mouth and flippant comments send a disturbed listener on a murderous rampage, thus ending his career. Enter Ruehl as his new enabler girlfriend, waiting patiently for him to drag himself up from the dregs, hoping to catch a ride to the top. Just when Bridges seems to have hit rock bottom, he encounters Williams, a crazed vagrant who thinks he is a knight in shining armor.What ensues is a tale of remorse, redemption and rebirth which is made all the more magical by Gilliam's magnificent vision. Most notable is a scene which takes place in Grand Central Station where the hustle and bustle of the busy commuters dissolves into a spectacular waltz as Williams follows Plummer, the woman of his dreams. Gilliam's style makes Williams delusions come alive as the character makes the slow journey from trauma-induced insanity to stark, yet hopeful, reality. Every character in this film undergoes a metamorphosis, each learning from the others along the transformation. It is a beautiful film to watch, and an achievement to all involved that subject matter of such depth can come across with such humor and with such beauty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terry Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam has made a lot of good films and a couple of great ones(namely Twelve Monkeys and Brazil)this, though could well be his best.Why ?For starters there is the cast.Jeff Bridges,officially the most underrated actor of his generation, giving a performance that veers from one end of the spectrum to the other almost imperceptibly.From comedy to tragedy and back again.Robin Williams- a great comedian and a better actor than he is given credit for.Fair enough he does tend to go through spells of making films primarily for his kids (Mrs.Doubtfire, Hook, Jack) but when he does decide to buckle down and do a serious role he rarely disappoints (Good Will Hunting, Insomnia, Dead Poets Society).It is with this role though that Williams gives what is the best of his career to date,as Parry. He is undoubtedly insane, but it is not yet too late for him, he justs needs someone to take the effort to save him, and if it had not been for Bridges colossal mistake and subsequent search for redemption, no-one would have done it, and he would never have survived, merely another casualty of another one of Gilliams nightmarish cityscapes. Mercedes Ruehl is perfect as Bridges suffering girlfriend.She thinks of herself as hard-bitten a survivor, and yet she continues to stay with Bridges, trying to prove to herself that she has the strength to change him, to redeem him. She wants to be his saviour, and yet he comes in the shape of a homeless madman, prone to dancing naked in Central Park and seeing floating fairies whilst defecating.The Fisher King is a movie about hope, despair and redemption, and all of the human conditions that fit in between.It contains one of the most inspired,beautiful scenes in recent memory,as Grand Central station transforms from a dingy,noisy concrete hole into a luscious, gorgeous ballroom, simply because of Lydia, Parrys love, the one thing that keeps him grounded in any semblance of reality.The chinese restaurant double- date in which Parry connects with her for the first time is both funny and touching, and makes what comes after even more tragic. It is at times tragic,brutal even but it's heart cannot be doubted,and it remains a wonderful success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie with depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie's plot has been discussed enough, no need to rehash it here. I just wanted to add a few observations. In my opinion this is one of Robin Williams' best performances. I know that at the time he was heavily involved in Comic Releif and this story about mentally ill homeless men and acceptance of all types of people really fits the PC Comic Releif mentality, but he really did a great job here, portraying Parry, a man lost in fantasies of knights and ladies.Jeff Bridges is very Howard Stern-like as Jack Lucas, the insulated, rude talk show host. In 1991 Stern was still a New York thing, but being that his "fame" has since spread, we see who the character was based on with a little more clarity now.Michael Jeter as the homeless, depressed former cabaret singer was a delight in every scene he was featured in. His "singing telegram" scene to Lydia in her office was a classic.Mercedes Ruehl also stood out as sort of living outside this crazy world that Jack Lucas finds himself thrust into. Her home is a haven and scenes shot there are usually scenes of a return to normalcy in the story, a grounding.David Hyde Pierce has pretty much found his niche as the asexual, slightly fey character. This was basically a toned-down Niles Crane in a hat here.Amazing movie. Like other Terry Gilliam movies, they unwind like dreams and have the look of otherworldliness. I am sorry that the homeless people arent giddy and uplifting enough for some viewers, but in reality it is a pretty stark existance.Recommended highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redemption and Resurrection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Possible spoilers.The Fisher King, a 1991 film directed by Terry Gilliam is based on the myth of the same name-a medieval legend that tells the tale of a dying king who through betrayal and tragedy has lost the Holy Grail. Ostensibly the cup Jesus used at the last supper and into which drops of his blood were collected at the crucifixion, it is the only thing that can save him. He knows this but he is powerless to do anything about it, and although it is right in front of him, he can no longer have the ability to recognize it. It takes an innocent fool with unclouded eyes and a compassionate heart to see it and to fill it with the healing water that the Fisher King needs to be restored. In the film version, Parry (Robin Williams) and Jack (Jeff Bridges) alternately play the fool and the king, each in retreat from his own reality and each the vehicle for the other's redemption. Their lives first intersect when Jack-a shock jock-inadvertently incites a disturbed listener to commit a horrific act of violence that destroys many lives including Parry's. Parry escapes into madness and homelessness, as in a sense does Jack (though his is manifested through alcohol and a parasitic relationship) and they are each lost in a world of guilt that they are powerless to overcome. It will take each to play the fool to the other's king to open each another's eyes to the possibility of redemption and new life. Other characters are interwoven (Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer aptly play the love interests) but it is Parry and Jack who are both the redeemed and the redeemer in this tale. There are stops and starts and other theological and social messages that are interwoven throughout, but this is first and foremost a story about healing the wounds of others, and the importance of giving over receiving. Through Parry's redeeming act, Jack is redeemed and through Jack's redeeming act, so is Parry. Unable to heal or even see their own wounds, they clearly see the wounds of the other, and like Christ, they provide the bridge to life. The Holy Grail, visible only through the compassionate eyes of the fool, becomes the cup filled with the water of life from which they both take a drink and are resurrected. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams should have won an Oscar for this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Fisher King" is one of those movies that shows how, although we can't get over certain incidents, they may end up leading to our redemption. Jeff Bridges plays Jack Lucas, a New York radio talk show host. One day, he makes a mean remark to one of his listeners, and the listener murders some people. When it gets reported that the man had done this after a remark by Lucas, Jack knows that his career is over, but also realizes how he has been affecting people.Some years later, Jack is wondering the streets and meets Parry (Robin Williams), a homeless man whose mind is gone. Parry believes Jack to be a sort of hero and Jack can't get him to think otherwise. So, the two accompany each other from then on.Probably the movie's most interesting aspect was how director Terry Gilliam shows what is happening in Parry's imagination, contrasting it with reality. The Red Knight and Holy Grail make for some unusual scenes. This may be Robin Williams' best performance ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect Robin Williams movie (and much more)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is really exceptional in a lot of ways. It's got one of those plots, full of ironic reversals and personal struggle, that's been turned into melodramatic trash in every creative medium ever invented. With Robin Williams as the magic crazy guy and Jeff Bridges in an 80s ponytail, the ways the basic concept could have gone awry (in other hands) are truly frightening to contemplate. But with Terry Gilliam at the helm, The Fisher King speaks to your emotions more directly and powerfully than 90% of the movies out there without degenerating into sappiness. Perhaps the most brilliant acheivement of this movie is the way it takes Robin Williams' crazy-improvisational persona and makes it an integral part of the story. Instead of being a tacked-on adjunct to the "real" movie, Williams' stream-of-consciousness patter is essential to the work as a whole.At the same time, Gilliam is making an almost-mainstream movie for the first time in his career, while explicitly referencing his past (the Holy Grail). It all comes together into a movie you will never forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming From A Completely Different Direction Than Any Film Remotely Like It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fisher King can be viewed as an oddball dramedy like several others during one's initial viewing, but then suddenly you're struck by the hallucinations of Robin Williams's character, namely the sight of the large, outlandish, scorching red figure of a demonic knight coming to kill him. Things like this seem at once to throw the film out of balance a little bit, like the film is making a straight line and suddenly makes a sharp and brief stab upward, and then back down to continue the line in the straight way it was before. One has to think about The Fisher King and realize just how largely, outlandishly, scorchingly different it is. Think about this plot when you're watching the film. You'll realize how well it modestly unravels instead of contriving itself to mystify us. The filmmakers show no ego and are not interested in impressing themselves. They are telling their vivid, dynamic story the way good films are made. The story is just completely fresh and new. And with that in mind, thinking outside the box along with Terry Gilliam and Richard LaGravanese, one shouldn't even think of the brief sporadic fantasies the film splashes at us here and there as anything so jolting.Jeff Bridges turns in a fantastic, despicably likable performance. I say this not so much because I believe he has a universal effect on anyone who understands or enjoys the movie. I say this more because I related to him greatly. I felt like his character was very familiar with his self-centered angst, bitterness lathered on top, an emotional and sexual nature quite like mine, and frankly the performance in a serious relationship quite like mine. Bridges, who I have always thought of as a very good actor, has my kudos for understanding to the point of successful portrayal a type of person who is rarely completely understood.Robin Williams, constantly underrated at this point for his self-indulgent bombast and personally difficult, nonstop communication of his sense of humor, is proved in this, as well as several other films I could mention, that he has true talent and feels his characters to the very core and projects as such. It is not and never has been right to reduce judgment upon him to surprisingly shameless look-at-me-fests like Mrs. Doubtfire, Patch Adams, and Good Morning, Vietnam, because he has always been tremendously capable. Above all, I think he is an actor whose work is founded upon intuition. He communicates his physical and psychological portrayal by emotional understanding and deep feeling. When you watch this film, do you not have that clutching grip upon his character's pain? Are you not taking that journey face to face with him?Mercedes Ruehl is not a token here. She is not just the voluptuous Brooklyn Jew girlfriend who nags, criticizes men, and makes dinner the whole time. That is the way her character lays out, because that is the path the emotional position of her presence in the story leads. She is perhaps the strongest, most decisive, and understanding person of all four main characters, and believably so. She is also very sexy and very natural. Take the scene with her and Bridges stumbling with laughter down the street after the dinner scene. She is quite real in a scene that with many other players would've been annoyingly not so.Amanda Plummer is a sad portrait of a very realistic person, ironically enough in a film that is greatly surreal. She is the lone wolf that drifts through life, crippled by a complete lack of self-assurance and with age has become extremely used to it. Plummer's rich, seldom screen time is great, very wise acting. When she is suddenly accosted by the attention and adoration of these other three people, she reacts, and I feel like I know many people who would react the same way.The Fisher King is in my opinion the first great film Terry Gilliam ever made. He had never made a bad film before this one, but this is the film that really made me connect. It's filled with emotional understanding of the human condition and a parallel story and cinematic style that are so acutely unique and naturally offbeat. It is among the definitive Gilliam films. Perhaps the click that sounded off for a truly effective film came with the connection of very similar, very compatible perspectives between the writer and the director. It's a determined, forceful, emotional, passionate, and secretive movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! Sooooooooo overlooked. A mini-masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched Robin Williams/Jeff Bridges in this "fairytale" more times than I count. Finally bought it. You have to watch it at least twice , in my opinion,because the first time all I could do was try to let it "settle in".I love movies that hit me broadsided and then blind me! I keep trying to watch it with my daughter, who only likes love stories, but if I can keep her still long enough she'll find out that this IS a love story, of the most incredible kind. A love story for all mankind.I hate to gush, but if it's ever called for, it's called for here.The first time I saw it, I was soooooooo impressed with Mercedes Rhuel's performance and actually said to my friend in the theatre, "That woman's gonna get nominated for the Oscar for this performance", which of course she won for her performance. So, I'm not so unsophisticated after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still amazing on a 4 inch screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first rented this movie out, it was like an enchantment, even on a 4 inch screen. It was a tape but still, i felt the magic in the movie its self. But the Fisher King is more than a movie, it is a story of redemption, madness, guilt, sanity, poverty and love. In the movie, all these things come together. Jeff Bridges was always a well respected Hollywood actor. In the Fisher King, he plays a role a lot more different than the star man. He plays a radio talk show host Jack Lucas, a wild, arrogant radio DJ who's advice causes a man to assassinate seven people in a restaurant. Jack Lucas did this unintentionally, but as a result to that, he is now down and out in poverty. When almost killed by thugs, a insane homeless man (Robin Williams), saves Jack, and in the end turns out to be the husband of one of the restaurant victims. Parry (Robin Williams) has lost his sanity because of that. Jack feels so muck guilt that he wishes to help Parry meet with Lydia Sinclair ( the girl that Parry likes, played by Amanda Plummer), and help him find the one thing Parry treasures, the Holy Grail. The performances are incredible. Particualary Mercedes Rhuel, Robin Williams, Amanda Plummer, andJeff Bridges, they stole the show. This should be in the library of the top five fantasy dramas in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbreakingly hysterical dramedy; one of my all-time faves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE FISHER KING (1991) **** Robin Williams, Jeff Bridges, Mercedes Ruehl, Amanda Plummer, Michael Jeter, Tom Waits. Brilliant tragic-farce about a shock jock radio personality (Bridges in top form and criminally overlooked for an Oscar nod!) who goes over the brink into madness when he inadvertently causes a tragedy that he ends up reliving when he comes upon a homeless man (Williams equally brilliant, Best Actor nominee) that has become that way due to his actions. Repercussions and setbacks aside, intriguing character study despite some broad strokes. Daring direction by Terry Gilliam and Ruehl (Oscar winner, Best Supporting Actress) is dead-solid perfect as Bridges' taken for granted lover. Pathos and pathologies aplenty. Astonishing screenplay by Richard La Gravenese (who has a blink-n-miss cameo in the first asylum sequence; he's in a strait-jacket). Look sharp for Kathy Najimi as a video store patron Bridges insults and David Hyde Pierce as Bridges' agent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a modern romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I kept returning to it over they years and I always found it a great and enriching experience to watch. I especially like the shifting incarnations of the legendary Fisher King in this film (the wounded hero, kind of the wasteland, keeper of the holy grail. The archetype of the knight and of the wounded warrior can be seen as one of the prominent archetypes of masculinity we have. By this view, this movie can be seen as a research into masculinity as such. The performances by Bridges, Williams and Ruehl are exquisite. The eighties' New York is a great setting for this ethereal, symbolic quest, and the surreal theatricalness of some of the scenes (a la "Brazil") only adds to the overall artistic congruence of the film. The visuals are great. The movie works on many levels, so apart from this very abstract layer, we get a funny and intelligent comedy about modern misfits - with a great love story, or two. Also, I especially recommend this movie to anyone who loves New York City.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't quite know what to expect with this movie when I first saw it. But I have to say, it exceeded my expectations. I love the performances by Jeff Bridges, Robin Williams, and Michael Jeter. They were all excellent.One of my favorite scenes was were Michael Jeter dresses in drag and starts to sing to the girl of Robin Williams's dreams about a video store. I was laughing so hard at it.I also like the dramatic side of it where we learn that Robin Williams is mentally ill and that he lost his wife a few years ago.This is the must-see for any Robin Williams fan. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Gilliam's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably Gilliam's best film, and certainly his best acted. As usual, Bridges is completely natural and absorbed in his role. This is the only time I've seen Robin Williams combine his best humor with his severe talent for dramatic work. He seamlessly switches from being wildly charismatic to being an empathetic, heart broken man just trying to escape his past. The basic structure is one which has been done many times, but never has it been mastered as Gilliam has done. The parallels in the story are remarkable. Parry's name being short for Parsifal, a knight of the Holy Grail. Parry saves Jack just as Parsifal saved the Fisher King. Also, Parry's flight from the Red Knight is reflected from Parsifal's battle with the Red Knight. Another parallel is seen when Parry's haunted past is brought back to him after kissing Lydia, just as Parsifal is reawakened after kissing Kundry. Gilliam creates all of this beautifully, yet keeps it very subtle and light. The film itself combines outrageous humor, heartwrenching drama and even some thrilling chase scenes. The hallucinations and flashbacks also have a very haunting ambiance to them. The film really is a tour de force on all fronts. As always, Gilliam creates a very haunting yet comfortable ambiance through some of the best cinematography I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could be a treasure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gilliam tries something dramatic......and succeeds?! This is about as quiet as Gilliam's hyperactive, wonky skewed-camera imagery is gonna get, but he really did well with it. Containing a lot of the fantasy conceits he loves and obviously holds dear, it's still a much more, shall we say, realistic look at loneliness and escape.After a shock-radio host accidentally inspires someone to take a sawed-off shotgun into a yuppie coffee shop, he quits his job and falls into a sweaty and alcoholic depression made worse by his own sense of self-involvement turned self-loathing. After a night of drunken rambling, he is saved from a couple of sadistic rich kids by a kind-hearted Robin Hood-style bum who takes the DJ under his wing. Enter self-exploration and learning something about kindness and redemption.The star of this movie is Jeff Bridges, and he does nothing short of spectacularly. This is the third movie I've seen him in, and each time he has played a unique and engaging character very well, so I'm going to chalk him down as one of my new favorite actors. Robin Williams is not so much Robin Williams as he usually is in different roles, though he still mostly is in this one. By that I mean Robin Williams tends to be himself in most roles but in this one there were moments when he was out of typical Robin Williams character and into the character on the screen. It was good to see, very good to see.It's also a very interesting juxtaposition of relationships, one from the viewpoint of a helpless romantic who dreams of knights and castles trying to sweep a lonely and ungraceful girl off her feet, and the other from a couple of bitter New York cynics who both desperately involve themselves in a relationship they don't like despite the fact that they really love each other. It's a weird mix, but it works very appealingly.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fisher King ? Another masterpiece from Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New York is not just a city. New York is a model, model for the "world full of busy people," where the person is too grounded and too occupied to stop, look up into the sky and simply say "look it's beautiful". Jeff Bridges plays a guy, anchor of the popular radio show and his popularity allows him to "make love with his ego." No one can stop him from self obsession, even the beggar knocking on his Porsche car window. Almost nothing can wake Jack Lucas(character played by Jeff Bridges), except for his own announcements in radio, which gives birth to tragedy.His ego can't stand this and turns him into heavy drinker. Once being drunk to death he goes wandering in the streets, thinking about his lost fame, here he encounters character named Parry, played by Robbin Williams. Possibly Gilliam influenced by his early work for Monty Piton(Monty Piton and Holy Grail) turns Parry to a character who seeks Holy Grail, however in this case Grail is just a symbol, symbol which will allow Parry to return to sanity and forget the tragedy which happened to his wife, the tragedy which links to Jack? However before the search for Grail begins the movie prepares us to this point. In the legend of Holy Grail the person should have been prepared to find it finally, he should have faced serious challenges and then become ready for the quest, so does the movie. Parry wants to get possession of the Grail during the whole movie, he knows where it is, however somehow he can't reach it and thinks Jack is the one chosen for this mission, however Jack does not even think finding it. However finally we get to this point and as mentioned above the grail is found and links the various topics of the movie together. The atmosphere in the movie is typical to Gilliam's style, which reminds his early "Brazil" and later work "Fear and loath in Las Vegas". The scenes are overloaded with various subjects, which is normal for Gilliam, the camera moves in experimental way and so on. The movie features "Snap's" "I've got the power" song and appears every time Jack Lukas enters his luxurious house, car or office. However the question in the movie is what real power is, Jack having fun in his pent house, Parry dancing naked in the central park of New York, finding true love (by the end of the movie everything comes to this point), or maybe simply the human relations? The movie raises all of these possibilities and it is up to the viewer to find sense in the messed tale like world of Terry Gilliam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional and sensitive tale about two deranged characters driven into deep craziness by an unexpected distress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Modern Day Tale dealing with The Search For Love, Sanity, Craziness and The Holy Grail . A former self-absorbed radio personality ,the popular DJ Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges), suicidally despondent because of a terrible mistake he made, when a nutty man carries out a slaughter that takes place in a popular New York bar after hearing the radioman speak against Yuppies. He then finds redemption of the unexpected tragedy in helping a deranged homeless named Perry (Robin Williams) , a former professor who turned unhinged and who was an unwitting victim of that mistake and also in desperate need of rescue himself . The ex-DJ strikes up a friendship with the vagabond and both of whom join forces to steal the Holy Grail from the private Library of a New York Socialite . While it is not quoted in the story , Parry's name is short for Parsifal, the "pure fool" and legendary knight of the Holy Grail. Perry brings redemption to Jack Lucas just as Parsifal brings redemption to the Fisher King Amfortas .This is an imaginative , glamorous , chaotic fantasy based on the relations among four characters , though a little bit tedium too and paced in fits and starts . This touching and stirring film contains nice performances from Jeff Bridges as a radio man dejected by remorse and Robin Williams as a homeless become crazy after witnessing his wife's violent death in the bar shooting . Absorbing and overlong tale , both funny and tender, and full of good feeling , emotion , intrigue and human relations . The film cast includes three Oscar winners: Robin Williams, Jeff Bridges and Mercedes Ruehl; and three Oscar nominees: Tom Waits, Dan Futterman and Richard LaGravenese. It's a good picture but relies heavily on the lovely romance between Robin Williams and Amanda Plummer , and the relationship between Jeff Bridges and Mercedes Ruehl ; lacking adventures and action . Nice secondary cast cast as Michael Jeter and David Hyde Pierce and brief appearance of Kathy Najimy , look fast for John de Lancie and Richard LaGrevanese , film's screenwriter, as strait jacket yuppie . Special mention to Mercedes Ruehl who won best supporting actress . Nice scenarios from N.Y. as the "castle" , it is the facade of the Squadron Armory, now part of the Hunter College Campus Schools building, located at 94th and Madison Avenue. This medium-budgeted , under-appreciated film was a flop in the premiere and at the box office , being panned by the critics ; however , today is very well considered . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Roger Pratt, and evocative musical score by George Fenton . This is the first film directed by Terry Gilliam to not feature any other members of Monty Python. The motion picture is imaginatively directed by Terry Gilliam , an expert on wonderful , surreal atmospheres ( Time bandits , Brazil , Baron Munchausen, Doctor Parnasus). The film might be described as an extraordinary human drama full of imagination and color . Rating : Good , better than average . Worthwhile watching .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as it gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While most of Gilliam's work is known for their over-the-top wild madness, which is a good thing, this is his most restrained, most subdued and possibly the single finest film of his career. Throughout there is a sense that life is going on while he just happened to be nearby with a camera, somehow even magically catching the tormented vision of a Red Knight chasing a hapless soul through Central Park.The performances are stunning. Possibly the greatest moment in Williams' career, a chance to "be crazy" but in the sense of someone barely capable of functioning. Ruehl controls her reality, which is small and confined, but it is hers, every inch of it. Plummer, always fascinating, here is heart breaking. Jeter's role is small but perfect in every possible way. Najimy is on screen for about a heartbeat, but is totally memorable.Then, of course, there is: Jeff Bridges as Jack Lucas. Bridges is obvious now, The Dude, Rooster Cogburn, his Crazy Heart beating loud. It is here, though, that the man that has done so much, and from a short line of great actors (father Lloyd and brother Beau as also great) that has given so much, he really deserved the attention that he is only now getting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>one of the best stories about the life in urban jungle and how everything is related. Jeff bridges and robin Williams are perfect. a must must see for anyone who enjoys a good story well told. last but not least the director terry Gilliam adds his most loved extra grim flavor.The Fisher King (by: Richard LaGravenese)It begins with the king as a boy, having to spend the night alone in the forest to prove his courage so he can become king. Now while he is spending the night alone he's visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire appears the holy grail, symbol of God's divine grace. And a voice said to the boy, "You shall be keeper of the grail so that it may heal the hearts of men." But the boy was blinded by greater visions of a life filled with power and glory and beauty. And in this state of radical amazement he felt for a brief moment not like a boy, but invincible, like God, ... so he reached into the fire to take the grail, ... and the grail vanished, ... leaving him with his hand in the fire to be terribly wounded. Now as this boy grew older, his wound grew deeper. Until one day, life for him lost its reason. ... He had no faith in any man, not even himself. ... He couldn't love or feel loved. ... He was sick with experience. He began to die. One day a fool wandered into the castle and found the king alone. And being a fool, he was simple minded, he didn't see a king. He only saw a man alone and in pain. And he asked the king, "What ails you friend?" The king replied, "I'm thirsty. I need some water to cool my throat". So the fool took a cup from beside his bed, filled it with water and handed it to the king. As the king began to drink, he realized his wound was healed. He looked in his hands and there was the holy grail, that which he sought all of his life. And he turned to the fool and said with amazement, "How can you find that which my brightest and bravest could not?" And the fool replied, "I don't know. I only knew that you were thirsty."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>when vanity meets despair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who hasn't known the work of Terry Gilliam, Fisher King is a great starting point. This film contains all the splendid characteristics - drama, comedy, action, a lot of fiction and fantasy- that we usually see on Gilliam's films. and also it has the credit of Robin Williams who gives a true performance on stage. we get to see how the life of a vain and shallow man at his late 30s is turned upside down because of his great idea of himself. we get to watch how he is drown to depression and back to his feet by wacko who believes that the holy grail really exists and is an ornament on 6th Avenue. but what happens when the vanity understands that it itself has caused despair? what could become a movie only to watch with tissues and only admired by women, is a fantastic thriller because of the director. and as a song i prefer these days says, "love is the answer to most of the questions in my heart" don't miss it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true modern classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and probably the best performance Robin Williams ever gave as a dramatic actor, although the competition is stiff. I think I liked him here the best because he is given an opportunity to play his role both serious and silly, and it really showcases his range.The plot has been continuously rehashed, so I won't go into too many details again. I do wonder why this film seems to be so forgotten when it is such a modern classic. In one way it is stuck in the past, in the sense that New York City in 1991 was and had been for twenty or so years regarded as a place with ungovernable grime and crime. In the time that has passed it has really undergone a renaissance. In another way the film is so topical in how it handles the subject of high-priced talking heads and how highly they regard themselves, never giving a thought to the fact that words have consequences. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good start to Terry Gilliam's Trilogy of Americana.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fisher King is the first of Terry Gilliam's Trilogy of Americana (followed up with Twelve Monkeys and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.) The purpose of the Trilogy of Americana is to follow 3 American's (in America no less) as they experiences madness and insanity. The Americana movies are a little less fantastical than Gilliams other movies, but they still manage to have that element of fantasy that Gilliam is known to have in all his movies. In the Fisher King, Robin Williams is basically an insane homeless man who saves Jeff Bridges from being burned to death. Jeff Bridges then makes sure to go out of his way to help Robin Williams anyway he can. Robin Williams is AMAZING in this movie. Honestly, any movie where a person can play crazy very well will win me over. Gilliam has a knack for always having weird and over the top characters in movies, but his characters are never annoyingly over the top, they're over the top in the most entertaining way. I'm glad Williams was nominated for an Oscar for this role. To go from batpoo crazy to spewing an emotional monologue about The Fisher King isn't easy I'm sure. The Fisher King has a great story and great acting. Gilliam's bizarre camera movements were lacking a bit for this movie but that's fine, this movie wasn't the kind of movie that needed jerky movements and epic angles.ThatWasJunk.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie again. (actually I felt compelled to buy it at a video sale). I have always loved it and I continue to be moved by it. The story has such a romantic and poetic quality. It examines the nature of redemption born, not out of guilt and obligation, but out of a truly selfless act of love for another person. The film rivals "The Shawshank Redemption" in its vision of the triumph of the human spirit, and the elements of fantasy are absolutely breathtaking, especially the scene in Grand Central Station. Definitely one of Robin Williams' most moving performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm just going to say it, I love this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen 1400+ movies. There is always what I call a rare breed in which I am so sucked into a film that I praise it is sheer excellence and regarded as a favorite. Terry Gilliam's "The Fisher King" is such a movie. The story's central focus is on Jack, a radio talk-show host (Jeff Bridges) who says insensitive remarks to a caller, who in turn shoots up a diner. 8 people are killed, and so is Jack's career. Three years later, he lives in drunkenness and self-loathing with his long-suffering girlfriend Anne (Mercedes Ruehl). Chance so happens one night that he is rescued from a couple of thugs by a group of homeless men, led by an individual named Parry (Robin Williams). It just so happens that Parry is one of the surviving victims from the diner massacre. As a means of redemption, Jack seeks to aid Parry in wooing a quirky girl, Lydia (Amanda Plummer) whom he has grown smitten with. The plot itself sounds pretty deep and it would make great for a novel. In fact, most of the best movies are based off books (ex: The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption). Surprisingly though, this film is entirely written for the screen-a fresh, original idea. The writer for this movie knew well how to create a story and pack humor, adventure, fantasy, and even tragedy all in one. One of the best scenes in the movie takes place at a train station where Parry follows Lydia through a crowd. The scene starts as a mundane sequence of people walking to and fro, but it slowly morphs into a ballroom dance floor as everyone begins dancing while a lovestruck Parry pursues a clueless Lydia. It is amusing to watch and shows the imagination of Parry coming to life. The characters are not only well-written and well-developed, but the actors make them unique and real. Williams is known mostly for comedy and family films, but he also has an edge for the dramatic roles, as seen in Insomnia and Good Will Hunting. As Parry, he combines both elements of humor and drama to make an unforgettable performance as a good man who has lost his sanity, but is not too far gone from hope. He is funny, heart-warming, and even tragic. Too bad he was up against Tony Hopkins for Silence of the Lambs, for he probably would have won the coveted statue. Jeff Bridges physically and mentally transforms himself from the usual tough, laid back personas he often plays to a man who is trapped in regret and who wants to do something right in his life for his change. This is truly one of his best works. Mercedes Ruehl, who won an Oscar for her performance, is the real screen stealer. She is funny, but also a strong, passionate character that stands by her man and is willing to do just about anything to get him back on his feet. Amanda Plummer is limited in screen time, but she delivers excellent comic timing as the cute, yet dim-witted Lydia. She rivals Jacque Closseau when it comes to sight gags. Besides the writing and performances, director Terry Gilliam crafts a film without it being too much like his other works. HIs emphasis on vector shapes (like Jack's radio room and apartment), tilted camera angles, and sense of the fantastic is present; however, it is not too much in excess. It is different than 12 Monkeys and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen in terms of storytelling style and visual imagery, which I think is a good thing. His work can get very bizarre. This may have been because he did not write the script (unlike Baron Munchausen and 12 Monkeys). Even so, he does a fine job and proves to be a very unique director. The other thing worth noting is that "The Fisher King" explores an aspect that seems to be neglected in movies, and that is the issue of homelessness. While most people think homeless people as lazy bums, this movie shows that there is a reason behind it. Each person has a story of their own and that is what can lead him or her into such an unsavory situation. We're all people after all. But it is a good and hopeful thought for someone to pitch in and help.To sum up, "The Fisher King" is a movie that I was hooked to from start to finish. And this is because of the overall excellence that everyone put in part to film. Great characters, great writing, great storytelling, great direction. There is nothing more I can ask for in a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting, under-appreciated work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You find some pretty wonderful things in the trash" -- ParryThe now-classic waltz scene in Grand Central never fails to touch me in some almost- indescribable way, signifying to me the hidden beauty that lies unnoticed, unrealized, beneath the grit of everyday life, because we never think to look for it.And it's a metaphor for the characters in the movie, too - most are deeply flawed, damaged, whose faults are made plain - yet Gilliam finds and reveals their inner beauty - their dignity, their worth, their joy, their wisdom.The movie is, by turns, screamingly funny, touching, and frightening - the threatening manifestation of Parry's memories, and Parry's terror at it's approach is hair-raising - and affecting, as the nature and source of the monster is revealed.Despite the sudden changes in perspective and tone, Gilliam manages this deftly, and with subtlety. His approach seems a little less ambiguous than some of his other works, and so might be more accessible to audiences - yet never patronizing, nor clichéd. The dialog is often rich and revealing, and Gilliam's distinctive visual sensibility, while muted, remains recognizable - the film is beautifully shot.The acting in this is superlative - Robin Williams, Mercedes Ruehl, Jeff Bridges, and Amanda Plummer all deliver incredible performances - yet Michael Jeter's scenes were perhaps the best of all, his laugh-until-you-cry scenes were just stunning.When you look at Gilliam's filmography, you can't help but notice this constant - he has great actors, delivering some of the best performances of their careers - for instance, I still think the performances by Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt in "12 Monkeys" were among their very best in their careers - this cannot be coincidence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam is not an ordinary filmmaker.His films offer viewers more in terms of psychedelic fun,visual delight,thought provoking ideas and sheer technical brilliance.Terry Gilliam appears to be the modern day distant cousin of maverick,iconoclast filmmakers like Terence Mallick and Alex Cox.All of them are believed to make less films with quality elements."The Fisher King" is one such film which offers an out of the box glimpse into the world of homeless people.It is a world of solidarity,companionship and mutual trust.The Fisher King also discusses the outcome of male-female relationships before the arrival of Internet to inform us as to why some of the relationships would not work ? The film is set in a time when video cassettes were a massive rage.Terry Gilliam has even attacked the media for their alleged misuse of power and authority.In this film Robin William shows us one of the most original ways of correcting one's wrong doing.On the technical front there are unusual camera angles which provide visual pleasure of high adrenaline rush-skyscrapers and areas where homeless people live.This film might soon achieve cult film status because of its material.The message of this film is extremely simple:Anyone can become a homeless person any where,any time under any circumstances.This is because a tragedy can strike anyone,anytime,any place.So be nice and kind to your dear ones in order to love them forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You find some pretty wonderful things in the trash"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Terry Gilliam's first film produced back home in his native USA, perhaps a deliberate move to help further establish himself as a serious film director in his own right, and get away from his image as an interesting offshoot of Monty Python. Gilliam had certainly created his own distinct style with the four films he made in the UK, and they are by no means bad ? Brazil is an outright masterpiece ? but with their British-made look, quirky humour, not to mention the odd ex-Python among the cast it was understandable that he would want to move on to a different setting and get out of the Python shadow.So here we have a Gilliam film written by an American (Richard LaGravenese), set in New York and with a Hollywood cast, but in style and content the same Gilliam touch is very much in evidence. Like Brazil this is a complex story and, like all his previous features (with the exception of the inferior Jabberwocky) it deals with the conflict between imagination and the real world. The screenplay thus puts Gilliam on familiar ground, and gives him free reign to create something weird and wonderful ? enter homeless vigilantes, a moustachioed cabaret singer and a fire breathing red knight. In spite of all this the bizarreness is just a little more restrained than in previous Gilliam efforts. All for the best perhaps as it allows him to give more weight to story and character.The plot of The Fisher King is multi-layered and highly original, the best study of guilt and redemption I have seen. While keeping the setting and concerns of present-day America it references Arthurian legend for its story, and any number of classic romance movies for its tone. Gilliam handles this poignant side confidently, as well as introducing that same light, lyrical touch that cropped up in Brazil ? one scene, in which hundreds of commuters in a station concourse suddenly break into ballroom dancing, is done so smoothly it could almost have been something out of a Vincente Minelli musical.What really brings The Fisher King to life though is the top-notch cast. Jeff Bridges plays a character clearly based on shock-jock Howard Stern, and brings him through a radical and very moving development. Mercedes Ruehl plays his girlfriend, creating a character who is at once over-the-top and utterly believable, and she deservedly one an Oscar for the part. And then there is the unique Robin Williams as Parry, in one of the best performances of his career, no doubt supplying much of his own dialogue.The Fisher King is Gilliam's second masterpiece. It may lack the constant creativeness of his earlier works, but there is now a greater emotional depth on display. It's a great balance of tragedy and comedy, with a life-affirming resolution that is a counterpoint to the despair of Brazil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant, real-world "Brazil"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fisher King is one of Terry Gilliam's least talked about films, which is a shame considering how detailed and captivating a film it is. Although it features an outstanding cast, it's often misunderstood as simply a drama, or a dark comedy, but no genre can really describe the type of movie Gilliam has created here.Like most Gilliam films, especially Brazil, a large focus is placed on the Goddess figure (in this case, Lydia), the fear of an unspeakable horror and the gradual overcoming of that fear (the Red Knight), and the constant interplay between the fantastic and the mundane. But what makes The Fisher King such an interesting movie is its basis in the real world, in a time that is current. Whereas Brazil, Baron Munchausen, Time Bandits and other Gilliam classics achieve their effect through make-believe worlds, The Fisher King's world is one we are a bit more familiar with. Gilliam's talent is giving us a different sort of glimpse inside something we all take for granted, teetering somewhere between the magical and the mad.There's no need to rehash the plot - if you haven't seen it, The Fisher King is a brilliant movie that everyone should see, and I hope its reputation only improves as time goes on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenging, but perhaps Gilliam's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, a recommendation: reading spoilers for The Fisher King will degrade the viewing experience, much like Citizen Kane or Fight Club.The Fisher King is one of the most complex, intricate, intense, and dynamic films in recent memory. It stars Jeff Bridges as a disc jockey and talk show host whose life changes abruptly, forcing him to confront his mistakes and repair the damage to his old life. Along the way is Robin Williams in one of his first (and, one could argue, most effective) tragicomic roles, after Dead Poets' Society and before Good Will Hunting. At this point in his career, his trademark slapstick comedy had not yet given way to his later deadpan, resulting in ludicrous scenes involving aluminum foil armor, fruit pies, and, eventually, full frontal nudity. Together, the mismatched pair alternately face self-immolation, healing, and the pursuit of their respective romantic interests--with excellent supporting performances by Mercedes Ruehl and the always-weird Amanda Plummer.Terry Gilliam, in his third stint in the director's chair, was faced with a dilemma: his first full-length, Brazil, was too challenging for a mainstream audience, and, despite critical acclaim, bombed. His second, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, tried too hard to be mainstream (along with a slew of other problems), and bombed. Gilliam worked hard to make a movie which didn't tip one way or the other. To some extent, he succeeded: the comedy in The Fisher King has broad appeal; the love stories are Hollywood-acceptable; there are several Baz Luhrman-like song and dance scenes; and the cinematography is beautiful without the unnecessary frills that plagued Brazil. The movie was a mild success. But the ideas that Gilliam presents the audience about homelessness, mental illness, grief, and redemption can be hard to absorb, preventing The Fisher King from receiving a well-deserved Oscar. Furthermore, like Lynch, Gilliam fills all his movies with long sequences of difficult-to-watch scenes, and The Fisher King is no exception. However, persevering through them all yields a rich and rewarding movie experience that will stay with you for a long time after.A final word on Michael Jeter: this vastly underused and underrated character actor gives the finest performance of his career in The Fisher King as a cross-dressing cabaret singer. With his goofy handlebar mustache, hilarious singing, and earnest acting, he, like Williams himself did in Mork and Mindy, steals every scene with talent to spare.All in all, a superb movie. 8.5 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so beautifully done. There isn't a single actor in it who doesn't steal a scene, from the largest to the smallest. Michael Jeeter is fabulous as the cross-dressing prize-o-gram singing a red hot reworded song from 'Gypsy'. Mercedes Ruehl is intoxicating with that accent of hers, especially griping about the lasagna and cracking that card in the video store. It's like a play with carefully crafted moments full of symbolism, laughter, and tremendous pain that gives real meaning to this dromedy. Jeff Bridges as DJ is intense. Robin as mystic is childlike and beautiful. The castle, the fiery knight, the villains... it's a medieval folk story set in the mind of a madman that will suck you in!! The backdrop, a modern-day New York filled with people you know MUST exist, whether hidden or right out in the open, is dark and mysterious and colorful, menacing and friendly all at the same time. The ongoing theme of redemption, captured in the sarcastic tagline "Forgi-i-i-ve me-e-e!!!," leads you along as strongly as it leads Bridges' character; you both need to know Parry's story.My favorite scene: the ballroom dancing in Grand Central station... perfection! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Story, Exemplary Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the one for which Robin Williams should have received an Oscar; for as Parry, the victim of a senseless tragedy, he is nothing short of brilliant in `The Fisher King,' directed by Terry Gilliam and co-starring Jeff Bridges (who also gives an Oscar-worthy performance here). Gilliam has created the perfect mood and atmosphere to tell the story of successful radio talk-show host Jack Lucas (Bridges), and the homeless and mentally unhinged Parry, whose lives intersect in the wake of an act of unconscionable violence that leaves them both barely clinging to the memory of a reality that no longer exists for either of them. With this movie, Gilliam has deftly crafted a study of the symbiotic existence of mankind and the impact of human nature upon the space we all must share in a world growing smaller day by day. Through Jack's eyes, Gilliam examines the nature of cause and effect, and the results thereof, and Jack's story ultimately becomes Parry's story, and aptly illustrates how the needs of one become the necessity of another, and what it means to finally be able to look beyond ourselves and delve beneath those layers of contemporary frivolity we all manage to build, which in the end are nothing more than pretentious insulations that keep us from the things in life that really matter. Even as Jack's own act of irresponsibility comes back to haunt him and make him question his own values to the very core of his being, Parry receives the brunt of it all from the other end of the spectrum, with consequences even more dire, though for both the result of their shared circumstance is life-altering. Williams gives a masterful performance here that illuminates so well how thin the line between comedy and drama really is. He brings the complex, tragic figure of Parry to the screen flawlessly, with attitude, expression and even body language that is impeccable, and all without a single false moment to be found anywhere throughout (by comparison, even as good as he was in `Good Will Hunting,' for which he received the B.S.A. Oscar, under close scrutiny you'll find a moment or two there that do not ring true). This is quite simply the best work he's ever done, before or since, and he's given the cinematic world an unforgettable character that will undoubtedly make a lasting impression on anyone who sees this film. And, though Williams grabs the lion's share of the spotlight here, he by no means overshadows Jeff Bridges, who has also created a memorable character in Jack. He brings a depth to this role through which he readily displays the many different levels upon which Jack works and lives, from the egotistical, self-centered to the compassionate; it's like watching a struggle for domination going on within him, and waiting to find out which side will ultimately emerge triumphant. It's an exemplary performance, and it's a gross miscarriage of justice that Bridges didn't at least receive a nomination for Best Actor for this one. Proving, however, that justice does, at times, get it's due, Mercedes Ruehl was awarded the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her personable portrayal of Anne, the fulcrum upon which Jack and Parry dramatically balance their tender and tentative psyches. Like Bridges and Williams, she gives a performance here that is totally credible, and she's a delight to watch. One of the strengths of this movie, in fact, is the incredible performances; and it's so gratifying to see such a good story brought to life and made so real through artistic endeavor. In a supporting role, Michael Jeter demands to be singled out for his part as the homeless Cabaret Singer, and also Amanda Plummer, as the hapless and endearing Lydia, both of whom are just additional parts of the aggregate that make this such a great movie. With `The Fisher King,' Gilliam has given us a wonderfully textured morality tale, both entertaining and engaging and rich with metaphor and substance that will endure the test of time, because it is, in the end, a story for the ages. This is definitely one you do not want to let pass you by. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly I don't understand all the enthusiasm!?Plot? There is no real plot. OK fine there is one, a very classical arrogant successful guy hits a rock, sinks low, and then discovers generosity and helping others which makes him a better person. Yawn. OK, not yawn per se, but yawn in this film.Acting? - Robin Williams is Robin Williams in a one man show, or close to one; he does his usual part when someone lets him, i.e. if you remove his costume in your imagination you find that you could be in pretty much any other made for Robin Williams (Patch Adams, Mrs Doubtfire, Jumanji, etc.) He overacts so much and so constantly that it kills much of the movie that isn't Robin Williams - Jeff Bridges does his usual slow-moving, quiet, I'm not really sure I understand what is going on here thing. A bit like in K-Pax in many ways. He is at his best when he plays that he's drunk. - Amanda Plummer looks exactly like, hey I am a young actress and I worked hard and watched a lot of people with some mental and behavioural issues and look at how well I can portray such a person, only no, at no time is she even remotely credible. Someone go watch Jodie Foster in Nell, or Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. - Mercedes Ruehl shines among this crowd. She is the only truly credible character, she acts, she has presence, it works. And what helps is that she has a "nice guy" part where she is kind, lovable, generous, you name it. Her award was well deserved.Filming / editing / pace? - something just doesn't work. Some bits are terribly terribly slow and without much if any content, but yet not achieving any particular depth that would justify this slow pace. Some bits are full of agitation and screaming but not sure why. Oh and there is the Red Knight which isn't really that useful and seems lifted directly from Baron Munchausen (where Robin Wiliams had a part btw).Bottom-line? Not a good arrogance meets punishment meets redemption movie. Average to downright terrible acting (or at any rate, overly dominant and very monotonous). Issues with pace. Terry Gilliam has made several films that I really like - but this one just doesn't work for me, sorry. And I really, really don't understand all the super-positive reviews, I just don't. Is no one going to scream, "hey the king is naked!" ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly Robin Williams Best Performance Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What really struck me in "The Fisher King" were the visuals. It was the way in which director Terry Gilliam managed to give us a picture of Parry's insanity. Robin Williams was excellent in the part. It was a perfect character for him - a combination of laughably crazy and tragically insane - and he pulled it off brilliantly, but it's still the imagery that stayed with me. The pictures of the "red knight" that stalked Parry in his mind at least and that wouldn't let him go, even when he thought he had finally escaped and started to return his life to normal with his budding relationship with Lydia (Amanda Plummer.) Those images have a haunting quality to them; they don't easily leave you after the movie's over.After the imagery, it's the performances that stand out in this. As I mentioned, Robin Williams was brilliant as Parry, and Jeff Bridges was almost his equal as Jack - the former radio shock jock whose off the cuff comments led an insane man to shoot up a bar , which led to Parry's wife being killed in front of him and resulted in his insanity. Obviously, Parry's life is devastated. Jack's life is devastated. The story picks up three years later, when Parry and Jack inadvertently meet, and Jack sees his opportunity for redemption - can he help Parry get his life back?Gilliam did a good job directing this. It starts out tentatively, perhaps a bit slow paced, but it builds brilliantly to what I thought was the real climax - the return of Parry's demons after he walks Lydia to her apartment and says good bye. As he ran screaming through the streets, and ended up beaten and bloodied, it was one of the most powerful scenes I've seen. Well done by Robin Williams. For all the strength of the performances by Wiliams and Bridges, it's surprising to me that the only acting Oscar this won was Best Supporting Actress for Mercedes Ruehl, as Jack's girlfriend Anne. Williams was nominated for Best Actor, but lost to Anthony Hopkins for "Silence of the Lambs." I can't argue with the choice of Hopkins, but Williams was superb. It may be the best performance I've ever seen from him.For me, the biggest weakness to this was the ending. I'd have left it with that climactic scene, and cut out much of what came after. Frankly, I wasn't that taken with the whole "Holy Grail" theme, and the extended scenes of Jack trying to get the Grail didn't do anything for me. I was ready for this to come to a close with that aforementioned scene, even if it had meant Parry's fate being left up in the air. I can live with the happy ending, but the Holy Grail material was just distracting. Still, that ending aside, I enjoyed this immensely. It's a very impressive movie. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange - but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having a public influence is not always a good thing, so does the self centered radio DJ Jack experience when his on-air caller kills seven people, triggered by Jack's flippant comments. This was director Terry Gilliam's first movie made from someone else's script. Parry is played by Robin Williams, is still a classic character of Gilliam from his time with Monty Python - a figure combined with both fantasy and reality.In Gilliam's first movie "Monty Python and the holy grail", the knights searched for the legendary cup. For Parry the grail was a symbolic item for the meaning of his own life, and in "The Fisher King" the destroyed Jack also had a grail to look for. Both Jack and Parry were victims in the same tragedy, and together they try to find a way back to society, their normal lives.There is no real performance by the actors here, it may have been difficult to give life to these characters. But Robin Williams gave maximum to his weird role, and Jeff Bridges also did very well - but I fell for one particular scene with Michael Jeter which gave me a big laugh. However, the actor that gave this movie the classic comedy, was Mercedes Ruehl. Her scenes were very funny to watch - but in a dramatic way.Gilliam's craft is very good, but his product lack courage and originality. The movie is also too long, and I thought it could be cut down at least 20 minutes. The plot took too many directions, but the product was highly praised, received four Academy Award nominations - and won an Oscar for Mercedes Ruehl. All in all it's a very good movie, I think it deserved an 8 star vote from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something of a surprise to watch for the first time 20 years after it was released, THE FISHER KING has all the dazzling visual and verbal complexity you would expect of a Terry Gilliam film but a plot that hangs together rather more cohesively than some of his other movies. The casting is spot-on for all the major characters and the acting is wonderful.Bridges never fails to impress, Williams is suitably un-hinged, as you'd expect at this point in his career, and Plummer is plain strange in an endearing sort of way. The plot alternately makes you laugh out loud, cringe with embarrassment and then wipe a tear away as it veers along like Williams in his over-sized white suite as he tears down a New York street ! It's often grim, ugly and violent but offset by inspired madcap moments that keep it compelling throughout.The restaurant scene is stand-out hilarious, for no obvious reason, and when Williams sang "Lydia the Tattooed Lady" with a line (improvised?) about Michael Jackson, I laughed until the tears ran down my face. Thinking back on it, a day later, I have no idea why, but it still seems funny! It's that kind of a movie. Worth anyone's time to watch although the first ten minutes or so take a little effort I think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A warm and touching drama from visionary director Terry Gilliam, with just the right amount of magical whimsy to make it unique without being cloying.Jeff Bridges and Robin Williams give wonderful performances as a shock-jock radio DJ and the homeless vagrant with whom he strikes up a friendship. Williams, allowed to be outrageous and goofy, received much of the attention, but the film relies on Bridges, whose performance is quieter and less showy but all the more impressive for that. Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer take on the supporting female roles, and Plummer in particular gives a delightfully kooky performance.The film manages to be eccentric without being in love with its own eccentricity, a characteristic I attribute to the way it's directed.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam demonstrates again why he should be considered to be one of the top directors of alternative American film-making in the 20th century (and well beyond, let's hope). A modern take on the classical fairy-tale with an equally classical Gilliamesque (and Kafkaesque) twist. (This is worth seeing just for the dragon and knight rummaging through the New York night alone. What imagery!) Wonderful characters, well performed by a highly characteristic but balanced cast. I found Mercedes Ruehl's performance especially moving. Robin Williams is over the top as usual, and Jeff Bridges borders on the forced, but it all matters little in the end.This is a completely insane film. But it made me smile in a new way. Consider yourself blessed if you're equipped with the kind of humor and sentimentality needed to enjoy this movie :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A radio DJ, Jack, becomes despondent after one of his listeners goes on a killing rampage in New York City. Later he meets up with a homeless man, Parry, whose wife happened to be killed in the shooting. While Parry is clearly insane, Jack decides to help him on his quest for the Holy Grail and in his pursuit of a girl, in order to help himself get over the tragedy.The entire cast is wonderful in their roles. I'm not much of a Robin Williams fan, but this is one role that fits him perfectly, and he does a great job. As others have stated, the Grand Central Station waltz is a great part of movie magic. I also quite enjoyed the monologue given by none other than Tom Waits. This is a funny and touching story about insanity, redemption, hope and love. Anyone looking for an unconventional love story, look no further.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen 'The Fisher King' perhaps 10 or 11 years ago, and eagerly watched it again on DVD borrowed from my public library system. It is amazing how much we forget. It was almost like a new movie. It is a mainly under appreciated story of two men whose lives intermingle for the salvation of each. Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges have never been better. It is a tragic story, a drama, but with many funny moments. August 2014 edit: I just watched it again, after Robin Williams' recent death by suicide.SPOILERS follow, for my own recollection, please read no further.Jack Lucas (Bridges) is a self-centered radio personality with an early morning talk show, where he gives trivial and flippant advice to the callers. At the end of this particular day his sign-off message was 'Thank God I'm me!' Soon he learns that his last caller, Edwin, took his advice seriously and killed 7 plus himself. His bubble burst, we see Jack 3 years later, an angry, paranoid boozer with a girlfriend who loves him. He works, badly, in her video store. Then, weights on his feet, ready to end it all in the river, punks show up to torment him, but Parry (Williams) and his bum friends show up to torment and chase off the punks. 'Parry's" real name is Harry Sagan, a former professor who, among other things, had written an unpublished manuscript 'The Fisher King,' right before he went off the deep end, 3 years earlier, when his wife was one of the 7 killed by 'Edwin.' In his delusional state he is hunting for 'the holy grail', which he believes is in a castle-like home in Manhattan. He says he sees 'little fat people' who speak to him, and an evil knight, aflame, on a horse (which we see too). Ultimately the friendship that develops between Jack and 'Parry' brings both of them back to life. Jack because he feels responsible for the death of 'Parry's' wife. A cute side story is 'Parry's' affection from afar of a homely, awkward lady named Lydia. Jack and his girlfriend conspire to help bring the two of them together. That, plus Jack's scaling the castle-home to bring back a silver cup, 'Parry's' grail, bring 'Parry' back from a catatonic state after a beating by punks. Now Harry Sagan again, he has a new girlfriend, while Jack realizes what life is about, professes love for his girlfriend. The movie ends with Jack and Harry lying naked, at night, in Central Park, watching the stars and the clouds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful story, amazing actors!This movie shows how a normal guy with a normal job and apparently a normal life makes just one "mistake". He is kind of evil in his job but no one sees what is coming. This horrible "mistake" has lots of consequences and we see him 4 or 5 years later. He could not get over this "mistake", it has ruined his life. He is a mess and he thinks his life is not worth living. He tries to kill himself but someone helps him in the funniest and the most beautiful way I have ever seen. This is basically the story. Jeff Bridges and Robin Williams are so amazing, the story is very touching and I admit, I cried once or twice. It is also amazing how the director showed us the world of Parry and the things he sees. Probably one of the best performances of Robin Williams ever! He should definitely have won an Oscar for this movie.</fullReview>

I've been extremely told often how strange I am - I'm okay with that, even a little bit proud of it, but it's always very boring and disappointing when I want to see something strange in another person but me and end up with the same strange-less feeling. SO - from the moment I saw Parry( Robin Williams ) I fell in love with the him - so honest, so pure and so... different. Just another New York lunatic and yet the only person who knows how to make his life interesting. Jeff is flawless too, as always, but there's nothing like the spirit of Robin's character and for everyone is clear that he makes the whole movie.It's good Hollywood has actors like Robin Williams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked very much almost all the movies of Terry Gilliam, even if I think that not all are perfect(specially his recent works), but all share the unique and bizarre style that made him famous in the pasta decades. "The Fisher king" was my favorite, mostly because here Gilliam manages very well to create a moving and emotional tale without missing that eccentric atmosphere of his previous movies, even if in this one there wasn't nothing of fantasy or science fiction. And the most incredible thing, it work well. The performances are very good, no wonder why the actors receive so much nominations. Also there were many scenes that were hilarious and sad at the same time. I'm not sure if this is a masterpiece, but I will say that at least it's one of my favorites.If you liked "Brazil" and "Time Bandits, you shouldn't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was well above my expectations. There was once a photo in a teen-magazine with a short plot outline for this flick. Remembering that, my acquaintance with this film was not a blind date, but still, this movie was "a sealed box with something inside". And it turned out to be one of my greatest movie experiences.The image of the Red Knight is most striking and powerful. To my opinion, it's the image of everything evil in the world and also the personified figure of the devil.Though the director gets rather close to the adult scenes, he never throws them "for a good measure" and it is wise.The movie has a strong tear-jerking potential but not in a "Titanic" way. This movie is absolutely not simple. It is no "Pretty Woman". It is complex and quite engaging. One moment you are smiling and in a minute you are far from feeling high. Then again you rejoice. The mood of the viewer is changing and it changes drastically.Cannot help mentioning the actors' play. A real boozer, a real chattering DJ, a bumbling bum, a teenager-degenerate, a loving woman, a zany, a brooding veteran, and other characters are living their lives on the screen. They are real: with love and compassion or with worms and slime inside.An 8 out of 10. Thank you for attention.</fullReview>

His "waltz" in Grand Central Station (sp?) is a joy to the eye, one of the only really original things here. The script is good but some of the "comedy" is dumb, and it feels set up for Williams to do his "bits", which are annoyingly the same from film to film. Ruehl is excellent with Bridges, and Amanda Plummer is really exciting, although she's forced to play almost as broad (physically) as Williams, just to keep up with him.

		<shortDescription>A tale of love and friendship.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched the film I didn't really give it a fair chance, it was just something to watch. However, after watching the film on countless occasions since, my opinion has vastly changed. First off, Terry Gilliam is now one of my favourite directors; he creates films in his own, bizarre vision, and - in my opinion - generates some visually stunning images.The Fisher King is a departure, in many ways, from some of his previous pieces. The picture is set in New York, which is a far cry from his usual works of fantasy, although there are hints of a fantastical nature, mainly from within Parry's (Robin Williams) mind. Especially note the Waltz scene in the Grand Central Station, which shows Gilliam's flair for extravagant film making to great effect.The cast really take hold of the film and do Terry Gilliam's movie justice. Jeff Bridges was a perfect choice for the character, Jack Lucas, and handled the difficult role of being at the top of the world one minute, and plummeting to the depths of depression in the next. Incidently, other actors considered for the role of Lucas were, amongst other's: Billy crystal, Bill Murray, and Bruce Willis, but these were only brief considerations.Robin Williams also treats us with a great performance as Parry, the bum who loses his 'real life' to a tragic and horrific incident. Also playing important parts are, Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer who play the love interests, respectively, and both use their acting talents to pleasing effect.The film is darkly shot around Gothic settings in Manhattan, even though Richard LaGravense's script was originally picked up by Disney. In my opinion, it would have been a shame to set it as the proposed caper, because Gilliam's dark - although often humorous - creation did the script great justice.I liked this film because it is comical, but also very emotional. I really sympathized with the four main characters; they all have their own problems to deal with, and the film shows how each of them deal with them in their own way.It portrays the fact that friendships can grow against the odds, the basic premise being: No matter who you are, and whatever your interests or backgrounds may be, strong friendships can still form.In short, It is a fantastic tale about love, friendship, and the extents that some people would go to achieve closure. Gilliam followed up 'The Fisher King' with the storming Sci-Fi 'Twelve Monkeys', and 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' of which was an effective take on Hunter.S.Thomson's Pharmaceutical fuelled novel. It looks like Gilliam's proposed project of, 'The Man Who killed Don Quixote' has fallen through, but if he ever gets to helm 'Good Omens', I'm sure that we'll be in for a real treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fisher King (1991) - Directed by: Terry GilliamI was just wandering at the video arcade, when I found this movie by chance. I liked the title, and decided to rent it. I thought to myself "Come on, this must be a great movie. It's a Gilliam's movie!". and I can say: this is one of the best movie I've ever seen. The story is about two guys. One is a depressive DJ, who has suicidal tendencies due to a mistake he made and which led to the murder of seven people at a bar. The other one is a former history professor, who went crazy and turned into a bagger after his wife's death. They meet each other in an evening when Jack (the DJ) is about to be set on fire by some boys. Pattry (the beggar) avoids the tragedy and saves Jack's life. The other day Jack finds out that Pattry's wife was killed in the mass murder that happened at a bar, and for which he has been feeling guilty for the last three years. Here the movie really begins.Jack decides to help Pattry as way to help himself, and they become great friends. It's not interesting to tell by what means Jack helps Pattry. Just let me tell you that he finds redemption in his good deeds. He finds love. He finds life. It's a modern tale, with stunning performances by Robin Williams, Jeff Bridges, Mercedes Ruehl (which won the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role on account of her performance in this movie) and all the rest. I would give 10 out of 10 for this movie. Why? Well, it has an amazing story, fantastic dialogues, great performances, what else can we expect from a movie? I wish our lives could be like a tale. A Gilliam's tale, of course. A movie which won't be forgotten soon. And which is really worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never has New York looked so, magical.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam transforms New York from a cess pool to a place where magic can happen, most notably in Grand Central Station. The movie starts out with Jeff Bridges' intro as shock jock Jack Lucas. We see him as a cold, uncaring, lout. His only concern is getting bigger and better. Only when does he learn that his remarks set off a tragedy, does he start to falter. Through Gilliam's direction, and Bridges' own great acting, we see Jack's world come crumbling down around him, and it's all accomplished by a slow dollying in on Jack's eyes. Three years later, Jack has the odd luck to run into Parry, wonderfully played by Robin Williams. Williams is able to bounce between pure love, unbridled joy, and pain. The most notable scene that has the most gravity in the entire movie is right after Parry leaves Lydia. He starts to remember his former life, and it manifests itself in the form of The Red Knight.</fullReview>

Of course, we have Gilliam's usual shifts between "reality" and "imagination" (sometimes very hard to deal with clearly), between "comedy" and tragedy, and between roles (both main characters are Amfortas and Parsifal in turn or at once). And despite its tame "happy end" (which I found predictable - ought I say that about a Gilliam movie?!), it's a sad film. You find happy end only in imagination, so say the fireworks of the final scene. "Comedy is acting optimistic", says Robin Williams. Or perhaps this isn't sad at all, it's just the real way out?

		<fullReview>Part of the problem with this movie is that it doesn't trust the audience to imagine anything. Instead the director wants to show us.. For example the red knight that symbolizes repressed memories. To me the visual metaphor seemed very hokey. I can conjure far more terrifying visions from my own nightmares. Again with the murder scene. Anyone with a significant other can appreciate the trauma seeing him/her murdered would do. I didn't need the rather cheesy special effects to pound that home. Both flawed attempts at showing us what the characters were/had seen only detracted from the experience for me.The second nail in the coffin was my failure to connect with the characters. It was strange to watch a movie from the era where Williams over-acted as was so popular in the 90s (witness the rise of Jim Carey). In the end despite an energetic performance by Robin, it is hard to "buy" his character. That coupled with the borderline believability of several other characters goes a long ways towards sinking what is essentially a character drama.The real shame here is that the move had great potential and an above average plot. It just didn't feel well executed. 6/10, worth renting if you have made it through the top 250 already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A satisfying modern fable from visionary director Terry Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not the absolute best I've seen from Robin Williams, Jeff Bridges or Terry Gilliam, THE FISHER KING is still wonderful tale of friendship, love, and loss. Jeff Bridges plays Jack Lucas, a rather callous shock jock who makes an offhand remark that influences a listener to commit a murder-suicide. Robin Williams is Parry, a homeless man whose life was severely affected by that act. As the film progresses, the two of them come together and help each other deal with loss in their own ways. While the theme of loss, and accepting it in order to move on, is a subject that's been shown many times in film, Terry Gilliam finds a way to make it seem fresh with his wit and unmistakable cinematic style, even though it's toned down here considerably. Jeff Bridges and Robin Williams also give outstanding performances that are properly nuanced and full of emotional depth. There is also several really funny scenes which showcase Robin Williams gift for humor, despite not being as manic as he can be. Here, his "insanity" is a cover for some deeply held emotion regarding his past (not unlike many comics in real life whose gift for humor masks very real pain). Jeff Bridges also has pain of his own, in the form of guilt over that incident which resulted from his on-air comment. The journey on which these two go, represented in Parry's mind by a quest for a holy grail (Monty Python?) was fascinating and gripping. Gilliam also gets to indulge in some fantastical imagery, as Parry imagines himself a knight with an evil, fiery Red Knight in pursuit of him. However, despite whatever trappings the story might come in, the performances are what make the film. Also of note is Mercedes Ruehl, who also turns in an outstanding showing as Jack's live-in girlfriend (technically, he's her live-in boyfriend). I read online that she won a Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance, and from what I witnessed she definitely deserved it. If there's one issue I take with the story, it's that it perpetuates the movie stereotype of the wise and wacky homeless man, even though Robin Williams plays it so well. There were also a few scenes that could have been trimmed. But overall, it was a pleasantly satisfying experience that spoke to me on a personal level, and that I enjoyed watching.</fullReview>

After hearing a popular DJ rail against yuppies, a madman carries out a massacre in a popular New York bar. Dejected and remorseful, the DJ strikes up a friendship with Parry played by Robin Williams, a former professor who became unhinged and then homeless after witnessing his wife's violent death in the bar shooting. The DJ seeks redemption by helping Parry in his quest to recover an item that he believes is the Holy Grail and to win the heart of the woman he loves. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that the film "sweeps you up on waves of humour, heartbreak and ravishing romance." This film is a great character study as all the characters grow during the duration of the film, learning from the others along the transformation. It is such a beautifully sad film to watch that has such beauty also. The Fisher King is a stylish comedy-drama that everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've liked Robin Williams sporadically over the decades, and Terry Gilliam when I was a kid for his mad Monty Python cartoons. But I was 99% certain that I wouldn't like this one my daughter recommended to me and I was right as it's a deliberate mess - potato chips, moonlight and motor trips.DJ ruins at least one man's life but strives for redemption by helping him out, ravelled up with Arthurian legend via Don Quixote and My Man Godfrey. Pointlessness and relentless puerile swearing are mixed up with gratuitous graphic gore and sweet and tender moralising. It reminded me of the kind of talky tripe UK TV used to churn out almost nightly in the '60's and '70's, Play For Today comes to mind. Or Son Of Oblomov on stage. Gilliam tries to be different by copying the olde British TV directors from the Permissive Golden Age. However there are some good images of a fiery Red Knight interspersed throughout for sledgehammer psychological effect. Williams puts in a superb performance as usual, and decidedly had more balls than Jeff Bridges!Gilliam had The Power but chose to collate a series of hackneyed emotions and images to display an urban nightmare; its heart is in the right place but its head is out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic tale about love life and being alone and afraid. and being redeemed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fisher King has power. Real power. It can affect the way you think and the way you feel. When IT was first released in 91 I heard so much about it. That when I did see it well the hype was not a lie. This movie has so much going on and it tells so many different stories at the same time it entertains us. It is most of all a story about hope and redemption after being damned.JAck Lucas is a shock jock. he makes his living by shocking his listeners. When he tells one unbalanced man over the air that the wealthy upper class are no better then inbred animals who are evil and must be stopped . the man takes a shotgun to a popular bar and opens fire killing seven people then himself. Jack is on the cusp of having it all . But after hearing this loses it all. His mind breaks on him. Three years later Broke and penniless Jack is living with Anne. A video store owner who loves him madly. but Jack is broken. he can't love all he feels is guilt. Then he decides in a drunken stupor to end it all. He stands at a bridge ready to jump when a gang of rich kids mistake him for a bum. They drag him off the bridge and beat him up. Then douse him with gas to burn him alive. Then Suddenly a unlikely saviour appears. He is Parry. A man who imagines himself as a Knight. He has a army of homeless people who fight the youths off. and Parry befriends Jack. He tells him the tale of the Fisher King and then shows him the picture of a millionaire and points to a cup like object and claims it's the holy grail. Parry tells Jack that HE is the one to get the Grail for Parry. Jack dismisses it. But Jack finds out in a strange way that Parry was at the bar the night the madman urged on by JAck's words went on a rampage and killed Parry'wife. after that he slipped into a strange kind of madness. Parry was once Henry Sagan a noted historian who taught Grail lore at a university. After his wife's death he slipped into his own world. Jack feel guilty for him. But when Parry shows him a woman he has fallen in love with. Parry is too shy to ask her out or too shy to even speak to her. But JAck takes it upon himself to get these two perfectly matched people together. But fate has other plans for Jack Lucas. and that forms the stunning climax of this incredible movie where love truly does conquers everything. This film is so powerful and so moving . And Roibin Williams is so great in it . You sometimes forget it's just a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff Bridges and Robin Williams may an old couple in "Brazil" director Terry Gilliam's "The Fisher King," a contemporary drama set in New York City about a Howard Stern radio personality and a homeless man. Jack is an abrasive radio phone-in personality who likes to humiliate his callers. One caller that he humiliates decides to shoot up a popular night club where Parry (Robin Williams) and his pretty wife (Lisa Blades) are having fun. This traumatic experience ruins Parry's life and he winds up living in the basement of his apartment building. Meanwhile, Jack suffers from the publicity fall-out of the shooting rampage and moves in with sexy Anne (Oscar winner Mercedes Ruehl of "Lost in Yonkers") who operates a video rental store. One evening when Jack is feeling suicidal and has tied cinder blocks to his boots, two violent young guys with gasoline and matches attack him under a bridge. Parry shows up with an army of homeless people and they rescue Jack. Eventually, Jack and Parry become friends. Jack is such a self-absorbed prick that he cannot even tell Anne that he loves her. Nevertheless, he bonds with Parry. Later, Jack learns the ugly truth that he inspired the alienated psycho who shot up the night club. Now, for the first time, Jack suffers from guilt and struggles to help Parry. Parry has a crush on a Wall Street secretary, Lydia (Amanda Plummer of "Pulp Fiction") who works for a book company that publishes romances. Jack and Anne arrange a double-date with Parry and Lydia. Anne loves Jack, but Jack isn't man enough to reciprocate his sentiments. All along, Parry?who was an English teacher?dreams of finding the Holy Grail. A millionaire has a cup that resembles the Holy Grail that Parry prizes with such a passion. No sooner have Lydia and Parry kissed each other and concluded their first date does Parry witness a mirage of sorts?the Red Knight on a flaming horse?and Parry goes berserk and scrambles off to the same bridge where he met Jack for the first time. The same two punks careen up in their jeep and savagely slash Parry up. At the same time that Parry is being beaten up, Jack feels like he has recovered from the ordeal of Parry's tragedy and he breaks up with Anne. The two of them are shocked when they find a catatonic Parry in a hospital bed wrapped in bandages from head to toe. Okay, "The Fisher King" contains a happy ending, but it is rough going to get there, and you may burn out before this 138-minute melodrama arrives at fade-out. Jeff Bridges plays a colossal jerk who eventually realizes how awful and self-centered that he has been. He risks his neck to steal the Holy Grail and this gesture brings Parry back to life. All along, Lydia has been visiting Parry at the hospital, but he is so out of everything that he doesn't respond to her. The Richard LaGravenese screenplay pulls few punches. You can see traces of "Brazil" in "The Fisher King." Altogether, his male bonding picture is rewarding, and the scenes in the hospital wards foreshadow another Terry Gilliam movie "Twelve Monkeys." Robin Williams is all over the place but he plays it mostly straight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bridges does some fair work, Ruehl is excellent, and Plummer perhaps stands out above both of them, but Robin Williams is brilliant in what I feel to be one of his most heartfelt and passionate performances. The pain and torment felt by his character is overwhelming and inescapable. Bridges plays the role of jaded burnout who manages to find his humanity through it all; he seems to be able to pull it off better than most. Gilliam's influence is all over the film, especially in his frank and honest portrayal of the human condition and his off-balance, skewed camera work. Just a strong piece of work, overall. What more can I say that hasn't been said a million times?</fullReview>

Jeff bridges and robin Williams are superb! talking about a man's quest to get rid of his guilt (Jeff bridges) and then when he meets someone whose pain he has been inadvertently been the cause of (robin Williams) - this movie is a must see for all of us who think that the grail in a sense talks about redemption, and release from past guilts. a RJ who has accidentally set off a chain of events that have staggering consequences is wallowing in self pity and trying to get some semblance of sense in his life gets a jolt when he is attacked and then rescued. meeting Perry has given his life a new channel, and he launches into 'rescuing' Perry from his situation, when he realizes that he has been the cause of it. Little does he know, that in the process, he is the one being saved! i think that this movie is a brilliant watch!</fullReview>

Jeff Bridges, well... Jeff was Jeff, but in this role I believe he went places he had never been before. Great directing. Director did a fair job at depicting homelessness and the fact that not all homeless people are there by choice, but indeed, some are. There were continuity issues, but none too noticeable to the general public. Other than that, it was seamless. Did some research on Gilliam and didn't realize just how many other titles he had been involved with. I liked it. Watched it twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful portrait of to men, one who becomes insane after seing his wife get shot too death and the other one blaming himself for what happened.There are many angles of this movie that might seem strange too the ordinary audience. But not to a Terry Gilliam fan as myself. The former Monthy Python member is a marvelous director, totally unafraid of mixing reality with fantasy, and making them blend together in a series of events that makes perfect sence.SPOILER The scene when the mad man Parry/Harry, played by Robin Williams, followes his beloved girl, played by Amanda Plummer, through a great hall of some kind and everybody in this hall starts too dance waltz with each other, as Perry runs allong after the girl, is probably one of the most beautiful scenes I´ve ever seen. And how cool is it not when the music suddenly stoppes and everybody who just danced with somebody else in a tencion of a second becomes ordinary people in costumes, walking to their works!?!SPOILER 2 Just thinking about the red knight. Is the red knigt a symbol for the past, always hunting Perry, always trying too catch up? When it / he finally does, Perry falls into a coma, after being forced to display the tragic event with his wife in his head again.THE ACTORS! GREAT; GREAT; GREAT!!! Thats all you can say about this. Not only the main caracters, played by Williams and Jeff Bridges, but also the supporting actresses Plummer and Mercedes Ruehl are as good as it gets in this film. Ruehl was rewarded an Oscar for her role.******** 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this film very much. I was struck by the title of the movie Jack selects for the fat red haired customer in the early scene in the video store. That title is Ordinary Peepholes. Perhaps a reference to the movie Ordinary People in which a boy searches for the Love of his mother who cannot show that emotion to her son. That reference would seem to be a clue to the theme of The Fisher King --- the search for love and how to accept love when we find it. The holy grail which seems so important throughout the film turns out to be an ordinary cup awarded to the recepient for some trivial event. So searching for it is more important than finding it. There are so many interesting turns and twists to the screenplay of Fisher King I think it is a film which can be viewed many times and savored each time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fisher King is a dark comedy about how two men who are effected by the same tragic event and then how they cross paths on the road to recovery. Robin Williams turns in a highly inspired performance as Parry, a lovable nut case, who is on a seemingly ludicrous quest. Jeff Bridges portrays Jack, a radio DJ that feels responsible for Parry's situation and who can only find redemption in helping Parry with his quest. The movie is caste in the same dark, dingy mold as Terry Gilman's other films The Search for the Holy Grail, Jabberwocky, Twelve Monkeys and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. The supporting cast does exactly what they are paid for, supporting. They provide an extra spark to the movie that in the end makes it a highly original, intelligent and funny movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life and Fiction - The Fisher King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam has always claimed that the main characters of his films represent him at that time in his life, with The Fisher King this statement could not be more clearer. Both characters in the film Lucas (Jeff Bridges) and Parry (Robin Williams) are men who are searching for a kind of personal redemption, this being Gilliam's follow up to the wildly over budget flop The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), Gilliam needed to prove himself to the film world, and too, like the characters was searching for a form of personal redemption. The story of The Fisher King involves Bridges character Jack Lucas, a successful New York "shock jock" about to make the transition to his own TV show before one of his on-air statements inspires a terrible tragedy. Williams is Parry, the homeless man who appears to have been sent to pull Jack back from despair. But as the plot unfolds we find out that both men need each other if they are to equally feel cured. It's this idea that runs primarily through the film, with writer Richard LaGravenesse (sp) throwing in a romance subplot involving Amanda Plummer's character Lydia, who Parry has fallen madly in love with. The performances are fantastic, with Bridges giving the best work of his career (rivalled only by The Dude in The Big Lebowski (1998) and Williams is good, but he has a tendency to bring to much "Robin Williams" to the role. It was Mercedes Ruehl who won the best Oscar, I would have personally likes it if Amanda Plummer had walked away with something; she brings a pathetic and understated air of tragedy to the role. But at the end of the day this is Gilliam's film and he brings a sense of imagination rarely seen in the American mainstream...7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is in my top ten all time favorite movies. Unfortunately I can't really explain why. Maybe it is because of the time the director takes in carefully developing the intricate characters. Possibly it was the " can't turn my head" anticipation I felt for each pivotal sceen. (shrug) I have no idea? After all, this is no where near the gun smoking, steroid pumping, gasoline spilling, 7,000 RPM, Hemi Cuda style movies I usually like. There wasn't even a gun sceen. O.K. there was one. But that one doesn't really count. To me the movie just had substance. And if you know anything about psychology, it even has a significant reality base. If the last ten new releases you've watched are all started to seem like one long mini-series, pick this one up. It is definitely a fresh break from the type of movies being made lately! Oh, don't eat popcorn while your watching this show. The movie is highly cerebral. It is packed with underlying plot. You won't want to miss a thing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know that Gilliam is the man. this is his (in my opinion) his best work. Always one to have an underlying message, here he makes it just subtle enough, but not as abstract as Brazil.Jeff Bridges is Jack Lucas, a popular radio DJ on the verge of greatness. All of this goes down the tubes when he inadvertantly coaxes a listner into a brutal shooting.3 years later, poor, paranoid, and suicidal, he meets Parry, a dillusional homeless man(Robin Williams at his finest). Jack feels he must help Parry, and thus begins his search for redemption.There isn't a slacker in the cast, the visuals are beautiful (as is the case with all of Gilliam's work) and the story is romantic and funny.Technically, there is only one flaw, a blatant jump cut. But that is easy to ignore, as this movie never lets up and is thoroughly enjoyable.In addition to the two stars, who are in their prime, catch the solid supporting cast, especially Mercedes Rhuel (who won an Oscar) and Amanda Plummer.This is my one and only Favorite Movie Of All Time.

		<shortDescription>Strong Film Making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very powerful film that hooked me right from the start. Crisp and entertaining screenplay, Believable characters that come to life very strong and convincing on the screen, and what a Rollercoaster of a story.Director Terry Gilliam leads this character play with dreamlike imagery and completes a very smart and enjoyable overall piece of cinema. The moods drop and change. One minute you are laughing heartily with the characters, the next you are tangled in their tortured lives. Brilliant layered film making (as you can only expect from Gilliam) with more than one thing hooking your eye and imagination in most of the scenes. He captures the characters as they feel, almost as if no one is supposed to be paying attention.I really cant begin to trace out the storyline. You have a Melancholy Ex-radio Host (Jeff Bridges), A semi-insane, semi-genius homeless man (Robin Williams), The quiet reclusive accountant (Amanda Plummer), and all the other memorable yet important characters that come in and out of the story like bacteria under a microscope. Like I said, its basically a character play and you play the role of the voyeur.Recommended - Check it out! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams' Shining Hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though Robin Williams seems doomed to star in mediocre, saccharine dramedies for the remainder of his career, we will always have this film to look back upon with bittersweet reflection, pining for the Robin that might have been. For the most part, it's director Terry Gilliam who deserves the most credit here. In the hands of a lesser director (oh, say Chris Columbus) this would have just been one more cutsey Robin flop. As it is, Gilliam never allows the movie to succumb to melodrama, which would have been all too easy for a story about a man who loses his mind after a horrible tragedy. Instead, Gilliam keeps Williams' character in the thick of his dementia, making him a disquieting thing for the audience to observe and all the more heartbreaking for it. Then there's Jeff Bridges, always in top form, playing the damaged ego to Williams' runaway id. It's a rare thing to see two actors play lost souls so well, to where self pity and defeat seem like incurable diseases, that the audience can't help but feel a personal stake in their salvation. Add in superb performances by Mercedes Reuhl and Amanda Plummer and this becomes a movie with almost no false moments; a story of faith and forgiveness in an age where there's precious little of either. Williams might have had very few bright moments since then (Toys, Good Will Hunting, perhaps) but this performance will shine for some time to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I definetly do. One of the most unique movies of that year. A delightful, funny touching, honest and ultimately uplifting movie. Normally, I'm not too crazy about movies in which all the problems work themselves out in the end, but this one was done so well I couldn't help but buying it. The first thing that makes this movie so touching is the writing by Richard LaGravenese is excellent. Each character is distinct and has their own voice. The dialogue is not only dramatic, funny and insightful but it's delivered in such a natural way. No line appears forced. You really believe that these characters could exist. Terry Gilliam is the perfect director for this movie. Using huge crane shots and obscure first person point of view camera angles really puts you into the character shoes. The visuals in the Fisher king are a perfect compliment to LaGravenese's writing and only help make the story clearer. In the hands of another director this movie could become too talky or too visual. There is a perfect balance between the two. And lets not let me forget the acting which was superb. Jeff Bridges is excellent. He brings a natural cynicism to ex- radio shock jock Jack Lucas. Robin Williams is his usual self with his larger than life lunacy. Mercedes Ruehl is also very good as Jacks boss/ girlfriend. And I can't forget Amanda plummer who is the perfect compliment to Robin Williams. She seems to make a career out of quirky off beat roles. All in all everything was there. The holy trinity of great writing, directing and acting contributed equally to make this an extremely enjoyable film. And a new favorite of mine. Yes, I like New York in June, how about you?</fullReview>

Parry (Williams) is not completely out of touch (see the scene as Jack picks out a suit for Parry). I may have a biased view of this film, as I have always enjoyed Arthurian legend. But do see this.

		<shortDescription>Magic right in the middle of New York</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scene I love about Fisher king is the moment when Jeff Bridges climbes a castle's wall with a rope in the middle of New York, and having a quick look at the street below him, declares(translation 'cause I am french)."I'm lucky. In this town, no one takes the time to look up"This sentence perfectly sums up the idea developed in the film : the holy graal is different with each person ; but it has to exist in a rather material world.That's what brings so much magic in this film, and give you the impression when you get out of the cinema and jump into the street, that you suddenly land.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie. Probably the best movie of the 80's and certainly the best Terry Gilliam movie since the Monty Python's. Jack Lucas is a drunken ex. DJ who meets a person while wandering the streets of New York whom he is in debt to. Robin Williams is perfect as the mildly crazy man who thinks the he is a knight of the old code in a world populated with dragons and red knights. Jeff Bridges also stars in his part as the DJ Jack Lucas who orders a man to revolt against the upper class, and who realize his mistake in a brutal way.This is a logic movie and one of the few Gilliam movies that actually has an ending - unlike ex. Twelve Monkeys.Totally watchable 10/10. What a hit!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, or anyone who knows me, would call myself an avid movie watcher with much to say on the subject. And this movie is one of my two all-time favorite (the other being the Princess Bride). The movie is both touching and comic, but there is something underlying in the themes that really touched me. Pay close attention to Parry's story of 'The Fisher King,' because I think that is what really sold me on the film. It's a must-see, I'm not guaranteeing that everyone will like it (in fact, many probably won't) because it does get a bit long at times. But regardless of whether you love, like or hate the movie, it's definitely not a waste of time.</fullReview>

The movies give us Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, but, in truth, our mates are human. Jack and Anne are human, with human frailties. They give us life as it is and as it can be. A wonderful film that is a must for everyone in a relationship of any sort. The "Red Knight" will be hurt by the small screen, but Robin William's tour-de-force performance will more than make up for it. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorites....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I really admire Terry Gilliam's work. Brazil, 12 Monkeys, all the Monty Python films, and even Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas were all fantastic, but this has got to be my favorite of his films.The whole cast is brilliant and the story keeps you thinking throughout the entire film. Jeff Bridges is flawless, but it is Robin Williams that steals the show with his portrayal of Perry. His acting tends to either bore me (Awakenings, Good Will Hunting) or annoy the hell out of me (Mrs. Doubtfire), but he is perfect here. Amanda Plummer and Mercedes Ruehl are quite good as well. Also, keep on the lookout for Tom Waits' cameo in the hospital.I won't go into a long dissertation about Gilliam's cinematic genius - all you have to do is see the ballroom dancing sequence in Grand Central Station in this film to know why I love his films so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd Goes Mainstream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Terry Gilliam best known for some odd and off-kilter movies such as Brazil (1985) and 12 Monkeys (1995) brings to the screen the wacky antics of Robin Williams's earlier Mork and Mindy (1978) television series, Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) and even the more subdued dramatic flair of his Dead Poets Society (1991) as a precursor to Gilliam's later film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009) as well as mainstreaming his earlier Brazil work for the masses. The rich balance between harsh drama and crazy comedy stands out in this movie, among the most difficult of directorial tasks and it barely, but effectively succeeds. While the ending of the movie is pure American mainstream commodity, the rest of the movie maintains a fascinating and captivating elements of unpredictable delight and intrigue. The immersion into the mentally ill is well captured in both exaggerated but heart-felt sensitivity. This movie incorporate many universal themes raging from materialistic selfish pride, to loving devotion, to great loss and suffering. This movie almost in a genre and topical interest of its own echoes Slaughter-House Five (1972), Lars and the Real Girl (2007), Slip Stream (2007); Clockwork Orange (1971); Being John Malkovich (2000), Twelve Monkeys (1996); He Was a Quiet Man (2007).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An almost fairytale esquire movie,The Fisher King is a movie that is touching,dramatic and funny.Jeff Bridges plays a cynical,arrogant,shock-jock talk-back radio host by the name of Jack Lucas who's comments on air inadvertently provoke a psychotic caller to murder multiple people at a local bar.Three years later,Jack becomes suicidally despondent and is attacked by ruffians because of being mistaken as a homeless man.He faces almost certain death until a deluded homeless man by the name of Parry(Robin Williams) comes to his rescue and is on a self-proclaimed mission to find the Holy Grail.Comments made through dialogue later in the movie suggest that Parry is the murderer.In my view,Robin Williams should have won the Oscar for Best Actor as he gave one of the best performances in his career and that Jeff Bridges should have been nominated for an Oscar as well as Terry Gilliam for Best Director but the film won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for Mercedes Ruehl.A good movie nonetheless with a good cast(Robin Williams,Jeff Bridges,Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Good and then good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every morning I browse the IMDb website just to get the low down on my favourite movies. I am not sure how but I came across the synopsis for The Fisher King. So I then went to my favourite DVD site and found that the movie was one of a three for ten pounds offer (I'm British by the way) and I purchased it. A couple of days latter three packets dropped through my letterbox and as fate would have the first one I opened was the Fisher King so I put the DVD in the player and watched. The Fisher King is an extremely moving film about how one mans carelessness can devastate lives. Once this character realises what he has done he drops out so to speak and then through a twist of fate he is rescued by a man whose life has been devastated by the careless remark. The character played by Jeff Bridges then tries to redeem himself by helping the Robin Williams character. He is supported by his girlfriend (the actress deservedly won an Oscar for her performance) and Amanda Plummer was enchanting as Robin William's love interest. For me this was a film where I dearly wanted everything to come good in the end. A really good film and worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Terry Gilliam's least bizarre pictures but still pretty bizarre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fisher King is one of Terry Gilliam's least bizarre adventures but it certainly is a wonderfully bizarre movie by the standards of the average movie. Jeff Bridges, in a role that seems fairly similar to his persona in The Big Lebowski, plays an emotionally devoid radio DJ who hits rock bottom when one of his callers goes on a killing spree. Three years later, he's an unemployed bum who feeds off a live-in girlfriend (Ruehl in an a role that won her the supporting actress Oscar) who runs a video store in Brooklyn. His life turns around when in a drunken stupor he falls into an alleyway where on the verge of getting beaten to death, a crazy homeless man named (Robin Williams) saves his life. The lives of the two become interconnected as Bridges' character learns that Perry (Williams) was once a respected professor of medieval history whose downfall into the bottom rungs of society he is indirectly responsible for.Gilliams' films are usually bizarre visually, but this is one of the few Gilliam films that possesses that wonderful sense of imagination in its storyline (the other one would probably be Brazil). It's thoroughly engaging and has a good amount of depth below the surface. It was also probably the most challenging role of Williams' career to date and holds up as one of his best. It does not fit the typical Robin Williams' mold of inspiring leader (i.e. Patch Adams, Dead Poets' Society, What Dreams May Come), the funnyman (i.e. Flubber, Good Morning Vietnam) or his desperate attempts to go against type performances in 2002 (Insomnia and One-Hour Photo). His role in Fisher King combines perverted elements of Robin Williams the funnyman, Robin Williams the romantic, and unique elements of Robin Williams' range that have never been seen before or since.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was reading about the chocolate Jesus controversy yesterday and thinking about Tom Waits song "chocolate Jesus" - actually, singing it:Well its got to be a chocolate Jesus Make me feel good inside Got to be a chocolate Jesus Keep me satisfiedAnd there, on the Fisher King, was Tom Waits sitting in a wheelchair in Grand Central Station. Weird.I am not a big fan of either Jeff Bridges or Robin Williams. I only watched this film because a friend recommended it. I did like Willams in Good Morning Vietnam and Good Will Hunting; and I like Bridges in K-PAX. But I have to say that both turned in performances that absolutely blew me away. I mean stay up past my bedtimes, and not to watch Florida win it's third championship, but to watch this movie.I am not into summarizing, others can do that, but just to say that this film will keep you on the edge of your seat by the performances of the actors involved. Besides Williams and Bridges, Mercedes Ruehl, whom I don't ever recall seeing, turned in an Oscar-worthy performance. Even Amanda Plummer (Pulp Fiction), in a small but significant role, turned in a performance that immensely added to my enjoyment.The only thing I guess I missed was the director, Terry Gilliam's use of symbology from Monty Python. Not having seen those movies, I was not in on the meaning, But, that aside, I was definitely in on the story of pain, trauma, love, and life that this movie represents. If it is not one you are familiar with, see it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges) is a successful radio-host almost at the top of his career with a cynical stick-it-to-the-man attitude. Unwittingly, he inadvertently provokes a psychotic listener to kill the patrons and himself in a small café with a shotgun... Then we meet Jack Lucas, 4 years later. His career is destroyed and he spends most of his time feeling guilty and wallowing in self-pity. He gets by living off his girlfriend. One night when he's feeling particularly bad, he goes out on a binge and ends up in the nastier parts of town. He's about to get killed by a gang when Parry (Robin Williams) and his friends come to his rescue. Parry is a mentally insane bum who nevertheless takes care of Jack. Jack then later learns that Parry lost his former life and his mental health an evening 4 years ago in a café when a psychotic radio-listener shot his wife in the head with a shotgun.Jack Lucas, ridden with guilt, sees his opportunity not only to save Parry, but to save himself in the process. Throw in some holy grail legend, a red knight (the manifestation of Parry's past), interesting characters and romancing subplots and you got yourself an adventurous, sometimes hilarious and heart-warming movie.Personally, I think this is Terry Gilliam at his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An offbeat treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff Bridges is the disgraced radio DJ whose downward slide leads him to meet Robin Williams' loopy street crawler leading to a series of escapades that involves knights, dating, the Holy Grail and video club membership. Terry Gilliam's tragicomedy is a lively, thoroughly entertaining and often hilarious treat which isn't afraid to enjoy itself in the light of its offbeat story. Bridges and Williams are invaluable in their roles and light up the screen with an array of memorable moments. The dual romantic sub-plot involving the pair's relationship with the two women in their lives (Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer) takes centre-stage for the film's middle portion and does become somewhat tedious as the on-street exchanges between the two men are more rewarding. Yet, for the most part, The Fisher King shines as a delightfully amusing piece of screwball entertainment.</fullReview>

What Lucas discovers is that one of the lives lost in that restaurant was Perry's wife, and Perry was present at the time. Lucas is then determined to make the wrong things right. It doesn't quite decide what it wants to be, at times it is comical and other times it is deadly serious, but the result is certainly engaging, and judging by the Camera work/hyper paced performances you could see how this would come from the same guy who directed `Brazil.'</fullReview>

Gilliam is able to accomplish much to this story, along with some fine and eccentric performances by much of the cast, into a sometimes moving, sometimes oddly funny and consistently surreal picture, one of his best to be sure.

Jeff Bridges (The Contender) plays popular radio disc jockey Jack, whose advice inspires a madman to commit a shooting at a restaurant. Mercedes Ruehl (Oscar-winning) plays Anne, the patient yet suffering girlfriend of Jack (and owner of a video store). And finally, Amanda Plummer who plays Lydia, whom Parry falls in love with.One night under terrible circumstances, Jack and Parry meet. Later, Jack finds out Parry's former wife was killed in the restaurant shooting and has been living on the streets ever since. To show his guilt, (not known to Parry), Jack helps Parry in the quest for the Holy Grail and in meeting Lydia.Sounds simple but there's wa-a-a-a-a-a-y more to the story than just what I've mentioned.

		<shortDescription>Terry Gilliam's best achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fisher King is an extremely powerful movie that touches upon a host of weighty issues, including the ultimate meaningless of material success, the cruelties and insensitivities of modern life, and the unbearable weight of knowing a life lived only for oneself is not worth living. Through it all, however, the film delivers the message that love and redemption are attainable. While this description sounds preachy and sermonesque, the movie is not. Jeff Bridges, in possibly his best role, plays a "shock jock" radio host whose casual cruelty in dismissing a disturbed caller leads to real-world tragedy. This sets him on a downward spiral that seems destined to continue when he meets Robin Williams, a former college professor rendered psychotic by the same incident. But in introducing Bridges to Williams, fate gives Bridges a rare second chance. The film is by turns funny, thoughtful and poignant, and both Bridges and Williams (as well as Mercedes Ruehl) are terrific. In an era when most Hollywood movies are simply mindless, illogical bubblegum fare, the Fisher King deftly takes on some of the most unsettling questions about life, love, and our ability to connect with one another, and does so in a provocative and intelligent way. A truly unique and memorable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Robin Williams' best performances, and that's saying something.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Richard LaGravenese. I love Terry Gilliam. I love this movie. Everyone loves Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges; that goes without saying. Each and every actor in this movie gives a sparkling performance. They are all great actors, that is true enough, but credit must go to the director as the enabler, the catalyst. This movie is a prime example of the magic that happens when there is a confluence of a great screenwriter, a great director, and great actors. How does this happen? Like the movie's story, like life in general, it is the combination of random, accidental events, and direction we set for ourselves. Parry had chosen the direction of being a school teacher and presumably living a normal life, when the accidental event of his wife's murder radically altered the course of his life.For me, the central story was the love story between Parry and Lydia. How many guys can identify with Parry! His adoration from afar. His fear of approaching his beloved. His not knowing how to dress. His not knowing what to say. His indifference to her flaws. But the scene where they are standing at her front door, and he looks into her eyes, he has become completely rational, completely sane, regaining for a moment his old personality that he had before he was traumatized. Parry: "I'm not coming up to your apartment. That was never my intention. Oh I want to. I have a hard-on for you the size of Florida. But I don't want just one night. I have a confession I have to make to you. I'm in love with you. Not just from tonight. I've known you for a long time. I know you come out from work at noon. I know if its a good day if you stop and get that romance novel at that bookstore. On Wednesdays you go to that dim sum parlor. I know... I love you. I think you're the greatest thing since spice racks. And I'd be knocked out several times if I could just have that first kiss. And I won't be distant. I'll call you if you let me. But I still don't drink coffee." Terry Gilliam has the ability to mix absurdly fantastic scenes with scenes of everyday life seamlessly. Doing so conveys the story with impact and emotion, capturing our attention, fascinating us. No one in the audience nods off during this film. Is it an accident that in an earlier incarnation, Terry Gilliam was involved with a troupe that made movies about Holy Grails and The Meaning of Life? It is no accident that both of those subjects are given a much more satisfying treatment in The Fisher King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgiiiiive Me, But I Just Love "The Fisher King"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing the trailers for this movie back in 1990/1991. It was obvious that the studio had no clue about how to market it: one preview made it look like a zany comedy; another one months later pitched it as an adventure story. I smelled 'disaster', and yet I went to see it, because I like Terry Gilliam and Jeff Bridges. After multiple viewings, it became one of my top five films of all time. What can I say about the wonderful, indescribable anarchy that is "The Fisher King"? Part buddy-movie, part love-story, it is a parable for a society where cynicism is the height of chic, and genuine emotion is passe. It features four of the most heart-wrenchingly real and affecting displays of film-acting artistry ever in one movie. The main actors perfectly inhabit their roles, giving perhaps the best performances of their careers (although I have seen very few of Amanda Plummer's pictures, it is hard to imagine her topping this). Jeff Bridges is great, as always, playing the how-the-mighty-have-fallen character that the rest of the movie hinges on. Mercedes Ruehl is superb (Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) as Anne, the tough-talking babe with a soft heart for Bridges' self-loathing, embittered Jack. Robin Williams keeps his manic side just enough in check that he does not become tiresome, and he creates a memorable portrait of the schizophrenic Parry. Amanda Plummer finds some tidbits of self-respect in her cripplingly shy and self-conscious Lydia.Another strength is the Oscar-nominated screenplay by Richard LaGravenese. Tellingly, there is a single author, unlike the multi-writer rehashes so common in current (July '01) movies. Without ever lecturing, "The Fisher King" addresses serious issues: homelessness, AIDS, mental illness, mass murder, public health care, the pervasive influence of mass media. Yet much of the film is quite humorous. The dialog is insightful and very witty, giving each character their own voice.*****SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!*******The excellent writing and performances join forces to create some unforgettable, genuinely moving scenes. The "I don't drink coffee" exchange between Parry and Lydia, the breakup scene between Jack and Anne, Parry's mad flight to the river, the "Home Free" sequence including Jack's encounter with Michael Jeter's character, Tom Waits' cameo as a 'moral traffic light' - any one of these would be a standout moment in any movie. "The Fisher King" is just one gem after another, with very few weak scenes (Jack's burglary of 'the Grail', Parry's monologue about the 'fat fairies').***************END SPOILERS!!!****************  Terry Gilliam finds just the right tone for the material. He uses Parry's madness to introduce the fantasy elements found in all of his films. The visuals are perfectly in sync with the story: odd shifts in perspective, unusual camera angles are used to open up Parry and Jack's New York for the audience. By entering Parry's world, Jack discovers that worldly success is meaningless without true love (the real 'Holy Grail'). "The Fisher King" is one of the most unapologetically romantic movies ever made. This is one of those exceedingly rare times where all of the elements - the writing, acting, Gilliam's fantasy touches, the evocative score, and the storyline of personal redemption, unselfishness, and true love - come together to create a truly enjoyable, unique, and rewarding movie. And I guarantee that you will never look at a homeless person the same way after seeing it. SIMPLY BRILLIANT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam is a genius. Of course we already knew that from Monty Python and Brazil. But here he reconfirms his status and shows his ability at creating omni-genre films (something he did again later with the superb Twelve Monkeys). I'm already a devoted fan.

		<shortDescription>The Fantastic King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's such a fantastic movie!Only by the craze thoughts we can see homeless and street people as a knights of the city. And they are true barring their own sad and deep sorrow and insanity like us.It's one of the coolest Jeff Bridges movie (I think), and Robin Williams expertise. But true Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer stole attention there, as a women who's not just being a partner, but being oneself; someone who can hold and keep the guys alive and sane with faith and love.And the surrealist style of Terry Gilliam is so strong and vivid, and give bigger bite in Fisher King.I invite you to a New York City Fairy Tale: The Fisher King. A must see movie especially on Saturday night evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilliam's heart-warming classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a strange thing that happens with Terry Gilliam films: While he's making his grandiose fantasies, life starts imitating art.It happened with Brazil - one man takes on a bureaucratic industry; The Adventures of Baron Munchausen - a teller of tall tales incurs the wrath of the authorities, and in arguably his best film, The Fisher King, a disillusioned ruler finds his heart thanks to a humble servant. In this case, Gilliam was the King of outlandish big screen adventures, made cynical when his previous film flopped. Richard La Gravanese was the unknown screenwriter whose heart-warming tale reinvigorated the Monty Python veteran.It's an old fashioned love story and a heart warming tale of redemption that has lost little of its impact in the years since its release.Gilliam may be seen by many to be a mad genius, but in a crazy but rather safe world of Hollywood, where most film-makers are emulating the last big hit, he has always stuck his neck out and come up with the goods.After countless projects - including a version of comic book hit, Watchmen, fell by the wayside. the director started wondering if he'd ever make another film. Then he received a script by newcomer La Gravanese - who has since gone on to pen heart-warming movies such as The Bridges of Madison County and The Mirror Has Two Faces. Suddenly, Terry realised that less is definitely more and ditched his trademark, sweeping visions of cities under siege and elaborate, gothic sets for more humble backdrops.The movie centres on Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges), a superstar talk radio DJ in the Howard Stern mould. After advising an unhinged fan to wipe out a yuppie watering hole, Lucas is naturally shocked when the madman obliges. Following many months of regret, the suicidal Lucas is saved from a gang of thugs by tramp Parry (Robin Williams). It turns out the two men's fates are intertwined in a plot twist which leads Jack to try and make amends. Back in 1991, Gilliam realised that huge budgets and inspired special effects may be great eye candy but compared to the power of four well-drawn actors and a cracking script, all the fireworks in China couldn't recreate the dramatic fireworks that ignite the screen here. At the time, Williams was one of the world's biggest box office draws but many were growing tired of his familiar manic patter. As a result, he seems to be the weakest link in a quartet of actors including the sublime Bridges, Amanda Plummer and Mercedes Ruehl (who picked up an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress).A sublime comedy drama which is filled with many notable scenes: Bridges sat at the foot of a statue in Central Park with a Pinocchio Doll; Williams' rendition of I Like New York In June; Ruehl's sassy video shop owner, Anne, and Plummer's oddball loner, Lydia, attempting to choose a video in Anne's shop - look out for Munchausen and Brazil posters dotted around the premises as a Gilliam in-joke. It's also littered with familiar faces including John De Lancie (Star Trek's Q), Frasier's David Hyde Pierce and Tom Waits as a disabled veteran. Don't miss the jaw-dropping dance scene at Grand Central Station, the hilarious meal and Michael Jeter as the outrageously camp singing telegram. The movie also boasts some fine photography by Gilliam's regular collaborator Roger Pratt. There are far too many memorable moments to include here so "forgive me," for not listing them all.Best thing is just curl up on the sofa with the tipple of your choice and let the magic wash over you as the King of cinema reveals his greatest treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most original and touching film of the 90's: a true masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, there are 3 movies which are by far the best of the decade: in strict chronological order, right after DANCES WITH WOLVES (dir. K. Costner, 1990)and three years before PULP FICTION (dir. Q. Tarantino,1994),here comes THE FISHER KING.This picture has all the visionary lunacy of former Monty Python Terry Gilliam, the consistent screen writing of Richard La Gravenese, and most of all it benefits from an authentic "state of grace" of all the 4 main characters, here playing the best roles of their respective careers (Mercedes Ruhel got an Academy Award for her performance as supporting actress but, in this strangely marvelous film, all four actors would have deserved an Oscar for supporting acting, since there is no one better than the other three, being all 4 perfect).New York had never been filmed with both realism (the sound is magnificent) and fairy tales magic. In particular, the scene of the waltz in the hall of Grand Central Station, deserves a well earned spot in movie history (along with other righteusly memorable dancing scenes: from THE LEOPARD Burt Lancaster-Claudia Cardinale duo to PULP FICTION John Travolta-Uma Thurman swing contest, etc.).The narration is compelling, the situations tragic or funny or moving or simply fun, many script lines truly unforgettable, and so many picture frames just kinetically perfect. One for all: when Parry lies in bed at the public hospital, still unconscious, we see all other patients in bed too, all of them dressed in white or grey, like the beds themselves, the walls, the door and window frames. Only Parry is dressed in a clean and freshly ironed, colorful, childish pyjama: it is a sharp, fast and effective "depiction" of what difference love makes.The movie shows, in a way very difficult to equal, compassion, tolerance, forgiveness, hope, without using the over-used melodramatic tools, but instead going down an utterly different path: the fall and rise of simple extraordinary human beings, helping one another to find the Grail of redemption.An absolute 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilliam's Most Rewarding Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film came as a surprise to me; I'm not normally Gilliam's biggest fan but I was entertained and moved by this movie. Gilliam's New York in this film is a place of madness; fallen minds seem to have filled up the asylums which we see so packed, and the overflow has fallen out onto the streets. It's a Gilliam dreamscape more accessable than that of, say, 12 Monkeys or Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas, because in spite of the flame-breathing horses and waltzers in Grand Central Station, it's set against a backdrop of realism and familiarity. As we see Bridges scaling a castle tower on Central Park East, a yellow cab drives by underneath. It's much closer to the world we understand ourselves, which immediately allows us to draw closer to the characters in a way that seems difficult in his other, more surreal visions.The hugely underrated Jeff Bridges is excellent as the fallen-from-grace DJ trying to hold on to his own mind while Robin Williams delivers what must surely be seen as a career high performance (along with Good Will Hunting) as the madman with a little more personal history than first meets the eye.It's tempting to consider this movie as a mental autobiography of sorts on the part of the director; as a renowned eccentric himself, Gilliam clearly delights in the madness of the characters which he so caringly creates and surrounds us in from the start of the movie, and shows how close to the surface the madness in all of us really is. Gilliam loves insanity, and this film encourages us to consider where it comes from and what it actually is. It doesn't spell out any answers, it just lets us think.What's the most rewarding is the absence of Gilliam's more sadistic streak, and as a result what we get is the unfettered, Terry-ised take on a slushy love story. There is a warmth to the movie which is as lifting as it is unexpected, and a strong emotional vein runs throughout. You finish watching this film feeling like you've just seen a really good story, had your emotional muscles exercised a bit, and even been given a bit of food for thought about the workings of the mind.And then there's the bit in Grand Central Station. Watch this movie; it's all classic Gilliam, just in a different way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of friendship, love and salvation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fisher King is an interesting tale of friendship, love and salvation. Jeff Bridges stars as Jack Lucas, a once on top of the world radio disc jockey turn alcoholic. Robin Williams also stars as Parry, a once college teacher turn street bum. The two are linked because of a tragedy. A tragedy for which Jack feels responsible. Parry's wife was killed by a crazed caller on a shooting spree. The killings was triggered by some offhanded remarks he made to a caller to his radio show. This event changed both of their lives for good.The two meet by accident, but are already connected by fate, even though they don't know it yet, at this point. Jack has hit rock bottom and is ready to commit suicide. He is saved by, of all people, and on the verge of craziness, Parry. Parry now believes he is knight on a quest for the holy grail. And Jack is the chosen one. The one chosen, in Parry's mind, to get this grail. Jack, of course, wants nothing to do with this, but as the movie progresses he slowly changes his mind.One of the most intense, wonderful, whacky scenes in the movie is when Parry takes Jack to Central Park. It is here we hear Parry telling Jack the story of The Fisher King. It is the first time we see Parry as not a nut, but a very intelligent teacher. And the look on Jack's face while Parry tells the story also adds to the intensity of the scene. In the story as he tells, there are 2 characters that parallel them. One is the Prince who was "sick with experience," that would be Jack. And the other character is the fool, who saves the Prince, by giving him what he needs. And this would be Parry. This is a great scene and we learn a lot about both of them here.Jack's girlfriend, Anne, played by Mercedes Rheul and Parry's dream girl, Lydia, played by Amanda Plummer are both brilliant in their roles. Whether they are in scenes with Jack and Parry or together they are wonderful and real. Jack decides he wants to help Parry get his girl, Lydia. He believes that by helping Parry, he will make things change for him. And he is right. From this moment on things change for all of them. But, it is not easy. Parry can't fully get his girl and Jack can't move on with his life until they both face the tragedy in their past. The Red Knight follows Parry where ever he goes, while guilt follows Jack. The Red Knight is visible only to Parry but it chases him through out the film. This symbolizes all the issues Parry needs to deal with regarding his wife's death. Jack's guilt isn't seen the way Parry's is, but it's there. Jack has to get over feeling responsible for the people that died by his remarks on the radio. Watching them do this is the main part of the film.The screen play for The Fisher King is well written by Richard LaGravenese. What he does here is make the dialogue sound like the way real people talk. It is so believable and fresh.Terry Gilliam directs this love story with a fantasy angle. There is so much to appreciate in this film, the love, the friendships, the symbolism. It is a truly wonderful, but complicated movie that needs to be viewed more than once to get in and grasp everything it offers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My problem with this movie, when I saw it the first time, was that I went to see it expecting another Terry Gilliam movie. I was utterly and completely disappointed. This was not one bit like Monty Python. Later I have come to love this movie. It is beautiful and tragic. Funny and touching. In short: human. The style is very smooth, yet Terry Gilliam'sk. Quite like Brazil (which I hadn't seen when I saw Fisher King the first time) and 12 Monkeys yet much more subtle and natural. I still think Brazil and 12 Monkeys are Gilliam's best movies, but this is close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is a truly great movie all about? Well...watch this one and you may get a hint. "The Fisher King" has all the ingredients to make a movie last in memory. It's sad, it's entertaining, it's full of riddles and questions until the very end. And it's heartwarming.I loved it so much I had to see it again within two days. And I have always had a thing for those little details that Gilliam puts in his movies - "Fisher King" and "Army of 12 Monkeys" both have the same feel to it - the same lunacy and weird juxtaposed storyline. They are works of art.The gentle but confused Williams, the egoistic but kind Bridges, the strong but sad girlfriend and the shy but tender Plummer - and not to forget, the extremely funny but terribly tragic Pierce. All the characters are trapped in their mistakes, but get a chance to resolve their tangled lives by crossing the path of one another. Perfectly brilliant.</fullReview>

It was very good-they made it into a movie too.That is why I watched the Fischer King. To this day I love the whole cast. Great storyline.In depth characters and understanding of their emotions.Love Bridges-even though he is unbearably unpassionate in most of it but has a change of heart at end-hopefully. I love Amanda Plummer's part too as the mousy,paranoid,shy,Lydia. Grat little songs throughout that just make the movie memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fisher King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great mix of King Arthur and Don Quixote fill the air in this savagely funny and heartwrenching film from Terry Gilliam. Bridges plays Jack Lucas, a bastardizing shock radio personality (I imagine Howard Stern was the inspiration) who makes career shattering comments to a caller who then runs amuck with a shotgun killing innocent people and then himself. Years pass, as do opportunities for television gigs and Jack wants to end his life. Enter Parry, played to perfection by Robin Williams. Parry is a knight in search of the Holy Grail and he invites Jack into his quest. Aside from his quest for the Grail, Parry also has his heart set on his damsel in distress, played wickedly by Amanda Plummer. Mercedes Ruehl shines in her Oscar winning role as Jack's tough as nails girlfriend. Director Gilliam shifts beautifully from comedy to adventure to tragedy and even to musical. A performance also worthy of notice comes from Michael Jeter, who does the best version of "Everything's Coming Up Roses," since "The Merm" herself. Williams received a much deserved nomination, as did the wonderful script from Richard LaGraverse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie keeps balancing between « 4 » and « 7 » : i liked the underbelly of NYC that was common in 80s, 90s and that has nearly disappeared today ; i liked the interest into those bums, losers while now only the winners can talk ; I liked the demented vision, the fantasy world because Gilliam really transcends the material and knows how to organize things ! Robin is fantastic, so free, showing so much different feeling, it's incredible ! I like the punch of the videostore owner ! I like the hidden fun (his movies posters, Hitler salute, ?) On the other hand, i can't stand the Bridges family (as well the Sheens, Baldwins) and the first half of the movie is totally useless and boring ! I don't like the Lydia character as she is not that easy and kind ! I don't like how the movie lost its way, has a lot of scenes totally expandable and how a heroic fantasy magic tale suddenly becomes a romance comedy ??? I don't like the way Robin has nothing to do in the last half hour. The train station scene is a total flop and the score is particularly weak ! At the end, i give « 7 » because if i cut all the bad scenes, the remaining is pretty cool so it's not a total stinker !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "lead" role, tailor-made for Robin Williams. Seriously, nobody else could've played this role like him. A complex mixture of a broken man borderline insane and the remains of a past cultured, well educated life. And Jeff Bridges' NY/Italian woman in the film, superb performance, that earned her rightfully a supporting actress' award. A lengthy film, but that justifies its weight with excellent story telling, attention to detail, and a very strong appreciation for the psychological element, very subtly carried out throughout the film. Very eventful, and although it's been criticized for it, it does answer all of the questions it poses. This isn't an overcrowded, over-complicated story; this is a complex modern tale with lots of sensitivity, real life issues, and a beautiful core at the center of it all. Excellent film.</fullReview>

The aforementioned caller goes on a rampage, shooting up a bar with his 12 gauge shotgun. The rest of the film is anchored to this tragedy.It's not a bad film. Robin Williams does an okay job, and Bridges is good, but there is nothing funny about this film. Gilliam focused on building the shock-jock character rather than the bum, so for the majority of the film we're unable to empathize with any one character, because nobody wants to root for a radio guy and the bum seemed like Robin Williams playing dirty Robin Williams.An early David Hyde Pierce makes an appearance though. He played the obscure manager of Bridges. I wish there was more of him in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Message Of Doing Something Unselfish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1985 writer/director Terry Gilliam gave us the film "Brazil", the story of a humble civic servant caught in the web of a dystopia society. The enigmatic fantasies manifested in the mind of our protagonist is a gave a hint of hope in an otherwise hopeless dimension. Six years later, Gilliam directs, "The Fisher King" which also looks into the eyes a deranged man who's lost in his own world, oblivious to the real world. Of course as a protocol, if anyone who lives in a fantasy dream world and is not afraid to speak out of it, you will easily be dismissed as a delusional lunatic. But every once in a while, some humans being will embrace that person's delusions even if it's to cover up one's faults.Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges) is that man. We first meet Jack as a cynical, self-absorbed radio jockey who couldn't care less about anyone or anything. His ego has climbed to epic proportions, as he truly represents what every other person walking this Earth represents. He has his own desires and knows how to get them and never has to go back on his steps. But eventually the lesson here is that the largest of egos can abound to become deflated. His world comes crashing down when he lends his voice that led to a violent murder frenzy. Three years later, Jack now demoted to working at a video store with his girlfriend Anne (Mercedes Ruehl), spends most of time inebriated and feeling that his life is not worth living decides to contemplate suicide, but in a sudden burst of irony, he is rescued by a homeless guy who goes by the name of Parry (Robin Williams), a former teacher, now has become a catatonic homeless guy who thinks he's a knight in search of the Holy Grail and asks Jack to help him in his quest. At first, Jack refuses to have anything to do with this nutty man, but after going through some research to discover that like him, Parry has lost faith in himself and has sunk into an even sadder path than him. In addition to that he feels that by committing a selfless act, he can help rectify the problems he's trying to overcome. This might be about Jack's ego, trying to better himself, But Parry's whims are very unsettling at times and his erratic behaviour can drive anybody insane, Jack makes strides actually helping this man, rather than playing along with this looney. Many fans can dismiss Parry as a crazy street bum, much like Jack as a egocentric jerk, but both characters embody a character study with plenty of layers within their psyche. Parry has created this fantasy where he's a knight on a quest where it's used as an escape to hide from the cruel world that was brought onto him. But when you think about it, isn't stories and fantasies are intended for? The world is a very cruel place and by creating characters and images, we all have to find ways to distract ourselves in once in a while. Does that makes crazy? If so, than so be it. When you think about the things that we suffer from can reflect on our storytelling abilities. Jack has no clue was what Parry is talking about or who this Red Knight he keeps mentioning. Jack doesn't realize is that this quest is also a reflection of what he's trying to accomplish, trying to turn two negatives (Jack and Parry's current states) into something positive and Jack sees something he's never seen before in his life, a silver dawning of a new person. Just doing a world of good isn't the way to go about this. It's more than that. It's a commitment to eternally promise that you will change your ways and never forget those who helped you along the way. And that is exactly what Jack understands as the film progresses and to help another down-trodden individual is the way to go, so for that we can actually relate to Jack because we all have a little Jack in all of us. Sure we as humans can be selfish if we wanted to, but then there are other times where we can commit selfless acts if when given the opportunity or commitment to do good things. Jack isn't just annoyed by Parry's behavioural patterns, he's upset as to why Parry chose him on his quest, let alone save him from self-destruction while offering the meagre cash in his possession. Love doesn't come from what's inside your wallet, but what's inside your heart. If Jack were to understand this, than maybe he could find reasons to love himself and put a disclosure to the error he committed years ago. "The Fisher King" is a subliminal metaphoric film that powerfully illustrates how one selfless act could seal the gaps from one's troubled past in hopes to turn one's life around.</fullReview>

It's one of those movies that makes you think about our society, lives and world in general. There's a philosophical meaning behind it as well.

Jack feels guilty for the lost of parry wife. And to feel less guilty jack helps parry in his search for the holy grail. The Fisherking is a movie based on the story of the knight parzival. It is a part of the parzival story brought in a nowadays jacket. In the beginning of the movie I thought it was a little bit slow and boring but a little later in the movie it became very nice and not boring at all. The role of jack is played by Jeff Bridges. The role of Parry is played by the great actor Robin Williams, who sadly past away in 2014. Robin Williams plays the roll of parry perfect. In the movie he really becomes parry. But also Jeff bridges plays the role of jack very good. The Fisherking is a mix of drama with also a lot of humor. It is a very good movie with a real strong and good story. I highly recommend this movie. That's why my rating for this movie is an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Power of Redemption!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fisher King is a fantastic movie directed by one of cinema's greatest visionary minds, Terry Gilliam. The movie is both funny and heartwarming and it features two amazing performances from Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges. The movie almost seems like it is a Monty Python movie in modern-day New York so that even made the story more interesting. The film also explores some powerful themes such as redemption and love and how these particular traits could change a person for the better. Terry Gilliam's film is about a radio DJ who inadvertently caused a madman to shoot up a place which left seven people dead. Several years later, Jack is left with hardly any money and on the brink of suicide. But he is saved by an unlikely source: a homeless man who believes he is on a quest for the Holy Grail. This man also happened to be one of the victims caused by Jack's words, so Jack feels as he should help the man in order to redeem himself. Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges deliver amazing performances. Williams is very funny, but he also shows a sad side of himself as a man haunted by his past and someone who is looking for a new love. Bridges is excellent as an arrogant man who finds that meeting this homeless man is the best thing that could have happened to him. Overall, The Fisher King is a fantastic movie that have powerful themes of grief, happiness, love, and most importantly, the power of redemption. The movie has a fine line to balance between comedy and drama, and it does it exceptionally well. This is the kind of movie that will make you laugh or cry perhaps both at the same time. As the movie world lost Williams recently, this movie is perhaps a little bit more emotional to watch, especially as we see him at his best. A fantastic movie thanks to the powerful acting and visionary directing of Gilliam. My Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern and unusual take on an Arthurian tale, Gilliam strikes gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It had been a couple of years since I last watched this film and I must say I have found more appreciation for it since. Redemption is a strong theme of this film as it tells the story of a shock jock, who becomes suicidal after a listener he offended going on a murderous rampage and in order to redeem himself, helps a homeless man who was affected by the tragedy. Jeff Bridges is one of the stars in this underrated dramedy, playing shock jock Jack Lucas who comes across as arrogant and obnoxious but starts to show a softer side as the film progresses. The other star of the film is the incomparable Robin Williams who plays Parry, a mentally disturbed homeless man who has hallucinations about knights and believes himself to be on the quest for the "Holy Grail". The acting in this movie is top notch as the cast give close to career best performances, Jeff Bridges proves he is truly an underrated actor from his generation and Robin Williams perfectly blends his dramatic and comedic sides here to give one of his best all-round performances. Most people see Williams in more strictly funny roles like Mrs Doubtfire, Patch Adams and the like but he is one heck of a good actor, one of the best comedic actors of all time. Amanda Plummer sort of plays against type in this movie as Lydia by not playing her usual crazy woman roles (ie. Pulp Fiction) but in a way, it is Mercedes Ruehl who steals the show as Anne Napolitano, the girlfriend of Jack who is not just eye candy but is almost like a voice of reason to him. Speaking of Ruehl, she fascinated me as I always used to wonder why she won an Oscar for this role but not every Oscar winning role needs a member of the audience to feel sad or cry, she does the opposite by making me laugh and bringing deeper meaning to her character which is hard to do in a comedy. And of course, credit must go to Terry Gilliam who strikes gold with this modernistic take on an Arthurian tale and is personally the mastermind of weird movies such as this. But whoever said weird was bad? If you think so, I suggest you take time to appreciate "weirdness" such as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams Should Have Got The Oscar For This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams is at his dramatic best opposite a brilliant Jeff Bridges in this wonderful movie with with Mercedes Ruehl giving solid (Oscar winning) support along with Amanda Plummer.Plot In A Paragraph: Jack Lucas (Bridges), a radio shock jock, becomes suicidal after his insensitive on-air comments to an unstable caller print him to go on a shooting spree at a popular Manhattan bar. Fast forward three years, and Jack is now working with his girlfriend Anne (Ruehl) in a video store usually drunk and depressed. One night he attempts suicide. Before he can go through with it, he is attacked and nearly set on fire by thugs. He is rescued by Parry (Williams), a homeless man who is on a mission to find the Holy Grail, Jack tries to help Parry when he learns that the man's condition is a result of witnessing his wife's horrific murder at the hands of Jack's psychotic caller. I may be in the minority, but I actually think Williams should have won the Oscar for his work here, Anthony Hopkins won it for his first (and what I consider to be over rated) portrayal of Hannibal Lector in "Silence Of The Lambs" Michael Jeter (Whom I love) is as brilliant as always, David Hyde Pearce has a small role and Kathy Najimy has an even smaller role as "Crazed Video Customer"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>R.I.P - Robin Williams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes RIP Robin Williams I can't find a better caption than this. The acting which he did in this movie is top-notch. I'd seen many movies of Mr. Williams like "R.V" and "Good Will Hunting" but to me this movie wins hands down, Robin Williams is so into character never breaks it and does with absolute perfection . But I must say that Jeff Bridges was also wonderful he's a talented actor and he's awesome. Mercedes Ruehl as Anne was also very interesting though her role was not important but still noticeable.So about the movie its about a man Jack who is a self arrogant, cynical and a type of a man who always thinks for himself he has no feelings for others, unintentionally did something terrible and one day a devastating news breaks on him and his life changes, after three yeas he was saved by a guy from suicide who's life is ruined by his mistakes and by helping that person he finds redemption.This movie could be better by improving some idiotic scenes which I found very stupid. This films also about Schizophrenia and how a person deals after a traumatic experience, so if you are interested in this, then definitely check this out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 90s movie for a modern audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fisher King is a movie that I have put off watching for such a long time, usual excuse was that it may not be my thing. With nothing else to what I said to myself "what the heck" and decided to watch it.Right now I am injured after kicking myself so hard for not watching this movie sooner. Yet that being said I think now was the best time to watch it being older as I get the themes of the movie and understand it better then if I had watched it say 10 years ago.This movie is a classic for a number of reasons, first the actors/actresses were fantastic, from Jeff Bridges self loathing narcissist to the Robin Williams's multitude of personalities for which we are taken on a roller-coaster of emotion and delight. The actresses such as Mercedes Ruehl who plays the doting girlfriend to Jack and the dependable Amanda Plummer playing her usual type of role of the shy nobody that catches the eye of Parry.In my opinion this is Robin Williams's swan song, its easy to consider that the characters of Jack and Parry can be compared in some ways to the life of Robin Williams. This movie is an important movie about how people approached mental heath back in the 90s and maybe even today, how homeless people are somebody else's problem and not theirs, and also how people who suffer mental health issues may not simply be their fault but because the system failed to help them through a tragic circumstance which in this case is the death/murder of a man's wife. The movie shows that all it takes is one person to take notice and help if and when they can. Although the message may seem a little self centred after all the character of Jack felt someway responsible for the murder of Parry's wife, this is its own way is a mental health issue that is hidden as most of the limelight is take up on helping Parry.How can one possibly deal with the notion that they may have been indirectly responsible for making someone go on a murder rampage? The character of Jack has to battle his own demons in order to help Parry, and when you watch the movie you are not sure who is suffering more. Its easy to think that Parry is suffering more as he actually lost his wife and is trying to piece together meaning of his life and uses dreams of King Arthur and a red knight to give meaning to his pain. You only realise at the end what those dreams are about and when its discovered it kind of makes sense. Jack on the other hand finally comes to terms that what happened to Parry's wife and all the other victims of the shooting were not his fault, but he feels that he must atone somehow to receive his own salvation for which he does.I was pretty shocked to see that this movie wasn't up for many awards back in 91 although Mercedes Ruehl did win a deserved support Oscar, but considering the competition that year I can understand, but that being said when I reflect the movies that did do well to the Fisher King, I feel that the Fisher King was seriously overlooked. Perhaps its for the same reasons as I put earlier, back in 91, the movie may not have made sense yet today I wouldn't doubt it could clearly clear house in most movie awards. I was very surprised to see that only Robin Williams was nominated for an Actor Oscar and not Jeff Bridges also, I think if Williams had been nominated for a supporting role he might have won.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't believe it took me so long to see this treasure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when this movie came out, but I'm surprise it took me so long to see. Having Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges in the film is a selling point on its own, but adding the fact that it was directed by Terry Gilliam, I can't imagine what stopped me from running to see this movie long ago. The American Montypython's style drives this movie's artistic movement. Its so totally nineties but it doesn't feel dated. Not even with Jeff Bridges character Jack's love of the song, I've got the power, which is blasted throughout the film. Than there's the added fact that Jack's girlfriend owns a video store. Like most of Gilliam's work, the film gives us an over the top look on social commentary. This time we get his insight on homelessness and its link to metal illness with William's character suffering from the lost of his wife in a tragedy that drove him mad, and Jack who suffers his own downhill spiral when he faces how his media influence as a dick jockey can change lives. The two of them start to heal when the find each other and in the process they find love, Terry Gilliam style. New York seems a perfect place for a Gilliam movie. The art direction was perfect as the city felt very sir real. It was almost like watching Brazil. If I had no idea what the city truly looked liked, I would have thought the whole thing wad filmed on a sound stage. The Big Apple is a character on its own. Seeing the city in Gilliam's eyes is fascinating. Robin Williams and Terry Gilliam were definitely a match made in heaven. It was like Gilliam knew exactly were to put the camera in order to capture all that is the great comedian. I can't believe I waited so long to see this masterpiece, but it was well worth the wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Friendship/Redemption Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Terry Gilliam has put together an entertaining if a bit dated work with "The Fisher King". It featured Robin Williams around the time of his best work as well as Jeff Bridges not far behind. The setting is the streets of New York mostly, and while there's some of the whackiness of Williams, and earnestness from Bridges, the highlight of the movie was Mercedes Ruehl who stole many of the scenes she was in away especially from Bridges. The movie is zany and endeavors to poke fun at 80ish yuppiness in the early 90s. It also takes a swipe at shock-talk radio ala Howard Stern type. Some of Gilliam's close up and odd camera angles are on full display, and his story of friendship and redemption though a bit overlong has some witty dialog and full force acting, unsurprisingly given the leads. Overall it is good but sometimes wandering. Recommended 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a trademark Gilliam film. While most of it works, it flip flops a little too much with story and substance. It's not a particularly easy watch. Some of it is epic and amazing like the Grand Central station ballroom scene. Some of it is comedy. It just doesn't quite sit right (for me at least).Williams almost gets it, he looks a little too fresh faced, as does Bridges. And they are both a little unconvincing.Watching years later was odd in that there is a lot of Kpax mixed up with a couple of 'Dude' (Big Lebowski) walk on parts. Bridges works in those movies, but feels a little out of place here. It's just a bit scrappy.I loved the metaphors and the ideas more so than the film. A difficult movie to lift from the page no doubt, it almost triumphs and is worth a watch.Looking forward to Gilliam perfecting the fantasy drama with Don Quixote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>crazy acting from Robin Williams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges) is an arrogant selfish call-in radio DJ. His rant against yuppies causes a madman to commit a mass shooting in a hip NYC bar. Three years later, he's a drunken mess working at a video store with his girlfriend Anne Napolitano (Mercedes Ruehl). Jack is attacked by a couple of young punks and he's rescued by Parry (Robin Williams) and his group. Parry sees himself as a knight on a quest for the Holy Grail and hounded by an imaginary Red Knight. He thinks that Jack is the one to find the Grail so that he could win the heart of Lydia Sinclair (Amanda Plummer). Jack finds out that Parry is actually college Professor Henry Sagan and his wife was killed in the bar by that madman. There is a lot of crazy acting from everybody especially from Robin Williams. It's a little touching. It's a little surreal. It's a stumbling affair with fits and starts. It meanders a bit and I wish it's more of a quest movie. It's cute sometimes like the date. At other times, I can't wait for the movie to pick up the pace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly regal . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Fisher King' is a clunky, rambling movie that tries to be tender and sweet and manic and eccentric all at the same time. The movie contains everything but the kitchen sink but the movie comes off like an erector set with missing pieces.The movie stars Jeff Bridges as Jack a radio talk show host who sends a caller over the edge one night causing him to go on a public shooting spree. Jack falls into a deep depression, quits his job and starts drinking. He finds solace in Parry (Robin Williams) a homeless man living in Central Park who believes that he is on a mystical quest to find the holy grail. Parry also believes that the grail lies in the possession of a billionaire living in Manhattan and that Jack may be the man to help him find it.For every honest moment in the movie there is a pointless moment of needless fantasy. Parry keeps seeing the image of a flaming knight on horseback, a vision that eventually sends him into a coma, which Jack (in the movie's most pointless scene) tries to cure by stealing the grail from the billionaire.Then there is the relationship between Jack and his girlfriend Ann, played wonderfully by Mercedes Rhuel, who tries to make sense out of Jack and all the craziness. She loves the guy but doesn't really need to.The worst performances by Robin Williams are those in which he is just seems to be doing that same schtick that he does on 'The Tonight Show'. A lot of 'The Fisher King' finds him doing that. I like him better when he has quiet, thoughtful performances in movies like 'Good Will Hunting' and 'Awakenings'.Director Terry Gilliam has constructed a movie that at once is a fable and then a love story and then an adventure movie then a human drama. It's hard to see it as a whole because it is trying so hard to be entertaining that it forgets to sew these threads together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I re-watched this one last week, and was surprised how well it has stood the test of time. I remember it fondly since sometime in the nineties, when I saw it last, but was not prepared for it being this good! It is truly amazingly well-acted. Like in 12 Monkeys, Gilliam has comedy and drama perfectly in balance. He also stays on the right side of melodrama the whole time. The scene with Williams going over the top while being served dinner by Mercedes Ruehl is brilliant. The following Chinese dinner is also a high point and makes me weep with laughter every time. You truly feel for these characters, and want the best for them. Gilliam has the the good taste of letting the camera be unobtrusive in the majority of emotional dialog scenes, and let the performances speak for themselves. A true masterstroke. It also enhances the dynamics for the scenes with more extravagant visuals. One of Gilliams best, and I hope he still has more of these movies in him. I sincerely hope he only can find a script of this caliber again soon.</fullReview>

It's difficult to comment on the film without telling to much (which would mean I'd have to spoiler something) ...

		<shortDescription>It's a Terry Gilliam world, really.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, Terry Gilliam, a director and a member of the legendary "Monty Pythons" team, is one of the most unique directors in modern cinematography. I was rather astonished when I saw "Monty Pythons and the Holy Grail" for the second time, because I hadn't noticed how marvelous the direction was. Truly, the photography and the overall structure of the film is really staggering. The "12 monkeys" is also a great example of a good directed movie. I haven't seen "Brazil" yet, but I'm sure that, when I shall, It'll be quite of an experience. But let's get to the point."The Fisher King" is no stranger to Monty Pythons. It deals with the myth of the Holy Grail. But it goes much further. It's all about friendship, guilt, self-consciousness and forgiveness. Jeff Bridges is a popular and quite cynical radio DJ, who loses his job, because he kind of encouraged a man to go and murder anyone who got into his way. What the man did, was the following: He rushed into a restaurant and killed all the people who happened to be there. Among the people killed, was Robin William's fiancée. Williams quits on life, after this fact, and becomes a beggar, while having very strong hallucinations about a black Knight who's supposingly after him. What will happen, when the two men -Bridges and Williams- finally meet? Will Bridges help Williams regain his lust for life and, most importantly, love? The colors of the movie are classic early-90s colors. The performances are good -especially Williams', and the direction is amazing. What I particularly liked about the movie is the slight balance between reality and dream. One minute everything's the way it should be, the other the black Knight attacks. Along with Gilliam's cynicism and irony, it offers a great mixture of adventure, drama and black comedy.Do you like interesting movies? Go and check out this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, Funny, Sad, and Very Terry Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam had been a well known director before he made this film. His works included Time Bandits, Brazil, and Monty Python and the Holy Grail. So you know pretty much what to expect when you go into one of his movies. A fantasy filled world of dark humor and love. This film is no exception.Quite possibly the best of Gilliam's post-Python films, it tells the story of radio DJ, played by Jeff Bridges, who, through no real fault of his own, ends up convincing a psychotic man to kill a bunch of people and himself in a nightclub after asking Bridges for advice. The DJ feels very responsible for this and decides to stop everything and try to cope with it.After three years he gets attacked by hoodlums and is saved by a homeless man played by Robin Williams. The two get to know each other and Bridges reluctantly becomes friends with him after finding out how the two are connected.Bridges and his girlfriend, played by Mercedes Ruehl, try different things to get Williams to fit in with the rest of New York City and to not be a bum. This results in some amusing situations involving the girl of Williams' dreams, played by Amanda Plummer, and another quest for the Holy Grail.The film revolves around itself to bring us the tail of two not so different men in a big city where it seems everyone is different. Especially Mercedes Ruehl who ends up being the wise conscious of Bridges. She won a well deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, but we don't see much of her these days.All in all, The Fisher King seems like something the children would like, but the adults would find amusing. I guess that means that it's a good film, but still a little dark for younger audiences. I thought that it was well done, but like most Gilliam works, something held me back from giving it a higher rating. The same thing happened with Twelve Monkeys, but I guess I have to see more of his films to find out why this is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally i manage to track down this great cinema piece in the bargain shop. Thankyou above. I note some reviewers think that this is King Arthur inspired, it's not. The legend of the Fisher King is the story of a young Knight called Parsifal, who upon seeing a wounded king, did not ask the question- "what ails thee?", and goes in search of the Holy Grail. involving himself in all sorts of adventures, most of which if he would only pause and take stock would show him where the grail is. That being in his heart. With all myths, subtext is all and near anything can become important, overlaid, and gain meaning. Jack never knew he had a heart, New York the same, Parry (Parsifal) bleeding deeply from his and so on. I wonder if the red knight, a not very happy experience, for Parry is a dramatic representation of the blood splatter of his wife's hair in the restaurant scene, personified now and continuing to haunt Parry as he tries to break free. Good performances by all the cast, especially Jeff Bridges, who as an ace arsehole derides all responsibility for his actions, and i think his alcoholic stupor is not the result of his actions but the fact he got canned, He was still arse once he got back to fame, he receiving redemption from his ex when she took him back - surely a work in progress'Good film do not miss it. Oh and NY found its heart in Grand Central for a couple of moments, Love that waltz.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really think "The Fisher King" will someday become a well known movie, just like "Shawshank Redemption" became. It wasn't noticed at first, and now, years later - it has become one of America's favorites! The Fisher King is a psychological drama/comedy which has so much hidden meanings and twist it is just amazing! It is not only funny, but profound and touching. I have watched this movie at least 5 times and each time have seen more to it than the last time. It is a fantastic movie, and I can't wait to see it catch fire! I am sure this will happen - NEEDS MORE ATTENTION!! Please watch this movie and spread the word. I think it means so much, it is a man seeking redemption and a man seeking to come to terms with loss and insanity. It is a story of loosing love, and finding love again. I just cannot say enough good things about this movie. Robin Williams is just such a talent! And all his talents shine through in this movie. Please watch it! I want to get it on DVD! Well worth the slow beginning. When Robin Williams comes on, it just takes off!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Playing off an Arthurian Legend, this film weaves an intricate tapestry of philosophy, love, despair, arrogance, and innocence together in a tale that would be unbearably intense were it not underpinned with humor.Terry Gilliam brings to life (it's so real it could be true) Richard LaGravenese's classic story and peoples it with great performers.Jeff Bridges offers a striking picture of an egocentric radio talk host brought to his knees by his arrogant behavior. He finds his way to a real place with great difficulty, tripping and falling again and again along the way until he finally learns the lesson of the Fisher King.Robin Williams shows his whole range of talents as a dramatic actor and a verbal and physical comedic genius. One of many great performances.Mercedes Ruehl fits her ever changing persona to the role of Bridge's love interest, creating a distinctive character and earning a well deserved best supporting Oscar.One wonders if this had been a Miramax film, with the promotional and political skills of the brothers Weinstein, if it might have garnered a host of Oscars.Amanda Plummer brings reality to the complex and vulnerable role of Williams love interest. An amazing performance, one of the best of her unbelievable career. Five dozen films in a little over twenty years, while still finding time for Tony Award winning live theater performances, plus forty-eight Emmy's for her television work.Michael Jeter in a over-the-top performance as a cross dressing homeless cabaret singer, makes an unbelievable character believable. A great character actor in a great role. Dead too soon and lost except for his wide ranging body of work.While the Fisher King does not rely on special effects, the one it uses, The Red Knight, is as spectacular as it is effective.After a couple dozen viewings I find something new -and more important something meaningful- each time I watch it. There are lots of great films, but this is for me, the best yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie several years ago, and I thought that Jeff Bridge's performance was the most realistic of all. It is easy to see someone getting that caught up in trying to atone for what they have come to view as a past sin. Robin William's role of Parry was sweet and sentimental, but a bit over the top. But it's Robin Williams and I never have seen him in something and not liked him - he brings his own unique personality to every role. Michael Jeter performed in this, and I have never seen him mentioned - he has a stereotypical role - gay guy dresses in drag and gives comic performance as singer - but I loved him and his in-your-face style. (Michael always caught my attention in whatever he did - he's probably one of two reasons I will go see the new Costner flick, the first reason being Robert Duvall).Without giving anything away, I have to say that I watched this movie again, having seen it several times before, and knowing that my son watched it two days before he died, and I was more horrified in subsequent viewings by the disturbing scenes (violence - can't say more), but don't let that stop you from seeing it. Just be warned - it is painful and shocking.The story, of a one man's descent into psychosis which wreaks chaos in his life after a trauma, and also of another man who seeks his own redemption by coming to the salvation of the first - believing himself to be responsible for the first man's ruined life, is engrossing, even if played out with a bit of a heavy hand. Having said that, I don't see how it could have been toned down at all, and ultimately, I wasn't disappointed with the outcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual film but made its point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains a few spoilers. I watched this movie for the first time last night. Someone I knew had seen it and they said it was good but I would always pass it by at the video store. Didn't care. Now 12 years and two boring rentals later, I decided to rent it. The Fisher King was...unusual to say the least in the matter in which it was presented. The magical realism in this movie about two lives entirely different crossing paths over DJ Lucas'opinions was different. But then knowing that the director who did 12 monkey's is responsible for this film is not surprising. I felt like he wanted to bring back the kid in all of us and that *ssholes have hearts too. Here's my opinion of it.After twenty minutes of the movie, I wanted to cut it off. Then when William's started taking off his clothes, I figured the movie was almost over. Then I thought the movie was over as the camera slid away from the dinner scene at the restaurant. Then I thought definately over the top when Lucas stole the object for Williams.But it had its moments and it was good that they made Bridge's character a real *sshole. Too many times Hollywood is movie-friendly with their lead characters. What happened if he never went back with Rheul. That would have been interesting. It was real enough though the way he cleaned up. I hung in there for its authenticity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By 1991, Terry Gilliam's art as a director had matured to the point that his control of the visual was complete. He had developed his visual style to what may be a career high in Brazil, although his much-documented disappointment with the studio's support left one wondering where he would go after that.The answer came with the Fisher King. Rather than succeed in dominating his own Red Knight, even after the more user-friendly Munchausen, he succumbed and took on Richard LaGravenese's clever but light script with a Hollywood ending that perhaps he hoped would bring audiences for the banal.Only the Hollywood accountants know whether he was successful in this quest. The film was better than most, but to those of us who look to Terry for something more, the Fisher King was a bit of a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fisher King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Monty Python star and Golden Globe nominated director Terry Gilliam this is a great fantasy drama. Basically Jack Lucas (Golden Globe nominated Jeff Bridges) is a talk DJ, and was in a TV sitcom, and one night he is almost suicidal, but was stopped when thugs attacked and almost burned him. But he was saved by crazy street living tramp, Parry (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Robin Williams). Parry tells Jack he is on a quest to find the "Holy Grail" (a cup trophy), but Jack tries to help him by giving him money, that he doesn't know what to use on. Parry also suffers from terrifying hallucinations of a Red Knight, mixed with the memory of his wife's death. But then Parry tells Jack of the woman he has been seeing for so long, the woman he has fallen for and been following for ages. They find out her name is Lydia Sinclair (Pulp Fiction's BAFTA nominated Amanda Plummer), and they convince her she has won a new card, and with the help of Anne Napolitano (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Mercedes Ruehl) and her nail varnishing, they set a date for a dinner. Parry and Lydia get on really well, and were practically made for each other with their traits, but it soon goes wrong when Parry's flashbacks come back and he is beaten by the thugs, and put into a home. In the end though, Jack helps him by stealing the "Grail", from a suicidal man, and both couples, i.e. Lydia and Parry, and Jack and Anne live happily ever after. Also starring David Hyde Pierce as Lou Rosen, Kathy Najimy as Crazed video customer, This Is Spinal Tap's Harry Shearer as Sitcom actor Ben Starr and Michael Jeter as Homeless cabaret singer. With great comedy moments, particularly from the fantastic Williams, this is essential for fans or him and Bridges. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music for George Fenton and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be interesting to know the ages of those who have already gushed forth paeons of praise for this movie. I caught about a half hour on TV while having lunch today, and could not believe what I was seeing and turned it off. Feeling incensed as I do with most contemporary films, I checked your viewer comments and saw most people loved it. Why? Because I suspect they are all under 30. I am long past 30, and having lived through and loved all the great films of the 40's and 50's, I find this type of emotional assault too grim, too depressing, too pretentious. Isn't there enough misery every day in this unhappy era we are living through? Why spend two hours watching some screwed up characters try to sort out their lives? Sorry. The actors may be great, the direction flawless and all that... but isn't the bottom line of any film to be entertaining? I am not entertained by this sort of sturm and drang. And as one of your viewers considers this the best film ever, I must put in my two cents for MY most enjoyable film ever... namely, SINGING IN THE RAIN, which leaves you uplifted, gloriously positive, happy to be alive... Yes, times change, but not always for the better, sad to say...</fullReview>

They are always interesting, because I love the creativity. Terry Gilliam's version of bizarre is a little too much for me. My first experience with Gilliam was when I watched Brazil. I couldn't finish that movie, but I still decided to give this one a chance, solely because it stars two of my favorite actors, Jeff Bridges &amp; Robin Williams. Robin William's hyperactive character is very good, but it gets to be a bit overbearing after a while. Jeff Bridges is excellent. I have no complaints about him. I lasted until the hour mark, before I caved in, and couldn't take anymore. Not only is it extremely depressing, but I got a headache from some of the strangest visuals in this movie. It really is a mind- trip, and one I couldn't withstand. Some will love this movie. Terry Gilliam's style certainly has his fans, but I'm not one of them. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to love this movie, but in the end, it goes on too long, gets into too many cubbyholes of plot, and tilts toward "Patch Adams" good-vibes in the last few minutes. It does have a great performance by Jeff Bridges -- one of the all-around top leading men who has only begun to get his due. Robin Williams is, to my taste, too schticky -- but I've never been won over by his verbal pyrotechnics. ("Tempo, people, tempo!!" etc, etc.) This film will always be worth revisiting for the scene in which hundreds of Grand Central commuters fall into a ballroom dance, to mirror the romantic spell that Williams falls into as he stalks Amanda Plummer (a sappy part of the plot, but it's supposed to be True Love.) The dance scene draws you in without fanfare. At first, you see one couple waltzing at the edge of the frame; in moments, the entire concourse is one swirling crowd of dancers; there is just enough of the dance to resolve its meaning, and then the crowd falls out of it, as if they have emerged from a dream. Absolutely wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Fisher King" is one of those strange films that tries to do way too much and ends up being so outlandish by the end that one will wonder what they just watched. Jeff Bridges stars as a wild disc jockey on par with Howard Stern who has one of his rampages go terribly wrong. Fast-forward a few years and Bridges runs into an eccentric homeless man (Robin Williams in an Oscar-nominated role) who was directly affected by his antics. Bridges thus seeks inner-peace and redemption by befriending Williams and by trying to understand his twisted views about the Holy Grail, dangerous dragons and other fantastic things. Bridges' girlfriend (Mercedes Ruehl in another one of those odd Oscar wins) is also along for the wild ride. The film is real funny in areas and as serious as a heart attack in other departments. It is one of those movies that just never does jell the way it could have. It is not a bad film as Bridges and Williams each do excellent work, but in the end it was not nearly as good as it could have been. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Close, but no cigar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam's THE FISHER KING is a great story, a great vision but a disappointing film that comes close to greatness just before it meanders off into near mediocrity. It is both a startling pleasure to watch, especially for the first hour or so, and an irritation to endure. For the most part, the film's script is brilliant, its ambience appropriately and compellingly disorienting, its cinematography stunningly beautiful and its acting (with a few exceptions) superb.Some of the blame for the film's failure goes to editing, but it is the director who inexplicably allows the narrative to stray and fails to notice that allowing Bridges' character to incessantly state the obvious, i.e., that which has already been wonderfully conveyed by the narrative and the cinematography, is irritating as hell. But what is most exasperating about this film is not that it fails to live up to the high standard it sets for itself, but that it needlessly fails to do so. The fixes are readily obvious and quite simple. Less is more; stick to the essentials.It is not necessary, e.g., for Williams' character (Henry Sagan) to be nearly beaten to death in order to once again lapse into a catatonic state for six months while Bridges' character (Jack Lucas) deserts his girlfriend, goes back into radio, has a second epiphany (Eureka!) and rushes to Henry's bedside. One epiphany per film is enough, and life itself is enough to drive Henry's fragile mind back into its hole. Before the narrative strays, Jack has already discovered and involved himself in the needs of others. He's finally free to love himself and others. All that remains is his struggle with commitment and his inevitable confrontation with the bloody Red Knight. Faced with Henry's tragic relapse on one side and his girlfriend's love-sick anguish on the other, Jack has all the motivation he needs to emerge from his psychic stupor and be convincing. This film is about twenty minutes too long.Further, cut Jack's maudlin speech at Henry's bedside; silent anguish and good camera work is all that's needed here. Why must Jack babble as he climbs the castle wall? Silence! Why must he suddenly and inexplicably have flashes of Henry's hallucinations?; the shot of the bloody Red Knight in the stain-glass window conveys everything.Why must Jack utter the F-word in the scene where he learns about the murder-suicide? Like much of Bridges' dialogue, it's redundant! The expression on his face, in his eyes, is enough.Less is more! Less is more! Less is more!Still, this is a good film that simply fails to live up to its tremendous potential. It's well worth one's time. Give it a look and see why it just misses getting an Oscar nomination for best picture and going down in history as one the greats. I give it about a 6 ? to 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Weird! This was my first reaction after viewing Terry Gilliam's "The Fisher King". However Gilliam has created a dramatically powerful and quite funny movie. There are quite a few 'Python' images and references here. The humour is definitely straight U.S. though, thankfully.Robin Williams does his usual comic turn, and although it gives on the feeling of 'déj? vu', it is entertaining. Jeff Bridges and Mercedes Ruehl steal the show though with very strong performances that are both funny and powerful. Also starred Amanda Plummer and David Hyde Pierce. "The Fisher King" is a very different, and a little over long, cinema experience.Tuesday, November 5, 1991 - Knox District Centre</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unhinged fantasy suffers from stylistic epilepsy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Terry Gilliam's halfhearted return to Earth includes all the ingredients for what could have been a whimsical romantic fantasy, despite all the illogical, contrived plot tissue about how an acerbic, selfish New York City radio host (Jeff Bridges) redeems himself by rescuing a soul in worse peril than his own. The film was written like a small, offbeat character study: loony street-person Robin Williams, who imagines himself to be a medieval knight on a mythical quest, saves Bridges from suicide, and Bridges returns the favor by arranging a date between Williams and the painfully neurotic Amanda Plummer. But Gilliam's absurd, distracting over-direction smothers the already flimsy scenario under an avalanche of inappropriate 'style': fish-eye lenses; whizzing dolly shots; exaggerated camera angles; smoke; steam; and one gratuitous, gory flashback to a bloody mass murder, totally out of place in an otherwise light romantic comedy. Any genuine charm or emotion is lost because the visual scheme is so artificial, and the highly praised, ersatz performance by Robin Williams is little more than undisciplined shtick.</fullReview>

The character development of Lydia was almost non-existent, and there seemed to be so much just thrown in for the hell of it - Robin dancing on the table from Jeff's girlfriend, the red night and castle and miser who tries to commit suicide - I think one may have to really be insane to get anywhere with this film. The moral value was worthless - a complete wash - I see where it was trying to go with social justice and compassion - but it swung and missed. Overall poor and incredibly strange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's all too easy to confuse frenzied scenery chewing with great acting;the Academy does it depressingly often so it was no surprise to see the praise heaped on Mr Robin Williams for his showboating in "The Fisher King".Mr Williams is a stranger to restraint.Even in reflective moments his characters have an air of contrivance about them. Artifice is not the be all and end all of acting - however clever the characterisation,if it does not touch base with reality however peripherally it is just so much silly voices and glycerine tears. I have never seen him give a believable performance. Mr Jeff Bridges,on the other hand,is an actor who knows that a movie is a marathon,not a sprint and paces himself accordingly. Mr Terry Gilliam makes the sort of movies that suit Mr Williams down to the ground."The Fisher King" was a match made in heaven for the both of them. Let me be up front about this from the start - I do not like Monty Python.I did not like it 30 years ago and I don't like it any better today.With the exception of Mr Michael Palin I find the "Monty Python Gang" far too clever and smug for their own good.The adjective "Pythonesque",used incessantly by equally clever and smug media pundits induces the vomit reflex in me like no other. Despite my antipathy to his comic roots,I greatly admire Mr Terry Gilliam as a film director.His masterpiece "The Twelve Monkeys" is the work of a considerable talent. Apart from the profoundly moving "Great Waltz" scene,nothing in "The Fisher King" indicates that it is the work of a man with an original and imaginative intelligence.It's competently enough made,but it's only run - of - the - mill psychobabble dressed up as a modern retelling of a medieval myth. That it works as well as it does is despite the presence of the irritating Mr Robin Williams rather than because of it. If you like his rather hysterical persona add another star to my rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Battling Worlds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.We have two battling worlds here -- neither one wins. We have the world of the writer who has certain tricks he pulled from the stock book: the self-reference of an actor playing a nested, created role: the merger of the two realities (of the film and the reality within the film), the incongruously unsexy redhead, the reflection of the video store, the (film) performer who plays a (radio) performer and who is offered a (TeeVee) performance about something that sounds very much like this film.And we have the world of the filmmaker, Gilliam. This world is highly architectural; quirkily strewn with odd objects; always has a menacing corporate overlord; and is populated by people coping through good humor. Quite a different world. Each is incompatible with the other because both are self-defining. These worlds tussle within the small bag that is this film and the result is incoherent. It is not a matter of left and right brain -- it is a matter of the liver engaged in a life and death struggle with the kidneys. Fortunately for us, we have Roger Pratt's use of space wrapping it which makes the whole thing tolerable if you notice the architectural eye.This struggle is interestingly mirrored in the story, in the two characters. Bridges is Gilliam's character, an open actor who acts with his frame. Bridges occupies space; all the shots of him emphasize the space around him and his relationship to it. His relationship with show `business' is similarly multilayered and overlain on the space. He is selfishly indulgent and loved for it. That's Gilliam. Watch how Jeff emulates his walk.On the other hand, we have Williams. He is surrogate for the writer, and is a superficial student of myth, intent on acting it out. He doesn't know better, presenting the known as if it were deeply true. Watch how meanspirited is Gilliam's camera in how it treats Parry. Watch how Robin is clueless about how he is being abused.The self-reference of the battle over the film and the battle within the film is interesting enough. Bridges would be tapped by the Coens to do this very same thing against Julianne Moore in `Lebowski.' But for Williams, this turns out to be just another of his many roles as aggrieved widower, this time with the comatose bit as well.Gilliam himself would eventually find the kind of film that he is perfectly suited for: `Fear and Loathing.' The irony is that at that point, he learns not to fight the broken mind of the writer, but to enter it and populate it with his signature elements: space, stuff, oppression, salvation through irony.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally like Gilliam's movies, but in this one he transplants his manic, fantasy-oriented style to everyday New York and the result is just bizarre and does not seem emotionally real at all. It's one thing to have the camera moving in circles and up and down walls in a crazed universe like "Brazil," it's another thing when it's just a guy sitting in his bathtub. It's also extremely unsettling that the mood changes from comedy to tragedy every few minutes. Williams turns in a nice performance, but I still was never able to believe his character was a real person (probably due more to his stardom than the way the character is written). Everything feels contrived, manufactured and fake. I feel like it could have been a good movie with a dose of calmness and subtlety, but Gilliam's Ringling Brothers direction just ruins it. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If they had an "Emperors New Clothes" rating for a movie, this movie would get my vote. This is an "art movie" for the roller-bearings-for-brains crowd. It exploits all the major stereotypes of today: the "tormented" gay man, the "tormented" dj power-freak, the "tormented" yuppy widower of a random killing victim and the ULTIMATE unattractive, klutzy, charmless wallflower. Robin Williams gives one more (though admittedly his best) over-the-top performance, erupting rivers of noxious sentimentality all over the screen, while Jeff Bridges plays one more jaw-clenched I'm-a-tough-sensitive-guy-in-the-wrong-movie-again. He does know how to act stoned, though. There are two great performances, however: Mercedes Ruehl is very earthy, very real, she really glows with character, and Michael Jeter is absolutely, brilliantly unforgettable. Ruehl's apartment is really cool too. Unfortunately, the actors get in the way too much. Nothing makes sense in this movie, even on a fantasy level. The worst offense &amp; the only one I will bother getting into, is the Lydia character played by Plummer, who becomes the obvious target of pity for all the other characters because of her many gross shortcomings. There's absolutely no sense of humanity or compassion in this slick mean-spirited piece of hollywood drek.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woe to those who praise this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mainly rented the Fisher King because I just saw Insomnia and wanted to see some of Robin Williams earlier movies, I was very intrigued when I saw he was nominated for Best Actor for "The Fisher King", it also had some good reviews and Oscar and GG nominations, so I took it up on the hype. The Fisher King is a pointless story, it starts with Jeff Bridges as a shock radio DJ who is basically a recreation of Howard Stern, so much so it isn't even funny. Bridges tells a caller to deal with a situation in a lucrative manner, the man kills some people in a resturant, one of those people is William's wife, but that isn't told to us until the near end of the story. Anyways Bridges finds Parry (Robin Williams), or rather Parry finds Bridges when Bridges has stumbled into a junkyard, drunk , maybe twenty miles away from his house, and his life is threatened by junkyard punks, Williams stands up and acts crazy, and I guess that is enough to scare them off. Parry takes Bridges to his basement where he lives until he wakes up, Bridges thanks Parry, and soon comes back to see him, thus the dragging story begins. Bridges "realizes" he needs to save Parry for some reason, before he can revive his career and life. Parry is mentally unstable because of the loss of his wife, but even that loss probably wouldn't cause a man to lose his mind completely and decide to live in a dump wearing a trash can lid as a helment. Anyways Parry has been noticing a girl at an office (Amanda Plummer), he wants to date her, so Bridges helps get Plummer with the help of his girlfriend (Mercedes Rhuel), they get Parry together with her, Rhuel and Bridges get back together after tough times. The main point of the story is that you can't fix yourself until you fix your mistakes. There is a side story about Parry finding the Holy Grail which is totally misleading and absolutely unnecessary.One expects Terry Gilliam movies to be very strange and funny. I think old Gilliam got a little greedy after his hit Brazil in 1985, he took a horrible script and directed this, hoping to make a bigger name for himself. Thank God he recovered with 12 Monkeys in 1995 which was a great movie. You can pass this one, seriously. None of the Academy nominations were deserved, Rhuel's win over Juliette Lewis was a complete crock, Lewis lost souly because of her age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just missed the mark...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not usually a lover of forced quirk in film, but this one at least had a little extra personality to it to nearly hit the mark.It kicks off intriguing enough as Bridges barks his way through the end of one of those aggressive radio shows. Upon preparing for his move into the TV sitcom realm, his world is shattered at the news that one of his radio show callers had gone on a killing spree at a restaurant. Three years pass whereupon he's been reduced to living above a video store where he also works and lives with his long-suffering girlfriend/boss (Ruehl).In a drunken stumble through town, he happens upon Williams and his merry band of homeless knuckleheads. Bridges does the bug-eye thing during his initial stay in Williams' hideout, where ol' Robin does his usual rapid-fire insane act he had become so associated with. After discovering he has a connection to Williams' past, Bridges feels guilted into looking after the demented loon as best he can.The first 20 minutes of this ain't so bad, before it segues into the usual Gilliam flair for the bizarre. Wild camera angles and musical numbers permeate the storytelling, but writer LaGravenese saves that by adding a depth not commonly scene with this genre. There are factual statements about men, women, life, death, salvation, friendship, etc. Though too many moments are somewhat predictable (you just know how Bridges will accomplish William's 're-awakening') and the "drag" points of the pace are pretty heavy.Another issue are the characterizations themselves. When you mix two characters who are residing in the real world (Bridges and Ruehl), and two who are not (Williams and mousy Amanda Plummer), well, it's tough to see why Bridges and Ruehl would bother with them anyway. They lead a fairly normal existence, and in actuality would run for the hills from Williams' raving weirdo and Plummer's accident-prone spinster. The Plummer character especially, who is "fallen in love with" by Williams', despite the fact they've never spoken. And her two minutes of non-charm in the video store would make anyone feel they were wasting their time for Williams' cause.Ruehl won an Oscar for her efforts, for a part that was adequately played, but nothing spectacular. Michael Jeter, however, deserves special recognition solely for his show stopping song and dance number (how he hits those notes while still having testacles, I'll never know).I usually don't issue SPOILER WARNINGS in my reviews, but here I must address the flick's shortcomings: (Here is your official ***SPOILER ALERT***!!!) A.) The fact that Parry is never made aware -- or doesn't acknowledge -- his connection to Jack loses a few points. Williams' character is so ethereal as it is, I was figuring Jack would confess to him only to have Williams' say he already knew who he was (Bridges states his full name on several occasions).B.) The two "fire-setting" yuppie kids was a ridiculous stretch even for a zaniness of this film's type. Their originating scene came off forced anyhow (Bridges just lays there watching gasoline get poured on him). Plus the two kids were lousy actors.C.) The fact that Jack doesn't exact revenge on said kids for their attack on Parry left me waiting and waiting for it. Yet, it never arrived.These may be petty complaints but it's what separated this movie from being great to only fair in my eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam's typically overreaching style does nothing for this underwhelming material about an unfulfilled radio shock-jock in New York who goes into hiding after suffering career misfortune, learning to live again after meeting an ex-professor who is now some kind of guru among the homeless. Literate perhaps but meandering, self-important comedy-drama, with Jeff Bridges visibly struggling on-screen alongside Robin Williams. Mercedes Ruehl won a Supporting Actress Oscar for showy, one-note role as Bridges' girlfriend. Williams, in free-association mode, attempts to steal the picture with his ranting, but he's mostly a nuisance. Overbaked folk lore and fairy tale symbolism detract from the narrative, and Gilliam is never able to move the audience emotionally with his heavy handedness. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm so disappointed in this movie. I love Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges is an excellent actor, but this movie was bitterly disappointing. The story just didn't cut it for me, it took too long to bring Robin Williams in, it was bitty and patchy and the vital spark of empathy was missing - I just didn't care what happened to them. I gave it 45 minutes and then went to unpack some moving boxes - an indication of how dreary it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a useless try</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've recently seen this film and I consider it one of the worst films I've ever seen.Although Robin Williams and Mercedes Ruehl's performances are pretty good in my opinion they are not enough to be an excuse to watch this film. This film tries to be complicated and different than the others,one of these films that make you change your life,such as other Robin Williams' films ,for example Dead Poets Society,however this film is just that,a try.All they show is a bunch of weird people whose lives have been ruined for one reason or another and make then play their roles in a "circus" half real and half fantasy with a pretentious typical fairy tail touch,including the unexpected ending.</fullReview>
