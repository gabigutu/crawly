		<shortDescription>Solid, realistic political melodrama - not a thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides of March isn't a story just about the back-alley dealings of those seeking to gain power; it's a morality tale of how much one must wrestle between doing things because he feels they are the right thing to do and doing things that will serve themselves better in the long run. It is a political melodrama, but it just as easily have been written about business and high finance. It's highly cynical, with its points driven home by a terrific cast, and yet it manages not to be heavy handed or preachy. Indeed, there aren't really any strictly good or bad guys in this movie.Ryan Gosling stars as Steven Myers, a top aide to Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney), who is running for president; currently at stake is the battleground state of Ohio. If Morris can gain Ohio's delegates, he's pretty much assured to get the Democratic nomination, and in the film it's noted that the Republicans have a weak field themselves (at best). All of this means, of course, that as Ohio goes, so goes the presidency, so there's plenty riding on this one primary.Morris' campaign manager is Paul Zara, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, a veteran of many cutthroat campaigns. And although Zara has the experience, Morris often turns to his young(ish) aide Steven to gain a less-jaded, more-truthful perspective. (Of course, by doing so, Morris is simply trying to hear from someone who may not be thinking four years or fewer down the road at his next job.) Like most staffers, Steven believes in Morris; he thinks that if the man is elected president, good things will happen. He is the prototypical idealistic aide; doing the right thing will win out over all, he believes. He's not completely naive to backdoor politics, but his organization, his analysis, his acumen, and his spirit are what endear Morris to him.Even though Steven is not a Mr. Perfect, a self-righteous do-gooder, he's savvy; he knows which buttons to push. He learns, though, that his chief obstacle to success is in recognizing whom is trustworthy, and just because one is friends with another doesn't mean that either owes the other much when it comes to the game of politics. For example, simply feeding the press (in the person of Marisa Tomei) the occasional tidbit doesn't mean that the media will be an extended PR arm for Morris.Somewhere along the line, Steven reaches a breaking point, a place at which loyalty isn't the most important thing on his plate. This point comes as a result of two pretty bad decisions, one that he knows is a bad idea right away and another that seems a little more innocent ? but then Steven has underestimated how petty, parochial, and vindictive those in the business can be. It's all about one's level of paranoia. You have to have some in order to foresee problems, but too much of it will hollow out your soul in a jiffy.Clooney, who also directed, looks and sounds presidential, but he's not the focus of the movie; as with his brilliant Good Night, and Good Luck, he's a powerful supporting character. Things don't revolve around Mike Morris as they do around Steven Myers, and that's one reason the movie works ? our focus is on the morality battle, and it's presumed that as a sitting governor, that battle's long been over for Morris.The hand-picked cast is superb. Not only do we get Clooney, Hoffman, Tomei, and Gosling, we also get Paul Giamatti as the governor's opponent's campaign manager. Each one seems to steal scenes, even ones they share. Even Evan Rachel Wood, as a new intern in Morris' camp, turns in a splendid performance.It's clear that The Ides of March won't be for everyone. It is, as I said, cynical ? highly so. It won't leave you hopeful about, well, anything. It gives you no one for whom to really cheer and yet no one for whom to really despise. It offers realism in lieu of hope, and its goal of trying to explain the motivations of those who get involved in these campaigns is reached. It's an effective, gripping melodrama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Political thrillers can be so juicy and filled with "gotcha" moments and "oh how could he/she" scenes. Inevitably, most come down to an "I believed in you" showdown and reckoning. This latest one based on the play Farragut North by Beau Willimon, gives George Clooney an opportunity to play out his political aspirations without opening himself to the real thing.Clooney also directs and the smartest move he made was assembling an ensemble cast of some of the best actors working today. Clooney plays Pennsylvania Governor Mike Morris, who is one of two still-standing Democratic Presidential contenders on the verge of the Ohio primary. His Campaign Manager is grizzled campaign veteran Paul, played with staunch principals and black and white rule book by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Their talented and idealistic Press Secretary Stephen is played by Ryan Gosling. Their opponent's manager Tom Duffy is played by Paul Giamatti. Duffy oozes cynicism and seems to have lost the rule book that Paul holds so dearly.The film begins with the set-up so we get a feel for just how strong or weak of character each of these men are. Morris (Clooney) is obviously an Obama-type idealist who claims his religion is the US Consitution. He says this while gently poking fun at his opponent's Christian beliefs. We see just how talented Stephen (Gosling) character is at handling the words that Clooney speaks and we see Paul (PSH) in full back room politico maneuvering.The film has two huge points where the mood swings. The first is a contrived, definite no-no meeting between the ambitious Stephen and the shrewd Duffy. The second is a sequence between Stephen and a 20 year old campaign intern named Molly (Evan Rachel Wood), who also happens to be the daughter of the Chairman of the DNC. These two events turn the film from political thriller to melodramatic Hollywood fare. That doesn't make it less of a movie, it's just different than it began.Cat and mouse games ensue and we see just who is the master manipulator amongst a group of professionals. This is one of those films where the individual pieces are actually more interesting than the whole pie. There are two really excellent exchanges between Gosling and Hoffman. Ms. Wood steals her scenes with ease. Jeffrey Wright nails his brief time as a desperate Senator negotiating the best deal possible. Giamatti's last scene with Gosling is a work of art. The only thing missing is a confrontation between Giamatti and Hoffman. THAT alone would be worth the price of admission.You might be surprised that Clooney actually minimizes the political meanderings, though he does get in a few jabs at the Republicans. This is more character drama ... how far can your ideals and morals carry you. What is your breaking point? Where is the line between realist and idealist? Is it betrayal if you act for the right reason? The final shot of film is superb. Et tu, Brute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The games people play to get ahead, not necessarily in politics, but within themselves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney is running for President. Well, I mean, in "The Ides of March," as Governor Mike Morris, he's running for the Democratic Presidential nomination. He's the good guy and his opponent is the bad guy. Because that's how it is supposed to be, right? The opponent's campaign manager is played by the ever-shady Paul Giamatti, while Morris' campaign is championed by the young, handsome idealistic Stephen (Ryan Gosling).This is about politics, the games people play to get ahead, and the types of people who get played?that's the interesting part. The refreshing part, is that this isn't about election night and who is going to win and who is going to lose. A few poll numbers are rattled off, but it's mostly about what is going to happen to our heroes (or anti-heroes) and what are they going to do in response. When you look like Clooney and Gosling, it's hard not to be the hero, but remember, this is politics and nobody is really a hero in that mess.People make mistakes. I enjoyed following Stephen as he struggled internally with his path forward. He believes in the good of the Governor. He's smart and passionate and makes a good campaign manager. His mistakes seem minor and understandable. The problem is, he's 30. He's at the in-between age, where he's half young-college-student-ready-to-take-over-the-world and half experienced-cynic. Those are two very combative halves and when they come at odds within him, the character takes some shocking and drastic turns.The few references to actual political gaffes are obvious and just done for comic relief. All the clever lines are stolen by Giamatti, who, I am predicting, will come away with the only acting nomination for the film. Although, the brilliant character work ? that's done by everybody, and is what makes "The Ides of March" so intriguing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No heroes, no villains, just real human beings - and what could be scarier?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Corruption is such a nasty word. It is universally steeped in negative connotation, and is a term applied theoretically to a selfish, unjust misuse of power. Yet, realistically, this evil becomes hard to determine, and many attempts at justification can be made using alternate terms, such as "motivated" or "single-minded". Many of the best social dramas have explored this ambiguous area: in House of Sand and Fog (2003) an unfairly biased policeman was put to work, for once, for the supposed sympathetic protagonist, but we still didn't find it excusable; more recently, in the fiercely intense Contagion, the top doctor leaked confidential information in order to place his wife's chances of survival above the others ? in this case, we can understand his position, but the injustice at hand here is still undeniable.It is very unfortunate in society that the places where corruption is most prevalent are those in which justice and citizenship is supposed to be the absolute goal. Contagion and other similar films expose this in the medical industry, films like L.A Confidential (1997) in the police force, and now George Clooney, as both writer and director, has brought us another razor-sharp political drama that reveals how cutthroat and sinister working in the government can be, even if creating a "free world" is purportedly the overall goal.Ryan Gosling portrays another robust yet ultimately inadequate young businessman attempting to excel in a challenging line of work. In Fracture (2007) it was the legal system, where, again, his character, Willy Beachum, faced this same temptation when his partners urged him to falsify evidence in order to put away a fiend that they knew to be guilty, yet could find no proof against. Willy resisted admirably, but Stephen Meyers, his more competent yet far less righteous character in The Ides of March, has rather weak moral resolve. He is the talented and favoured staffer of presidential candidate Governor Mike Morris (Clooney), a man whose political philosophies he genuinely supports, and is very anxious to see become president. However, Morris is a man who sticks firmly to his principles and is unwilling to make a strategic compromise. It is an insistence that frustrates Stephen, and indeed his entire team as they see guaranteed victory is within their grasp if he only concedes to endorse the slightly disagreeable Senator Thompson (although neither Jeffrey Wright nor Clooney exactly make it clear what it is that Morris dislikes about him). It is a case of breaking a few eggs to make a good cake, and as Morris continues refusing to do so, pressures mount, the opposition begins to gain the upper hand, and a highly riveting series of complications arises.Audiences will be happy to hear that they will not have to sit through a ridiculous amount of dry, technical passages of dialogue, sift through needlessly enigmatic storytelling methods and poke and prod their way through murky themes in order to find value in the film. The broader ideas are not all it has to offer, but lie over the top of the solid story foundations to be properly examined upon the reflection that takes place after viewing, as they should. This piece also works as a slickly entertaining, enthralling crime thriller. For while the intricate world of politics can arguably be likened to a game of chess, as it is in the film, the pieces are not stone figures, they are real people whose entire lives become ruined when they are captured by the opposing side/ Seeing as beyond the point of the Senator Thompson dilemma, the plot involves a string of juicy surprises, I shouldn't really reveal much more. All I will say is that Paul Giamati, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Evan Rachel Wood and Marisa Tomei all give exceptional performances as the key figures involved, and that each of their characters, and at one stage or another, harbours a deadly secret.Clooney's direction is remarkably apt, particularly in a wordless scene in which Hoffman's character is given aggravating news from Morris inside his car, and we become cheeky onlookers from the outside, not even seeing their faces. He has also done well adapting beau Willimon's play Farrugat North with the help of Oscar-nominated screenplay writer Grant Henslov (Good Night, and Good Luck) and the playwright himself. His performance as Morris is fine work also, but, for the common audience at least, the film really belongs to Gosling, who proves once again that he is more than just an exceptionally handsome teen idol, but the most convincing and versatile young actor since Johnny Depp, with Max Minghella (The Social Network) and Jennifer Ehle topping things off beautifully as part of the supporting cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd suggest you see Ides, film buffs; although more of a triple than a home run, the cast is superlative and the direction very fine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen (Ryan Gosling) is a razor-sharp, rising star political media consultant. Presently, he is working on Pennsylvania Governor Mike Morris' (George Clooney) campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Steve-o has only one man above him, overall campaign manager Paul (Philip Seymour Hoffman). The two consult each other daily. The governor has a single chief competitor, an Arkansas senator with his own astute adviser, Tom (Paul Giamatti). At the moment, the Ohio primary is looming and the staff is working out of Cincinnati. One of the governor's lower-level workers is beautiful Molly (Evan Rachel Wood), the daughter of the present head of the National Democratic Party. Only 20, she is just learning the ropes. One day, she makes a pass at Stephen and he responds positively. But, he makes it clear to her that politics is his passion and, especially, Mike Morris, his idol. Indeed, Morris is handsome, smart, and appears to speak sincerely and clearly to potential voters. Yet, very soon after their first encounter, Molly drops a bombshell on Stephen. It is a stunning piece of news, one that could knock the earth off its axis. Also, amazingly, Tom has been courting Stephen to "switch sides" while a respected, determined journalist, Ida (Marisa Tomei) is eager for any and all campaign stories. A cauldron of conflicting genuine and perceived realities is brewing. What will be the result? This is a fine film, based on a stage play, and directed by Mr. Clooney. While the story is more predictable in nature, the script has some great lines and Clooney's direction is quite, quite admirable. This is particularly true of the performances he draws from the cast, with Gosling, Hoffman, Giamatti, Tomei, Clooney himself, and especially Wood giving great turns. All the film's amenities, from sets, costumes, and camera work, are also nice. If you are a discriminating film buff, who loves quality flicks with ample discussion points, then I'd suggest you see Ides at your earliest convenience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very professional but doesn't have the sharpness or intelligence it suggests it does</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You came here from the trailers and the clever poster campaign? Or maybe you came here because you love Clooney and the idea of him doing a political film appeals to you because you agree with much of what he puts his name behind? Or maybe you just decided to watch on a whim? Well for me it was the first two that put it in my mind but the third that saw me pick this from the queue recently. The publicity leave you in little doubt that this is a smart political movie while the names involved all point to something that is worth your time, expensive and very professionally put together. In terms of these latter qualities the film does deliver but it is just a shame that it is not as good as it looks in regards the former.Let's deal with the superficial first. The film looks great and Clooney deserves credit for the job he has done here as it has a real sheen to it with really well designed shots and a real richness to the look (credit to the cinematographer of course). On top of this the score is just right ? a little generic in its tone perhaps but it works and fits the film well. Naturally the cast features a collection of names and faces for whom quality is the norm and generally the film looks and feels like it is a really good product. The only place where it falls down is that it isn't quite as smart as it thinks it is. The story is fairly straightforward and the "message" (if that is the word) is equally simple; this puts a lot of pressure on the lead character of Meyers to be engaging and thrilling in his journey into the murky compromises and twists of politics ? and this is the problem, it doesn't come over that way.The solid plot holds the attention and the sleek presentation feels like velvet throughout but the real meat of the story here needs to come through Meyers and sadly the material just doesn't make this happen. In terms of narrative he has it, but in terms of heart and soul of the man, it is lacking and as a result the film is lacking. It shows in Gosling's performance; he is a good presence, easy to look at and follow but he doesn't have enough within him to lift the film. I watched A Single Man the other day, in which Colin Firth delivered a great and nuanced performance that carried that entire film ? this needed Gosling to do that, but he didn't and/or couldn't with what he was given. Clooney is good in an easier role as are Hoffman, Giamatti, Tomei, Wright and others but they are the dressing around Gosling's character and as good as they look, they cannot hide the fact that the centrepiece just isn't as good as the trimmings suggest.It isn't a bad film, indeed I quite enjoyed it as it went along, but it is a lot less satisfying than it looks like it will be. Really professional and polished but the heart of the message doesn't come out and the central character doesn't deliver as they should. Solid, but neither as sharp or as smart as it thinks it is or as it should have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>politics with shocks and twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling's at his best in dramatic roles and there's no exception here. As things unravel - that happens quickly thanks to the intense plot - Gosling decides that his ambitions are so important that he'll be willing willing to lose his soul. George Clooney has a very strong appeal, he's very convincing, his acting being almost perfect. "Ides of March" has very few flaws, the twists in the plot are not predictable and overall doesn't have any problems connecting with the viewers. Eventually, though there's no character to empathize with, the audience has the impression of a notable film noir, challenging us to come to terms with what politics is nowadays. I've seen intelligent filmmaking and a provocative moral fable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth it, but funny aftertaste....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to write a review about this film. It's so full of contradictions (artistic and otherwise) that it leaves you with a funny aftertaste. The film is about an idealistic young man working as a consultant for a campaigning politician and the conflicts and dichotomies he has to face if he wants to remain whole and with his integrity unbroken. Purely from the filmmaking standpoint, the movie will remind you of political thrillers of the 70s made by Alan J. Pakula or Sydney Pollack. It's beautifully shot, has a great script, a very ad-hoc music score, great performances by everyone involved. The way the story and main character evolved, however, lacked coherence and at one point I was under the impression I was watching a fragment of a different movie. Somehow it went from A to D, skipping B and C altogether. That alone changed my viewing experience from fully satisfying to one that, as I said at the beginning, left a funny aftertaste. The movie is more of a character study than a political thriller per se; as the former, it works mainly because of the performances by actors who are able to convey the inner conflicts they face. As the latter, don't expect to be taken aback with unpredictable twists or edge-of-your-seat suspense, because you won't find those here. I give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, if it was made in 1965</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by stating that I do not need a movie to be filled with foul-mouthed, currently PC dialect, or trends at all. With that said, I'm sorry but I found The Ides of March outdated. I was looking forward to an intelligent, political film. This film had absolutely nothing new to offer. Other than pretty leading stars and the always solid backup of Giamatti and Hoffman, I cannot understand the nominations. The story line would have been interesting in the 1960's, not 2011. It seems to me that if you are going to rehash a politician with a squeaky-clean reputation cheating with an intern, at this point there also needs to be some deeper insight or intrigue to the story, otherwise it's a big "why bother?". The interns fate is right out of novels from the early 20th century. They may have explored the Senator's side of the story more; something, anything, to make this relevant to tell again. Like many women, I have no problem looking at Mr. Gosling for 1 1/2 hours- but best screenplay? I'm sure there are many more deserving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great start to a disappointing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides of March is a political thriller about the Democratic Primary in Ohio at the start of a political rally for who will eventually be nominated to run for President. Political Manager Stephen Myers (Ryan Gosling) is top of his game as new presidential candidate Mike Morris (George Clooney) looks to be well on his way to winning the Ohio primary. However, several moves on the political spectrum, and a surprise controversy uncovered part way through, shake the idealistic Myers to his core, and puts him knee deep in a race for the primary with his candidate as the target to lose it all.Sounds great right? Well it could have been ? 7.5 / 10 What Clooney wants with this film is something that was just accomplished by the film Contagion only a few months ago, in short, he wants to realistically represent what actually goes on behind all the media storm and speeches, what really goes into the hearts of the political campaigners as they battle for the chance to win the presidential spot for their party. And the film certainly starts well enough in that spectrum.But a fundamental shift halfway through the film or so. It goes from realistically portraying the events that take place, to suddenly becoming something much more emotional. What happens isn't so much unbelievable as it is badly placed in a movie that does not seem to want to tell a story as much as make a statement. Instead what it does is tell a story and says to hell with the statement, but still wants to act like it is making a statement.This is because it goes from realistic to emotional. Contagion worked because it portrayed an outbreak realistically, the emotional parts were limited and had more to do with people being people rather than ever replacing the logical and clockwork functions of a virus, which is clockwork. This movie decides that a logical game of chess (politics, same thing) can be completely destroyed because a pawn has a heart attack.The real issue is the twist itself and that's stepping into spoilerville. Essentially, so much melodrama is suddenly demanded from one simple scene, that it throws the intelligent and logical viewpoint of the movie so completely off track that it doesn't remember that this is supposed to be a movie about politics and works on more spectrums than just the one going on behind people's bedroom doors.But at least the acting was great. You hear a lot about Gosling's performance in the lead role, but the greats take the cake, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti are so empowered as the heads of their candidates' political campaigns and knowing so much more than Gosling, that you would be more impressed if you hadn't seen them in better movies doing better roles.All that banter and ranting being said, Ides of March could have been a great movie had it kept its head and tried to offer an acceptable reason for the dirty game of politics, rather than amounting to a few too many cookies missing from the cookie jar. Their reasoning focuses too much on the antics of one type of scandal, rather than the true strategic meanderings of people, media, and candidates. The movie actually leaves us much like Gosling at the end, disappointed, confused, and wondering at what point our true expectations got left behind and converted without us even knowing about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outstanding performances by Giamatti and Hoffman as is nearly everything they do. Ides of March starts off with high energy looking forward to the make or break state presidential primary. It could have kept us in suspense as we watched political intrigue and the drama of back dealing unfold from both sides. Instead we watch Ryan Gosling's affair with an intern become the center of a silly who slept with who. Unbelievably, Mr. Goslings character who is supposedly politically savvy beyond his years commits a blunder one would expect of a teenager. After that happened Ides of March no longer held interest. Admittedly, the last five minutes did redeem the dull middle somewhat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting but disappointing ending in my books</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie's premise is a good one. Coming at a time when America is rich with political strife, the ideas of march brings a few key issues to light and attempts to wrap it all up in a pretty bow, with a couple twists and turns along the way. I enjoyed the first half of the movie. The writing in on point as is the acting. Given the star studded cast you would expect nothing less. It gives you a sense that there could be some good politicians out there, ones willing to stand by their morals and principals and change the great United states of America. It covers such topics as our reliance on oil, our religious debates as well as gender classification, gay rights and abortion. It pretty much touches on so many topics that every single person in the audience will find themselves at one point or another personally vested in it's outcome. It does a good job keeping you wondering. Where it loses me is the ending. Nothing irks me more than a movie that doesn't take ownership of it's plot and grant the viewer the courtesy of an ending. Now albeit I was disappointed with Inceptions ending as well, which I know is not in agreeance with a lot of people. Personally I just felt let down when Ryan Goslings character never reaches the final climax. He sits down- looks at the camera and that's it. I get it, the premise is he's going to out the whole scandal and you can argue that the title of the movie alludes this but I'm sorry, I just feel let down and robbed that the writer/director didn't think enough of me to shoot that final scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well we see George Clooney play himself yet again. There is no real acting talent at all and the plot is thin an weak. Ryan Gosling, on the other hand does put in a credible performance as his aid. Ryan finds himself caught between a rock and a hard place however it is not enough to save this very average film. The way in which the dirty side of politics is portrayed is given some credence here and that may be its saving grace.By the time the end of the film had rolled around I was bored and then to see this long shot of Ryans face hiding the anguish due to his actions was really quite pathetic. I wondered if the director had run out of ideas and was trying to make the drama stronger with this quite silly closing shot.If you are really bored, have nothing at all better to do then it might be worth a look but really you would have to be at your wits end to see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry, but this one clunked from beginning to end. Let's start with the plot. Idealistic staffer for presidential candidate is tempted to the other side. Then a silly girl suicides because her lover, the candidate, disappoints her. One is tempted to ask what she expected, especially as she's from a political family and is also a staffer for the same candidate: hasn't she heard of Monica? Then candidate denies having known her, to the great disappointment of Mr Idealist. Again, what did he expect? Acting? It's OK, but I never found myself caring for a single moment what happened to any of the characters, not Mr Idealist, not the silly girl, and certainly not presidential candidate Clooney, whose only policy seemed to be some ridiculous waffle about renewable energy.I was bored about two minutes after this started and it never got any better. Just totally unconvincing from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And to talk about alternate thrillers, put this next to also Academy Award-nominated "Margin Call" for screenplay you easily spot the difference, both in the quality of performances and the power of the script. This thriller-drama revolves around Stephen (Ryan Gosling), a smart staffer for a campaign who learns the true face of politics the quick way.The script is captivating and it draws the audience at the exact moment the film starts, but what satisfies more than the changes in Gosling from the beginning to the end? Ryan Gosling delivers his transition realistically through events that unfold in front of him, with solid and believable performances scene after scene that prove he is a highly capable actor. Gosling's mask-like portrait of the nameless hero in "Drive" is amazing and exciting, but his performance in "The Ides of March" undoubtedly expose to us more of his if not flawless, masterful and flexible acting abilities. And we shouldn't leave out Hoffman and Giamatti, who are both incredible and perfect for their roles, Paul Zara and Tom Duffy, respectively. Clooney is great, but credits should definitely be given to him for the whole package, for his directing and writing rather than his performance alone. Evan Rachel Wood plays a supporting role as Molly Stearns, who is much related to the entire campaign itself and many characters. She is also the key that motivates Gosling's actions."The Ides of March" is certainly one of the most powerful and believable political thrillers or dramas out there, so don't miss this for certain.- dchgl.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unbelievable is a word that got it's usage all twisted in recent years. People use it now as a synonym for 'extraordinary' or 'incredible.' Not me.This review has plenty of spoilers. It's not meant for those who haven't already seen the movie. It's meant for those who want to know what others think about it.On the plus side, it's got a cast of heavyweight actors (especially Philip Seymour Hoffman, and why does he have to chain smoke? Don't the producers know that people learn these bad habits from the movies?) so it's watchable. But as a story it's ..... unbelievable. Let me explain with a comparison: Think about Avatar. That movie begins by presenting us with a futuristic existence in a world with interplanetary space travel. Then we are introduced to a concept where people can lie down in a chamber and control a real live body which was designed to act on the hosts mental commands. That's absurd, isn't it? Yet once I accepted the basic premise, from then on, everything made sense. Now compare that to Ides of March: Set in modern day USA with ordinary people (no super powers etc.), what it presents to us should be reasonable. I don't mean to say an action flick where the hero never get's shot after 20 gunfights with automatic weapons. Those kind of movies we're trained to accept as pure fantasy whenever and wherever they are set.I mean this movie is about characters who are set in a modern day election campaign, and it seems the key theme is the changing of one person from a loyal idealist into a ruthless selfish criminal. So the 1st key event is when Ryan Gosling, a key staffer in George Clooney's Presidential campaign, is given a call by Paul Giamatti, who is the head campaign manager of the rival candidate. Giamatti wants Gosling to meet him for a chat. Gosling hesitates, then agrees.Giamatti offers Gosling a job if he will change sides because he thinks Gosling is so talented. Gosling declines, then goes back to his headquarters and tells his boss, Philip Seymour Hoffman about the interview and restates his loyalty to Clooney.How does this differ from an engineer at Apple getting a call from a headhunter and offering them an interview at Google, to work on the latest Android OS for twice the pay? It happens all the time. It's legal. It's ethical, to the point the Apple engineer may have a nondisclosure agreement he signed when hiring in about proprietary technology. In the case of the movie, that doesn't count because at the same time, Hoffman was trying to woo a senator for an endorsement and gave away all the Clooney 'strategy' to what turned out to be the competition.So Hoffman makes a big deal about the meeting Gosling had with Giamatti as if that was a big breach of ethics to find out what the guy wanted. Phony premise. Then what happens gets more unbelievable. Hoffman fires Gosling for having the meeting after leaking that 'story' (who would care about that) to the press, and Gosling then confronts Giamatti and agrees to work for him.Giamatti laughs in his face and explains how smart he had been arranging this coup: He explains that if Gosling had originally jumped ship, that was a big win for him and if Gosling didn't he knew all about Hoffman's character and that Gosling would get fired anyways, so that would deprive Clooney of his talents which was the objective. A win-win for Giamatti.That's all too much for me to buy. After that we learn what a rat everybody involved really is, with death, extortion and backstabbing all rearing their heads which isn't so unbelievable, except for one thing: If the people involved were so ruthless, how come nobody disappears in the middle of the night or while walking down the street? That would be realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat two-dimensional and rushed expose of cynical political practice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The odd thing about The Ides Of March is that, in a way, it ends halfway through. It is about the blooding of a young deputy campaign manager and his rather brutal initiation into some of the darker arts of running a presidential campaign (in this case the campaign of a state governor who wants the Democratic nomination). That campaign manager, Ryan Gosling, who does not seem especially naive when it all gets going, is transformed before our eyes from a reasonably idealistic man into all that he would previously have despised: we meet him when he insists that he is working for the governor (George Clooney, who also directed and co-wrote the film) because his boss wants to do all the right things - save the planet, stop going to war, that kind of thing. But by the end of the film (which can only have been a week later in the film's time) he has resorted to blackmailing the governor not only into sacking his top campaign manager (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and appointing him instead, but in accepting the endorsement and votes of a state senator the Clooney character despises, who will play ball and help the governor get electedn on the promise that he will be made the new Secretary of State. And that, really, is it.I'd like to think that the 'message' of Clooney's new film is not 'my, my, but isn't politics dirty'. But then if that isn't the message what is? Is gorgeous George really trying to tell us to 'watch out - water's wet!' And that is a slight problem with The Ides Of March. A more complete film would have used what we are given more or less as a prologue to the full story. Taking the Shakespearean allusion just a stage further, if the full story is the tragedy of Stephen Myers (Gosling's character), Clooney's film gives us only the first two acts. What happens next? That is what I want to know.I have no trouble at all in accepting that a previously idealistic man can have the stuffing knocked out of him and be transformed into the kind of cynical bastard his boss and his boss's rival are. But that transformation does happen almost in the twinkle of an eye, and we are given no reference points in the Gosling character which would indicate that it has all been brewing up for some time. In fact, the film goes out of its way to show him as decent and upright. I have no way of knowing personally, but if the kind of down and dirty muck-raking and wheeler-dealing shown in is not par for the course in politics, I'll eat my hat. And it would be pretty naive to expect the viewer to accept that it is all a bit exceptional but that otherwise our politicians are good men and women and true.Apart from that flaw, this is an engrossing and entertaining film with some great performances. Unfortunately, the flaw does loom rather large in my reactions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible Premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, put George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Paul Giamatti in one film, and it will be worth watching, no matter how lame the story is.The main problem with the story for me is that the scenario written for Molly isn't believable. The authors spend the first third of the movie convincing us how mature beyond her 20 years this girl is, street savvy enough to sleep with a sitting governor-presidential candidate and one of his campaign managers, yet afraid to ask Mommy or Daddy for $900? She comes from wealth; I'm sure she spent more than that amount on her prom dress or the smart suit for all her upscale interviews with the power brokers surrounding her well-connected dad. Shoot, I'd be surprised if she doesn't have a couple of credit cards with at least that amount on 'em. Would you send your daughter off without emergency funds? But, okay, let that pass for the moment. The next problem I have with how they wrote her character is that when Stephen tells her she made a mistake and that means she forfeits the right to stay in the game, she folds. This smart, savvy, mature-beyond-her-years young woman folds. I think, especially in today's world, she'd realize immediately that SHE holds all the cards. She IS the game at this point. She can call any shot she wants. Yet, the writers have her yield and metaphorically slink away. I think a smart, savvy young woman in her position when strong-armed by Stephen-the-underling would have called his bluff.That would have upped the ante. What would Stephen do then? How far would he have gone in his negotiations with Clooney? Would Stephen have joined forces with Molly? By dismissing the girl's potential with sexist nonchalance, the writers missed a golden opportunity to update and make much more complex the rest of the story. When she makes "a mistake" she's supposed to go home and quit playing the game; when Stephen makes "a mistake" it's written into the story that he finds a way to capitalize on it and come out on top. Seriously? Aren't we ready as a society to move beyond that tired context? So, enjoy the acting and actors in this film, but lament the storyline and demand better in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible movie. American politics twist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe I watched it, The plot I didn't get and the ending was an anti climax. I suppose its a good mirror of how politicians are 2 faced. Really struggling to come up with 10 lines here to review this movie as it does not have many redeeming points about it and I don't want to give the plot away. I suppose I watched the movie thinking about where it was going and how it would end.. and it ended with? what?!! no idea. I suppose in the states people might be kinder about this movie, but I think it lacked all imagination or originality. Its as if it were a copy/paste story from Clinton era with a slight twist. I did not think George C. did himself any favours with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glum take of unpleasant people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides Of March, directed and co-written by George Clooney, takes its title from the day on which Julius Caesar was betrayed by the Senators he trusted. Which is not to say that this is exactly an updating of Julius Caesar. The political betrayal is elsewhere in this drama about the machinations behind the campaign of US Presidential candidate Mike Miller (Clooney in a relatively small part). This film centres on Miller's media consultant Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) and his interactions with Miller's campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti) who is the campaign manager of Miller's opponent, Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood) who is an intern with the Miller campaign, and Ida Horowicz (Marisa Tomei), a political journalist.The opening is rather hard work for those of us who are not that familiar with the mechanics of US politics but, as the roles of the individuals become clear, and the plot develops, the human story takes over from the political one. It is quite interesting, albeit rather glum, given that it involves the power struggles and other activities going on between a number of people, none of whom is very pleasant.All the cast are very good, but Clooney is outstanding. Gosling, not an actor who has impressed me so far, is given a part here which suits his impassive screen persona, and he gives glimpses of emotion. Perhaps that is his gift, to project a lack of emotion and then to open the window slightly every now and then. I'm not convinced yet, though.It is no doubt a very worthy movie, and will probably do well come the awards season, but I can't say that I enjoyed it very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politically Charged Stage Play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audiences leaving George Clooney's latest Ides Of March will feel like they've just finished a watching a really good play.What makes sense of this is the fact Ides Of March was adapted from a play. In a play telling an audience everything they need to know always helps, especially when the majority of it are only going to see it once. However the difference in film is the aesthetic liberties it allows its' director and I don't think in this Clooney took enough advantage of that.There is a part to this movie where a business exchange takes place inside of an escalade parked outside of a barbershop. The words being exchanged within that escalade are left to the audience's imagination because the camera never goes inside, but stands staring at it from across the street. Ides of March could've used a lot more scenes like this, but Clooney played it safe with a conventionally linear story line. And I think Clooney put so much more into the story line than he needed to for the audience's sake.This film didn't leave enough to the imagination of its' audience. While the actors carried out every single demand of this script, the film itself doesn't leave its' audience with enough to make them want to watch it again. The amount of telling done over this show leaves little to no replay value. It feels like the majority of the aesthetic was put into the script when I think a minimum would've been more than enough. Ides of March's script told me a lot more than I needed to know. It feels like the script told me so much that I forgot some key elements to the story. Then again the liberties he took with the script is exactly what allowed Ryan Gosling to take his character to some extremes.In terms of acting, with names like Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Paul Giamatti, Clooney delivers an all-star studded Sega Dream-Cast. And in terms of his direction, Clooney really leaves Ides Of March to his roots in the stage. However with that said I'm afraid it all felt a little too staged for the silver screen.For the sake of cinema I think Clooney could've taken a little more of an aesthetic liberty with this project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lose the liberalism 1st 30 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is the assistant manager of Democratic Governor Mike Morris's (George Clooney) presidential campaign. Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is the campaign manager. Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti) the opponent's campaign manager meets up with Stephen Meyers and offers him a job. Eventually the meeting is discovered. In the meanwhile, Meyers has been sleeping with an intern Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood) who reveals a shocking secret.This story seems old fashion. They talk about 3-4% as if it's rock solid. There's no real talk about internet or 3rd party involvement. It's all very 1999. Morris' speeches are filled with big unimportant things. They never seem to be real people talk. The whole first half is a sad iteration of liberal fantasy talk and inside political wrangling.Then when it turns, it's already 45 minutes in and too late. They needed to cut at least half of that time out. All the BS speeches need to go. I think it's suppose to show how idealistic Meyers was at the start which is really sad. To think that the second in command of a presidential candidate could be so naive even in Ohio. It's really sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The non-American individual is always a bit lost when it comes to US elections, and The Ides of March is pretty much no exception to the rule.The script suffers from a certain difficulty for the uninformed viewer to fully understand what is at stake and the little aspects of that big machinery. Therefore, the plot loses a lot of interest and we find ourselves enduring this succession of unclear scenes. Moreover, the message that one manages to get from the scenario has been used many times: politics is a crooked world where the personal interest comes before the general. Not revolutionary whatsoever.The characters could also have used more development and depth. Even so, the cast did quite honorably except perhaps Gosling that lacked emotions, which is the case sometimes for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did We Need a Movie to Tell Us That Politics Is a Corrupt Business?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This limp political thriller stars Ryan Gosling as a wunderkind campaign director who suffers a dark night of the soul when he learns some unsavory things about the candidate to whom he's devoted his life (George Clooney) and ends up as cynical and jaded as the very system he chooses to believe doesn't have to exist.That someone could be so brilliant at engineering campaigns while being so seemingly ignorant of the devious machinations behind them doesn't make any sense at all, and that more than anything is the biggest flaw at the heart of "The Ides of March." Gosling's character isn't consistent, and Gosling, though a fine actor, can't do much with the role. Clooney, taking a refreshing break from his hang-dog likable nice-guy roles, is much more fun as our villain, but he's not in the movie very much. And it's surprising to me that someone who in his personal life seems as politically astute and involved as Clooney would choose to make a movie (he also directed and co-wrote it) that appears to think it's the height of profundity to tell us that the political system is corrupt. Is there anyone on Earth who doesn't already know that? What could have sizzled instead lands with a thud.Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, but nothing earthshaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ides of March" is the story of a political campaign from the perspective of a campaign aide of the name Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling). It is meant to portray the nature of a political campaign and how the entire process is a grueling ordeal. In addition, it is meant to expose some of the under-the-table dealing and corruption involved in the election process.Stephen Meyers is an idealistic campaign aide, who from the beginning of the campaign, believes strongly that his candidate, Mike Morris (George Clooney), absolutely must win in order for the United States to succeed, as a country. The story depicts how Meyers is broken down by the political process and is turned into a part in the corrupt machine that he is trying to work against.One of the biggest strong points of this movie is the acting. Ryan Gosling brilliantly plays a young man who is driven by idealistic views of how a country should be and how a government should serve its people. He manages to play an intelligent character who is simply too naive to understand how things really work in national politics. In addition, Phillip Seymour Hoffman does a very precise job playing the campaign manager Paul Zara, depicting him as a a man who has been hardened by many years of weathering a corrupt political system, and has been turned from an idealist to a pragmatic realist.The weakness in this film is that it fails to convey anything that is already known to people who follow politics. It does not give a fresh perspective that a politically aware moviegoer would be hoping for. It simply gives specific examples of the interaction between two political campaigns as well as the campaigns and the news media.In the end this is a well written movie with well acted characters, but it simply falls short of reaching its intended goal. This is not a bad watch and would be worth seeing once. Ryan Gosling's performance in this movie is definitely worth consideration for "Best Actor" at the Oscars, but this film will probably not have much of a chance at "Best Picture".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd rather watch 'Primary Colors'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why doesn't this film scratch the surface? We never learn much about Morris the politician outside of campaign offices, and the sidelines at a few events leading up to a primary: we don't know what kind of politician he is even *supposed* to be, and we don't know what the Gosling's idealistic campaign manager really believes in. Clooney appears to have been content to rely on recent events to develop the character of an Obama-like liberal rather than to develop the story of a career both on the verge and in jeopardy, and it isn't much of an emotional letdown for us when we learn the truth about Morris. The story does well with the machinations in and between campaign offices, with good performances by Gosling, Giamatti, and Seymour-Hoffman, but there is not much in the way of political reality here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, guys, I've watched the movie and I have to say it stands for NBC - Nothing But Crap... I love George Clooney and RYan Gosling was OK until this one, but the story line and screenplay just made me cry after watching +-25 minutes of the movie... Seriously, what made me so disappointed was the screenplay and it's far far distant connection to reality... It just ticked me off... let me explain why.. Froms this genre of movies where we see politics, real people and no fiction involved (I mean no spidermans or hulks, where you'd expect no connection to reality), I think we all expect it to be at least to be a little bit more connected to the way events, people and things evolve in real world. But this, this....!!!!??? real NBC... dialogues are cr..p, sorry, but it is.. the way things and events evolve around characters - are just something that makes you want to stop the watching the movie and say it out loud - B...S..., things don't happen this way in a real world and people don't do things they do the way they do in this screenplay.Seriously, I haven't even taken a single second to take a look at who's the screenplay writer was, but dude, this is one of the worst movies that I ever saw G.C. taking part in... Story line is 'NBC', monologues, dialogues and spin of of the events and how everything turns out at the end - the biggest gap between the reality and how things would've evolved if it was real and what was written in the story line... sorry, but G.C. stick to what you do best - acting - leave the directing to people who know how to do it... honestly, this is one of the cr...piest movies I've ever saw starring G.C.</fullReview>

He'd better hope that they don't start to like him too much because when they do they start to put you in garbage like this. Ides of March should have been a great political thriller, but instead we get a predictable movie that telegraphs all of its intentions and leaves you empty. I guess George has become cynical about politics and I guess I can't blame him based on the current situation. I guess I can understand why more people haven't flocked to this movie. My husband fell asleep on the first half and I was angry after the second half. The movie should have left you with something to think about like Michael Clayton but it didn't; too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gosling plays Stephen Meyers, an ambitious staff member for a democratic presidential candidate played by Clooney. As Meyers is torn between his ambition on the one side and his loyalty to the democratic camp on the other, some obvious political intrigue ensues.The premise of the film plus the 2 or 3 little twists the film has on offer is simply not enough to fill a feature film length. I read that it was based on a play; it shows. On top of that the movie doesn't offer any characters to connect with nor does it give them enough backdrop to accomplish that in the longer run. It's a tale just like you would expect to surface from within the political arena in the US. I found myself simply not caring for the outcome since it seems so inconsequential to begin with. If a movie wants to make me root for someone or some cause, it needs to show me the reason for it. Some obvious rhetoric about alternative energy or a who-slept-with-who is really just a tad too thin.The role of Clooney could have been played by his next door neighbor without much consequence and it were mainly Giamatti and Seymour Hoffman who were able to bring some gravitas to their roles. Perhaps the main focus of the film should have been on their characters in stead of Gosling's. I thought there was some worthwhile yet undeveloped conflict there. As it stands the film is totally forgettable and, considering some people called it the next Michael Clayton, a sore disappointment.5/10</fullReview>

And, if you paid attention in history class or read Julius Caesar and recall the soothsayer telling Caesar " beware the ides of March," you probably anticipated there might be a bit of backstabbing taking place. Throw in a pregnant campaign intern, a suicide, the usual palace intrigue &amp; standard Washington, DC Machiavellianism and there you are.That's pretty much the problem with the Ides of March. It's all pretty obvious and predictable. No suspense or cliffhangers. No original plot twists &amp; turns. If you're into political drama, you'll probably enjoy this movie. Watching Ryan Gosling for 90 minutes or so is a pleasant experience. Philip Seymour Hoffman turned in a credible performance of a two-dimensional character. Clooney appeared to have phoned in his performance, which is odd since he's credited as both writer &amp; director as well. Possibly multi-tasking is too great a burden for him to bear.

Netflix's pretentious House of Cards is another example. The characters are corrupt and scheming, leaving no one for an audience to sympathize with. No wonder nobody trusts Washington. This film seems to suggest we should accept and expect dishonest showboating instead of realistic, honest political discussion. This film did nothing more for me than remind me of why I generally don't vote. I was hoping for something exciting, as the title's reference to Julius Caesar suggested, but no; it's just boring, political scheming, which, at best, falls flat as a film.

		<fullReview>This movie is like that joke you heard on the bus from some kid you didn't know when you were in grade school. It has a really elaborate setup, and you're really excited to get to the punchline, but when you hear it. the whole thing falls flat.Because the setup for this movie is really good. You've got a maverick politician running against a traditional party hack, whose candidacy had energized not just the hopeful young interns on his staff, but also his jaded, faded, seen-it-all manager. And he's given a new hope to his junior campaign manager, and idealistic young man who was beginning to lose faith in the political system.There's even a cute subplot about Our Hero getting involved with a perky little intern who is even younger and more idealistic than he is.Of course, as soon as you see this setup, you know that the perfect candidate is going to do something perfectly awful to bring everyone's hopes crashing down. You settle in for a political thriller and wait for the bodies, literally or figuratively, to pile up.And then?Nothing really happens, and what little that happens is wholly unbelievable.Without dropping any big spoilers, I can tell you that the perfectly awful thing would-be President Clooney does is the kind of rookie mistake that a man of his age, intelligence and political sophistication would never make. This is the kind of trouble high school boys get into on Friday nights. Not only that, as perfectly awful things go, it's a pretty pedestrian mistake, and one that would be easy to sweep under the rug.From this point on, the movie piles one unbelievable and unrealistic episode of top of another, and this great setup is lost in a farrago of events that strain our suspension of disbelief.The most ridiculous of which is when a character that might as well have "Party-Line Sleazeball" tattooed on his forehead passes up a chance to blow his opponent's candidacy out of the water.I can tell that this movie wants to teach me that no matter what their rhetoric is, all politicians are amoral finks; a bunch of conniving, backstabbing predators who will do and say anything to get elected and stay in power.Yeah, I think most people got the memo on that during the Nixon Administration, and Tricky Dick's successors haven't really done much since 1974 to make us think otherwise. Movie, even if you have nothing new to say, shouldn't you have at least said the same old thing in a better way?It's a real shame that this movie turns out to be a whole lot of nothing going on, because the performances are very good and the actors are all extremely well cast. I'm giving it four stars for the structure and the performances. Bottom line? I saw the first half hour of what promised to be a really great movie, and then the movie spent the last half hour breaking that promise, and delivering to me on a bright, shiny platter with the 2010's written all over it some old news from the 70's.If you have to see everything that Ryan Gosling, or George Clooney or Phillip Seymour Hoffmann are in, because you are a big fan of one or more of them, see this movie for their performances. If not, skip it, because, trust me, you've seen this all before, and written a whole lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Especially Exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have a real interest in behind the scenes political wheeling and dealing, then "The Ides Of March" might give you your fix for a while. That's basically what this is - a look at the political backrooms. I've spent my time (in an earlier part of my life) in the political backrooms. It was never at this high a level, but, frankly, politics is politics, and whatever the office being sought the basic dynamics are the same. Everybody wants a piece of the action, a piece of the power and a piece of the candidate. That's in evidence here. The candidate is Mike Morris (George Clooney) - a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. Behind the scenes you have Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) - who seems to be the press secretary - and campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman.) You also have an attractive young female intern (Even Rachel Wood) - always a problem for Democrats!For most of the first hour of this movie nothing of great interest happens except jockeying for behind the scenes influence. Finally, at that point, a scandal and then a tragedy is introduced - but both get used to simply add to the behind the scenes jockeying for position. And really - who cares? I long ago got over my fixation with politics and politicians (at least as an active and avid participant.) The best quote in the movie was "he's a politician. He'll let you down eventually." So true. And watching the parasitic, behind the scenes hangers on to the politicians who let you down eventually who just move from campaign to campaign (or sometimes into lobbying jobs) because they can't find real work isn't very inspiring.Sure, it's an accurate enough look at what goes on behind the scenes. The scandal and tragedy I really didn't finds gripping. The basic problems here were that I didn't feel any kind of sympathy for any of the characters, and I don't especially care for George Clooney. It's worthwhile watching only if you really must see the sorts of things that go on behind the scenes in a campaign. (3/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bravo. Gorgeous George has done it again. Not much with his performance this time but with his directing skills. This is his best work after Good Night, and Good Luck of 2005. Like Good Night, and Good Luck, Clooney does not take the upper hand in this one as well. The entire script revolves around Ryan Gosling who does an incredible job. This young man is surely and slowly making his mark. He is cool, composed and more importantly focused in his character. The entire cast has been picked wondrously and each of them execute their roles to perfection. In fact, this movie stars several Academy Award winners including Clooney himself. One thing is for sure George Clooney isn't just a pretty face. He knows his piece very well and acts accordingly. Giamatti and Hoffman are one of the best natural actors ever born. You give them any roles and they will perform no matter what. But the star of this movie is definitely Gosling. The plot is rather simple but the story kinks itself in a dramatic way. The one message this movie conveys is that no matter how good or honest a politician displays himself to be, he or she has always a dark and suppressible background. This is a very important movie indeed but this is not for everybody to enjoy.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If George Clooney were not attached to this film it would have been shuffled off into oblivion and never heard of again. But because Mr. Popular himself is director, writer and star...it got rave reviews and even award nominations. I can promise you it deserves none of the accolades. I don't mean that it isn't reasonably entertaining and it isn't a bad movie but it is so stereotypical, by the book, predictable and you'll realize that you've seen this time and time again. Some reviewers called it 'thrilling' and 'captivating.' I definitely don't get the thrilling part because there isn't any 'thriller' aspects to this movie. Yes the performances are decent but the script is so hum drum and typical that it just loses any merit it might have. They are very fortunate that they had a strong actor like Gosling and the chemistry of Clooney because otherwise I think this movie would be a five or less and would be completely lost in the grand scheme of predictability.Ryan Gosling is good at playing the young hot headed political master mind. He's almost too young to be believable but he pulls it off because Gosling really is a brilliant actor. He does make the film watchable and is always entertaining in his roles. George Clooney is the Governor running for President. Clooney is a good actor at times but usually his most heralded performances I find just okay and this is one of them. He is downright boring. Yes he looks Presidential but the character is so boring and typical. I even thought his chemistry with Gosling was just average. Philip Seymour Hoffman is such a terrific actor and he gets wasted so often in films. He is good in this movie as a rival to Gosling but he gets placed in the background (much like they did with Moneyball) and never gets to really let loose. Another example of this is Paul Giamatti, another terrific actor who has been getting the short end of the stick lately, and is barely used in this movie. Even when he is on screen his character is very drab. Evan Rachel Wood seems to start out strong in her character and has great chemistry with Gosling but then a turn in the story pushes her character into complete monotony.I'm just really surprised that George Clooney would write this and not think to himself...do we need another story about this? Aren't people tired of the same old political story? Because that is what this film is. A very simple, straight forward, tired old political story. Gosling raises up the ante of the film enough to make it reasonably watchable. As much as everyone hypes the movie I will encourage people to really pass this and find something more captivating. Its not a waste of time but it also won't stick with you after its done and over with. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Ides of March", directed by George Clooney, was a bland and uninvolved watch. The focus of the movie is glitzy political schtick. It feels like it has little substance or meat to it. It reminded me of "Charlie Wilson's War" - another movie with many capable actors but with a vapid preachy story. Clooney here clearly uses political dialog and banter for his own slant on things which may or may not be agreeable, but the atmosphere is trite and like a television drama. How many times, do we have to watch "news channels" set up in movies to some how validate authenticity. (spoilers) While none of the acting is really poor, there's little to say, and a dumb open-ended ending sort of leaving me wonder - OK, what was all that supposed to be? Not Recommended. Note Clooney himself in the movie is curiously aloof supposedly a warm politician ringing phony.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faultless acting, direction and writing, but ultimately rather pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the height of the run-in for the Democratic Presidential candidate, young campaign manager Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling), who is working for Governor of Pennsylvania Mike Morris (George Clooney), is called for a meeting by rival campaigner Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti) who attempts to convince him to jump ship. Meyers refuses, but fails to tell his boss Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), only to admit it to him later. Furious at the lack of trust now between the two, Zara fires Meyers, who furiously tries to join the rival team. During this time, Meyers has been romancing intern Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood), who may just harbour a secret of his own. Over the course of the film, Meyers learns the true nature of politics, and just what it takes to survive in the business.There are three things that cannot be faulted with this film - that is the stellar acting by a multi-talented cast, the sharp script, and Clooney's direction. Gosling is quickly becoming Hollywood's favourite A-lister (even though I've been championing him for years!), combining good looks, charm, and a huge acting talent. 2011 was good to him, with this film, and the year's sleeper hit, Drive, catapulting him to stardom. The reliable supporting cast - Giamatti, Hoffman, Clooney, Wood, Jeffrey Wright and Marisa Tomei - all prove effective in their roles. The script, by Grant Heslov, Beau Willimon, and Clooney himself, packs a lot into its feature running time, but it keeps things rather tense and suitably fierce. And Clooney, who is quickly becoming a hugely confident director, keeps the style of the film very much that of the political thrillers of the 1970's. Not to say he is a homage director, but he clearly takes his styles from his peers. Given that America's finest cinematic era was the 70's, there's certainly nothing wrong with taking its influences from it.Yet, given all the style and fine acting on display, The Ides of March seems rather pointless. It is clearly depicting the corruption of the self through politics as Gosling evolves from naive and passionate wunderkid, to morally dubious game-player, though it's nothing that has been seen before. So politics corrupts? No s**t. A shame then, as I wanted to really like this film, and I suppose I did, but ultimately it left me yearning for more, and I felt the film would have been more effective as a mini-series, giving time to breathe life into its characters between the moments of back-stabbing and shady meetings. It's undoubtedly extremely well made and well-intentioned, but rather hollow. Clooney, however, still remains a director of promise, and I will still be eager to watch whatever he directs next.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it was a good film, a good production.The story has some ups and downs with somewhat expected turns of events. The editing was solid and timing of the events - in spite of being easily foreseeable - was certainly in line with the flow. The Script was above average; there were a few forced metaphors though. But, all in all, it was well structured production with a fluent flow of events and it achieves what it wants to convey in an orderly fashion.However, real achievement within this movie, is how the acting of Ryan Gosling outshines through all the other great actors like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti and even George Clooney. Even though Ryan Gosling is certainly accepted as a great actor now, it is clear that he is destined for much more than what he has already achieved.</fullReview>

Nobody was actually likable to me in the movie except for Clooney, he's been around long enough to be able to pull something reasonable out of it. He was the only one that seemed legit to me, the only character that had some degree of stucture and humanity. Ryan Gosling played his part like he just descended from "Fracture", he did exactly the same type of character. Booooring !!!!

There is no deep meaning in this movie, it was just boring. The characters lacked depth, the story was full of holes, and just about everything remains unresolved at the end. Terrible.The only redeeming quality of this film, and simply the reason I gave it 2 stars was the acting was very good. However, no amount of great acting will save an otherwise flat and boring story that fails to instill any excitement in the audience.

There are at least 5 better presidential candidate movies out there shot long before "Ides of March". Forget this one, watch "Damages" or "The Wire" and get a bigger thrill and 10 times more insight into the human psyche. Of course we already know that wanna be candidates give up all their principles for power, no new revelations for the audience here. ANd the "Governor's" speeches were pretty lame too.

		<shortDescription>Hollywood and politics don't mix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no secret that celebrity endorsement has begun to take an increasingly important role in the US electoral process and the drawbacks of this are pretty evident. Not only does it risk reducing the proceedings to a mere popularity contest, but the passionate celebrity backing given to Barack Obama in the last 2008 election promoted a very narrow idea of what constitutes political change.Obama's campaign was spoilt for choice in terms of support from the cream of acting and musical talent, with everyone from West Wing star Martin Sheen to rapper Jay-Z publicly voicing their support for the Democratic candidate. However, the way in which this host of liberal celebs joined arms to scream 'Yes We Can' seemed to suggest that political upheaval could be achieved by merely shirking one mainstream party in favour of another.Following the election, interviews with Obama's celebrity fan-boys perpetuated a false feeling that the country had arrived at some hallowed place in which the pressing issues of welfare, race relations and foreign intervention would simply fall away now that the fabled one was in office. Furthermore, even the reaction of conservative celebrities to Obama's election maintained the idea that, with one election, the world had irrevocably changed. Right-wing media figures like Donald Trump and Bill O'Reilly presented Obama as a veritable threat to Americana, speculating about the details of his birth certificate and his possible socialist affiliations. Of course, both sides failed to recognise that this was, after all, just another election of yet another president.Bearing all this in mind, it would be fair to assume that The Ides of March would be an unenlightening and self-congratulatory piece of liberal Hollywood propaganda. Not only is it produced by, directed by and starring George Clooney ? a strident supporter and personal friend of Obama ? but the film centres on the presidential campaign of a squeaky-clean and 'socially progressive' Democratic candidate.For much of the film's opening half this appears to be the case. We are introduced to hunky spin-doctor Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) who insists that he only plays dirty if he believes in the cause. The cause he believes in is Mike Morris (George Clooney), an atheist Democrat, who wants to tax the rich and make petroleum a controlled substance. In short, he is a liberal wet dream.On the eve of the Ohio primaries, Meyers is approached by Morris' opponent and asked to switch sides. Yet just as you think this will be a tiresome competition for Stephen's soul and allegiance, The Ides of March does something rather refreshing. It demonstrates an often overlooked fact in Hollywood: Democrats can be bad people, too.Having rejected the opportunity to defect, Meyers stumbles across one of Morris' dirty secrets, leading him to question if there is indeed anyone in politics who is truly incorruptible. From here on out, the film challenges the idea that underhandedness is the sole realm of conservatives and that beneath superficial differences, politicians are rather alike. However, as welcome a turnaround as this is, it remains a pretty unoriginal moral on which to anchor an entire story and there is unfortunately very little else here to sustain viewers' interest.Clooney takes a discernibly sober approach to the political thriller, and whilst this is somewhat commendable, the complete lack of any original insight leaves one yearning for the excessive twists and turns that the genre usually entails. Furthermore, whilst Clooney and Gosling are predictably competent and Paul Giamatti is fantastic as Machiavellian campaign manager Tom Duffy, the cast nevertheless struggle to keep the film afloat.Obama's campaign, and the celebrity endorsements which surrounded it, put a lot of emphasis on symbolism. He was not your average Democratic candidate appealing to the nation on the basis of a particular policy platform. No, he was above all else the embodiment of an idea. He represented a zenith of tolerance and progression and, in just being elected, he had already changed the world forever. The fact that the 2008 election produced the first African-American president is no trivial matter, but the suggestion that the very idea of Obama held some sort of metaphysical power only inspired a lot of false hope, which Obama, the man, would never be able to live up to.While The Ides of March should be applauded for unpicking this sort of liberal complacency, there's no escaping how sophomoric this political fable really is. As ever, it seems Hollywood and politics just don't mix.</fullReview>

(You also wonder if the plot isn't simply a platform for Clooney's political beliefs...)George Clooney's direction is solid. Movie moves along quite effortlessly and doesn't drift. Pacing is consistent.Good performances from an all-star cast: Ryan Gosling, George Clooney, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Evan Rachel Wood, Marisa Tomei.

		<fullReview>The Ides of March is refreshing since it doesn't shy away from revealing people's true selves despite their insecurities and flaws. The movie showcases people as people, in their glory and sorrow, and it conjures up an interesting twist on the drama that is politics. The casting is strong with leads Ryan Gosling and George Clooney who fall right into their characters?although I can't say the film was particularly moving. The plot is also fairly bland, except for a few scenes, and follows a scandal and the members surrounding a potential Presidential candidate. Despite having great actors/actresses, this movie simply fails to impress on any specific emotional or entertainment level. It meanders a few contentious topics and has surprising moments but ultimately left me untouched after 101 minutes. Nonetheless, the film is worth the watch. An arguably important concept in our lives is the state and its affairs, and a look at its underpinnings is worthwhile. Hopefully you can take away more from it than I did.</fullReview>

Both men act their sock off here, as does Seymour Hoffman, in this gripping but depressing tale of an idealist corrupted by his surroundings. That the idealist becomes what he hates in order to achieve his ideals is a damning condemnation of the world of politics, and will probably provoke American viewers with its implications about the American political system.Some very memorable moments for me - the last shot; close up on Ryan's face and the conflict he feels - brilliantly played. Also the silent shot of a car as we wait for a conversation we can't hear to end, and Seymour Hoffman's face (and posture) when he gets out of the car. Risky directing choices that most definitely paid off. Overall, some seriously good actors do a cerebral story justice. An hour and a half well spent in my view. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney's The Ides of March is actually a really good political drama that will keep moviegoers on their toes. Usually, I don't watch political-driven movies, but I was attracted to the film by the all-star cast and the director, Clooney himself. This turns out to be a really good movie because the cast delivers, a very good screenplay, and subtle direction. By the end, I did not mind any of the political mess for one second.It is kind of hard to explain the plot of the film because sometimes I just don't understand the mumble jumble of politics. But it's pretty much about a junior campaign manager, Stephen Meyers who works Mike Morris, the Democratic candidate in the presidential elections. Basically, all there is in the film is dirty politics and back-stabbing people which makes the film quite interesting.The cast delivers up to their namesake which is always good. Ryan Gosling has a nice career ahead of him if he continues making films like this. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a very strong performance as always. Paul Giamatti as a sleazebag is always good to see. Of course, Clooney is spot on.Overall, this is a a political drama well worth watching. It may not be the best but it's tense and riveting. Even though there is not much violence, this movie made me feel as if I was watching a crime thriller. It had that vibe even though it's not a crime thriller per se. If you like politics, you would probably understand this film more than I did. I still really liked it though. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

However, the way the movie played it out, it was simply a disgruntled employee blackmailing his former employer. That's it!The idealistic person got tricked by his opponent, which caused him to get fired. In retaliation, he blackmailed his former employer using information he inadvertently received to get the top job.That's it! The only politics in the movie is there just to provide flavoring.

		<fullReview>After watching the trailer I distinctly remember thinking: wow, this could be one of the best political thrillers of the decade. Good cast, intelligent plot and a whole lot of sudden turns of events. However, as I sat in the cramped cinema I started to realize how wrong I was at that time. First of all, the movie seems to go on forever, because of all the unnecessary longueurs during the 100 minutes of 'action'. Second of all, I would hardly imagine the presented presidential campaign to be a real one. In fact, many of the mistakes made during the projection could have been easily held off with a little help of broader imagination. Third of all, as charismatic as Gosling can sometimes be, I did not believe that he gave this performance all that he could. It seemed that Stephen Meyers was a bleak and indistinct persona, even though he was the main protagonist of the show.I don't want to say that this movie is all bad - the second part is almost captivating, due to more enjoyable action and desperate attempts of the candidates at outmatching one another. The general idea of Ryan Gosling character's changes of mind and abrupt decisions threatening the further career of Clooney's character is also understandable. The cheating and the lying and many of the scams and frauds that occur in the movie can surely account as a part of the dirty political world, which to us regular citizens will never be truly revealed. Yet, even though the film has some memorable moments and quotes (my favorite: You can lie, you can cheat, you can start a war, you can bankrupt the country, but you can't f*** the interns. They get you for that.), in the end it came out as another mere attempt at bringing back the 90's and the many great thrillers produced in those days.All in all, because of the general level of movies shown in 2011 i give it 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another solid directorial effort from George Clooney, much like the unjustly underrated "Good Luck And Good Night", "The Ides Of March" is very much and old fashioned political thriller in the vein of "The President's Men", "The Candidate" and even more recent fare like "Wag The Dog", "Primary Colours" and "The Contender".A great cast comprising of Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Evan Rachel Wood, Marisa Tomei, Ryan Gosling and Clooney himself, shine in a well crafted and well directed movie.A story of politics, the people in politics, and their environment. This is a cautionary tale of the thin line which exists in politics, between morality and hypocrisy, integrity and self-interest, and everything in between.The film imparts its lessons without beating people over the head or being too preachy. I liked the subtle manner in which the story unfolds and how the characters behave given the situations they face.Politics require people with a certain flexible moral quality, yet the deeper one descends into the games of power and manipulation that flexible morality can vanish quite quickly and give rise to whatever was there in the first place in the individual or individuals involved. Though loyalty and integrity seem to be highly priced qualities, given the need to attain and maintain power, hypocrisy is never late in rearing is ugly head and taking charge of the situation.If you are up for a morality tale dressed up as a political fable, then "The Ides Of March" is definitely one for you. Movies like these don't get made too often, and when they do oftentimes their scope or focus is quite narrow and limited. Not so here, Clooney has an affinity for these slightly out of focus stories, which though seemingly stuck on a particular angle, nonetheless manages to impart lessons which could be applied in many aspects of life.Given the state of politics, not only in the US, but worldwide, this movie should figure way more prominently than it has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment, stay away!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit that I had great expectations. Instead, I watched a film that could not impress me, even though it has some good elements. Photography is excellent (I still remember the small conversation between Paul and Stephen behind the huge American flag). Direction is not special but does not push you away and does make you want to stay until the end. The very good performance of Mr. Hoffman is the peak of the film. The performances of Ryan Gosling and George Clooney are shameful... Mr. Gosling manages to make the audience hate his role character rather than find him nice. He cannot express the role, his coldness is unbelievably not suitable for it. Mr. Clooney's performance is actually not a performance: he only can play one role, and he does play it every time at any movie carrying his name. But still, he cannot be considered as a capable actor.Furthermore, the plot is not a big surprise. At the beginning you are attracted to the idea that a big scandal is covered and everything is gonna explode. But it is just...a Monica Lewinski-like story: another sex scandal. OK, it is not right for a man to treat women like that but...almost everyone has non-marital relationships. Big deal. Do Americans expect that their politicians is God or something?? I do not think so. In conclusion: If you want to watch a hard political thriller, stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a too familiar story, told not always too effective or interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thing that always surprises me is how George Clooney still seems to able and finds the time to write these type of complicated scripts and directs these difficult sort of movies. He always comes across as a totally different person and one that seems far more busy with other things (young beautiful women mostly). Movies like this always makes me respect him more and more, even though this definitely is not his best work.Really the biggest problem I had with this movie was that it wasn't doing or telling you anything new. It's a political movie about the dirty side of a presidential campaign, which involves lots of backstabbing, lying, false promises and things like that. But really, is this anything new to people? In that regard this movie does feel a bit like a redundant one, at what it is doing and trying to say.It could had all still worked out well and effective if the movie was a bit of a more involving and surprising one. But the movie really doesn't always succeeds at intriguing you by doing or telling you anything new or all that interesting. It's really a movie that could had gone a step further with its premise and could had become a bit of a more dirty one to watch but the movie however never really does so. You could definitely say this movie is lacking some depth and bite at times.But really, this still remains a good watch. Of course especially when you are into political movies, this still remains one fine movie to watch because of its story and actors involved.And the movie does truly has an all-star cast in it. Clooney himself really isn't all that much in this movie, despite the fact that he is still getting prominently featured on all of the posters and such. It's just because his name sells of course but it truly is Ryan Gosling who plays the one and only true big role of this movie. Everybody else is a secondary one really and has a limited amount of screen time in this. This goes for fine actors such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Evan Rachel Wood, Marisa Tomei and Jeffrey Wright, who all still manage to impress with their roles.And despite everything, this also still remains a well made movie. It's technically well directed and the sort of movie that lets its actors do most of the work and tell most of the movie its story. It perhaps is a bit of a movie that disappoints but it really never becomes a terrible one, in any sort of way. It really is not a punishment to watch this movie, also because it's a quite short one and therefore never starts to drag or become a boring one.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense thriller without the usual baggage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a thriller category movie without a car chase, guns, bombs, plots to destroy the world. Difficult isn't it? and yet that is what we have in The Ides of March a thriller that is tight, intelligent and rewarding. It exceeded my expectations even though my experience with George Clooney films has given me high expectations.The plot twists and turns like a New Zealand country road. Just when you think you know what is to happen, something else happens and yet all of the twists ring true. Some are red herrings. We suspect people of having agendas when they do not, we discover agendas where none were suspected.In the end we are totally blown away, but even that makes perfect sense.The writing is superb but the cast totally delivers without a false note.Just watch, and experience. You will not see politics as usual again.In a word, Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Clooney Guides Us Through the Slime of Political Campaigns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The timing for the release of this film could hardly be more appropriate. It seems our level of tolerance for the constant bickering and mudslinging, and poison secrets, and empty rhetoric from the current political campaign is usurping our media blitz from caucuses to talk shows, to interviews, to newspapers, to blogging, to television and radio overkill. The degree of credibility of whether what we are slammed with daily is addressed well in this polished film based on the play 'Farragut North' by Beau Willimon who also adapted his play for the screen with the aid of Grant Heslov and director George Clooney. It is a tight script, a keenly photographed (many dark and tight closeups of the characters as they show their true selves) and observed tale of corruption that helps us all understand more of why our political campaigns are hard to believe and tolerate.Stephen Meters (Ryan Gosling in a brilliant performance) is an idealistic staff member of Governor Mike morris (George Clooney) in his race for the Ohio primary against Senator Pullman (Michael Mantell). Steve believes in Morris' idealism and is free of corruption until he comes under the spell of the campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman, also superb), The campaign is close and much depends on the support of Senator Thompson (Jeffrey Wright) who owns over 300 delegates and is holding out his support for payola as a promised Secretary of State position. Thompson's campaign manager is the smart and smarmy Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti) who is not beyond the darkest moves to manage his candidate's victory. Both camps are hounded by the press in the form of Ida (Marisa Tomei). One of Morris' interns - Molly (Evan Rachel Wood), who happens to be the daughter of the powerful DNC chairman jack Stearns (Gregory Itzin) - is beautiful and smart and seductive and wins the attention of the idealistic Steve, a liaison that eventually leads to the uncovering of some very dark secrets that alter Steve's idealism, making him just as cynical and dirty as those around him.Yes, political thrillers such as this have been done before, but this one manages to address the issues of idealism versus greedy two-faced cheating and corruption better than the others. Much of this is due to Clooney's excellent direction but the success of the film is also due to the line of exceptional performances by Gosling, Clooney, Hoffman, Giamatti, Wright and Wood. There are small supporting roles by Jennifer Ehle and Max Minghella that enhance the overall drama. It may be too frank for many viewers, but it is a microscopic view of the process through which we move to elect the President of this country - and that process is flawed and difficult to observe as it is defined here. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp</fullReview>

It's great when you see such potential in a commercial movie.The reference to Ides of March, the monumental date marked in history as the murder of Julius Caesar by a group of conspirators, is made by showing the election campaign of Governor of Pennsylvania, Mike Morris played by George Clooney.Gosling plays the part of his Junior Campaign Manager Stephen Meyers who is working under Senior Campaign Manager Paul Zara (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). The plot unfolds in a very suave manner and you will be on the edge of your seat from start to finish until you run into a completely unbelievable ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what you think it is, or might be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the "noise" generated by the film, you'd think it was one of 'those' hard-hitting political thrillers of old, where the hard-dealing twists and turns come hard, fast and thick! Far from it.The plot, or should I say story, (as I'll explain) starts in the usual way slow way, where-upon you expect, sooner or later, for it to start the rumblings of taking off, which it never really quite does! So, almost an hour in, I really lose most of my interest and almost stop watching, but since one has seen blurbs proclaiming 'Oscars all round' for the cast I continued watching. What you then find yourself watching,(or in my case, continuing to watch) are the characters going about the political campaign business, with some dreadfully) minor elements thrown in. So really, no major plot!This really, when all is said and done, is little more than a soup-warmer of a political thriller, and may as well have been done as a TV movie! Don't get me wrong! It's all well acted, but, especially for me, just didn't turn over, and at the end of the day (movies end) I was left with the feeling of, So What?!In essence, it's Not Bad..., good (definitely lower 'g'), but nowhere near Great!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-acted but not exactly new . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney's The Ides of March is a well-made, beautifully acted and very entertaining political drama that presents cold, heartbreaking facts about the American political campaign that probably seemed new in about 1960. Is it surprising anymore after the Monica Lewinsky scandal that a political candidate would sleep with his interns? Is is surprising anymore that a candidate would be two-faced, saying one thing on-camera and something else off-camera? It is surprising anymore that those working on the campaign would be willing to bury their colleagues to get ahead? Is it surprising that the outcome of our elections are so carefully choreographed and telegraphed that the votes cast by the electorate are more or less an afterthought? Don't get me wrong, this doesn't make The Ides of March a bad movie, it just doesn't make it a surprising one. The strength of the movie doesn't lie in the story it tells but in the actors who tell it.Based on the 2008 play "Farragut North" by Beau Willimon - which was loosely based on the 2004 Presidential campaign of Vermont Governor Howard Dean -The Ides of March centers on Steven Meyers (Ryan Gosling) 30 year-old press secretary for Democratic Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney), a idealistic Democrat who is gearing up to win the Ohio primary in a bid to win the Presidency. Steven believes in Morris who is a crafty politician, good-looking, charming, intelligent and confidently making the promise to his voters that there will be no combustible engines on the road in ten years. Uh-huh.I don't recall a candidate who speaks as well or looks as quietly confident as Mike Morris, I guess I would have to go back to Kennedy. At any rate, Steven believes in the Governor. He too is an idealist. We can see that he is old enough to know better but there is a feeling that he still wants to believe in his candidate. Around him are cynics most especially Morris' campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour-Hoffman), a hard-nosed realist who has been working on politics so long that he seems to have developed ice-water in his veins. Meyer hates Zara partly because of his ethics and partly because he can see the reality of this political life that will soon envelope him as well. Also on hand is a crafty journalist named Ida (Marisa Tomei) who gathers information from Steven and seems like a friend but when the chips are down reveals herself to be looking out for number one.Meyer finds solace from the cynicism in the person of a 20 year-old, naive young intern named Molly (Evan Rachel-Wood) who is smart and open-minded and finds herself jumping into Steven's bed. This relationship doesn't fall into romance but a kinship that collapses under the revelation of her past involvement with the Governor. This revelation sets the drama in motion and the second-half of The Ides of March deals mostly with the breakdown of Steven's soul into the revelation of those who are trying to destroy him for their own personal interest. Even though we can mostly guess where the movie is going, it is interesting watching the personal and professional chess match as Steven uncovers a web of personal vendettas and merciless backstabbing.The story is well-told but it is the acting that makes the movie work. Ryan Gosling proves again and again that he is one of the best actors of his generation. He has a quiet confidence, but also a face that sometimes brims with uncertainty. He expresses a lot just by sitting still and thinking. In that way, he reminds me a little of Paul Newman. Evan Rachel-Wood is good too as a young woman who is too young and too naive to be playing in the big leagues just yet. Paul Giamatti, one of my favorite modern actors, has a wonderful role as the campaign manager for the other side. He has a great scene toward the end of the film when he reveals his true nature that is played to perfection.The problem is that the story isn't exactly surprising. As I said, the inside scoop on what goes on behind-the-scenes in American politics is well-know and has been told before in much more focused pictures like Mike Nichols great Primary Colors. That film dealt with the machinations within the campaigns just as the Ides of March does, but the earlier film does it in a fresh way. This one seems more like a thriller. Even with the limitations aside, I was glad I saw The Ides of March. George Clooney has now directed four films and what I can see is that he has confidence in his material. Here he makes a small film, very spare that lets the actors do all the work, and that's just right because they are the ones who make it work. I just wish he could have found a way to make it more contemporary and tell us something that we don't already know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is "cynical political drama" redundant?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although playing a supporting role, famously liberal actor George Clooney, is otherwise right in his element in a movie that rails against politics rather than political affiliation. The film reveals its origins as a stage play by being long on intricate dialog and short on action. Michael Bay fans are advised to spend "Ides" hour and 41 minute running time instead continuing to eager await this summer's movie version of the children's game "Battleship". Fans of "In the Loop", "Wag the Dog", "Primary Colors" and maybe "War, Inc." will better appreciate the points the movie makes about idealism being crushed by pragmatic realpolitik. Others will point out that the dirty political maneuvers made by the characters hardly break new ground and if you have seen similar films or have been paying attention to this year's Republican Presidential candidate race not a lot new is learned here. However, even those cynical about cynicism in films should see the thing just for the cast which is the best you'll find since "The Men Who Stare at Goats". Seymour Hoffman, Giamatti, Clooney, Tomei and even pretty boy Gosling all put in good performances although the aggregate starpower does tend to cancel out any one performance. To a degree, such a powerful cast is not quite necessary given that there is a dearth of emoting that needs to be done given the cerebral material. If the movie is a little too stoic and talky, the pacing is also a little too brisk as one plot complication arises and is quickly addressed - some Hitchcockian suspense would not have gone amiss. In short, a taut cynical political drama that will appeal a lot to a narrow audience and somewhat to a broad audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting is great, as one would expect from Clooney and Gosling. I don't think I have much to say about acting.However the story is a little bit dull. I was looking for more action. I mean it did start as if it was going to be a capturing tale, but somehow after Stephen learned the truth about the intern, the story became really dull and slow-paced. I felt like the resolution was too fast, the story dissolved very quickly at the end. I was also expecting more from the climax - there was something missing there. Ultimately, I am not satisfied. I have not read the original play, so I don't know how the adaptation is but I can't help saying that the story feels unfinished. I had very high expectations before seeing the movie for some reason, so I was quite disappointed.</fullReview>

I watched this last night on DVD; and think GOD I didn't see it at the theater or I would ask for my money back. Usually I believe political drama's make good movies, but this had no plot, the ending was STUPID, and I expected more from George Clooney. In the beginning of the movie it started very slow. I thought after 15 minutes it would pick up; and begin to have more of a storyline, I was so wrong. It was so boring my mom took a nap lucky her. I continued to watch this wreck; and around 55 minutes into the story , the viewer gets some action. We get to experience what person Gov. Morris is; and what he did while trying to win the Presidentacy. We get 15 to 20 minutes of excitement and then the movie flat-lines again for good. It's been awhile since I saw a movie this poor; the only plus about it was it was filmed in Ohio, my home state.For anyone who likes political movies try Absolute Power, In The Line of Fire, The American President, or JFK to name a few. These are good movies; and you will not be wasting one hour and forty-one minutes on pure trash. Kris L. CocKayne :)</fullReview>

Unbelievably talented cast - Clooney, Giamatti, Tomei and even the great character actor Greg Itzin. The most thrilling of which to watch on screen was the never-disappointing Phillip Seymore Hoffman. I spent a buck-thirty on my rental, and I kind of want my buck back. The story is about a very left-wing Democrat, running against another Democrat for President. His true-believer campaign speech writer is offered a position with the competitor's campaign. These leads to an unfortunate series of events which makes him seek revenge. The revenge plot doesn't really start up until 3/4 of the way through the movie. Too slow and vague for my tastes. Found my mind wandering. Wanting to get up and do other stuff. Ryan Gosling unfortunately could not hold my attention. I very much hope other people enjoyed this movie, but I just couldn't stay interested. Although I did stick with it until the uneventful ending.</fullReview>

Even though the events depicted in the film are not surprising, it is still disturbing facts to revisit.The performances of "The Ides of March" are captivating, particularly by George Clooney and Ryan Gosling.

		<fullReview>The only thing worse than watching actor George Clooney's formulaic political corruption expose "The Ides of March" (** OUT OF ****) is realizing that this kind of skulduggery occurs with such regularity that a film about it seems superfluous. A top-notch cast, polished production values, and cynical storytelling cannot compensate for this pedestrian thriller. "Good Night, and Good Luck" scenarist Grant Heslov and Clooney have adapted Beau Willimon's 2008 stage play "Farragut North" with Willimon's assistance. "Farragut North" drew on Governor Howard Dean's 2004 Democratic primary campaign. Although the "Oceans Eleven" star has cast himself as liberal Mike Morris, the governor of Pennsylvania, Clooney spends more time on the periphery rather than the limelight. Instead, Ryan Gosling emerges as the troubled protagonist, and Clooney--as director--presents everything from Gosling's perspective.As "The Ides of March" unfolds, Governor Morris is encountering stiff competition in the Ohio primary from his chief rival, Arkansas Senator Pullman (Michael Mantell of "Secretary"), for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Morris keeps his staff scrambling as the two candidates struggle to persuade another politician, Senator Thompson (Jeffrey Wright of "Casino Royale") to endorse their campaigns. It seems that Thompson wields the kind of clout that will help the right candidate clinch the nomination. Thompson's asking price is a cabinet seat as Secretary of State, a position that he is wholly unqualified to fill. However, Morris is reluctant to cave into Thompson's demands. Miraculously, Governor Morris maintains a slight edge over his adversary because he has hired the best and brightest. Veteran campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman of "Doubt") and up-and-coming Junior Campaign Manager Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling of "Drive") plot Morris' campaign strategy. Together, Zara and Meyers constitute a formidable team. Meanwhile, Senator Pullman's wily campaign consultant, Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti of "Shoot'em Up"), summons the idealistic Meyers to a clandestine rendezvous at a remote bar. Duffy makes Meyers a proposition. Incredibly, Duffy wants Meyers to defect from Morris' campaign so he can join Pullman's campaign. Suffering a crisis of conscience, Meyers tries to contact Zara, but he cannot reach his boss.Before he knows what has happened, Meyers finds himself booted off Morris' campaign and unable to join Duffy as a part of Pullman's staff. The revelation is that Meyers' own paranoid boss has leaked information about Meyers' secret meeting with Duffy to a savvy New York Times newspaperwoman Ida Horowicz (Marisa Tomei of "The Lincoln Lawyer") who wants a scoop on the deal that Morris' people are brokering with Thompson. During the campaign, Meyer has gone to bed with an inexperienced but seductive 20-year old intern, Molly Stearns (drop-dead-gorgeous Evan Rachel Wood of "The Conspirator") and then discovers by accident that Molly had an affair with Morris. Moreover, Molly has gotten herself pregnant so the close-mouthed but sympathetic Meyers arranges an abortion. The catch here is that Molly's father is Jack Stearns (Gregory Itzin of "Law Abiding Citizen") and he chairs the Democratic National Committee. Molly fears that Meyers will use his information to get himself reinstated on the Morris campaign, so she commits suicide. Cleverly, she makes her death look like an error in combining prescription medicine with alcohol. After Duffy refuses to hire Meyers, our hero is desperate to do whatever it takes to salvage his career, so blackmails Morris into putting him back on the campaign."The Ides of March" concerns the dirty deals that take place on the campaign trail. Unfortunately, despite their intelligent screenplay, Clooney and company have produced a film that tells us nothing than we don't already know about politicking. Of course, the first casualty of any political campaign is honesty. The next question is do the ends justify the means. It doesn't matter what you do if you want to win. The only redeeming thing about "The Ides of March" is that it shuns over-the-top CGI action sequences and unrealistic predicaments. Everybody here looks like flesh and blood creations, but few of them are sympathetic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ides of March starring Ryan Gosling and George Clooney. Though many of the trailers have been quite misleading once watching the film. This is Ryan Gosling's film (as the clear lead), he is enthralling as the PR man who, despite his shrewdness, is blinded by the boss's charm. Through the film, soon enough, the bombshell drops and it's lead actress (Evan Rachel Wood). Trouble is, she just happens to be the girl who Gosling has been getting cozy with. The pace quickens as he weighs up his loyalties to the governor and the girl, as well as getting pushed and pulled between rival campaign managers (Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman). The acting is heavyweight, as are the moral questions about the personal cost of serving the greater good, which propel the story with an unstoppable force. The film works due to several twists and turns throughout and there is great suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, this movie is good, and a one time watch, but it has a weird leftover taste to it, which doesn't settle. There just is something that with this movie that doesn't make one give it more than 3 stars. It's kind of a like-it but not-a-fan or not-too-interesting relationship going in the mind of the user after the movie.So I'm going to review this movie starting with what went good. The acting by all the lead actors is of course good, and that's not something one can bring this movie down really. With a strong A-list cast, it was bound to have some good performances. And Gosling, Clooney, Hoffman make sure you are not disappointed in that regard. Clooney even did a good job directing, and one can't feel that he really could have directed this. Clooney comes of looking good as and realistic and a presidential candidate and Gosling looks very convincing as the very idealistic Campaign Manager who slowly faces the "et Tu, brute" situation and realizing that not everything is as good as it looks, is forced to change himself. So, overall, there are some good performances in this movie.The cinematography, style of shooting, visual effects, and the catchy soundtrack add to creating that thrilling police air for the movie, which again make it gripping and interesting to watch. It keeps the viewer hooked that something interesting is going to happen soon.But alas, that's where the movie fails. Suddenly you realize the movie's over and that was it. Nothing that "big" happened. The Big groundbreaking scandal you were expecting, is not a love affair of a candidate with the intern. Maybe in the old times, but the current times when you have Trump running, with even wilder stuff for presidential candidates coming and going, where you hear political senators from the US engaging in all kinds of weird sexual acts and other scandalous items, this seems very small. There's that all this for that much? Question left when you are finished watching. You realize the some good acting was just wasted there on something that could have turned out to be really good.It's not the script, the movie has good dialogues and and quotes and the talks seem real. It's the overall story that has the fault. It's not as gripping and as much of polecat thriller as it wanted (or was trying) to be.The reason for Gosling to switch from the good to the "take-revenge" mode just didn't seem that strong enough. It wasn't presented well. There's so much that he could have done to prevent but no, it was just a mess with many loopholes. The movie starts of being very realistic, but when it mixes too much emotion all of a sudden, the reality the movie was going for, suddenly becomes less and brings the whole movie down. Overall, the story is pretty straightforward, and the message that the movie is trying to convey is quite simple, and thus puts a lot of pressure on the lead of the movie (gosling) to make it engaging or thrilling, but unfortunately, the character played by him isn't able to deliver that meat of the story required. The story lacks character development. It lacks the heart and soul it required from its protagonist and antagonist which could have made it a fierce completion and an edge of the seat thriller. The competition/fight/race to outshine each other between Clooney and Gosling's character just doesn't seem something actually worth getting into a rivalry for and doesn't seem to reach the intense heights it could have.And it's definitely not intellectual. It's not a smart movie. It doesn't make you think anything towards the end. It doesn't make the users feel connected to the characters. I couldn't feel myself in anyone's shows in the entire movie. Not a single character that could connect with he audience. You don't seem to learn anything new out of all that drama. Just the same old, same old.Overall, its not a bad movie, pretty enjoyable for a one time watch, but cannot make it to anyone's list of all-time favorites. It's not dull, but also not as sharp and exciting as it could have been. It's polished and refined, but the message isn't really clear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delivers a good message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie shows that at the end you have to do what you have to do to save yourself. You might have the best interest in heart but when others around you play you then it's time to start thinking about yourself. While I think this message is transmitted clearly enough through the story line of the movie, the story moves forward quite slowly for my taste. There are a lot of scenes where the dialogue between characters is mundane. With regards to acting, I am not impressed by Ryan Gosling. He comes across as cold and fails to transmit emotions in situations when for example he feels betrayed and played. George Clooney does a great job in impersonating presidential speeches but beyond that he delivered a mediocre performance as well. Overall, I find the movie to be a bit unrealistic and overly simplified in terms of how the character of Stephen Meyers achieved his revenge. When I feel that I have wasted almost two hours when a movie ends, then I know that I didn't like the movie very much and that was the case with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Politics is a place where ideals go to die. That's the underlying message of this realistic, well-acted, occasionally involving film.Ohio's Democratic primary is only days away, and Pennsylvania Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney) has a sizable but insecure lead over his one remaining challenger. An alliance with a former candidate with 356 pledged delegates can put Morris over the top, but at a steep price. As campaign aides scramble to make the best of the situation, Morris's deputy campaign manager, Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) discovers Morris carries a secret no primary can overcome.Clooney directed and co-wrote the film, adapted from a play which presents the Machiavellian situation in the form of a personal journey similar to what Michael Corleone experienced in "The Godfather." Will he do what it takes to clear the field, or will he be left in the dust?"This is the big leagues," Meyers tells someone in the movie, though he could as easily be talking to himself. "It's mean. When you make a mistake, you lose the right to play."The challenge "Ides Of March" sets up is not in laying out the tawdry realities of campaign politics, which anyone with eyes can see on the news. It's making you care. In that way, it's not successful. The characters all talk in caffeine-charged soundbites, winning you over with their charisma but lacking depth. Clooney in his DVD commentary talks a lot about losing one's soul, and you see what he means, but you wonder whether anyone here has a soul to lose.While Meyers' journey is a dark one, we never quite see him as much of a prize. One of the first orders we hear him give deals with a scurrilous rumor about Morris' rival having a financial stake in a Liberian diamond mine. "I don't care if it's true, I just want to hear him deny it," Meyers says. "Win, win."So when Meyers finds himself the rumormongers' victim, you don't care as much as you might, even with Gosling giving a finely-shaded performance. He's too much of a Machiavel already.What gives this film its lasting power is not the message but the supporting performances. Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman crush every scene they are in with smart readings of clever dialogue without the slightest flavor of ham between them. Even better is Evan Rachel Wood as a young intern, "a little girl trying to make it in a grown up world," who discovers herself a helpless pawn in the game. She could too easily play the part of a mere sacrificial lamb, as that's what she's given. Instead she finds the grit to deliver real empathy in a film sorely in need of it.I find Clooney a fine director here stuck with one weak acting performance, ironically enough his own. Morris is supposed to be a smoothie, but his handling of trickier territory, and his attempts at playing dark in dealing with them, ring hollow. When Clooney focuses his camera on the other actors, which he often does, the results are so solid you wish he followed those selfless instincts more closely."Ides Of March" is a well-played film with a played-out message. I had no problem admiring its craft, but I felt disengaged throughout, caring less about the story than the acting clinic unfolding before me. In that sense, it delivers enough positives to make it worthwhile. Just don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dishonour of politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are on the full campaign in Ohio for the primary nomination for the presidential election in USA. This movie shows us with remarkable realism what goes on in the backstage of the campaign of the Democratic Party in case like it could happen with any other party. The difference between the principles and values publicly proclaimed and what is done behind is enormous. Even an apparently honest candidate is caught in an intrigue plot provoked by a sexual slip blunder of his own that makes him to put aside those good principles and values he has always defended and yield to a blackmail by a collaborator he had fired for supposed treason and now wants to be hired back. Curiously this collaborator begins to be presented as idealistic and supporter of those good values and principles however not to be followed tactically in the campaign as we see. Looks like that the ends justify the means although that same idealist had already been victim of a dirty trick by another member of the candidate staff. All intervenient performers do excellent roles and the story is full of authenticity and well and convincingly shown. Politics is dirty and dishonourable indeed in most cases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney plays a governor who is running for President. He is one of two serious candidates for the Democratic nomination. He is a bit too good to be true. He is adamant about the standard liberal issues and won't back down on them. Ryan Gosling plays his number two man along with campaign manager Philip Seymour Hoffman. One day Gosling makes a serious error. He goes to see the campaign manager of the other candidate. This is an absolute no no. His head is on the block. During this time he has a quick tryst with the daughter of the Democratic National Committee. She gives him a bit of information that could throw things into the septic system. Meanwhile, he is fired. Wanting his job back, he acts. This is really dirty politics and probably the kind of thing that is done behind the scenes all the time. Not a great political drama, but still very engaging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ides of March (2011): Dir: George Clooney / Cast: Ryan Gosling, George Clooney, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Marisa Tomei: George Clooney is an impressive director whose films often centre around males struggling with inner deception. Here Ryan Gosling plays a campaign liar whose candidate Clooney is Governor Morris. Gosling prides himself in his ability to render his subject as positive despite any media interference, but one mistake has him talking to the campaign manager of the opponent, which has him spotlighted as a liability and fired. Upon seducing an intern he comes to learn more than intended when her phone rings in the dead of night. Clooney allows his actors to shine but he is also very good as the Governor whose closet has skeletons. Two excellent supporting roles come from Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti who play opposing campaign managers. Hoffman is all about loyalty and Gosling wants his job. Giamatti is slick and knew how to play Gosling by getting him eliminated. As he stated, either way, he wins. Marisa Tomei has a nifty little role as a New York Times reporter out to get the details. Clooney has directed provocative films before such as Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and Good Night and Good Luck. He addresses material where a loner is involved yet isolated mentally from everyone. The final shot is a closeup of Gosling's face, which can render two things, which viewers are more or less given their vote. It is an individual of dangerous devices and an agenda that will play out one way or another. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Et tu Brute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the award-winning "House Of Cards" TV series starring Kevin Spacey as the stop-at-nothing U.S. politician determined to get into the White House and so wasn't surprised to see that programme's main writer and show-runner Beau Willimon credited as one of the writers here. George Clooney stars, produces, co-writes and directs too but yet this behind-the-scenes look behind-the-scenes of the sometimes ruthless campaigning which gives on in the race for the White House had more the imprimatur of Willimon id venture to say.Which means you can expect a twisting, turning narrative, taking in the usual mix of sex, lies, morals, ambition and in particular power-games as we follow the journey of leading Democratic candidate co-campaign manager Ryan Gosling striving to get his hero, Clooney into power. To do so he has to turn a losing position in the key Ohio primary to a winning one. Along the way, as ever, innocents get hurt, victory is clawed from the jaws of defeat and in the end consciences are wiped clean all the time nothing really changes in the way the country is governed.Gosling and not Clooney is the epicentre of the film. He starts off as an idealistic and enthusiastic spin doctor for his man Clooney but comes to learn that na?vet is weakness and that to survive in the bear-pit of Washington good guys finish last. Even if some of the main events and indeed the ending were predictable, the film entertains with its realism, sharp dialogue and recognisable read-across to the American political scene of the present and recent past.Gosling is excellent in depicting his character's development from youthful enthusiast to cynical power-broker, while Clooney reminded me of another pretty-boy-with-brains Robert Redford in a similar part from a different Hollywood generation in "The Candidate" from the early 1970's. The late Philip Seymour-Hoffman is wholly credible as Gosling's there-to-be- shot-at senior colleague and rival, while the several supporting parts as one would expect are realistically portrayed. I personally think "House of Cards" depicts this sort of thing better, but concede that over 30 or more episodes, like of course "The West Wing " too, it had greater scope for deeper character and plot development. Nevertheless this well-edited contemporary political thriller is the best of its type to come out of Hollywood for some time and draws the viewer in tighter and tighter as it progresses. I'm sure that any resemblance to real-life characters particularly in the last 20 years or so, wasn't entirely uncoincidental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Semi-engrossing political drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides of March is a semi-engrossing political drama from the talented minds of George Clooney, Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon. Whilst it never quite engrosses the audience with the same addictiveness that Willimon's House of Cards did, it is still an intriguing ride that is hard to turn off. Clooney's direction is very skillful, with plenty of cold and well chosen shots at key moments in the film.Unfortunately, the acting is probably the film's weakest asset. It is rare that I find the dialogue great but the delivery not up to scratch, but this was one of those times. Clooney's performance is at times a refreshing change of pace from his charismatic nice guy stereotype from every other movie, but without a few key scenes it wouldn't be so refreshing. Gosling is disappointingly bland in what should have been a rich part. Paul Giamatti, Marisa Tomei and Phillip Seymour Hoffman do good supporting work, but none of them are at their best nor can they carry the film. The best asset is likely the supporting performance of Evan Rachel Wood, another stellar work for her resume as a youthful and charming intern with a secret or two.I might end up watching the Ides of March again one day, even if I didn't buy the film's ending. I couldn't help but agree with Governor Morris' logic, and if I'd been him I would have just called the bluff and framed it as a fired employee getting back. But its not high class political intrigue, nor is the acting worth cheering. Its just a decent watch.</fullReview>

Clooney and Gosling are fantastic and are very well supported by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti. All of these four are very well developed in the movie and their interactions come off as very real and very believable. Evan Rachel Wood is also a great addition to the cast and throws a nice curve ball into the plot.I don't really have any negatives to report. If I was being picky, the film does drag just a touch in places, but not to the extent where you lose connection to the plot.All in all, a very good film which I would recommend as a real life look into the less crowd pleasing side of party politics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm writing this right in the middle of the most devastating crisis my country has seen since WWII. The last piece of news coming out right this moment is that the coalition government is likely to split, all because the supporting Left party won't stand for the sudden, admittedly clumsy closure of the state television network. Imagine. 1,5million people have been laid off in three years in the private sector and no one budged, and now all this ruckus. But see, this is a matter of image (the symbolic 'black' of no-signal), and political narrative, since no one wants elections but they all have to appear to be strong and idealistic.Anyway, there couldn't be a better timing for this.It's about two men who are for ideals and all that's right, or that's what they say in public. We all are in cocktail parties, the words come out easy. In private, they messed up one night, we all do, or that's what the public will think if the scoop is out. It wasn't even that bad, a small, human mistake in both cases; disloyalty (respectively, to wife and boss), a moment's indecision and ego that was regretted. But because it's not acknowledged (that we are flawed but basically mean well) it ripples through the system, twisting everything to ugliness and lie.So I like the distinction, and this is what powers the film as mechanism. In private, we have confused, flawed selves drifting through mistakes they have made, choices and desires. But it's a different thing out in front of the cameras, there has to be a clean story, a confident image, because the national image has to stand above, more pure than the individual. And what better actors to project this image than Clooney and Gosling, confident charmers both. Clooney as party candidate Miller channels Obama's svelte sophistication, after all he stands for him in the film.So this should be much more than it is as a film. I envision a great film using Altman's soft, drifting gaze for the inner life, and Pakula for the immaculate image on the stage. It does hark back to 1970's films in feel. Alas Clooney directs, and that's a wholly different craft to master; he frames everything the same way, and what powerful images here are not discovered in the flow of being there, say conspirators framed in silhouette behind a giant American flag, but symbolically framed as statements. And that's who he is?too convenient in his image to take a powerful look of image.It is all too ordinary, competent but usual: Ben Affleck stuff. So it doesn't jolt me from just a well-made poster, to the quiet hum that shakes the walls where we hang images.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young political staffer on the up finds his beliefs questioned the nearer an election campaign comes to the Presidency.Power corrupts. Politics dirties you. The moral of the tale is all too clear in this slick flick that is not half as clever as it thinks it is. In order for idealist Stephen (Ryan Gosling) to get his candidate where he wants him to be he has to get down in the mud and dirty it up with the elephants, according to jaded Tom (Paul Giamatti). Feeling soiled by his encounter with Tom, Stephen isn't willing to go there, till he finds out that his boss Paul (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and candidate Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney) are every bit as complicit and ruthless as Tom. In order to win the day, Stephen has to be as cold-blooded as them - and sell his soul in the process.Michael Corleone made the same journey, but with more elegance. The Ides of March stakes the plausibility of Stephen's journey on his involvement with intern Molly (Evan Rachel Wood). A confident, brassy 20-year-old suddenly becomes a troubled, deeply disturbed individual on the turn of one phone call. When that phone call reveals her dalliance with Morris, and her pregnancy, none of her actions to that point vis-a-vis Stephen make sense. We are asked to believe that the assured seduction she deploys on Stephen took place while she was simultaneously suffering the inner turmoil of carrying the child of her married boss. It is incredulous characterization and blows a hole right in the heart of the narrative's plausibility. Stellar performances from a cast that lead you to expect no less. The theme of one man losing his innocence is hammered home in every frame though, from an opening play on a speech that is mere hollow words, to a bar singer with a song about disappearing. After Stephen makes the choice to meet Tom and not tell Paul, it is fairly obvious how everything will play out. A few more twists, a few more surprises, and this really could have been something. Instead, it is all just a bit predictable and dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this three times because I fell asleep during the first two. Overall, I would rate this maybe no more than three out of five stars. The film starts out with the line, "I am not a Christian. I am not an atheist. I am not a Muslim. My religion is the Constitution of The United States.' No wonder George Clooney lost Ohio with a line like that. Perhaps George could have said something more spicy like, "My religion is the Ten Commandments" or the Hammurabic Code, maybe even the Magna Carta. What a silly opening line. But instead he identifies the Constitution as his religion. Weird and a total turnoff. Who replaces God when he worships the Constitution? The Founding Fathers??? As Paul Giamatti says shortly after, "When was the last time the Democrats ran an atheist?"So, the campaign has severe problems and it seems like my most difficult time staying awake was through the first ten minutes of the film. The political dialogue was all clichs and silly promises like when George Clooney threatens to make us all change from combustion engines to electric cars within the first ten days of his presidency. Yeah, so how did that Guantanamo closing thingy go again? Good luck with that, George. Ridiculous dialogue like that subtracted a star from my rating, bored me and made me wonder why I rented this movie again.The best part of the movie was looking at Evan Rachel Wood. That is two stars right there. This could not have been a good movie for Gosling who tried to play sexy but looks like a 15-year old Jay Leno. Poor casting. Had Clooney made this all about screwing interns like Evan Rachel Wood and not tried to communicate an agenda through the dialogue, he would have a better movie. In the end, this is about people screwing over other people within the DNC to rise to power. And that is about it. Do you like these characters? No. Except for Evan Rachel Wood. And the hottie who takes her place at the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of two movies (the other being "The Notebook") that led me to realize that Ryan Gosling is a darned good actor. Before that I had thought of him mostly as a graduate of Disney studios.But, this is also an excellent film. It helps, of course, if you like presidential politics, but even if you're not that into it, you'll probably still enjoy this great plot and fine cast.The story is a rather simple one -- Democratic politician is running in the Ohio presidential primary. It'll be a tough election. Will he win the primary by offering a somewhat radical Ohio politician a cabinet post? The focus, however, is on the man who is second in line in the campaign organization...who has an affair with a young intern...who in turn is having an affair with the candidate himself...and she is preggers. Will the press find out? Who will stay and who will go in the campaign organization? And is it the candidate who will not survive...literally? The cast is excellent: Ryan Gosling is wonderful as the junior campaign manager who goes against all his principles to become the senior campaign manager. George Clooney is very good (also director) as the presidential candidate who is not as squeaky clean as he appears. Philip Seymour Hoffman turn in another great performance as the campaign manager who ultimately bites the dust. Paul Giamatti has a very good role as the campaign manager for the other Democratic candidate. Rachel Wood is satisfactory as the intern who gets pregnant. Marisa Tomei has, in my view, a rather poor role as a newspaper reporter; she deserves better than this. And Jeffrey Wright, although he gets little screen time, puts in a great performance as a radical Democratic senator seeking higher office. I also enjoyed (as I always do) Max Minghella as a campaign staffer, although his role is not that large.Highly recommended, with one caveat -- there's not a single "good guy" in the picture, and that's why I dropped it to a "7"...there are some good political types out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Written, directed and starring George Clooney, THE IDES of MARCH is based on some real-life circumstances that were part of an actual failed political campaign in 2004. Stephen Myers(Ryan Gosling)is a bright, over-achieving and at times ruthless spokesperson for the surging Governor Mike Morris(Clooney), who is desperately in need of enough convention delegate votes in the Ohio Democratic primary in his march to the White House. Myers is Morris' second hand man and is a true believer in his boss's principles and potential in making a major difference in people's lives. A hardened and zealous reporter for the New York Times Ida Horowicz(Marisa Tomei)brings to light information that personally attacks Morris and Myers goes on the offensive to save the popular politician from dangerous blackmail. In a judgment lapse Stephen has what he thinks is a secret meeting with Tom Duffy(Paul Giamatti), the manager of Morris' main rival. Not only is Myers caught up in a blackmail attempt, but also is being made to look like he is jumping ship to the Republicans. The dialogue is very smart and the story line shows the scheming and backstabbing hardball world of a presidential campaign. This outstanding cast includes: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Evan Rachel Wood, Jeffrey Wright, Michael Mantell, Danny Mooney and Maya Sayre.</fullReview>

Although I do think it could easily have achieved what it was trying to do without adding quite so much emotional gunpowder, I imagine that Clooney wanted to be certain that the audience would be in no doubt about the mindset of the protagonist so he made absolutely sure of it. You can't blame him for using very big letters at that point. Apart from this one flaw, I think this film is near perfect. A very neat and well designed story about how the real world of high level politics will harden you and leave you cynical. Of course it helps when the cast is this great. You could watch Phillip Seymour Hoffman read the phone book and it would be interesting. Clooney holds his own in this company. The sassy intern is very enjoyable to watch too. There is one scene that is worth cutting out and keeping she is so good in it. Loved it. Will certainly watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting political drama! (not thriller!)... Good enough, but not Great.It deals with people and politics, and there are no heroes in the the story. - That's what I liked about it; it deals with real people. The amazingly talented bunch of actors - Gosling (what a year!), Clooney, Hoffman, Giamatti, Tomei and Wood - do their job very well and fit into the shoes quite easily. The story is good, but it could have challenged the viewers a little more and the characters could have had more depth...Clooney's direction is admirable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent and exciting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ides of March" was an inspirationally well written, directed and acted film. I watched it on the plane to New Zealand and immediately replayed it when on the plane back to New York. Revealing how the game of politics will jade the most idealistic player, I was fascinated by the tricky chess game of each character as they tried to get what they wanted. My only complaint is that Evan Rachel Wood didn't hold up against such a seasoned and intelligent cast. Her character was sadly one dimensional and unconvincing as well as a little void when it came to connecting with Ryan Gosling.But I thoroughly recommend this film and feel its opening scenes are dripping with symbolism and pathos and this is a true American classic. Go George Clooney!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching the Ides of March in March. This movie is full of dirty politics. Hard to watch. Get my vote for one of the most cynical political movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie directed by George Clooney is brutality a downer as none of the characters are likable and leaves the audience with a bad taste in their mouth about the American political system. This film gives an appropriate nod to intrigue and betrayal by using a William Shakespeare's quote from Julius Ceasar as its title. Et tu, Brute. The ides of March generally refers to March 15, the day that Julius Caesar was thought to have been betrayed and killed by his friends. The movie titled also hints at half division, as the poster for the movie displays half of the politicians' face and half of campaign manager. Ides is Latin for that. The film is an adaptation of Beau Willimon's 2008 play Farragut North. The original play was inspired by the Democratic Chairman Howard Dean's 2004 campaign, but the film a lot of similarity to George W. Bush, Bill Clintons, Lyndon B. Johnson and other presidential campaigns added to the play. Even the posters in the film taken inspiration from the Barack Obama posters. Set in the world of the American Democratic Party primaries in Ohio where candidates contest the party nomination to become the Presidential candidate. The movie is about the junior campaign manager Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) that work for Gov. Mike Morris's of Pennsylvania (George Clooney) campaign. The campaign is trying to attempt to secure the endorsement of North Carolina Democratic Senator Franklin Thompson (Jeffery Wright), who controls 356 convention delegates, enough to clinch the nomination for either candidate. Meyers sees Mike Morris as the right man for the job, but when Stephen uncovered a scandal that would rock, Mike Morris's chances to become president; he looks for a chance to betrayal his boss, senior campaign manager Paul Zara (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) for the gamble of working with Morris's opponent, Senator Ted Pullman of Arkansas (Michael Mantell) and his campaign manager, Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti). The movie is full of mind games, cheating, and double crossing that you can't help wondering where is the integrity and honestly in American politics anymore. It shows politics to be a messy and brutal game. I knew the movie would be like this, so it didn't bug me as much as other people's opinion. One thing, I didn't like about this film is that the scandals seem forced and rush. It comes out of nowhere. Without spoiling it: the scandals are really dumb and overused in political films anyways. Plus, most of the problems, Meyers dealt with is in my opinion, is his foolish fault. How on earth, does Meyers doesn't see that coming!?! The movie like to paint that Stephen got the raw deal out of it, but I have to say, nobody in this film are angels. Even the female characters of Intern Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood) &amp; New York Times reporter Ida Horowicz (Marisa Tomei) seem annoying and power hungry. The movie was well acted, but nobody really stood out. All of them, pretty much show the same acting characteristics that they put into other films. George Clooney sounds like he is playing George Clooney. Ryan Gosling is just Ryan Gosling. Paul Giamatti is just Paul, and Phillip is just Phillip. The writing is pretty good, but it does differs from the stage play in one thing: Mike Morris was never in the play. The movie did had a lot of political lingos that can confused the audience on what's going on. I don't see the movie being for everybody. It takes a lot of understanding of the US presidential primary system to get what is happening. I did laugh, in the stupidity of in what the paranoia details. It was bit odd for Tom Duffy to take offense on the media saying he order Buffalo Wings during his meeting. He seems angry at that, then anything else. The film was well shot, particularly in its way it use shadows, darkness and shafts of light amplify the themes of honor and deceit. I like how the film gave the audience, a little room for a non-dialogue scene in the van scene. The movie had way too much talking, and little action to go with it. There was one badly done scene that I have to complain. One scene that stood curiously out of place was with a young girl from a high school Democrat Society arguing that gender distinction was the same as racial discrimination. It never truly finish what she was trying to say or the answer to that question. The film quickly moves to the next scene. I felt like that if you going to bring an issue in the film, at less, finish it before moving on. If not, just cut the whole scene out. The score by Alexandre Desplat was dark-hued and work with the themes. The movie ending is pretty good, and its serves as an open to interpretation as if you don't know what Stephen's next actions will do. Overall: It's a good morality tale, but highly cynical that can be hard to chew. It really does kill optimism in believing in any government.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clooney teaching us history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clooney should be given more credit. The guy obviously works a lot, driving multiple projects, often, at the same time. Unfortunately, some of the material is bound to be sub-par. Ironically, his screenplay is the reason this is not very convincing or engaging. Aside from that, the movie is acted and directed very well and with authority, creating a feel of wholeness, albeit a flawed wholeness.We have a generic story about politics where an "inside" man's ideology is shattered by the events leading up to the primaries in Ohio. I did not think we needed another reminder of how corrupt and deviant political scenes can be, but I guess, who am I to think? Even worse, some of the "strategic moves" are a tad questionable and not very credible, at least in the circumstances presented. Yet, the historical reference is placed and utilized in an interesting way, which redeemed Clooney for me. Usually, when you have a reference to another story, you try to intentionally hide it, as it gives out much of the ending. Surprisingly, here it is used as a clue to explain and complete the ending. A history lecture or an homage to Brutus? Both?3/5 - Respectable, far from Clooney's best work though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clooney's Shiny Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides of March assumes, like the numerous films that form its ancestry, the plausibility of a naive Democrat who will never play dirty. That is something to which many can relate. I remember someone older telling me, as a fifth grader with grand social ambitions pushing for a Gore presidency, that "everyone is a Democrat until they get their first paycheck." Of course, I didn't know what that meant at the time, but there might be some truth to it. This film imagines that same claim. Ryan Gosling portrays a baby Dem with pure wishes who "needs to believe in a cause" in order to make a move. It's a tale of the Incest of the Left. Everyone floats somewhere between idealistic and cynical, usually representing both. Like Primary Colors and The American President did before, The Ides of March tells us little we didn't already know. Instead, it elects to dish out Clooney's political wet dream ? a president who mandates two years of military service, has no religious conviction (but he respects yours!!!), and never plays dirty unless he knocks somebody up.Directed by and co-starring Clooney, it is his predictable political antidote for the American Red/Right Infection from the very beginning. The first words of the film are "I am not a Christian. I am not an atheist." As a whole, the film shares the same non-committal. Every character but Gosling's is little more than a stepping stone. Visually, The Ides of March misses the methodical neatness of Good Night and Good Luck. Clooney's directing and writing styles are capable and wide. He is clearly interested in wordy pictures that search for meaning inside, not on the surface. Luckily for him, he found a balanced talent in Ryan Gosling, who also had a promising year with Drive and this picture. His masculine sensitivity and smoothness recalls the old masters, harnessing the cool charm of Cary or Gary. His quiet charisma also recalls Clint. The sum Dashing-ness of Clooney and Gosling is rich. You'll only need a couple bites of their cake, but it's good.Unfortunately, Ides does little to advance a committed ideology. The stakes are low and cool jazz is playing in the background while these characters talk. I'm unsure whether Clooney was seeking to make a good movie or a political statement. Either way, it only swallowed half of the glass. Whether it's half full or half empty is your call.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Expendable" in business suit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever you want to say about this movie, you can't fault its choice of cast: Ryan Gosling, George Clooney, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, and Marisa Tomei. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti are hands-down the two favorite contemporary actors of mine, I mean, gosh, you can make a movie of these two scrubbing the floor for two hours and I'd be watching it from beginning to end full of benefit of doubts. And if they throw in a line or two, a little witty jabs and spars across the floor, I might just believe I am watching the modern day "Wait for Gordot." George Clooney should be given credit for simply thinking of putting these two together. But that's also the exact problem of this movie -- it packs so much star power in such a tightly-wound story, nobody is really given the necessary length and breadth to shine. I mean, "Ides of March" is like "The Expendable" in business suit -- they might be aiming at different group of junkies, but it's pulled from the same bag of trick.Shakespearean reference and election backdrop aside, the movie is not politically ambitious in any real sense. Rather, it's just another little drama based on the drummed-up but dumbed-down Hollywood concept of political conspiracy. A clich. The movie is full of clich. In the only scene that really involves Paul Giamatti, he bellowed: "If you stay in this business long enough you'll get cynical and jaded!" I mean, the guy himself is a walking definition of cynicism and jadedness. But making him utter so lame a line is like asking Van Gough to compose a kid's song about sunflowers. He might as well be yelling at Gosling "Cookies are delicious!", with the same indignation and conviction, and it won't feel any more hollow or comical. Other than this supposedly gut-wrenching scene, we see very little of Paul Giamatti.Ryan Gosling, the modern day James Dean minus the sadness, is infinitely cool, which unfortunately, makes the scheming and plotting at the end of the movie unconvincing. But pit him against Hoffman is another great touch. The scene where Hoffman fired Gosling reminds me, well, just a little, the great Lester Bang telling the kid "they make you feel cool. Hey, I've met you, you are not cool. You are uncool".And last but not least, man, Marisa Tomei has aged. And aged so well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ides of March</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Political thriller is generally favored by the orthodox mass, as it hinges on an abiding gist: the pitch-dark side of politicians and their marionettes. But as a fact it will never own the impact on an social level to substantially transform the framework, so it only function is to appease the jealousy and complaint from our average joe with a fawningly condescending feeling as such "you know, it's not easy to be a politician, so give them a break, they are literally assholes, you are much better than them!". Of course, initially we all gloat to hear that, but time and time again, it may run to the other pole and intrigue an even more essential dislike towards the rotting upper structure and films that endorse the indulgence. George Clooney's directional work is on a par with his acting knack, so excellency might be overstated, but he can fabricate an arresting film without any difficulties (GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK. 2005, a 7/10, is stylishly chic while the plot line can shun many entries from a wide audience). In THE IDES OF MARCH, the entire exposition is more feasible to understand while a fatal setback is the corny tenor wrapped with a feather-weight crowd-pleasing script (adapted from Beau Willimon's play FARRAGUT NORTH). An over-simplified approach to elaborate a political puzzle, it does hurt the film. The acting is high-end and Ryan Gosling has again triumphantly invaded into anther genre to broaden his bent to be the next virtuoso. Inside the supporting group, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Evan Rachel Wood are my pick of prominence, Clooney himself, Paul Giamatti and Marisa Tomei are all dedicated without any glitch. And a big thumb to the unswervingly composed camera-work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie with a plot that gets more thickened as the story goes on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw The Ides of March I read some of the reviews of this movie. One thing that almost every single one of the reviewers mentioned was that the movie started of great, but then nothing really happened. My opinion is the exact opposite. In the beginning of the movie it's just a plantation of what the movie will be about. You get introduced to the characters of the movie and after about 20-30 minutes, the snowball begins to roll. I thought that the movie was a great film, filled with an intense thrill. And whether you think that the movie is going slow, or that it's exciting to watch, you'd still be wondering "how's it going to end?" But, I think that you have to be concentrated while watching this film. I'm not saying that you should be glued to your TV or Computer, but in order to experience the intensity in this film you'll have to stay focused on the plot. I also read the trivia to this film and saw that Philip Seymour Hoffman replaced Brad Pitt in the role of Paul. I'm grateful for that, since it feels like a typical Hoffman-roll. And he's amazing in this movie. Ryan Gosling does one of his finest appearances. And George Clooney, well, he's always going to be George Clooney and at this point at his career it's kind of hard watching him play a roll without thinking "That's George Clooney". If you're in to thrillers about corruption, and ethical questions about what is right and what is wrong, this i movie that you will appreciate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre political drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the films Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and Good Night and Good Luck, director George Clooney showed a very solid vision, which put him on par (or even above) more acclaimed filmmakers; but the stridently political screenplay from his most recent film, The Ides of March, along with its trite message, make it much less ambitious than the two previously mentioned movies, and as a consequence, it is much less satisfactory. Fortunately, the excellent performances help the movie and make it moderately entertaining despite its various cons.Foremost, I would like to say that The Ides of March is not ANOTHER tiring denounce against George W. Bush, the conflict in Iraq or the war on terror. I think that we have already surpassed that stage, even though there are still many subjects to be examined in the cinema "with a conscience". What co-screenwriters Clooney, Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon wanted to do with The Ides of March was not attacking a political party in particular, nor a person nor an ideology, but to the system itself, in which the straightness and the honesty become obstacles in order to advance in the road to power. That is a definitely important message, but...Does it really need to be repeated? Isn't it enough with only watching the news to find out that it has always been like that, and it will probably keep being so? I would have preferred the screenplay to include some other angle (such as the economical crisis, the addiction to oil or the election scandals), because that may have made this simplistic lesson about the obvious realities of contemporary politics more interesting.Besides, I did not find the existence of an intelligent, honest and fair governor, who denies himself to participate in the dirtiest tricks of the profession in order to guarantee his presidential bid, very realistic. Then, how the hell did he get to being a governor? By kissing babies and shaking hands with his voters? And, for the case, how is it possible to believe in a brilliant political strategist who works in function of his moral principles, and not because of the money and power he can win in a long-term? I mean, we are not in the era of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington anymore, in which the main character changed the course of the country with integrity and a smile. And even though the things get quickly sour to the characters of The Ides of March, the drama only works if we believe in their straightness from the beginning of the film.At least, I liked the ending, and as I previously mentioned, the performances are the main reason why The Ides of March kept me moderately interested, and not only the ones from Clooney and Ryan Gosling, but also the ones from the supporting cast, in which we find Philip Seymour Hoffman making a flawless work as the overwhelmed leader of a campaign; Paul Giamatti stealing every scene he's in as Hoffman's character's rival; Evan Rachel Wood bringing an appropriately innocent and sensual attitude to her character; and Marisa Tomei in a short role she perfectly interprets. In conclusion, brilliant performances in a movie which is excessively light in shape and elementary in substance. Nevertheless, I will keep following Clooney's career as a director with interest; I just hope that, in his future movies, he works with more ingenious, or at least more credible, material than the one from The Ides of March.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really couldn't believe it when this movie came to the end. I thought it was about where it should be at the end of an Act Two.The performances and cast are great. Clooney was tailor-made to play a presidential candidate (as Robert Redford always was) and I hope this film hasn't spoiled his chances of doing another before he gets too old.And Philip Seymour Hoffmann excels in any role and his range is just amazing, from Capote to Charlie Wilson's War.The background of political in-fighting is also scripted really well.However, it was ultimately unconvincing and that was probably down to its too-short running time. Not enough time for soul-searching and the rationale behind a complete character change.And it was totally unconvincing for a 20-year-old Molly, a serious political intern, to come on to Stephen the way she did, particularly after what had just happened to her (can't say any more as that would be a spoiler).Even so, worth watching and it did grab me, but felt cheated at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Press Secretary Stephen Meyers (Gosling) tries to fix a problem while working for Governor Morris (Clooney) who is running for President of the United States.This is based upon a play by Beau Willimon titled: Farragut North.The title changed to The Ides of March. But, no one was shouting, "Beware,the Ides of March!" There was no raised dagger; and no political bigwig was killed. However, there was someone giving a warning with a symbolically raised dagger of what the future will be like for a prominent politician. So, all in all, this is based loosely on the Julius Caesar moment. Most movies based on plays are talky, talky, talky whereupon the talking by all actors never stops and you find yourself in la la land. Not this one. In here the dialogues were very smart, quick, to the point and honest. All the performers were excellent. And, an Oscar nomination may come out of this for Ryan Gosling, whose idealistic character makes a mistake and then has his eyes opened regarding some of the realities of political life: the lies, deceptions, deals, secrets, bribes, and the rewards and consequences of loyalty issues. I said this was a thriller, but there are no car chases/crashes, explosions, shootings, men chasing other men here and there. No, it's a very good tension thriller and the suspense of what will happen next will keep you guessing. The music throughout was excellent, but the music when the credits run is worth a listen. Very good. There is some political stuff by Gov Morris (Clooney) but political reviews are not on my agenda.There is a downside. (here we go) The use of F-bombs and other language throughout was most distracting and quite unnecessary. Do politicians, reporters, interns, campaign workers really talk that way as much as I heard in here, and in mixed company? Yes, most movies these days do have some language to get the R rating, but this was just a little too much and took away from an engaging story. Oh, and this may not mean anything, but the movie seems to be telling us that personal political history (read behavior) constantly repeats. Note the young woman bringing coffee to the staffers in the beginning and the young woman making the same coffee run at the end. Duh! (7/10)Violence: No. Sex: Yes, there is a scene, but you see nothing. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, many F-bombs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Evan Rachel Wood and Marisa Tomei star in "The Ides of March," a 2011 film about the underside of politics.While not the most original film I've ever seen, the direction and strong performances are real assets in this story showing behind the scenes of a campaign for the presidential nomination.Governor Mike Morris (Clooney) is running for President, and one of the main men working on the campaign, Stephen Meyers (Gosling) is young and idealistic, totally believing in the candidate and committed to him. When he gets a call from the opposition's campaign head (Giamatti), asking to meet, he does so. This, plus an affair he's having with an intern (Wood) become problems that entangle Meyers in a web of paranoia, dirty tricks, blackmail, scandal, and betrayal.Very good movie, with Ryan Gosling in solid form as the somewhat naive Meyers. Two fantastic actors head up the campaigns - Hoffman and Giamatti, and both are wonderful. Hoffman is a perfect campaign manager -- slobby, looking exhausted, with a short fuse. Giamatti seems to be playing a campaign manager who is a little bit more seasoned, better put together and quick thinking.Clooney is magnetic as Governor Morris, seemingly sincere but with an edge. Without giving anything away, in a major confrontation scene toward the end of the film, the lighting nearly steals the scene, giving Clooney a different appearance from the one he puts forward on the campaign trail.There was a big debate on the message board having to do with the title - was it literally March 15 at a certain point in the film. The title, from Julius Ceasar, tells us what the film is about. Though I did hear one gossip show refer to this as The Ideas of March. Uh, not really, and why am I not surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Get out, now. Or otherwise..." Stephen Meyers (Gosling) is a young and ambitious campaign worker for his ideal candidate Mike Morris (Clooney). When the Ohio primary is in jeopardy the campaign has a tough decision to make. When Stephen talks to the opposition and discovers a secret that could ruin Mike's chances his morals are challenged. Being a political science major I really enjoy movies like this. I know most people may not but I do think that this one is different. For a movie that is basically an hour and a half of talking it moves very quickly, keeps you interested and is very tense. Focusing mainly on the dirty politics and deals made in order to get someone elected this will both interest you and make you wonder if this is accurate (which I hope it's not). This is one of the best political thrillers I have ever seen. The only problem I can see is that it's not a multiple re-watcher. I give it a B+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very tense and strong story, more a character study than a political drama, although, quite significantly, the democrat George Clooney shows no pity for a kind of democracy that under the profession of integrity and honesty, very easily gives in to corruption and blackmail. However, the movie appeals more as a Bildungsroman, following, little by little, the gradual moral abasement of the young, smart, passionate Stephen, struggling inside himself, but inexorably falling into decline, under the perverted seduction of power and prestige. A strong direction, based on a scrutinizing camera, and an essential and incisive screenplay, never forgetting its theatrical origin, enhance the talented performances offered by a top-notch cast: Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hofmann offer a well focused and emotional interpretation, as well as the always versatile George Clooney. Ryan Gosling as Stephen leaves the mark, we perceive his inner change, or more probably his gradual coming to a previously removed awareness of what he was really aiming at. His facial expressions are intense and emotionally gripping and the last shots on his face prove amazingly chilling. I found the female cast weaker, in the way the inner motivations of Molly and Ida are not well explored, but I also realized the movie is above all a titanic struggle between strong male egos, and this struggle is successfully represented, and greatly acted, as to get captivating and deeply involving for the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A maturing Clooney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As clich' as it sounds, Clooney seems to age like a fine wine. He has successfully shed his image as the ridiculously good looking eternal bachelor of Tinseltown for an aura of respectability. We've seen him grow over the last three decades from one of the thousands of Hollywood pretty boys into one of the most politically aware actors of his generation. It doesn't hurt that the man has developed a fine nuance for understated writing/directing/acting. We've seen shades of it in Good Night, and Good Luck, Syriana and Michael Clayton, but it has come into full bloom here.If the original Ides of March carries the image of dying Caesar in the arms of Brutus, here, it shows the loss of innocence of our young protagonist, Stephen Meyers, played adeptly by Ryan Gosling.There is a layered realism to the movie, adapted from Beau Willamon's play Farragut North, leaving even the most politically jaded viewers like yours truly glued to the travails of the Morris (Clooney) campaign. Ably supported by a plethora of established Hollywood character actors, including Oscar winners Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti, Clooney and writing partner grant Heslov managed to weave in little twists that will sneak up on you when you least expect it. But a lot were still left unsaid, and part of the challenge of watching the movie was deciphering the unspoken words, facial expressions and body languages of the actors. The intensity and emotions on display, complete with several very close 'close-ups', appeared too raw at times, but absorbing, nonetheless. Verdict: 9/10Is this my favorite movie of the year so far? Oh yes. Will the movie be an Oscar winner? Who knows? Will it be nominated for best picture? Very likely. Will any of the cast members win a major acting award? You bet. Will Clooney nab his second Oscar? You can put your money on it.</fullReview>

I am not a fan of the fairy tale, utopian political views that ooze from too many of his films, and was resigned to wasting yet another pittance for the privilege of being annoyed, insulted and riled once again. We otherwise self reliant right wingers seem to be so starved for meritorious entertainment that we repeatedly fork over our hard-earned bucks for the privilege of being serially humiliated by Hollywood's limousine lefties. So it was with resolute heart and jutting chin that I cringed and endured the initial, ritual swipes at the mean old Republicans.It began so badly that my usually sedate and restrained spouse was heard to yell "hope and change" during Clooney's delivery of an Obama-clone campaign speech, replete with many of the signature, expertly deceptive, liberal bromides. Then came a few unsuccessful and amateurish contrivances to explain implausible character motivations and I was seriously considering the lure of the exit sign and a righteously indignant demand for the return of my admission fee. But patience prevailed and the plot and script began to improve.The end result is a taut and entertaining adventure into political intrigue, backstabbing and gamesmanship topped off with the perfect maraschino cherry, if not entirely satisfying, ending. But the big surprise to me was not the quality of the product. Clooney, despite his dyslexic politics, is a talented and versatile actor, capable of selecting commendable scripts. No, the big and most welcome surprise of Ides is the fact that Clooney appears in and co-writes a movie in which the despicably irredeemable scalawags are actually the Democrats! Go figure. I can now recommend without hesitation, reservation, nor purpose of evasion, that Ides be nominated for the Oscar for best, and most accurate, documentary of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid yet unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a movie for everyone! The trailer gives a somewhat false idea of exactly what the movie has to offer. This put aside, it was a very entertaining film! The writing was absolutely phenomenal! There were so many moments where subtle comedy was worked into the overall dark plot. Acting was very solid throughout the film. Ryan Gosling will most likely get an Oscar Nomination as well as George Clooney, and or Philip Seymour Hoffman, and or Paul Giamatti for their supporting roles. I could also see Evan Rachel Wood getting nominated for her role. Overall I enjoyed the film yet it left me wanting more. Ryan Gosling's character drove the story by pulling you into his mind and taking you through his inner battle between morals and power. As intriguing as this was, it stopped short literally. I get the idea behind ending the story where it did but I just wish it could have gone on. It slightly reminded me of the ending in Inception. It wanted to leave you guessing but in this case it left me unsatisfied. I would have rated it higher if it were not for the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politics in the Raw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very occasionally a film comes along that not only holds the viewers attention with fine acting and an interesting plot, but also illustrates a wider truth."The Ides of March" is such a film. Both Ryan Gosling (Staffer Stephen Meyers) and George Clooney (Governor Mike Morris) play their parts to great effect, as does Evan Rachel Woods (Molly Stearns) - who I'm sure we'll be seeing much more of in the future. Meyers is the wide-eyed buck with idealistic views and perfectly honed and timed political strategies, whilst Morris is the seasoned political campaigner, easily wooing his audiences and the media into his altruistic, though ultimately false, world - seemingly the perfect match.As Meyers gets caught up in a challenging and quickly unravelling "situation", that could easily cost Morris the Presidency, his relationship with both the Governor and his gnarled campaign manager boss (the ubiquitous Philip Seymour Hoffman) deteriorate. Not to be deterred from his path however, Meyers finds himself holding all the Aces that, played well, will allow him to wreak revenge on his old boss and boost his own career.This is politics in the raw - "The Ides of March" should be watched by any youngster considering entering politics, so clearly does it illustrate the morally bankrupt world they're entering before, as with poor Molly Stearns, it is far too late to get out intact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aother Gosling movie, another really good movie coming your way too. While many may have expected Clooney to go deeper than he actually did with this (comparisons to West Wing are inevitable), he did a good job creating a thriller surrounding political (and general) ambitions. And while not completely flawless the movie has a good story backed up by great actors.While Gosling is almost in every scene he gets supported by a lot of characters. You might not agree with his portrayal at the beginning or may not be able to think his journey feels real, but I think he does convey that feeling. Other than that, the political aspect may be a little too thin for most people, but as thrillers go this is more than watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More restrainted than relaxed, a dry but believable look at the primaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides of March (2011)Overrated political insider film. It's all very nicely made, and it proceeds like a George Clooney movie (all his "solo" films seem to have a steady, interesting, slightly restrained quality). So you will get into the inside of a presidential primary campaign (good timing since I write this on Super Tuesday 2012) and see what we already know--everyone is a mixture of intensity and duplicity, the candidates are principled but not too principled, and sex is cheap and fast on the campaign trail.Why watch it? It's fun. It has some good acting in brief doses (for example, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti are both at their usual commanding odd selves, and both appear in just a handful of scenes). The key actor throughout is Ryan Gosling as a political operative with doubts about his career and about the candidates chance of winning. He's very good but you might realize that the material--his role as a desk wonk--isn't the most cinematic, and whether he brings the angst and energy you need to enliven his character for the screen might be a matter of taste. It was just fine for me, but never amazing.Oddly, the thing going for this film might be all the above. I mean, it doesn't romanticize things. It isn't a gritty documentary at all, but there isn't a glow to anything, there isn't an excitement to the whole process that makes you want to be there. The bad people aren't actually terrible, just bad in a selfish and manipulative way. So in a way, the film is pretty accurate, as Hollywood films go. It's fiction, it's not realistic in the big view, but it plays the cards with a kind of fairness you might be surprised at. Who knows, this movie might make a ton of sense fifty years from now. You can see. I'll be dead.I had heard great things from someone about this film before going, and so if you go into it expecting something not so amazing but simply pretty good, you'll probably have a great experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling and uncompromising political thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young man goes up to a microphone and starts speaking, hardly audible. Standard political phrases disintegrating into meaningless bla bla and ending in non-verbal noises. There is a certain playfulness to this, a lack of seriousness. It is, after all, a rehearsal only. Two hours later the same man will be on another stage, sitting upright, staring stone- faced into a camera.There is nothing playful anymore. Between these two scenes lies a story of disillusionment, a study in the changes circumstances can bring about in a person, a study in the deformation of character power is known to cause. The Ides of March is an uncompromising, bleak and chilling portrait of the serious business politics have become, of its perpetrators, its victims, of how to survive and at what cost.Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is 30 and he is near the top of his business. As the number 2 man and media expert in Governor Mike Morris' (George Clooney) presidential campaign, he is as close to real power as he can be. Unlike Morris' campaign chief (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Stephen cares for more than winning. He is a believer, he truly believes in Morris. When approached by the manager of the opponent's campaign, he shrugs it off. He can only work for something he believes in. This is the first part of the film in which everything seems to be exactly as it appears. Clooney plays the governor as a believable man who honestly pursues what he believes in. Given the chance to buy a former opponent's endorsement and with it the nomination, he refuses. There are plots and schemes, but everyone is on the right side.Or are they? Halfway through the film there is a turning point. It starts as a small yet dirty secret which can be brushed away just like that. But it cannot. It shatters the very foundation on which the house of cards was built. Stephen finds himself in the middle of a tornado of lies and schemes and chooses to play. And so the boyish enthusiast whose professionalism never stifles his idealistic belief in fighting what is good turns into a master schemer which an impenetrable face.Yet on the outside nothing changes: Morris is still the charming candidate he was, everything is business as usual. But the same thing that just seemed honest and genuine now appears hollow and hypocritical. Clooney, the director, masterfully creates the sense of a fundamental seachange even though nothing really changes. A lot of this is due to actor Clooney who excels in absence: even when he's on screen he's never really there. Morris is an idea, a projection which can mean anything. And as circumstances change, the image changes to. He is the figure in the dark, in shadowy corner as in the film's key scene. He is whatever people want him to be. And he will be Stephen's role model.The view of politics presented in this film is relentlessly bleak. There is no innocence or rather it is crushed ? literally or, as in Stephen's case, lured to the dark side. Politics is portrayed as a ruthless power struggle in which you can only succeed if you're more ruthless than the others. Some plot twists are too sensational, the overall picture might have deserved a little grey between the black and the white and the last 20 minutes feel rushed.But in the end this is a gripping and chilling political thriller which is strong on turning hardly detectable nuances into gamechangers. Suddenly the atmosphere is turned upside down, heaven becomes hell and we are left to wonder how it all happened. And in the middle is Ryan Gosling in a performance that encases all the film's essence in one body, one face. There was a time when George Clooney was just a pretty face. Those days are long gone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the minor hiccups, "The Ides of March" still gets my vote.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ides of March", based on the play "Farragut North" by Beau Willimon, and adapted to the big screen by George Clooney, Grant Heslov, and Willimon himself, follows Steven Myers (Ryan Gosling), a smart, young, and smooth campaign staffer who follows his heart working under the ambitious and innovative presidential hopeful Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney) and his campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a veteran in the game who has been itching for a campaign victory, and will stop at no costs to win it. The team seems to be invincible as interviewers, rival Senator Pullman (Michael Mantell), and the media (more specifically desperate New York Times reporter Ida Horowicz (Marisa Tomei), can't even touch them. Paul and Steven seem to have everything under control, and the Governor demonstrates he is able to hold his own as well. Steven's charisma and youth set him apart from Paul, as he becomes a target for beautiful intern Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood), Paul's counterpart Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti), who admires Steven's talent but still believes he may be the weaker leg of the team, and even the Governor as he looks to Steven for answers to questions he knows Paul can't answer. Things start to get rough, however, when both democratic candidates, Morris and Pullman, race to win the support of Ohio's Senator Thompson (Jeffrey Wright), which will ultimately grant victory of the democratic primary candidacy, and highly probable, the presidential election. As the pressure rises, Duffy starts to close in on Steven, and the growing desperation of Ida to publish a story to the Times, and Steven's unraveling of Molly's past only makes thing worse. Steven is then driven to a point of enlightenment where he has to make a choice of either following a broken moral compass and cut some corners, or walk the plank to the end of his career. Gosling's performance is impeccable, as the character of Steven requires charm and assertiveness not found in many actors. Clooney, the writer and director of the film, gives off such a strong performance it is hard not to doze off and fantasize what it would be like if Clooney was president. The roles of Paul, Duffy, and Ida were performed with a great air of competence that leaves no doubt in their casting of their respective actors. Heck, the music was even great. However, the movie isn't receiving a 10/10 for a reason.There were a couple knots in the plot which could have been unraveled and emphasized a bit in the film; nothing five extra minutes couldn't have done. There also seemed to be a bit of repetition or linearity in some portions of the script, but this may not be a problem to some viewers. However, certain supplemental characters, like Ben Harpen (Max Minghella) and Senator Thompson (Wright), were thrown around the plot at some points without clear explanation. Some of these things I picked up on during the film, but even after the film I had to ask myself "Is this movie a 10/10?" Upon reflection I noticed some flaws, but nonetheless, having being written and directed by an actor, which has been historically risky, "The Ides of March" is a wonderful film that accomplishes it's goal in showing the challenge of surviving in the "one-life remaining" realm of politics, and why only few are chosen to run with the big dogs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smart film about people who do not act smartly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Suppose you were an idiot and suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself." - Mark Twain My own short-lived career in California politics allowed me to participate in the same playing field with many idealistic and courageous people, some who are in Congress today, yet it also gave me a taste of the compromises that are often necessary when someone is serious about a political career. George Clooney's fourth film, The Ides of March, a political thriller set in the midst of a Democratic Presidential primary in Ohio, is a smart film about people who do not act very smartly. In this case, a careerist press secretary seems to lose his idealism when he is suddenly sacked for an indiscretion, an ambitious young intern becomes accessible to the campaign in too many ways, and a certain Governor makes lofty promises on the campaign trail but forgets to bring his morals to the party.Based on the play "Farragut North" by Beau Willimon who, together with Clooney and Grant Heslov, adapted it for the screen, The Ides of March is a well-done, entertaining, and riveting film that has a stellar ensemble cast that includes Ryan Gosling as Stephen Miles, a press secretary dedicated to the Presidential candidacy of Governor Mike Morris (Clooney) who is locked in a tight Ohio primary battle with Arkansas Senator Ted Pullman. Playing strong supporting roles are Philip Seymour Hoffman as Paul Zara, Morris' scrappy veteran campaign manager, and Paul Giamatti as the conniving campaign manager for Pullman, Tom Duffy. As the film begins, Miles walks into a darkened auditorium and, as the lights go on, tests the sound system by reading some of his boss' campaign rhetoric.His belief in Morris' candidacy is unshakable and he tells New York Times reporter Ida Horowicz (Marisa Tomei), "This thing, it's got me starry-eyed again. It's reminded me of why I got into politics in the first place." The dubious reporter tells him that his idealism is likely to be shattered when Morris turns out to be different than his expectations. Brushing her comments aside, Miles' eyes light up when he hears the Governor deliver a speech asserting that his religion is the U.S. Constitution and that he opposes padding the pockets of the wealthiest Americans. His remarks, however, consist mostly of the vague and meaningless catch phrases we are all too familiar with.The stakes are high for Morris as a win in Ohio would likely give him enough delegates to win the nomination. Aware of this, Pullman's campaign manager devises a fool-proof scenario to bring Morris down that involves a top player on Morris' staff. Meanwhile, things get more complicated when Steve has an affair with Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood), a 20-year-old intern, and an influential Senator (Jeffrey Wright) who owns 161 delegates, wants to make a deal for a cabinet post or a spot on the ticket. Needless to say, no one emerges from this scenario very clean and with all the power plays, maneuvering, and dirty tricks, the idealism with which the campaign began gives way to the "whatever it takes to win" mentality.In spite of the excess cynicism and melodrama and some character motivations that do not quite ring true, The Ides of March is a basically honest film that does not pull its punches; however, some very important aspects of the contemporary scene are left out such as the poisonous and corrupting influence of big money in politics, and the willingness of many candidates to cater to the most regressive elements in society. We know about the corruption in politics but some forget that there are people remaining in political life who have not given up their principles and who know that they can still make a difference through their energy and integrity, and to begin, in the words of Pete Seeger' song, "to bind up this sorry world with hand and heart and mind."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank God for Ryan Gosling. He instills his work with potent acting. Even in his minimalistic work, we can't look away from something that will at least explosive. There's a strong core and unlimited potential to this young man. Previous works that could have been laughable, even in the sales pitch stages take a shade of truth when Gosling is in the spotlight. No doubt, Clooney is a star with his looks and smile, and he can stand his own behind the camera, and we can always rely on Hoffman, Giamatti, and Tomei. The real surprise here is the chemistry between Evan Rachel Wood and Gosling. He portrays a character who is ambitious, but still retains much of what gives his character integrity. Suddenly he's facing a major political and personal crisis, and he must deal with the consequences.The film drags at first, but if you give it a chance, you'll be in the middle some interesting political scheming. Add to that the loss of innocence and some wild chess moves. Gosling is caught, pretty much like a deer in the headlights; the question is whether he'll be run over, or how much he's willing to move.There is a moment in the film when he's caught in what appears to be decisively losing situation. Still, thanks to a clever and somehow, not manipulative script, things don't quite turn out the way we expect them. There is no mystery here. Things are laid on the table. It's still like a game of poker. The winner is the best bluffer, and Clooney manages to put on a pretty good face, so does Hoffman, and Tomei sizzles in a very short turn, but keep your eye on Gosling...The question here is what is happening to American films lately. In "All The President's Men", the tension and our interest never waned. It wasn't just the source, but the handling of the material. Even Nichols made "Primary Colors" an interesting ride. Let's be clear, just having great soldiers doesn't quite give you an invincible army, we still need a great general, and here we almost got it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I am not a Clooney fan. Second, Clooney is very idealistic, and his writing is mediocre. This movie would not have been made without his street cred, as the story followed like a box of donuts: mixed, sweet, but too much in the end. Ryan Gosling kills this role and puts him in the top 5 of living great actors. Wow. He sells this role from his first line. He is sheer joy to watch. But the story hit a number of speed bumps that created nice opportunities for tension and climax resolution, but I was not sold. It would not have worked as a play: they needed editing to tie the loose ends together. So good for Clooney to take the risk, but he has a ways to go as a writer. Down the road, I think he'll look back and say, "I could do better. On the good side, the music was excellent, the story topical, and with a bit of less scrutiny the movie was entertaining. And I do look forward to his next movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie does plays out the political drama perfectly but the feeling of deja vu doesn't leave you throughout the watch. Dirty politics doesn't always mean screwing your interns.But that's not the lynch pin of my surmise that the movie is basically only average. The pace is sickening so much so that I'd have preferred to watch it on TV with faster-paced commercials in between.Ryan Gosling plays it out amazingly on the acting front with a lot of intensity, more or less winning my appreciation for the emotionless expression out of the guilt of having betrayed all his morals. It was interesting to watch George Clooney in his shady character but Paul Giamatti steals the show all the way.Paul's character was perfectly scripted and even perfectly executed if that were possible. His explanation to a crest-fallen, fired from his job, murderous Steven (Ryan Gosling) was a classic scene and remains my most memorable part of the movie.All in all, don't go in expecting twists and turns, cos' the only twist in the story leaves you really disappointed. It's dramatic towards the end and the only thing political about it is the backdrop.</fullReview>

It starts off slow, but it has various twists throughout. On paper, it sorta looks all a bit too silly or obvious. It is sort of a melodrama, but it's directed with a brilliant flare by Clooney. The actual storyline is pretty simple even with it's twists, but the film has a lot of great individual scenes. Still, it's a great film, only a great film, but nothing incredible. Clooney's direction is as smooth as you would expect from him, so this is in a way a directorial trick, but the screenplay is very, very well written, even if the storyline sounds hokey, the script smooths it out. Overall, better than I expected, and one of the few 2011 films where our opinion of the lead changes completely from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weak script prevents a good film from being great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides of March is a film that is slightly overshadowed by it's potential in comparison to what it actually is. On paper, it has the makings of a truly significant piece of cinema. It has one of the most sensational casts in recent years, a plot ripe for high intensity, political commentary and Shakespearean twists and turns and a director with a track record for doing some noteworthy works, particularly in recent years. It also is coming at a perfect time, with the Presidential race in gear and at around the same contextual position as the characters in the film. The Ides of March, for my money, is a very good film; however it doesn't meet what it could be, or what for many, it should be and therefore it's hard to praise it as much as possible. It's hard to look past what it could have been and just appreciate it for what it is.What it is, is an intriguing and slightly pedestrian political thriller elevated by a superb cast of some of today's best talent. The plot is very Shakespearean in presenting us with this young and desired protagonist who is pulled in different directions and traverses the waters while trying to keep his morals in tact in a world where the morally unjust reign supreme. Where even the whitest knight can have a dark secret. Those secrets and tugs of war are played out by a great supporting cast who all do do fine work, with director Clooney bringing in talents like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti (along with the director himself) who are as consistent as ever and each have their one big, great scene that they knock out of the park.In taking on that lead role I don't think there could be a better choice right now than Ryan Gosling, hot on his ticket in Hollywood and with audiences. Gosling has a natural charm and gravitas that is key to making this role work and even when he's doing some questionable things he always manages to intrigue and never lost me as an audience. He's been one of my favorite young actors for years now and I was admittedly slightly disappointed by his slightly empty work in Drive and his straight-up bad performance in Crazy, Stupid, Love, this is a film that helps me remember why I'm such a fan of his. It's not one of his best performances, because I don't think the writing ever lets him get there, but it is a very good one.In the end, I do think it is the script by George Clooney, Grant Heslow and Beau Willimon (adapted from Willimon's play Farragut North) that holds this film back from being the all-out masterpiece that it could have been. There is so much potential here and in laying out the plot points it should have been this dark and dirty in-the-trenches political work but when you see it play out on screen it just never really feels like it gets as resonant as it should. These very intense things are happening and while the film does hit every mark, it never got dark enough. And when it comes down to it, the only things I can think to blame it on are the writing or Clooney as a director himself.This is a film that is technically perfect and it does everything right, but it never does anything great. It never hits that mark that knocks you over or truly ropes you in the way that it should. I couldn't help but feel like if someone along the line of Aaron Sorkin had gotten a hold of the script it would have soared to it's fullest potential. I think that Clooney should stick to being in front of the camera because he has great ideas and when it comes to his acting he is tremendous more often than not, but I think as a director he's just a little too pedestrian. I think it holds this film back from being one of the best of the year, because it has everything going for it and it never does anything wrong...it just doesn't do anything phenomenal.</fullReview>

The story was so predictable and seemed Clooney was indulging himself. This was such a shallow telling of a potentially good story. And with such a good cast!

		<fullReview>"Beware the Ides of March" ? words of warning from the soothsayer to Julies Caesar. No one is assassinated in the latest George Clooney film, but the Ides of March is the day of reckoning for the democratic presidential hopefuls as the Ohio primary falls on the Ides and the winner of this hotly contested election will receive the nomination for the presidential race.Stephen Myers (Ryan Gosling) is an idealistic young media consultant on Mike Morris' (George Clooney) campaign for the democratic nomination for president of the United States. Although young, Steve is the best of the best and with him running the media campaign you are almost assured of a win. Steve's boss, Paul Zara (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is the campaign manager and is also the best. Mike Morris should be well in the lead, but there is trouble afoot with garnering the endorsement of a key senator (Jeffrey Wright). The endorsement of Senator Thompson is the key and will put Mike Morris over the top.During the campaign Mike Morris speaks vehemently of honesty and integrity. These characteristics are what excites Steve and his idealistic view of Mike Morris drives him to produce the best product to insure Mike's nomination.Morris' rival has an outstanding campaign manager as well, Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti). Tom meets with Steve to try to lure him to his campaign. Steve passes on the offer and confides in Paul he met with Duffy and what was said.During this campaign drama, a young intern, Molly (Evan Rachel Wood) who happens to be the daughter of the current Democratic National Committee Chairperson, comes on to Steve and they begin to have a sexual relationship. It is during one of their encounters that Steve learns some unsavory news about his candidate.On top of this, Paul fires Steve due to his lack of loyalty as loyalty is the one and only virtue that Paul holds to the highest of standards.This movie is well done and Ryan Gosling does a good job at playing the idealist who comes to the realization that politics and the quest for power somehow corrupt those individuals who put on such a good show. His faith in humankind is shaken and he must wage the internal battle of his right and wrong.I recommend this movie ? no academy awards will be given for this one ? but some of our finest performers are on the screen and make the movie interesting and at times thought provoking. A good release date on this one as we are just entering the real campaign season for 2012.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the Plot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe a movie with George Clooney and Ryan Gosling et al could be a flop, but Ides of March manages to pull off this unexpected feat. I was anticipating--and hoping for--an intelligent, engrossing story. Instead I got an utterly boring movie about nothing. What was the point?! What was the climax? Yes, it's well-acted. Yes, some scenes are incredibly well-done and full of emotion. But I repeat--where is the story? In place of a plot, we get nonsensical, unrealistic choices made by characters with whom we develop no connection. For example why does a well-known, well-paid political consultant need to steal $900 from the campaign's petty cash? On a bad day he probably has that much in his wallet!Michael Clayton, Titanic, Gladiator, After the Wedding, and Win Win are all my idea of good flicks. If you have similar taste, then perhaps you'll take my advice and avoid spending your hard-earned money on this attractive but empty offering. Beware the Ides of March.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horribly Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first movie in years that both my wife and I felt like leaving after the first 30 minutes. I found absolutely nothing interesting about this film except for the excellent acting and decent videography. The storyline was dull with no particular plot.The whole film seemed to be filled during overcast days which made the slow, predictable story even more painful to get through.I kept waiting for something interesting to happen but nothing ever did. The whole story seemed pointless. Each character droned on about nothing. About half way through we were teased with a potentially interesting story but that fizzled out as well.Clooney obviously has lots of clout to get this into theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An actors showcase, but ultimately not for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an actors showcase, well crafted intelligent filmmaking in a thought provoking drama, that was just not for me. It's a slow burn of a movie with the story following an idealistic campaign press secretary (Ryan Gosling) who works to help a politician (George Clooney) become the democratic presidential nominee, however a scandal causes him to rethink his loyalties.Dialogue heavy, ultimately this was dry and boring as hell. It took me several attempts to get through this and I only stuck with it at all because I kept expecting it to get better at some point due to the stellar cast attached and the fact that Clooney directed. In the end even with a couple of clever twists I was left disappointed. 11.13</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clooney Is An Excellent Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney is fast becoming a great director. Following on from the unappreciated Leatherheads, which I enjoyed. Comes this political thriller, and boy does Clooney nail it!Plot In A Paragraph: Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is a young idealist who's brilliant at communications, he is second in command of Governor Mike Morris's (George Clooney) presidential campaign, and is a true believer. In the middle of the Ohio primary, the campaign manager of Morris's opponent asks Meyers to meet; he offers him a job. Also a young intern, Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood) gets Stephen's attention.Whilst this movie does not have a great deal of rewatchability, as I may never feel the urge to watch it again. It is utterly engrossing with brilliantly compelling performances from Gosling, Clooney Seymour Hoffman and Wood. Marisa Tomei offer solid support too. Clooney certainly knows how to make a movie with plenty of atmosphere, as you can literally feel the tension as you are watching the story unfold</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller with a Punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though promo material says "pulse-racing thriller," I didn't believe it and sat down to watch a potentially interesting political drama. I enjoyed the twists and turns that happened as the tension mounted, and just when I thought the movie would end on a down note as an okay morality tale about corruption in politics, I was jolted out of my seat. It was just at that moment that I remembered what "Ides of March" connotes. OMG. I've been waiting for a thriller like this! One that keeps your interest until the very last frame and then, bam! Except that in most thrillers there is a question that has to be answered and it doesn't get answered until the end. In this one, you're not even sure what the question is and bam! you get blindsided. Double the fun.I think some of the reviewers who rated this low didn't get the ending. And for those who think it is utterly cynical--I think they didn't get the ending either. Isn't Gosling's character a hero? Decide for yourself.For those who were expecting deep political ideas, or a statement about politics today, no doubt they were disappointed. This is a thriller, but unlike most thrillers where there is one protagonist who confronts danger and comes out on top, this one is all about the motives and decisions of the main players. Every twist is unexpected but makes perfect sense in retrospect. I think I'll watch it again tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films about he politicians background machinery are a well-known and always welcome genre within American cinema. It is indeed strange for me that we don't get as many examples from this as we could, during and after the Bush jr. administration. Anyway Clooney does enjoy doing it. Surprisingly enough, he is a skilled filmmaker, who can this pull this kind of thing out, when he associate his director competent vision with the persona he has been cultivating for so long: the smiley winking guy, who stills Casinos with a cell-phone or gives Nespresso capsules away for the beautiful smile of a woman.The trick here was on the surface to give us a story about how a campaign manager falls for a girl who happened to have slept with the candidate, and how that triggers a whole set of findings that will tell us the huge distant between the openness and liberal thoughts of the "clooney-character" and his real self, as someone "like the others". So sex (which we don't see) as a trigger for a bigger drama, brought to screen by sex which we do see. Gosling's character is our agent on-screen, the guy who knows what we know, and finds out new stuff with us. All this is stripped out of real dramatic intent, the passions are not explored as such, only as cold triggers of a bigger "political" story. After all politics is the game of small men in high positions.Ryan Gosling is the new Brad Pitt, in that he conquers the audience easily through looks and personal sex-appeal, and that allows him to hide some of his shortcomings as a true actor. But, also as Pitt, he can recognize the good stuff, and he has an artistic ambition, which means he is bond to spend his career alternating between the "watch my looks" projects (crazy, stupid, love) and those where he believes he'll come through as a serious actor in serious films (Drive). This film goes in the second type.It could work and he could get through this. But than we have Hoffmann, whom we lost too soon, and who was probably the best actor alive. Nobody understood dialog, or speech for that matter, like he did. Rhythm, intonation, and that almost lost art of understanding that acting for the camera is not so much about how you project externally, as it is about how you reveal your character to yourself. A kind of Brand 2.0, that's what we lost with Hoffman. there are maybe a couple of actors alive who can do it, but none as young as Hoffmann. This film will live on in my memory through one single word that he says, preceded by a pause. While he speaks on the phone with Gosling and the latter lies to him, he gives a short pause moment and answers "ok". And with that we know that he understood he was being lied to and that he didn't want Gosling to know it. The editing helps a great deal here as well.My opinion: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't get to the real dirty heart of politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the U.S. at the moment, there's a bizarre story unfolding that follows on from the 2012 Republican party primary campaign, in which a campaign manager for one candidate took money from another campaign in exchange for publicly announcing he was defecting on principal. And we all know the stories of Bill Clinton and the intern. Politics, it seems, is often a dirty business; but 'The Ides of March', Geroge Clooney's take on these themes, is ultimately unenlightening. Yes, it tells a story that verges on plausible; but there are two problems. Firstly, plausible or not, it feels manufactured, the characters aren't drawn deeply enough to make one feel that their responses to events are anything except what the scriptwriter needs to keep driving the plot, which overall has a by-the-numbers feel. And secondly, what is really missing is the sense in which its the nature of the political campaign in itself, rather than the fatal flaws of its personnel, that really bring politics down. Watch 'Bob Roberts', for a hilarious but worrying take about the influence of money in politics; or 'The Candidate', which might date from 1969 but still seems as pertinent together, and you'll get a better sense of why whoever you vote for, nothing seems to change. And it's nothing to do with the sort of tale of personal revenge that you'll see in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ides of March is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.I certainly enjoyed this movie,but I will admit,with it's very impressive cast and story matter I was expecting a bit more,my main problem is that it was just too short,it was only one hour and forty minutes but it easily could have been two and a half hours,I would really have liked to see George Clooney and Ryan Goslings characters develop a lot more,as well as Paul Giamatti and Phillip Seymour Hoffman's characters,it all felt a bit too rushed.The films script is very impressive and is a clever take on presidential elections,George Clooney hasn't directed that many movies but he has proved that he really can direct,he takes a step back in this as a supporting actor and lets Ryan Gosling be the star.Political and dramatic but definitely could have been longer,the Ides of March is an enjoyable movie that I would still recommend to anyone looking for a good drama film. As the campaign to choose Democratic presidential candidate ensues,an enthusiastic young staffer learns a harsh lesson about politics. Best Performance: Ryan Gosling</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It isn't the West Wing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was keen on watching this because I read a magazine review which mentioned the West Wing, one of my absolute favourite shows. The movie has the political credibility nailed but is not in the same league as Aaron Sorkin's slick drama. I was interested enough to keep watching because I wanted to know what happens, but I was rather puzzled by the inconclusive ending. George Clooney's politician running for presidential nomination is believable, and Ryan Gosling as his aide appears to be a moral person who maybe becomes corrupted, but the story involving the intern Molly was not completely clear to me. There were too many questions unanswered. It presents a believable view of the dirty tricks in political campaigns, but there was a lot of swearing and the dark side was winning. It is not the West Wing in any way, it's a political drama and a fairly confusing one at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding! A gross indictment of our times...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The picture blows the lid on the filthy, gutter world of politics. It shows--warts and all--just how spineless, amoral, and opportunistic EVERYONE in that line of work is.The story itself is quite engaging for anyone with even a passing interest in U.S. politics. It is dramatized well, and the characters are also portrayed adequately. There is not much character depth (hence not a perfect 10 score), but any such development would arguably have been unnecessary anyway to convey the message.And therein lies the real forte of this picture: the message. Politicians and their apparatchiks are no longer in it out of any great conviction, let alone a genuine desire to Make a Difference(TM). All they are after in power and position. That end invariably justifies the means. There is no limit to the skulduggery, legerdemain, backstabbing and betrayal, lying, conniving, deceiving, coaxing, cajoling, misrepresenting, etc. they will engage in so long as they attain that goal: the office they are running for.That explains why the modern Western world of politics is so frustrating. Did you ever feel that it is irrelevant who you vote for; that "they're all the same"? Well, they are. They will say and do anything to get the vote; once in, they are reluctant to do much of note. And why would they, when they care not about the voters and their needs, but about Number One and ONLY Number One!?! Politicians of old got paid very little, but boy, they had principles. And their impetus was improving the country and the lives of the people living in it. How times have changed.O, tempore! O, mores! That subtext--running throughout the movie--is far and away its greatest strength. May it open the eyes of its viewers...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A glimpse behind politicians' smiles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Politicians are getting a hard time these days. Good. They deserve it. And if you watch the Ides of March, you'll only agree yet further.Some stories have distinctive plots, others have great character arcs. The Ides of March doesn't really do much of this. It simply is what it is. And what it is is an insight into what goes on behind the slogans, the smiles and the carefully choreographed rallies we're getting so used to seeing in times of elections. Of course this film is based on the American system of government, but do we really think our politicians are any the less noble? We wish.It's kind of like The Thick of It and its filmic cousin In the Loop, only without the humour and constant shouting of Malcolm Tucker.The Ides of March is slimy, despicable, depressing and, worst of all, probably completely true.If you have finally accepted that we're ruled by a bunch of lying, cheating, back-stabbing, two-faced men and women with nicer teeth than us, then you'll probably appreciate what the Ides of March is trying to say.It leaves me with a strong urge to buy a Guy Fawks mask and some Catherine Wheels and head over to Westminster with a naked flame.(MI5, if you're reading that last paragraph - it was a joke)http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ironic inside view of a fictional presidential run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ides of March may not be among one of the greatest films about politics ever, but certainly is up there with the most controversial ones. It's inside view of the presidential run.is sharp, fresh - and even if mostly inaccurate - it has a point, a daring and thought- provoking one, that maybe or not be dismissed. It depends of the viewer. Well, talking about the story now. It tells the story of a young man that enters in the world of politicians with apparently solid and idealist ambitions, but soon he realizes that 'The system' don't works in the way he expected to. The character development was well-made, so I could follow properly the film's intentions. Also thought Gosling's acting style fitted perfectly in the role, being said he's not an actor with a good range, but he oddly fitted on this film.And what is most interesting about Ides of March is it's capacity of talking about so many things in a short and efficient way. It talks about the shallowness, the corruption and internal conflicts without any fillers. Also talks about how people can do things that are even against their believes to win.And while the 'Molly' story delay a bit the film's initial quick pace, it it later seems to be the most important part in the film and also where it's strongest 'critique' is.I personally love the cast. Ryan Gosling has a style that I appreciate, George Clooney is consistent, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti, two great actors with great range and are(was, in PSH's case) exceptional in supporting roles...And while they aren't that great in Ides of Match, I still appreciate their presence, because they definitely add something special to the film.I definitely recommend this film, a well-made, entertaining and sharp insight of the 'politics' world in a presidential run. 7.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprise -- politics is a dirty business! It's not that personal feelings have no place in the arena. You can have love, jealousy, ambition, affability, pride, determination, loyalty, and all the rest. The thing is that they're all subordinate to winning.Take Ryan Gosling, a lower-echelon advance man for Democratic Governor George Clooney, running in a close race for president in the Ohio primaries. Clooney is self-possessed, serene, even in the middle of political turmoil, the little brass wheels and escapements inside his brain always ticking away, crunching numbers, scheming, assessing people, getting the lay of the land.Everybody's brain seems to work in a similar way in this movie. Talk about "Hardball"! The senior campaign manager is Philip Seymour Hoffman (R.I.P.) in another marvelous performance. He'll be missed for sure because he was a plump, middle-aged, man with a face that had the magnetic appeal of a soft-boiled egg, and nothing else except talent.Gosling, on the other hand, has a face with sharp features and an acting style of his own, that usually suggest a cocksure awareness of his own superiority. Here he's more subdued and more effective. Evan Rachel Wood has filled out and is frankly nearly perfect in profile, and she can act professionally. Now that she's grown up, I thought for a moment I was watching Laura Linney.I'm not getting very far into the narrative because it gets complicated. Everyone seems to commit a sin of one kind or another but when you're found out, you don't get absolution, you get fired. The entire dynamic is not theological but Darwinian.It was directed by Clooney. I didn't realize it because I'd missed the opening credits. But every once in a while there would be a scene or a particular shot that was compelling without being explicit, leading me to think that whoever directed it was placing a lot of trust in the audience. Well, as an example, Governor Clooney has been blackmailed into firing his old friend and loyal campaign manager, Hoffman. We see Hoffman getting his hair cut, then he steps outside into the Cincinnati winter, the window of a nearby car rolls down, and Clooney says, "Got a minute?" The camera stays on the parked car from across the street for about a full minute. Then Hoffman steps out, his head lowered, and lights a cigarette while the car drives away at a funereal pace. Not a word is heard. Nothing NEEDS to be heard because adults already know what's being said.I would guess that about 20% of the audience will find this movie revolting because it deals with Democrats, some of whom are idealistic and genuine. Clooney says all the right things in his speeches. None of these phony baloney platitudes about marching into the dawn of a new freedom blessed by American exceptionalism and national honor, bringing enlightenment to the darker regions of the earth. (What does that mean?) Nope. And who do we see on news broadcasts? Chris Matthews, Rachel Maddow, and Charlie Rose.It paints a tougher picture of politics than we're used to seeing. There is no Willie Stark, no evil caricature of a corrupt politician. Everybody knows the rules of the game and it's perfectly okay to steal second base. I thought it was pretty well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ides of March: George Clooney's directing again and he has done a heck of a job this time around. Ides of March fires on all cylinders using its directing, class A talented cast, and a creative screenplay to make a compelling movie. The cast is stuffed with superlative actors, Ryan Gosling at the helm producing fantastic work. Gosling stretches the character's skin over his on flesh in a performance that grows, starting with a portrayal filled with nuances, then evolving to one filled with intensity. All the other actors work using their greatest strengths. Hoffman knows how to play an asshole, Giamatti knows how to play a snake in the grass, and Clooney knows how to play a "personality" character. The dialogue is the clothesline the film swings on the first half, then Ides of March broadens with political controversies, moral confusion, and scope in the last half. The Ides of March tells us that success is built on integrity and loyalty, but what it shows us is that you win by playing outside the box. Finely directed by Clooney, The Ides of March is an biting film filled with malevolent, dirty dealings of politics.Rating: 8/10Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Gosling's best, but a strong Clooney effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Idealistic young political consultant Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is part of the campaign trail for the new presidential candidate (George Clooney). All about needing to believe in what he does, Meyers is thrown into the dirty side of the politics after a scandal. He can either stick to his moral guns, or embrace that other side.As a director, George Clooney has been a bit hit and miss. His films are above average and watchable; you can add The Ides Of March to that list. He shows great aptitude behind the camera but the movie overall isn't anything special.The biggest reason, I think, is Ryan Gosling. Brilliant actor, and I've loved him in everything I've seen. For whatever reason, though, him shouldering this movie never feels quite right. You'd think he would thrive with so much top-class talent around him but, while he's not inferior, he doesn't quite cut it. As you'd expect, Hoffman, Giamatti and Clooney are great. Clooney is criminally underutilised, especially since he's involved in Gosling's best scenes. I really like Marisa Tomei's character too, and would have loved to seen more of her.What is good about the movie is the interplay between the actors, and it's this that drives the movie forward. Thankfully, it's not overly political; it's a character study about the power between men ? it just happens to be in a political setting. Take out Gosling, and everyone else has a great chemistry. They're helped by a very strong script, which probably made life easier for the director too.The Ides Of March is a good film, with a fantastic cast. You're not gonna be mesmerised by anything you see, but it is fun to see Clooney having another good crack at direction. He will get better, but it's been slow progress so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because if there were such a thing...the award should have gone to The Ides of March. Starring three Academy Award winning performers George Clooney, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Marissa Tomei as well as two other Oscar nominees, Ryan Gosling and Paul Giamatti, collectively, the cast is flawless. George Clooney has become sort of a master of ensembles, no doubt rooted in his experience on ER. Every part is absolutely essential and shines in its' own right. He did it exceptionally well on Good Night and Good Luck which to date remains his best movie as a director, but this one does come in too a close second, a warning on the crookedness of politics. I left this movie convinced that one could lose their own soul in politics before Hollywood. Ryan Gosling plays the idealist who learns that to stay in politics, you have to get dirty and sell your soul doing so. George Clooney takes the supporting role as the seemingly quintessential presidential candidate, who, like so many politicians today, has some skeletons in the closet in which he will stop at nothing to keep there. Kind of the darker, more cynical version to Mike Nichols' more light-hearted Primary Colors. Every top performer does very well which should prompt the Academy to create a Best Ensemble Oscar and award it to the one who casted the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is a principle worth the sacrifice of the greater good? What if the agent of that change is not who you thought they were? Questions regularly posed in politically-themed dramatic efforts and so posed in this latest offering from long-time Hollywood favorite George Clooney and the recent favorite of movie-goers Ryan Gosling.Stephen Meyers (played by Gosling) is a veteran of numerous political campaigns and a revered media maestro. He's in a bitter contest seeking the Democratic Party nomination for his candidate. That being Mike Morris, the governor of Pennsylvania (played by George Clooney). Because of peculiar voting rules, his is most likely going to be defeated by Republican voters who are voting in their opponents' primary in hopes of seeing a weaker candidate that they could trounce in a general election. With another upcoming primary that, if won, could clinch the nomination. To win the latter contest, however, they would need to strike the kind of deal that the candidate refuses to make on moral grounds. All this is merely the foreground while the background is replete with backstabbing and illicit affairs.I am not one of those who only recently heard of Gosling thanks to much- lauded efforts such as Blue Valentine, Drive, and Crazy, Stupid, Love. I have known of him since the independent 2001 film The Believer. And he is true-to-form here as a man who's greatest weakness is his faith in his leaders and purpose. Everyone, Clooney, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, are doing superior jobs in compelling roles. That said, my tastes run more toward films that show American politics closer to what we wish it was, not what it actually is. Dave, The American President, and The Contender to name three.

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Political Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director-star George Clooney's The Ides of March is the perfect film to mirror our time, when the approval rating of the United States Congress is at an all-time low and the divisions between the two major parties and their constituents are wider than ever.This political drama is an adaptation of Willimon's play entitled, Farragut North. It stars Clooney together with Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman,Paul Giamatti,Marisa Tomei,Jeffrey Wright and Evan Rachel Wood.The screenplay written by Clooney, along with Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon.Ambition seduces and power corrupts in a nerve-wracking thriller.Idealistic campaign worker Stephen Meyers has sworn to give all for Governor Mike Morris, a wild card presidential candidate whose groundbreaking ideas could change the political landscape. However, a brutal Ohio primary threatens to test Morris's integrity. Stephen gets trapped in the down-and-dirty battle and finds himself caught up in a scandal where the only path to survival is to play both sides.This is intelligent film making, and a provocative moral fable. It may not be perfect, but it stands as one of the better, most realistic movies about the way we elect our leaders.Right-wingers won't like the fact that the lead character is a central politician that happens to be a liberal Democrat that advocates raising taxes on the rich, supports a woman's right to choose, and may be an atheist. But the Left-wingers won't be thrilled by the notion that even among the most seemingly high- minded, the desire for victory and the behind-the-scenes maneuvering and compromises made to achieve it easily trump quaint notions like loyalty and integrity, and secrets are like bullets to be fired at close range, where they can do the most damage.Indeed,the viewer may find it a reflection of most politicians today who are more concerned about their self-interest rather than their constituents or the people they serve. If the film had been able to get off the ground earlier, this probably would have been a great film. However, with its excellent performances, well-written screenplay, and engaging story, it's still a very good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "The Ides of March", Ryan Gosling plays a campaign manager for George Clooney's idealistic governor-turned-presidential candidate. But a meeting with a rival campaign manager (Paul Giamatti) combined with a relationship with a young intern (Evan Rachel Wood) leads to a potentially explosive situation. The movie is based on Beau Willimon's play "Farragut North", about Willimon's experience in Howard Dean's 2004 campaign. I haven't seen the play, so I can't comment on how well the movie follows it. However, Clooney's speeches in the movie are clear allusions to a lot of the political debate in the past few years. One might criticize that Clooney's character is shown to be so idealistic, but I would say that it's making the point that even the most idealistic individuals might have their less than stellar sides. Of course, practically no character in the movie can truly be called an upstanding individual, although it's easiest to sympathize with Wood's character. Philip Seymour Hoffman's character made me feel as if I was walking on eggshells.I didn't find the movie to be a masterpiece, but I think that it makes a good point about whether or not Americans as a people truly understand their politicians, and by extension their political system. Worth seeing. Also starring Marisa Tomei and Jeffrey Wright.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliantly pieced movie, start to finish. Ides of March touches on the nature of work a politician has to engage in and attempts to give perspective on the popular paradigms which labels that environment. Clooney is able to portray his character's thoughts and feelings through their dialog, allowing the viewer to empathize with all characters and experience their dilemmas. In essence, this is where the movie wins its appeal. Politics is boiled down to choices, dilemmas and trade-offs and Clooney allows his viewer to experience the angst and internal moral turmoil that comes with that. It is this way that we are given an interesting perspective of what it means to be a politician, and the title wonderfully draws on Caesar's assassination to suggest it was probably always 'that way'. Ides of March is Clooney's depiction of what 'that way' is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark, unsettling, gripping drama, more relevant than we want to admit ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ides of March" is not only a cynical and dark gripping political drama, but also a cheap and effective political IQ test. Anyone who is convinced that the movie somehow either promotes liberal values or exposes their fallacies does not make a cut as a thoughtful voter and can be easily deceived by the cunning politicians on both sides.These people also fail to see the true beauty of "The Ides of March": despite being on the surface about Democratic primaries, the movie reflects the universal, eternal struggle that was, is, and will be applicable to pretty much any party in any society, even including the societies that do not hold free elections whatsoever. No elections does not mean no politics.The insignificant details of course might be different, but the core, the tangled web of moral choices, ethical dilemmas and philosophical questions like "Does the end justify the means?" or "When to draw a line in the sand?" is always the same.While "The Ides of March" very wisely does not give any ready answers to the uncomfortable and unfathomable questions of life, the overall atmosphere it creates is quite dark, pessimistic and believable at the same time.The movie cleverly shows the corruption of the soul, the spiritual darkness that gradually overtake almost anyone involved in politics in any capacity ? from intern, to political reporter, to speechwriter, to campaign manager, to congressman, to senator, to presidential candidate.It all starts with na?ve idealism and ends up with pragmatic cynicism. It starts with reluctant dirty lies for the sake of noble goals and ends with eager dirty lies simply for the sake of winning. It all starts with having certain set of moral principles and ethical boundaries and ends up with releasing the ownership of the principles, crashing the boundaries and embracing the universal "gray area" where pretty much anything is possible, acceptable, and justifiable, depending on the situation.While such a transformation might lead to a momentary success, it comes at a steep price: something immensely more important, something of eternal value gets lost in the process. "The Ides of March" makes a compelling case that agonizing spiritual death is a very real danger for anyone who seriously plays politics.While an actor in the political theatre is desperately trying to win the audience, the boundaries between his acting script and his real personality inevitably begin to blur. Professionally practicing the Orwellian double thinking and double speaking is a bad habit, a dangerous business, quite damaging to the human's delicate psyches.If you were not sure, whether the smart and thought-provoking Oscar- nominated screenplay of "The Ides of March" (based on the award-winning Beau Willimon's play Farragut North) is good enough, I hope that my lengthy introduction above has cleared most of your doubts.In addition, the movie is very well directed by George Clooney who has definitely gone a long way from being just another cute "ER" character, to earning the well-deserved reputation as one of the best actors of his generation and as a talented and promising director as well.Nevertheless, even with the Oscar-nominated screenplay and strong directing, it is the acting that sets "The Ides of March" apart. Ryan Gosling gives a fine, nuanced, convincing performance as Stephen Meyers ? the idealistic junior campaign manager for a Democratic presidential candidate and yet he is not a true star of the movie. The truly fantastic trio that occupies that honorable place are Philip Seymour Hoffman as Paul Zara - senior campaign manager and Stephen's boss, George Clooney as Mike Morris, presidential candidate for whom both Paul and Steven work, and Paul Giamatti ? senior campaign manager for the rival presidential candidate.I highly recommend watching the movie twice. Having learned all the intricacies of the plot at the first viewing, you would be able to better appreciate all the little acting miracles that the "grand trio" performs ? looks, gestures, emotions hidden, emotions revealed.The rest of the cast in "The Ides of March" is very good as well. I liked how Marisa Tomei played Ida ? a nice and sweet on the surface political reporter who just happens to be an expert in cunningly worming her way into her victim's confidence and does not stop at anything, including blackmailing in her endless chase for sensational stories. Evan Rachel Wood was believable as Molly Stearns ? a twenty-year-old intern who in her young age has been already touched by the powerful decay constantly emitted by the unhealthy surroundings of the political campaign he works for.Not to forget Jeffrey Wright, who was excellent in a small role of North Carolina Democratic Senator Franklin Thompson, a politician with the two very different sides. On the outside, Franklin Thompson is an energetic respectable senator, but on the inside, he is a seasoned and weary cynical prostitute, desperately trying to find the most generous buyer for his semi fresh, but still useful political goods.One thing that I did not appreciate about the movie was its pervasive language that for sure could have been easily avoided without losing authenticity. On the other hand, however, the ugly profanity seemed to be in an odd harmony with the ugly inner worlds of the movie characters.In conclusion, "The Ides of March" is not only a good movie but also a valuable lesson for all of us. It is not about mere politics, it is about life. The last thing that I want is to leave you with the impression that I look down on politicians and consider non-politicians like myself superior in any respect.The hard truth is that dirty secrets, lies, intrigues, hypocrisy and power games are wide spread in our society. No person is immune and no social institute is exempt, whether it is school, or work, or church, or even your own family.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>" Ides of March", thoughtful and provoking movie directed by George Clooney, leaves a bitter taste. This is not a propaganda piece promoting the so-called, and by the tea party hacks eternally abhorred, liberal agenda. Far away from it. The real and ever so serious problem is a deeply flawed and corrupt system, very often taunted by the ruling elites as the" best in the world". So, it could be a Republican or a Democrat, and it really doesn't matter that much. It's a marvelously produced TV reality show, filled with people desperate for attention and a bit of money that goes with it. From Jerry Springer to presidential election. More polish, better haircuts, proper English, few more teeth, but not that much different. Same lack of shame and shortage of dignity and abundance of cheap thrills and even cheaper futures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smart intelligent political thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clooney continues to tread a different path, here directing, co-writing and starring in another film that multiplex audiences may largely ignore, due to it's political themed story.Governor Mike Morris (Clooney) is engaged in a ferocious run off battle with his rival to seal the Democratic nomination. Next stop the presidency, as the Republican candidate is considered a "dead duck".Running the campaign for Morris is Paul (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), ably assisted by his press spin doctor Stephen (Ryan Gosling). A person who can manipulate the press pool without them even realising they are being managed.Morris is affable, telegenic and according to Stephen, the "real deal". Paul just wants a win to add to his already impressive career, his ideals have long ago been crushed and packed away.On the opposing side is Tom (Paul Giamatti). Both campaign managers are desperately struggling to obtain the endorsement of Senator Thompson (Jeffrey Wright), a boost that would take them past the delegates required winning post. Of course nothing in politics is free, such endorsement comes with strings attached.The inner workings of a campaign are shown slickly and believably, with Ida Horowicz (Marisa Tomei) a print journalist, hovering like a circling vulture alert for any misstep or scandal. Stephen skillfully keeps her at arms length, a mutual distrust exists between them, which suits both until events transpire to alter the balance of power.Most of the audience for such a film will appreciate and not be surprised at the level of cynicism on offer. Politics is the dirtiest of businesses, integrity and beliefs ready to be traded as and when required, to achieve the only desired result, winning and subsequent power.To what lengths will candidates go to win, every and any would be the message carried through the film. It would be foolish to bet that real life is any different.Clooney is strong, his character is both believable and delicately played. As you would expect Giamatti and Seymour-Hoffman are as solid and dependable as ever. Gosling continues to impress with yet another solid performance, more than holding his own with the talent on display.Molly (Evan Rachel Wood) as a new intern, certainly makes an impression, catching Stephens eye and firmly placing herself at the centre of the storm as the story unfolds.Clooney is dealing here in a very murky world where there are infinite shades of grey. There is no right or wrong, just choices to be made. Bearing in mind he is the star and director, it is rare to see the central performance being handed to a supporting role, Gosling who does not disappoint.The ending has a rather satisfying ambivalence, that may intrigue or frustrate viewers in equal measure.There is no real action on display, this is not that type of film but the story does break free from it's stage-bound background, just enough to open up the story. Goslings character is perhaps a little young and in his characters position, one might assume any idealism would have been snuffed out long ago.The content will no doubt limit it's appeal, there is a element of preaching to the converted. For example, you probably need to be interested enough in the subject matter to want to enjoy the story, therefore the cynicism on display should come as no surprise.Based on the play "Farragut North" by Beau Willimon.Summary A smart intelligent political thriller, with top notch performances, again highlighting the inherent cynicism of modern political campaigns.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How far would you go to succeed?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen is a young, green, charismatic campaign manager. He's somewhat naive in that he believes completely in his candidate and the political process. He doesn't get involved in dirty campaign tactics. So much so he adamantly refuses to give a congressman a high position in his candidate's cabinet in exchange for an endorsement his campaign desperately needs. This proves sufficient for a while, but eventually his inexperience with the political game costs him. Soon he finds out that his candidate isn't as clean cut as he appeared. And then he has a decision to make; he can do the right thing or he can put the campaign first and cover it up.Of course, he makes the wrong decision and it's all downhill from there as innocence is lost and a chain of events begins to unfurl leading to him being booted from the campaign. He's now lost the very thing he loves. Again he has a decision to make, walk away or do whatever it takes to get back in. Again, he makes the wrong decision and uses his knowledge of the candidate against him in a series of power plays to get his job back and guarantee his candidate the win. Ironically, he achieves the very success he sought out for in the beginning, but can't enjoy it because of what he's become. It's a cautionary tale of what people are willing to do to make it in life, at any and all costs. It really makes you wander about the stuff that goes on behind the scenes in political campaigns, behind all the things you see on TV. Especially when someone gets an endorsement. What exactly do they gain for this? When and how much money will exchange hands?I thought there was a particularly great scene in the early part of the film that perfectly conveyed the deception of politics. In one frame you get the candidate; practically lying in front of the public in a town hall with buzz words and the typical jargon you'd come to expect to appease potential voters. In the other frame you see the dark stage behind the American flag in that very town hall where all the trickery, dealing and backstabbing takes place to facilitate what's happening on the other side. Loved this scene and thought it was great symbolism. I thought this was a great film with great acting across the board. I really like Evan Rachelle Wood in this, probably the best performance she's had in my opinion. Clooney is as good as you'd usually expect. I've said this before and I'll say it again; Ryan Gosling is officially a movie star. His performances in this role, Drive and Crazy Stupid Love can't be denied now. And I thought he was pretty good here, but not strong enough where I think he had a good shot at the Oscar.Make sure to catch this one. Easily one of the 10 best films of 2011. A must see. www.themoviesnob.ca@the_movie_snob</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney is a good actor, and he's becoming a formidable director. This movie is fine, but I was expecting some more. Great dialogues, thrilling scenario, excellent cast. Everything is fine. But I didn't enjoy the film as much as I was expecting. I just can't find what's going wrong in it. The story isn't that surprising. Anyway, it's very entertaining, and for once, it doesn't last forever, only 95 minutes. And it's rolling well. Maybe it's just because we, I mean spectators of my age (49), are used to 3 hours movie on politics. With an international side story. Here, we just have people who are trying to save their butt. Maybe that's where is my deception is coming from. It's not a movie about a political candidate, but a thriller based on a personal default.</fullReview>

I have to say I was extremely surprised in a very good way. This is a very good story with very good actors giving very good acting performances. I have to admit I/m a fan of Gearge Clooney's acting, but not his politics - so you can imagine I was more than a little dubious about this being a Clooney movie about the political machine. But all I want to say is do yourself a favor and watch this movie. It is dynamite - a definite 9 out of 10...Enjoy...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ides of March (2011) - Vote for Clooney! Vote for Gosling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written, directed by, and starring George Clooney, "The Ides of March" is a political drama 'slash' thriller, adapted from the original stage play by co-writer Beau Willimon. With an incredible cast ensemble, a perfectly challenged direction, and a terrific well-written script, "The Ides of March" is a solid, thrilling, and enjoyable motion picture from start to finish. With his second movie released in 2011, Ryan Gosling plays Stephen Meyers, a Junior Campaign Manager for Pennsylvania governor 'slash' presidential candidate Mike Morris, portrayed by George Clooney. He begins to make the campaign go at a fresh start, and he's so sure that Morris can show the whole country how good he really is. But when Stephen falls into a dirty crash in the campaign, serious consequences start to occur, and Stephen must decide whether to stay with his team, or join the other. Before watching, I thought this was just going to be an ordinary presidential campaign movie with limited potential, but was I wrong indeed. I was on the edge of my seat from the opening scenes to the end credits, and I was left thinking how awesome it was. I was astounded on how everything just came out at me in a flash. "The Ides of March" fires on all cylinders, indeed! Every member of the cast is just pure perfection. Besides Gosling's terrific work and Clooney's brilliant work, the incredible cast also includes Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Marisa Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood, Max Minghella, and Jeffrey Wright. They all created perfectly challenged characters, and they disappeared into the roles they played. Even as an actor, George Clooney is also a fine director as well. He makes a perfect arrangement of storyline, character development, and all the thrills and chills. Included with an array of fine music, dialouge, and characters, "The Ides of March" is one of the more better films of the previous year. When the movie brings that unexpected climax on screen, it puts a wrap on a completely enjoyable motion picture. The acting is solid, the script is terrific, the directing is top-notch, and the thrills were just jaw-dropping. This is one of the most entertaining films of any other year. "The Ides of March", in my review, "a beautifully well-made political thriller".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ides of March is a smart movie that builds the storyline little by little, step by step, sucking you in until you find yourself by surprise in the middle of a highly intriguing plot, just like the main character does. Among many other virtues, what I liked the most was the unpredictable events and twists the story has throughout its length. George Clooney really knows how to dispose the pieces of the puzzle and surprise the audience when the whole picture finally starts to come together. In other words, he really knows how to tell a story maintaining the tension and the interest till the very last second. This is a very good political drama with outstanding performances, thrilling moments and some exquisite shots, that make Clooney stand as the very good director he has become over the years. There's also a clear message in the movie that I enjoyed a lot. Politics aren't for everyone, and this is the movie that shows you what you need to have to live from politics, regardless of who you work for, a politician, the government or a newspaper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Meyer played by Ryan Gosling is working on a campaign for Mike Morris played by George Clooney, to be the next president of the United States. He gets a real wake up call in they way politics works when he talks to a rival Tom Duffy played by Paul Giamatti. The great Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Paul Zara, his boss and Steven admits to his boss that he spoke to the rival. This then leads to a huge mess. The film is directed, written and starring Clooney. Clooney knows how to direct his actors being an actor himself of course. He also collaborated on the screenplay. He also doesn't take the starring role and gives it to Gosling which I think was a good decision. Because Gosling is a young and up and coming actor and the character is a young up and comer as well. Gosling plays the role very well, he is good looking, he really takes on great actors like Clooney and Hoffman in some great one on one scenes. Marisa Tomei also plays a tough reporter trying to screw over Gosling. This is a great political drama and well worth seeing. I enjoyed it and recommend it to fans of political dramas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good, suspenseful political movie from George Clooney. Regards two Democratic candidates for the presidential nomination, on the campaign trail, focusing mostly on winning Ohio. I told my wife it might have been inspired by Bill Clinton, she thought maybe John Edwards. Regardless the political process is portrayed as dirty business, in the end you have to sell your soul for political gain. No room for an idealist. It probably isn't too far from the truth.Ryan Gosling is in every scene as Stephen Meyers, the 30-year-old idealistic and smart political strategist. He is working for the campaign manager for George Clooney as Governor Mike Morris. The chief consultant is Philip Seymour Hoffman as the veteran Paul Zara. The rival camp is headed by Paul Giamatti as Tom Duffy. The reporter that is the constant thorn is Marisa Tomei as Ida Horowicz.Of note the movie has the talents of several of the very best in the industry, and it shows in the fine way the story is presented. Not as veteran, but good also is Evan Rachel Wood as Molly Stearns, an intern with the Morris campaign, and also the 20-year-old daughter of the chairman of the DMC.There are several stories running here, one being the key endorsement of the Ohio senator, which would virtually guarantee national victory, but he wants a cabinet position, Secretary of State, and Morris is unwilling to sell that job for an endorsement. At least at first.SPOILERS: The young intern Molly flirts with Stephen, invites him to meet for drinks, then basically asks for sex. No resistance there. But soon when she gets a call at 2:30AM and he inadvertently answers her phone, when re redials he finds out it is Gov Morris. It turns out he had slept with her also, and when she turns up pregnant looks for help with abortion clinic fees. Molly dies in her room on prescription O.D. and Stephen, who had been fired for unapproved conversations with the enemy, uses the information to blackmail Gov Morris into letting him be the chief consultant, replacing Paul. They bought the senator, were marching on to the presidency, while preaching well and covering up their sins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry but I must suggest that IMDb user reviews are not meant to be serious. Those that are serious get paid for their reviews. Those who get paid for their reviews and still pass them off as IMDb users reviews are (you fill in the blank). But even for a non-serious IMDb user review, this one I am submitting on "The Ides of March" is frivolous. The movie is just so much fun, tragic turn of events notwithstanding.For a start, look at the "intern syndrome" because that is the key plot line that drives events in this movie. Despite the obvious subtleties (oxymoron intended) in avoiding the sinful "p" word and "a" word ("I'm IN TROUBLE with the governor", "I can't go to my father ? we are Catholics"), the movie makers can't hide the fact that this is likely the most-used situation in any melodrama, be it books, plays or movies. And it is difficult to suppress a chuckle when you see that if the protagonist had followed the style of THE intern, i.e. the Lewinsky style, the problem would never have occurred and the tragedy averted.The other fun thing is the play on the title, in reversing the roles. It may not be apparent at first glance rising bright star Meyers is betraying is mentor Zara. But if you think about it, I'll see that the true betrayal comes from the big boss Morris. But I am ahead of myself so let me back up a little with a brief plot summary.Despite the look of complication, the plot is quite simple: Ohio primary, the generally recognized to be the most accurate indicator of the final results of the presidential election. The contestants: Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney) against a senator who for this movie is mere props. A more important senator, Thompson (Jeffrey Wright), is one wooed by both candidates on account of the power carried with his 200 plus delegates. The most intense battle is really between the two top notch campaign managers, Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti) respectively, the intensity of which something not unlike the shoot out between two fast draws in a good old Western. In the Morris camp, there is another pair with an analogy-inviting relationship, of mentor Zara and protge Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling), not unlike Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. The intern here is Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood). Hovering on the perimeter is Ida Horowicz (Marisa Tomei) who uses Meyers and vice versa. One more character to note is Morris's supportive wife Cindy (Jennifer Ehle). The fun starts with Duffy "talking" to Meyers and takes an exponential leap when the later stumbles across something when having a fling with Stearns. Then it's down the Yellow Brick Road of double, double and more double-cross.While well made, competently directed (Clooney) and definitely entertaining, this movie is a tad melodramatic and say nothing you haven't heard of about dirty politics. The fun is all in the acting. I have in no less than a few times described a cast as a "dream team". Well, this one is a dream team among dream teams.There may appear to be a double-lead billing but there is only one real lead actor: Gosling. He gets billed, rightly, before Clooney who defeated him in the "Drama" class of Golden Globe, not with this movie, but with "The descendant". He is superb in depicting the loss of innocence (dark William Blake undercurrent) of a prodigious young (30) rising star. Oozing embittered desperation, Gosling is as cool as he is in "Drive", but even more chilly. Clooney, to his credit, does not try to outshine Gosling but delivers a solid performance in a character that is, in a way, even more chilling. He is, of course, after all the director and he also has "The descendant" for his Oscar bid. Gosling is not even nominated (unlike for Golden Globe), most unfair.A better pair you cannot find as Hoffman and Giamatti and with these two, I don't think I need say more. Wright has a really small part but the role is quite important, and he is certainly good to see. Wood on the other hand has the third most important role in this movie, ahead of Hoffman and Giamatti. She is probably best remembered as two rebellious daughters, rebellious but mature, more so than the respective fathers in "King of California" (2007) and "The wrestler" (2008). In "Ides of March" she has the most sympathetic (or you can even say ONLY sympathetic) role, which she handles very well. In a reunion of sorts with Wood is Tomie (she won a Best Support Oscar for "The wrestler"), whose role here is regrettably small but eye-catching. Eher may not be a household name but whoever that has seen her in "Possession" (2002) and "The King's speech" (2010) would not be able to forget her. To have her in just one small scene here in as Morris's wife, with her husband in a car, is a pleasure.This movie has the most lamentable waste of acting power from any team of actors ever assembled. Clooney has a tough enough time as director squeezing as much as he can sensibly do in the 100 minutes of this movie. That was good enough to get him a nomination in Golden Globe, but not enough for Oscar, which is not surprising.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not Clooney's first time in the director's chair, and his abilities as a director and an actor are constantly improving. While the film is about the Presidential race, the action centers around Gosling's character, and he seems to segue nicely from his previous romantic comedy - action adventure roles into something a bit more serious. His connection with Evan Rachel Wood is touching and real, something that might happen in the discreet world of politics, and his hypocrisy and elitist attitude is concealed in their affair. Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti are dynamic and powerful as the opposing campaign managers, and Marisa Tomei is the investigative reporter who knows how to twist the arm of her sources. Clooney also wrote the screenplay. An overall powerhouse for Clooney, with solid acting, smooth action, and a surprising twist at the end. Sex and language prevent this from being a family film, but the adults and later teens will be enthralled by the accuracy of the campaign process. Collectible if you like politics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern take on Macchiavelli ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney's "The Ides of March", accomplishes something I didn't expect: to surprise me despite a very formulaic story. It's the very kind of film you expect to dislike just because you see every thing coming, and then it's like the writer, expecting our expectations, tease them, twist them, and serve us at the end a plate we didn't expect to taste. And to the movie viewers who're fond of very clever scripts, "Ides of March" is a delight to savor with the pleasure of a gourmet.Keeping on these appetizing metaphors, let's begin with the film's unique flaw: the 'starters'. I can't count how many times I sighted watching Ryan Gosling as Stephen Meyers, the ambitious and idealistic staffer for the Democrat presidential candidate, the charismatic Governor Mike Morris, played by George ?who else- Clooney? Not to diminish the acting of Gosling, on that department, every member of the cast was top-notch, but I couldn't get over a deja-vu feeling worsened by the entrance of Molly, the young intern. I've always had a problem with Evan Rachel Wood's beauty, so pretty that it kind of distracts me from the story, and instead of following the story, I can only look at her beauty like the eternal plot device that help us to see what a womanizer our hero is. I didn't enjoy his flirty rhapsody, and hoped like the judge watching the lawyer calling a surprise witness, that 'it better goes somewhere'.And yes it went somewhere as Molly was the key of the story, the pivotal fate's intervention that would change forever the life of Stephen, I want to say the professional life, but this is a pleonasm for him, and when a character is so devoted to his job, we know we'll have a fascinating twist to illustrate that the end justifies the means. Why? Because we have an idealistic character in the beginning and the movie should feature a transition, had Stephen been a cynical and morally corrupted staffer, maybe the film would have featured redemption and the learning of the ability to be empathetic, to become loyal. But let's face it, this is not a fellowship, not even a 'Family', Clooney is painting us the sad map of politic dynamics where the marches that lead to power are not necessarily paved with the noblest intentions, let alone actions.There are exactly two schools when it comes to politics: the integrity school and the Machiavelli school. The first one is represented by Philip Seymour Hoffman as Paul Zara, Mike Morris campaign supervisor who, in an unforgettable scene, gives Stephen a moralizing lesson about loyalty, and encourages him to quit the job, because of his unethical behavior. Stephen accepted to meet Tuffy, Paul Giamatti, the staffer for the other Democrat side, in the campaign for Ohio, which is the guarantee of a win. Why did he accept, the film keeps a clever ambiguity in Stephen's intentions by showing the character's main flaw: his pride. Stephen is so confident over his talent that he accepts to meet Tuffy, if only for the pleasure of being flattered. Is Tuffy sincere when he invites Stephen to join his team? Well, if you take the theory of games, you realize that whatever decision Stephen takes, it's a win-win for Tuffy. Because either he takes the best element from Morris or he makes him in a situation so embarrassing he would be forced to resign if someone told the journalists, someone like the very man who gave the lesson about loyalty.It was a win-win for Tuffy, and a lose-lose for Stephen, the kind of situations that undermines one's credibility and career forever. The notion of career is crucial here because all these brilliant minds build a sort of prestige by working for the right candidate and any failure can poison their ascension, Stephen loves his job so much that he can't tolerate this failure, nor the double-humiliation of being rejected by both Tuffy and Zara, the first one manipulated him, the second punished him by denouncing him to a journalist, his so-called friend Ida Horowitz, the journalist, Marisa Tomei. Stephen is in such a dead-end that the only thing making us feel sorry for him is that all the other characters, aren't any better and all their actions serves their job. But it's all about Stephen's move; a masterpiece of Machiavellian scheme, and the third and final act is what makes the film such a great experience.Let's face it, Stephen isn't more ethical than the others, he learned the lesson the hard way, but I guess we root for him for the same reason we rooted for the Corleones in "The Godfather", we follow this character from beginning to end, watching him getting hit so hard, that he seems knocked out at the end, but by an extraordinary talent for bluffing and ability to learn, Stephen starts one of the greatest characters' evolutions ever portrayed on-screen recently, with an extremely satisfying conclusion and a last shot that shows a man having lost every ounce of integrity he believed in, because he knew there was more than his candidate's election at stakes, it was also a game of survival in very deadly environment: politics. There's one subtle moment when Zara wonders what was the weapon he used against Morris to convince him to fire him, Stephens could have said something that Zara would have used against him but his reply doesn't give any clue, Stephen's talent is to never repeat the same mistake.The film is so full of subtleties that we might forgive some displays of cinematic stereotypes and some scenes that doesn't ring very true, and even if we didn't need "The Ides of March" to see how ruthless and cruel a world were politics, enough movies have been made on that matter, as a character study, the film is simply one of the best written of the recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some might not enjoy this movie because they do not understand what and how campaigning works. I, on the other, have done campaigning, so I was intrigued.Steve's character was portrayed very good. He is slick, enterprising, a real con, but was pretty much just in it cause his friend Paul was. This all changes after his co-workers back stab him and Molly dies. Ryan Gosling portrayal of this character and change of character is excellent. So was George Clooney's portrayal of snake-like Morris.I also really enjoyed the production as well. Many parts were very slick and smooth, almost like an old movie. The scene when Molly gets an abortion was presented very intimately sad, just the piano music made me want to cry.This is one of the most well done movies I have ever seen! The acting, the wit, the storytelling, the message, was excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling plays an idealistic staffer who sees the dirty politics involved. As he works for a Pa Democratic Governor, George Clooney who also directs the film. As Clooney who's character is a married man cheats on his wife behind her back. And he is the Pa Governor.Noticed the way that the character's signs of the Presidential race are. As that was also the sign and trademark for Obama. Gosling is forced to downplay the scandal. Before the candidate's opponent and nemesis tries to make it go from bad to worse. As that is where Gosling comes on in at.The great Paul Giamatti is the main head for the opponent. Who wants to dig the dirt on Clooney's private life. In order to spoil Clooney's chances at running for President for the Democrats.Both sides play Machiavellian and try the best to one up one another. With Gosling's character stuck in the middle of it all. It is more about trust and loyalty. As Gosling and a 20-year old interim played by, Evan Rachel Wood is the daughter of the DNC head. Get involved over it all. As it goes downhill from there.Not just on a political basis but on a personal one. About trying to one up one another and get ahead. Which is involved in all political campaigns no matter what party, GOP, Democrat, Independent, etc are. Not the first nor will it be the last time this has been seen. Both in the REEL and REAL world!Really great acting and writing. Despite a lot of cursing in it. Still, you would love a film that plays politics and trying to show loyalty and trust between a candidate. While being caught in the middle of a would be political scandal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Does George Clooney ever sleep? Ont top of starring in The Descendants, he also writes, directs, produces, and stars in The Ides of March. The themes of the dirty workings of the political underworld may not exactly be eye opening, but it's still a pretty fascinating ride. Clooney and his co-writers deliver something really well done, equipped with freshly developed characters, snappy dialogue that may have been guest written by Aaron Sorkin, confidant pacing and structure, and nail biting tension.As for Clooney's direction, he does what is needed of him, and does it well. The slick editing makes the movie just fly by, and his ensemble cast is terrifically assembled. They're essential to the movie's tension, creating massive sparks in their path, certain scenes being where they're so good, NOBODY outshines the other. Evan Rachel Wood is the closest thing to a weak link I can find. She sometimes felt more like a plot device than an actual character, but that's a small complaint to a movie that I thought was great.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ides of March was a perfect political drama with astounding shocks and turns that will leave you deep breathed and feel satisfied with high gripping drama. Steven is a regular guy who helps the Governor to participate in a political campaign for the seat of US president. Through his daily job , he learns the tricks and attributes of politics and soon finds himself washing hands off in the dirty game of politics. He fights back and proves that he is the best man standing up up We all know what a fine actor George Clooney is but there is not even a slightest doubt about his brilliancy in direction. The director of "Good night, good luck" uses same routine of dark political drama with efficient screenplay(again he is credited for this) and towering performances by the lead cast. The story is so tight that you would not feel bored even for a minute. The whole star cast has indeed done justice to their part but its Ryan Gosling who steals the show. The mesmerizing actor is getting better and better with each performance. If you will like him in Drive , you will just love him in this flick. He just performs effortlessly and carries the charm along with him in every frame . Watch his expression when he is sitting in the car completely depressed. Overall , An amazing , intellectual thriller that is sure to keep you entertained. Watch it if you like performance oriented films with tight script.Brilliant ? 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ides of MarchBad things always happen during March: Messiahs rise from their graves, Irish people are encouraged to get smashed and stabbings while eating Caesar salad increase.That spring tradition of tragedy now continues with this thriller. Determined to see Governor Morris (George Clooney) succeed at his run for presidency, Stephen (Ryan Gosling) excels at his junior position under the Senior Campaign Manager (Philip Seymour Hoffman).In fact, he's so exceptional that he is headhunted by the campaign manager (Paul Giamatti) for Morris' Republican opponent.Later, a Morris aide (Evan Rachel Wood) comes forward with news that could devastate the white knight's reputation, while Stephen's meeting with the enemy is leaked to a reporter (Marisa Tomei).A pulse-pounding plunge in to the political arena, The Ides of March is a superlative study of a na?ve guppy's evolution into a shrewd shark. As for politics, it's best left to those who can afford to keep their gay lifestyle a secret. (Green Light)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I never wanna go to politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came home from the ides of march and boy, what a political drama this was. First i want to give the reasons why I couldn't give a 10, which I'm going to make pretty short because I really want to focus on the good stuff. First the length: Even though it is important to build up the drama and especially the thriller aspect slow and step by step, I have to admit there were some scenes that could have been cut better. I'm not saying there were any unnecessary moments but at one point or another they could have saved us a couple of minutes. And the ending which I'm not giving away is debatable but for me it wasn't quite what I expected nor what I wanted. Thats not to say it was horrible or anything but I don't know, it didn't fit for me.But now lets get to the good stuff: The actors, the pacing (for the most part), the clever twists. This (speaking as an Austrian) was just what I had in mind when I thought of politics in America when it comes to who is going to be the president. It's not about who has the best speeches or what whoever is going to do to serve his country best, its about finding mistakes of the opponent and using tricks and all sorts of manipulation to get to the goal. The more time passes the more you feel along with the main character that when you want to get somewhere in politics you have to become a cold hearted bastard who wont stop for nothing. There are many sub messages like in the end it doesn't care what your motivation was as long as you get what you want. Or in politics you can do everything, like in war there are no rules except for one, and so on and so on. So yes, this movie makes for a lot of debatable topics, which is something I really enjoy. The cast is fantastic, everyone of them is just in his role I never saw an actor in any of these people I saw the freaking characters they were supposed to be, I'm thrilled thinking this might could have been reality.So if you are tired of the 100th action movie and looking for something rather slow but pretty intense, go and check this one out, probably especially if you are American.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ides of March ? A Dark Political Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney is turning out to be one very fine entertainer. He acts well and his direction of the material he chooses is just spot on. The guy surely tries to weave together interesting stories with a unique direction style. His method is laid back and he cares a damn about it. But it sure doesn't fail to entertain the audience. I still feel Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is his most accomplished work but this stands a close second. He is slowly becoming the next Clint Eastwood or Robert Redford of our times.Ides of March is a political thriller set during the US Presidential elections. Now if you don't know anything about the election process in the US you would be clueless of the proceedings at the start. I was thoroughly confused but slowly everything started making sense and slowly I started enjoying it. With its dark take on the human nature and a satisfyingly twisty plot, makes it one of the most entertaining films ever made about the political process.Political expediency and intrigue make for fascinating cinema. Fans of this type of cinema recall fondly one of the originals, "All The King's Men", later made into many versions, the last being one where the word 'King's' was replaced by 'President's'. In all the versions of this movie, the rookie campaign manager loses to a smart politician. What if he did not? What if nobody loses and nobody wins either. "The Ides of March" based on a play 'Farragut North' takes up this theme from 'All the King's Men" and explores it to its ruthless ends and means.Stephen (Ryan Gosling) is the junior campaign manager for Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney) who's looking to win Ohio to guarantee him a presidential nomination. Stephen is an idealist who works for Mike because he thinks this is the man who can bring change the world needs.Events unleash that threaten to run Mike down. As things get out of control, as power struggle and political expediency intensifies, Stephen finds himself in the middle of a scandal that he hadn't anticipated and couldn't control? Or can he?"The Ides of March" is a coming-of-age film of a young idealist in the ruthless world of politics, of losing his virginity and innocence to the intrigue and violence of the political world. The focus is not on politics and the politicians, like in 'All the King's Men" but on the rookie and his reaction to things around him.Clooney is an expert director with an immaculate sense of timing and subtlety. Standing on the backside of a large American flag, Stephen contemplates his idealism even as the US national anthem plays on. The camera could have cut off, or panned out. But it hauntingly lingers on, silently giving a glance into the mind of this idealist.In another scene where an important character is to be fired, a man in the car calls him inside for a minute and for that entire minute the camera just focuses on the silent car as the man comes out and the job is done. In a normal scenario, the director would have jumped the minute. Clooney chooses to linger on thus heightening the tension of an important minute.Many politically charged films, like Clooney's directorial venture "Good Night and Good Luck" or "Syriana" where he acted, attempt to expose political intrigue and thus present the truth. Here, political corruption is almost taken for granted, and it is the corruption of one idealistic individual that becomes the focus.A stellar cast that includes Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giammati gives the film an extra character. Ryan Gosling's innocence works well for the film. After Drive, he yet again portrays what a fine actor he is turning out to be. Clooney is his usual self composed and confident of the proceedings and always in control of the scene.The movie reminds us that there's a big bad world out there, and to survive you have to answer Fire with Fire. Although, not the right thing to do always, it is something you have to live, grow and adapt with. This dark and practical take makes the movie worth a watch.Read the entire review at : http://devlifeintechnicolor.wordpress.com/2012/01/08/ides-of-march-a- dark-political-thriller/</fullReview>

Ryan Gosling is magnetic in the lead role, and as always, delivers a charming portrayal of a man trying to do right in a volatile atmosphere.One person mainly left out in reviews has been Phillip Seymour Hoffman who is once again powerful and real. He is easily one of the greatest actors working today and is always fun to watch.The cinematography was exceptional in this film and George seems to always pick the top people in the business to work on his films.

		<fullReview>What begins as a slow freight train of the slogging political campaign trail picks up to become a downward spiraling vortex in which no player escapes unscathed. The checkerboard of dirty politicking gets uglier as the stakes are raised in a game of secrets and lies. George Clooney as the Director moves his pieces about his role of Presidential hopeful and sitting Governor like moons orbiting Jupiter. The central core of his moral servitude destabilizes and results in the collision of those caught in his gravitational pull. Ryan Goslin gives a dark and stormy performance as the kid who will do what it takes to stay in the game. Evan Rachel Wood who is hard pressed to pass for twenty lends a subtle seductress sans innocent intern credibility. Paul Giomantii creates a swarthy opponent to the Morris campaign, He don't drink no F---in Merlot and He didn't order any F---in Buffalo Wings! Phillip Seymour Hoffman gives an incredible level of believability and proves that great acting is knowing when to shut your trap. Marrisa Tomei blends in beautifully as the reporter hot on the trail, she's a bloodhound that is going to sniff out what she can from the campaign. Very well done, and hat's off to George for not stealing the show.</fullReview>

I concur with his every point and also like the style he uses. I will then cover more superficial and less in-depth aspects in a more crass approach for those who might find some appeal or interest in that. Make sure to read David's; I'll dare say I wish I had written a review before his. Any form of plagiarism is frowned upon, so we don't do that.George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Marisa Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood, Jeffery Wright and Gregory Itzin? You know your 'gonna' have yourself a horse race with these 'Thoroughbreds'. Stock up, you won't want to get up from your seat. The basic storyline is a simple premise, which means the characters have to be all the more interesting in how they are developed and played. There are no let downs. David said it first, only a confrontation between Giamatti and Hoffman could have elevated the melodrama to a higher plateau still.We can buy the whole thing beginning to end because if we haven't already seen similar in real reporting by the media, we have the imagination to accept its plausibility with little reservation. I had not seen a seduction scene like that between Gosling and Rachel Wood, in a long time if ever. Everything the trailers teases you with, you will have the pleasure to see and more. If you failed to see it at the cinema, it's officially out this extended Holiday week-end. Rent It or buy It, but see hit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtlety &amp; restraint from Clooney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the feast of new films coming out in December, there are bound to be clever, well-made, thought-provoking films, as well as disappointing or downright embarrassing ones. The Ides of March, I am happy to say, fits in the former category. Based on the play Farragut North by Beau Willimon and directed by one of Hollywood's favourite leading men, George Clooney, The Ides of March follows Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling), a young, political up-and-comer as he works as the chief media adviser on Governor Morris' (George Clooney) campaign to win the all-important Ohio primary in the Democratic presidential nomination. As one of Morris' most trusted advisors and the race increasingly swaying in Morris' favour, Meyers comes ever closer to having a top role in the White House. However, political tides turn when the other candidate's chief adviser, Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti) asks to meet with Meyers and advises him to come work for his side. After Meyers declines, things begin to go awry in the campaign and questions of loyalty and dignity are brought into question more so than ever before.Obviously, this is not a ground-breaking plot in the political genre, and at times this becomes a noticeable problem, but Clooney is able to overcome this with a clear sense of purpose and technical skills in his direction and the performances he is able to achieve from his actors.The performances work so well because they achieve a sense of subtlety and restraint throughout the film. This is especially true when talking of Gosling or Clooney who could have easily stole every scene. Instead they allow room for their supporting cast, including an exceptional Evan Rachel Wood, to develop and as such they are able to achieve more depth and consequently, more humanity in their characters. Themes such as loyalty and deceit are very prevalent and at times it can feel that Clooney is trying too hard to hammer these aspects home. His overuse of lighting, particularly shadows to represent these themes are not as subtle as the rest of his direction and there are clear issues with pacing as the middle section of the film dragged slightly, but these are minor faults in Clooney's direction and do little to detract from the elegant restraint he shows throughout the rest of the film. Ultimately though, despite all these other aspects, the majority of discussion surrounding The Ides of March will be that of the man of hour ? Ryan Gosling. After a string of box-office and critical hits, Gosling gives another fine performance that on any other year would put him in the awards race but will instead be overshadowed by the audacious and controversial performance in the critic's favourite, Drive. In many ways this is typical of the film itself, as while it is a truly fine film with brilliant direction and performances, it will be ultimately, almost cruelly, overshadowed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting political thriller with a message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's one absolutely magnificent scene in this movie. It's a scene Hitchcock would be proud of. We see the campaign leader of presidential candidate Mike Morris leave a hairdresser's shop, and step into the car of his boss. Then we see only the front of the car for maybe 20 or 30 seconds. Nothing happens. Nothing moves, apart from the exhaust fumes from a nearby parked car. Then the door opens and the campaign leader steps out. We see from his posture that he has been fired. And from the fact that he has been fired, we know that presidential candidate Mike Morris has given up everything he stands for, in order to win the elections. The car moves away. Welcome to American politics. When you can make a film with the key scene consisting of an image of the front of a car, you are a great film maker. Clooney has proved before that he is as fine behind the camera as he is in front of it. The Ides of March is a confirmation of his directing talents. This film shows all the dirty tricks of a presidential campaign. And when I say dirty, I mean dirty. Wheeling, dealing, power play, double-crossing, sex, blackmail and even death are the ingredients of this drama. This film doesn't paint a pretty picture of American democracy, but of course that's nothing new. Clooney is cast perfectly as a sort of white Obama. Even his campaign poster looks like Obama's - a little inside joke. Ryan Gosling also proves he is a great actor, and morphs from a nice idealistic guy to a ruthless shark in a time span of 90 minutes. Just consider how sympathetic and naive he is his in the first meeting with journalist Ida Horowicz, and how cold and arrogant in his last conversation with her. And then there's lots of other acting talent: Paul Giamatti, Marisa Tomei and Philip Seymour Hoffman are great. This is a film with a message: American politics need to focus again on integrity. But apart from that, it's also an exciting political thriller and a showcase for Hollywood's best acting talents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In politics never promise anything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very powerful film that does not really call for a long commentary.We are dealing with the Democratic primaries in Ohio for the presidential election of a year that is not specified, though the various historical elements situate the events after the war in Iraq and yet within a context of hostility against the oil producers in the desert, meaning of course Arab oil producers.The candidate that is shown as the future winner in this campaign is not the incumbent president, is white and strongly hostile to the use of war as a way to achieve supremacy, though supremacy is the openly expressed aim. The way is is calculating his victory can only be understood in the American context: the great electors have to be elected state by state with rules that are different in the various states. The result then is some kind of in the wings negotiations and communication warfare and it has little to do with democracy and the US Constitution and the fundamental rights of the Bill of Rights.Calculations, rumors, shady action in the wings, intimidation and even scapegoats when necessary, or even some violence if that's the only way. American politics are dirty, very dirty with such a system, and yet it is so much better than some other political organization. There is little originality in what we can say on this political system.But there is a lot more to say on three points.Sexual traps and blackmail: any sexual caper, even hidden deep in the shadow of the night, is one of the favorite weapons used to destabilize and even pull down a candidate. That is immoral in the name of morality. This is mean and absurd, but it is true that unwanted sex is too often the case between the candidate or his major aides and the young volunteers and interns the candidate may use in his team.The wild and savage war among the various people at the top of a campaign-team. But this is a game in a way in which one will destroy the others if that one can in order to achieve full control over the campaign and a battle of that type is never finished: one may win one fight but the loser may call for a second fight and win in his turn: no one is supposed to be a bad loser and the best loser is the one who concede defeat and walks out without resisting. He will easily get some job somewhere that will pay for his experience and his connections.The third point that is not even discussed is the desire to bring the USA back to first position by cutting on the consumption of oil drastically and stop buying the oil of the Desert dictatorship that are Moslem at the same time. That is not dictated by any religious beliefs that are rejected from the very start, but only by the ambition to go back to the top and head of the pack of wolves the whole world is identified to.It is where the film is strangest because in 2010 or 2011 it is difficult to say that the main cause of the decline of the USA is the oil producers. The main opponents in the globalized market are the emerging countries that the latest crisis does not seem to have really jeopardized or endangered, even if it has bothered them slightly. In that perspective it would be interesting to suggest the USA and Americans to stop using any kind of high tech product that is produced in these emerging countries. That would cut the ambition to recapture the leading role in technology short and even very short, a crew cut in a way, which would lead to using the marines sooner or later to bring the emerging countries down.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shifting moral centres and political backstabbing in this portentous tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main difference between British and American politics is that, even within a two party system, US political campaigning is rife with vicious internal backbiting, especially during the primaries to elect a presidential candidate. This is brought to the fore in The Ides of March, where staffer Stephen Myers (Ryan Gosling) has to negotiate the donkey-infested waters of mudslinging, not only between the two Democratic candidates, but also within his own campaign team.Mike Morris, George Clooney's Clintonesque Governor, vying for a seat in the Oval Office, a seemingly clean cut figure , provides a fine veneer for the underhand dealings of his campaign manager,Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman),pulling more strings than a loom weaver to try to give his man a chance at the big chair. Hoffman plays the part with a calm servitude, a grizzled campaigner who never needs to raise his voice. Gosling's understated portrayal of the brilliant young prodigy provides a flexible morality for the first half, his character successfully promoting his man and policies without sacrificing his scruples. As in his previous outing in Drive, Gosling's performance dramatically switches to a passionately charged yet focused burst in the second half as Myers tries to deal with a drastic change in circumstances increasingly beyond his control.Grant Heslov, Beau Willimon and Clooney's screenplay (adapted from Willimon's play, Farragut North) doesn't have the snappy dialogue of similar political thrillers, such as Primary Colors but there is a subtle wit to the script that is relevant to modern US politics, with speeches peppered with sound-bites such as: "(I believe in no religion apart from the) constitution of the United States of America". There is also some political insight into why promoting National Service for 18 year-olds is a vote winner as those affected would be ineligible to vote against it. The premise that a President of the United States can get away with anything- such as bringing a country to war or bankruptcy- apart from having sex with an intern, is also brought to our attention.Clooney's direction is skilled in its imagery. He highlights the power of manufactured pomp by having the same speech read to both an empty room and a crowd of chanting supporters. Back room machinations and blackmail are sometimes held in front of a looming Stars and Stripes and the weather is employed as an emotional barometer, Gosling at one point seen weeping through a beautifully lit, rain-spattered windscreen.The Ides of March has plenty of classical tragedy and modern political backstabbing that lives up to the portentous date in its title. The moral centre seems to shift from character to character and then completely disappears by the end of the film, leaving behind a trail of innocent victims, which seems all too common in politics these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I figure George Clooney can just pick up a telephone, call five randomly chosen actors, and sign them to whatever project he's working on by the end of the day. Certainly The Ides of March has an All-Star cast. They've all got something to work with, too, in this smart political thriller.To a Canadian born and raised in a parliamentary democracy, the Byzantine U.S. federal system will always possess a certain alien charm -- and, frankly, a simmering alien horror. The Ides of March lays out the joys and horrors of this overly moneyed, often paradoxical system of democracy without ever seeming preachy or too laden with politicobabble.Ryan Gosling plays Stephen Meyers, 30-year-old second-in-command of Governor Mike Morris's campaign to win the Democratic primaries. We follow the campaign during a tumultuous week in Ohio, as deals and double-deals and betrayals and potentially career-ending events swirl in and around the campaign. The dialogue is mostly sharp, the performances lived-in and solid. No one here plays a dummy. And the actors are all up to playing smart.Gosling shines in playing someone who's both savvy and idealistic. Honouring the audience's intelligence, the final scene leaves it to the viewer to decide how much that idealism has been shattered by the events of the film. It's a quiet, subtle, Oscar-quality performance.Indeed, there isn't a weak performance in the movie. Clooney is utterly believable as a charismatic candidate promising hope and change; Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti make for crafty and rumpled long-time back-room opponents; even Evan Rachel Wood nails her role as a pretty, connected intern who gets caught up in the undertow of dangerous political depths. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ides of March is not about the assassination of a Caesar, as the name implies, instead it is about political machinations, the way the people that lead us play the game to get to be voted by us, a point where, basically, it doesn't matter who wins anymore: a "player" will win. At the same time, the movie is strangely optimistic, as the main character is an idealistic youth who doesn't get pushed out of orbit by the big planets, but gets to keep his place by becoming stronger. Is that a good thing, though? The movie leaves the viewer to decide that, and for that at least, The Ideas of March is a worthy movie.Clooney is known for some of the best political movies in the recent years. Actually, writing this, I am shocked to realize that there have been very few political thrillers lately and that is strange, given the current situation in the world. However, this film in particular felt a little forced, while in the same time, a bit boring. The subject of the film is interesting and the movie is worth seeing, but I can't shake the feeling that it could have been more dynamic and at the same time, better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you rate a movie it is important to measure it against what it tries to be and achieve. "The Ides of March" is a political drama. That is exactly what it succeeds at.If you are an avid follower of US presidential politics and your expectations when you walk into the theater is to be entertained for an hour and a half watching a fictional film whose focus is solely around US presidential politics ... you will love this movie.What I really liked about it is how it doesn't attempt to take a moral high ground or preach to the audience by driving the points with an invisible hammer into our minds.Look... we are all adults here. People who love political films KNOW that politics are dirty and treacherous, even since the times of Roman Republic and Julius Caesar 500 years BC and onwards.We KNOW that. So, what we want is a good story set in that environment, and that is exactly what we got.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dark side of presidential candidacy elections</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Ides Of March' is a modern-day political drama loosely based on Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar'. It shows what goes on behind the USA's long, arduous election campaigns.George Clooney's direction of this film was excellent, the dialogue was believable but also very funny at points - particularly at the beginning with conversations between Ryan Gosling and Evan Rachel Wood. Clooney's direction was very strong in parts such as when Gosling and Philip Seymour Hoffman are discussing matters in front of a giant illuminated American flag, highlighting what really goes on behind the shiny, clean-cut image of American politics. There are some points however, where the art direction can become a bit unbelievable and just too brooding such as when Gosling and Clooney have a discussion in a restaurant kitchen. The atmosphere in this scene is great but it just seems too dramatic for a real-life situation.I can't find any actor in this film who gives a weak performance. Clooney and Gosling's performances are excellent, Evan Rachel Wood and Philip Seymour Hoffman portray their characters very well also.The ending of this film is great, the people I watched it with at first thought the ending was a bit pathetic and anti-climactic, but after thinking for a while they realised just how powerful an ending this was. The timing of this film is very important too, released whilst the Republican presidency candidate campaigns are still going on and with no clear winner for certain at this stage, this film has an even bigger impact because of this.Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this film if you are interested in politics, even if not specifically American politics. It's a really interesting film which has not received enough credit for its excellence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney has a remarkable talent. It isn't that he's a great actor. It isn't that he's a good writer or producer. It's the fact he knows how to do all that and still be a great director. In this film called " The Ides of March ' he plays Governor Mike Morris, a promising presidential candidate who's faltering campaign is in trouble and needs the support of Senator Thompson (Jeffery Wright). Luckily for him he has Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) an idealistic and likable, but clumsy campaign aid who is targeted as easy prey by his opponents. His immediate supervisor is hard nose Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who discovers that Stephen has fallen for a simple badger game set up by his counterpart who seeks to remove him. In addition, Stephen also becomes romantically involved with Molly Sterns (Rachel Woods) a pretty campaign intern who has an embarrassing secret and Ida Horowicz (marisa Tomei) a pesky Newspaper reporter. Together, the cast makes for an intriguing ensemble who easily mirror today's political climate. It is not difficult to enjoy this movie. If you like movies with George Clooney, this is one you should not miss. Indeed, if you like political backstabbing, lies, betrayal and intrigue, I highly recommend this film. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometime after a new regime takes over the free world's highest office you and I know some things. We know if our prescient situations are better, or worse. We know if our longer range interests, things like our 401Ks are tanking or rallying?But, what do we really know? Do we know what has transpired prior to these things taking place? Do we know if there was a trail of tears or a path of glory that led to the present? The "Ides of March" puts forth the premise that we, likely, know little of how we were manipulated to the point we, as citizens, are party to, and very much affected by.George Clooney's "Ides of March" is anything but a "feel good" political drama. The "Ides of March" is a mirror of post 1963 politics; a movie that may be based on truth, consequences, or fiction. The powerful thrust that propels it is our knowledge that regardless of fact or fiction it is likely "spot-on" in its depiction of how murky the road to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue can be. Honor, though projected on all sides, may be so idealistic as to be more fantasy than reality. Careers are made, destroyed, and bargained out like chips in Vegas. That would not be a surprise as of 2011, but the fact that people not only may win or lose a certain bright future, but their very life is still quite unsettling. This is where "Ides of March" rises to be as much a social commentary as entertainment.This movie is recommended see as it realistically handles the rampant backstabbing, as well as intimate personal behavior, that go with the territory of the race for the office of President of the United States. While not being based on any particular candidate, past or present, it effectively illustrates a composite of realistic possibilities.Besides having a good screenplay we have excellent casting that conveys realism over acting. Ryan Gosling as the protagonist, a rising assistant to the leading candidate's campaign director, has just the right sincerity with cut-throat underpinnings to find himself in exactly the dark situation that evolves. Philip Seymour Hoffman turns in his usual low-key, yet extremely effective, performance portraying the consummate campaign chief who in all of his professionalism still cannot control human nature. Paul Giamatti as the opposing camp's campaign head, with limited screen time, almost steals the show as he gambles on being able to take advantage of the naivety and greed of his "mark" in the adversary's campaign. Giamatti adds the all-important impetus of playing various parties against one another to achieve a desired outcome. Politics is a dirty business?You got that (you will)? George Clooney nails the camera ready presidential candidate who is all too frail, yet projects everything the average American voter desperately desires to invest in. Marisa Tomei plays, and represents, the press in her relentless pursuit of a story, she wins only if she can bring anyone and everyone down. This works in no small measure due to the "hinge" whereby the door opens (victory) or closes (defeat or worse) brilliantly wrapped in the gregarious Molly, a young intern, played by Evan Rachel Wood. Casting is simply serving the excellent story which the coolly grey cinematography perfectly presents. A definite recommendation with the hope it is more fiction than fact; with fears otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off, I'm not into politics in any way. I don't really know much about the different parties etc. . Because of this, I thought I would despise this movie. I decided to watch it ultimately because of the award nominations it has been receiving. For the first 30 minutes or so I was struggling to find anything in the show that I cared about. The story was a bit dull and generic to begin, just another political campaign movie I thought. The story then took a sharp turn and it became very exciting to watch. Until the end of the movie it was very intriguing. There was never a time where I questioned a character's actions. The seemingly good characters introduced at the beginning of the movie start to show more and more of their bad side. Eventually everything collides and ends with the protagonist (Gosling) questioning what his next move should be. The ending is actually quite good, it reminded me of the end of inception, where it is left upon the audience to think about what might have happened. I think Clooney did a wonderful job directing this movie. I give a 7/10 because it started so slow. The story is brilliant though. Makes you think about what could be happening behind closed doors in the real political world.</fullReview>

Ryan Gosling's character may start out as an idealist, but he soon learns how the real world works and embraces it with both arms till, in the end, in terms of ruthlessness and cold-eyed ambition, he out-Caesars Caesar! But, young man, beware! He who rides the tiger....! Respice post te, memento te hominem! or whatever; anyway, what I mean to say is that this film cries out for a follow-up which tells the further exploits of Stephen Meyers. I hope he goes on from strength to strength, then brings the whole rotten world of politics crashing down like a pack of cards and comes out smelling of roses! And, to top it all, they manage to tell the story in a quiet, measured tone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tricky Political Character Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney's newest film The Ides of March is anything but safe. This tale of a young Junior Campaign Manager, Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) who is working on winning his candidate, Mike Morris (George Clooney), the Demoicratic primary in Ohio to become the Democratic nominee in a modern-times election. With this battle comes private battles of their own. The angst between Meyers and Morris' Senior Campaign Manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to get things done. The pace quickly picks up as Meyer's secretly meets with the opposing candidates manager (Paul Giamatti) and becomes romantically involved with one of the interns working on the campaign (Evan Rachel Wood). There are twists and turns along the way, and the action only rises from there.Clooney has a great sense of character (not uncommon coming from a director with an acting background). The manipulation of characters plays perfectly into the greedy twisty political interplay that everyone is basically akin to, but Clooney, along with screenwriters Grant Heslov and Beau Willmon do it in a way that maneuvers human emotion of the characters, a true strength of the film, and one that Moneyball REALLY wished it could have had. The performances were solid all around, even despite Gosling being a bit miscast in the role. Evan Rachel Wood is climbing a ladder of greatness, and her next few projects, whatever she decides those are, are going to take her to new levels; talk about a promising actress. It is no surprise that Clooney fits into the mold of his character extremely well, and the supporting cast (including a fabulous Marisa Tomei) are excellent. The social context of the film is intriguingly displayed, with the plot revolving around an Obama-esque character, so soon to the start of his re-election campaign. It's a film about winning and what that costs to the person themselves. And it's handled pretty admirable. B+</fullReview>

I was looking for a movie that shows a political campaign and the contenders are faced with moral questions and have to choose between what is right and what is popular. It's a world that has tough choices and the right people make those choices and this movie is going to highlight the difficult journey of those people. Boy was I wrong. This movie was one man's journey from idealist to jaded politician.

		<fullReview>Actually wondered if people were talking/writing about another movie.1} Idealism/innocence. The only one who shows any is Hoffman with his unwavering belief in loyalty (in politics no less). Gosling as Hoffman rightly points out doesn't make a mistake, he makes a choice. From start to finish all gosling does is make one selfish, self-serving choice after another. The only time you see any belief in anything outside himself is when he talks about clooney at the beginning and wouldn't you know it, he is talking to a reporter.2) Taut political drama. Saw the end coming a mile away and the girl's suicide killed any real drama as well as suspense. Realize a feature film has time constraints but everything working out so conveniently is just incredible. On one hand he's one of the best minds around and on the other he makes decisions only a complete idiot would. Girl from such a rich powerful family can't scrounge up 900 bucks. While desperately worrying about her condition and her lack of funds, she still has the time and attention (not to mention libido) to spare to hit on the one guy who could benefit from discovering her secret ? Then she dies. Right on cue.Even as the bad guy the movie star will triumph.A questionable victory of course because he is now all quiet and reflective but what does that really mean ? He now is the boss of people including one guy who directly benefited from his brief firing. He has burned all bridges with his own boss. There is no sense of disillusionment because they never really showed him as naive to begin with and no matter how sombre he looks at the end there is no real sense of conflict because his newfound reserve could just as easily be a reflection of a really toxic work situation.The actors were superb.The writing was pathetic.The directing thus is guilty by assosciation. The 'eat it' scene with tomei at the end was just peurile. The quiet walk and silent sitting would have played much better.The lack of any real depth or sophistication in hollywoods recent offerings is an insult to the intelligence. Thought the run would end with this one.Thought wrong. Wish them well.Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a story that shows the grimy an and gritty parts in politics. Ryan Gosling is the star in this movie playing Stephen Meyers who is a skilled worker in politics and is trying to help a charismatic and charming candidate played by George Clooney get elected. This movie is about what happens in the background when it comes to politics. The movie has topnotch actors and they all do a fantastic job but what really makes this movie shine is the dialogue. It's just well written and sharp. A movie by George Clooney can be a hit or a miss and this one is a hit. It's well directed, well written and acting is topnotch. And watching the progress and direction of the protagonist's ideology is engrossing while he is helping run a campaign. Anyways the dialogue made the movie intriguing and entertaining to just watch and listen to people talk in this. There is other movies that has a similar premise as this with the campaign for presidency and everything but this one really does show the dirty side of politics. Although some parts may seem a bit far-fetched than others. I liked the character development in this and how, you don't know unless your hit a wall or put yourself in others shoes. I would personally watch this movie again later on in the future.8.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The culture of distrust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the big debates for any political candidates is do you stick to your principles no matter what or do you compromise to ensure you can get yourself elected. This is one of many themes The Ides of March examines in this look of human character.In the Ohio Democrat Presidential Primary there are only two men left in the race, Mike Morris (George Clooney), the Governor of Pennsylvania and Senator Pullman (Michael Mantell), a senator from Arkansas. Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is Morris' deputy Campaign Manager, a 30-year-old man with a sharp political mind and really believes in Morris as a candidate. But Stephen makes a fatal mistake, he meets the rival candidate manager, Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti) and slowly Morris turns from the front runner to facing a tough neck-and-neck race. But Stephen not just suffers a political crisis but also an personal and career one as well.The strongest aspect of The Ides of March is acting from the whole cast. Clooney assembles a great cast, Gosling, Giamatti, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Evan Rachel Wood and Marisa Tomei. These were all well developed, interesting real characters as we see Stephen gets corrupted by the political process. Gosling starts as a wide eyed decent bloke who becomes a morally despicable, first out of loyalty and a determination to win to his ambition for revenge. Most of the characters are bad or flawed and Philip Seymour Hoffman was possibly the most sympathetic because despite his brass exterior he makes a verdure of loyalty and committed to the cause whilst Wood is simply a young woman who goes in over her head. Whilst Clooney seems like a decent politician, a man who wants to stay committed to his principles but in the end but no different to any other politician. Plus Clooney actually did not have much screen time, this was a film focusing on the campaign staff.As well as being about politics and the political process, this is a character study on the affects of power and ambition someone.Clooney's direction was pretty standard but I put it down to the fact the film is based on a play. A lot of the film is people speaking rooms as plot in various ways. It was almost like an edgy version of the West Wing but have different viewpoints on politics: The West Wing's view is that politicians are people who believe in their ideology because they genuinely believe it is best for the country and the system of compromise acts a check, whilst in The Ides of March the system of compromise is a way to weaken ideals and shows that some people are willing to do anything for power.The original played avoided mentioning which political party it focused on. Clooney turned The Ides of March into focusing on the Democratic Primary but there are some hints of play's political counter-balance by making out Senator Thompson (Wright) to be a bit like John Bolton (a right wing nut), claiming the top ten floors of the UN could removed.It is also an examination of how in politics that even people within the same side, the same campaign backbite each other let alone their oppoents: these are people who are meant to have similar ideology (and before someone gets clever I know American politics is a lot more complex). But this continues the theme of power corrupting people, people within any organisation are vying for top dog.One problem I have with many political films is it boils down to a sex scandal. I accept that a sex scandal would have massive affect on a campaign, but there are other things that could derail a campaign. But it is still a better executed film compared to Primary Colors and Wag the Dog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an idealistic young man experiences the inner workings of a democratic presidential campaign and is taught firsthand what "dirty politics" are all about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies out there that introduce us to a reality we live in that we never knew existed. This is not one of them.George Clooney's fourth directorial feature tells the story of an idealistic young man who experiences the inner workings of a democratic presidential campaign and is taught firsthand what "dirty politics" are all about. Based on the play Farragut North by Beau Willimon, we are shown the ugly truth behind his profession. The problem with this movie is it forgets that we aren't blind to what politics are all about, especially in a climate where these conflicts are front page news.Clooney plays presidential hopeful Governor Mike Morris, currently located in Ohio where he is in the middle of a presidential primary. He wouldn't be who he is without his team of staffers lead by his no-nonsense campaign manager, Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his intelligent press spokesman, Stephen Myers (Ryan Gosling). During the campaign they have to deal with the opposing democratic candidate Senator Pullman as well as his own team, which includes Paul Giamatti as the slick campaign manager, Tom Duffy. The fight between both candidates is admittedly realistic as we see the extents some will go to win.The heavyweight casting is the movie's saving grace. Gosling, Clooney, Hoffman, Giamatti, the underused Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood put on expert displays of the variety of personalities involved in a political campaign. It's the script written by Clooney, Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon that fails to thrill the audience. The film begins with the honest truth behind a campaign but slowly becomes rather commonplace. The movie begins to become sour when a predictable twist has a melodramatic turn and makes a mockery of real issues.In an effort to be more "realistic," the plot failed to be engaging. I came to be shocked and have my imagination about corruption and greed expanded to the limits. Instead, I found only an overuse of political rhetoric which seemed more appropriate for a prime time news station. Clooney made a movie in which the character we are supposed to identify with is too na?ve to see what's right in front of him. In our current politically-charged environment, he failed to recognize that the majority of us are not blind to the obvious corruption of our state. If the film had been more substantial about the conflict between ideals and reality, it would have produced meaningful and active entertainment.The true star of this movie is Ryan Gosling, yet again giving a brilliant performance and proving that he is the next big thing. On the outside his character radiates charisma and confidence, swaying reporters to believe what he sells about Morris because he is a true believer in everything that his candidate stands for. Every situation and emotional exchange Clooney threw at him, he executed with excellence.Clooney, likewise, is the perfect fit to play Morris. It has always been apparent that he has the wit and charm of a born politician. When Morris speaks you are inclined to listen. You can't stop because what he has to say is so intriguing. What he speaks are the true lines of a politician; saying what they need to say to smooth talk voters and at the same time acting behind the scenes to keep the worst parts of their lives from being revealed.But the strongest part of the cast lies in the battle to win between Hoffman and Giamatti. Hoffman's character stands for loyalty and how that is the only thing that matters in life, while his opposing campaign manager believes in finding any way possible to weaken the other team. Both actors give powerful performances as this is no real stretch for them. Their part in the movie was to portray the different sides to politics, and both with opposite personalities and views did their part very well.The two supporting woman consist of Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood. In a small role Tomei shines as a news reporter whose idea of a friend is someone who can give her a story. Tomei plays her character very well, presenting a woman who is extremely persuasive in her action to find a story and do everything she can to publish it, even if it means blackmail. Evan Rachel Wood plays the young intern to the Morris campaign whose importance may be a cover for something else. Wood is an actress with many talents and the character she is given doesn't allow her to display those talents until one pinnacle moment. Both actresses do a wonderful job but won't find their names on the nomination ballot when the Oscars come around.The Ides of March doesn't live up to its hype and is only worth watching for its incredible cast of actors. I have come to find this movie will go one of two ways; some will find it an honest masterpiece about politics and the world we live in or will find it a dull political narrative about the "shocking" world of manipulation, cover ups and scams that isn't actually so shocking. This movie will either be forgotten when Oscar season comes around or be one of the numerous nominees up for Best Picture. If I had it my way this movie would not be up for contention, allowing more deserving films of 2011 to be recognized.In the end, the movie left me disappointed. My advice to you is to enter the film with no expectations of being blown away by the story, but if you're interested in keeping up with valued actors it's mostly worth it.Anna Belickis www.awardscircuit.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank you everyone involved in the commissioning, making and promoting of this wonderful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How often do you get to say you saw a perfect movie? Ides of March. A perfect movie. At a time when the entire country is politically rudderless, anchor-less, skipper-less and even vessel-less, the timing &amp; conception of this predictably unlikely love story is impeccable &amp; immaculate. As the GOP's rampant unashamed (and vehemently anti-American) negationism 'anti-alchemises' our president's latent desire to heal and improve and prevail into a histrionic valedictory flourish, Ayn Rand must be turning in her grave. But that's another conversation.... On this website, let's prioritise importance. GOOD MOVIES are our sole concern, and those who make and act in them are modern-day demigods who deserve our worship: never more so than in this instance.George Clooney is the most important person in Hollywood. God bless him and his indefatigable commitment to telling Class-A stories, his delicious skill for understated yet explosively jarring and edifying narrative, his choice of stories to tell, and his unwavering respect for those unto whom his stories are told. The bravest, most radical man in Hollywood, I salute you. I also salute your taste in women. Linda Thompson is cool. Most importantly America - see what happens when you 'win'. It ain't always AWESOME.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Acting in an Unfinished Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides of March is a story of political infighting. The dirty tricks orchestrated by sleazy political advisers are more or less what we would expect from high-stakes races for president. We have witnessed political hardball. Americans have seen much real, not fictional, corruption in the political process in the past two decades, but corruption was not invented recently. The title refers to ancient corruption when a trusted friend murdered Julius Caesar, Rome's then leading political leader.The "Ides" cast is star-studded and the acting is better than the screenplay. Ryan Gosling is sorting through his relationship with ethics as he confronts moral dilemmas on the campaign trail. His character is shaped by his responses to them. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a veteran hardball player who is cynical and nasty without being especially corrupt. He has one scruple. He values loyalty. But he is a loathsome human being. A worse human being is Paul Giamati, who is Hoffman's counterpart for the opposing candidate. Giamati's character is fundamentally dishonest, nasty and completely beyond redemption. George Clooney plays the politician who has moved to the front of the race in Ohio, but his lead is tenuous. He has one or two remaining scruples, and we like him because 1) he is George Clooney, 2) he has a couple of scruples, and 3) he seems to be the good guy in a cesspool. The story is about the process of stripping away the last vestige of decency from people who are being seduced by dreams of power.As far as it goes, it is a terrific story, but it is unfinished. There was a better story based on these characters and these moral conundrums, but the filmed ended before the rest of the story was told. The characters are interesting, and their decisions reveal much about them. All of it is compelling.Having raised large moral questions, the story closes too soon and fails to address them. There was more that begged to be told. The End showed up in The Middle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overloaded Political Drama Somehow Misses the Mark Despite Its Exalted Credentials</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is precious little that is more frustrating than watching a film with a platinum-caliber cast fall short of expectations, but that was exactly my reaction to George Clooney's 2011 smart, engrossing adaptation of Beau Willimon's 2008 play, which in turn, was loosely based on the failed 2004 Democratic primary campaign of Howard Dean. Clooney shares screen writing credit with frequent collaborator Grant Heslov ("Good Night, and Good Luck.") and Willimon, and together they provide some insight into the inner workings of the American political system. The movie starts out strong and the dialogue feels quite sharp, but the plot twists turn out to be far less about the subtle intricacies in the current political scene and more about classic Hollywood themes like honor and loyalty. This cautious approach results in a film that is far more conventional in execution than I was hoping it would be based on the trailers.The story focuses on Stephen Meyers, a young politico who is the junior campaign manager for the charismatic Mike Morris, the governor of Pennsylvania who is looking to secure the Democratic nomination for the presidency. Competing against Senator Ted Pullman of Arkansas, Morris is looking to lock down the Ohio primary, but his surest chance for victory ride on getting an endorsement from Senator Thompson of North Carolina, who is pulling out of the election. After a hotly contested debate, Pullman's campaign manager Tom Duffy sets Meyer aside and confidentially asks him to switch camps and work for Pullman. Flattered and understandably paranoid, Meyers keeps this offer a secret from his boss, Morris senior campaign manager Paul Zara. Further complicating matters is Molly Stearns, an intern whom Meyers beds only to find out she had a previous liaison with Morris. She also happens to be the daughter of the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. A fair amount of Machiavellian-level deception and double-crossing among the campaign managers leads to one suicide and Meyers ultimately reconsidering his ideals in pursuit of success and revenge.The performances are as solid as you would expect. Clooney effortless brings his savvy and charm to Morris in a way that makes you wish Obama could pick up pointers from him. If Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman were anything less than stellar as Duffy and Zara respectively, that would have been far more surprising. What would have been more interesting is if the actors switched roles as they would be playing less to their usual archetypes. Evan Rachel Wood effectively plays the pivotal role of Molly, bringing an intriguing mix of youthful moxie and vulnerability to her character's actions, while Marisa Tomei provides just the right level of cynicism to her New York Times reporter (?will she ever return to starring roles?). Jeffrey Wright is criminally underused in just a few scenes as Thompson, but Max Minghella (the late director Anthony's son) lends sharpness to his minor role as a nakedly ambitious member of the Morris campaign staff. At the center of it all, Ryan Gosling proves he has the gravity to carry a mainstream movie, even one as fully loaded as this one. I only wish the film itself was more surprising and insightful than it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one poorly structured and out of focus political film that's neither a political thriller nor a think piece. It's just an excuse to lambaste the political process all the while mixing in insane liberal rhetoric at just about every turn. Every stump speech Clooney delivers is filled with the most idiotic liberal platitudes imaginable. I give credit for pointing out Democratic hypocrisy and it's an interesting look in to the mindset of a left wing campaign but it's not interesting enough. A great cast is absolutely wasted here and the movie itself offers no insight or depth to any real issue. This movie is as big of a waste of time as any dumb CGI video game movie and that's the real surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Underbelly of Politics, Driven by a Stellar Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a good, well-rounded synopsis of this film, please read Dan Franzen's astute review, written on October 8, 2011. My review focuses on character development, script, and metaphor.Sizzling with a dark undertone, "The Ides of March" delivers on it's campaign promise. It's politics as usual in this story, and the film is driven by a stellar cast, with George Clooney at the directorial helm. For me, this film is a standout among the 2011 fare. It's fortunate that Clooney is wise enough to cast himself as the co-starring role of Governor Morris, a man who is trying his fate at winning the Presidency, one state at a time. Although he does not get a lot of screen time, Clooney's character retains a burnished charisma, which is filtered by quiet ambiguity. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a morality tale. There are numerous cogs in the wheel, which include Governor Morris, his opponent, and their support teams. But one thing is clear: they are all in service to Politics. It's a game that they thrive on, and sometimes despise.I would suggest that the main character of this film might very well be the Puppetry of Politics.Yes, Politics, with a capital P.As it brandishes it's bravado, and thinly disguises it's blood-thirsty intentions beneath a veil of nobility, the puppet strings of Politics are taunt. So entrenched are these strings, that a politician's reputation can be snuffed out, and in quick order. Politicians may hate the theatrics of the puppet show, but they still pay their allegiance to the Puppet Master. They are required to do a little jig to the corporate-sponsored tune, but politicians are not the Maestro of the Puppet Show. And they never will be.Actress Jennifer Ehle deliciously plays her limited role as the governor's wife, so that we are hungry for more. But, this might be an intentional choice by Clooney and his fellow scriptwriters. As is echoed in real life, the politician's wife-in-waiting is often relegated as a mere background player. In Ehle's one key scene, she is filmed in a tight closeup with Clooney, as they traverse the campaign trail. Her face is a moon-lit, and is framed by her husband's granite-like, shadowy persona. For me, this visual offers a nod to Mount Rushmore. Both Clooney and his cinematographer, Phedon Papamichael, must be be praised for this. Furthermore, the script for this scene is particularly well written, as what the Governor and his wife infer is more telling than what they say aloud.Ryan Gosling and Phillip Seymour Hoffman adroitly shine in their roles, as political power players in their own right, who help carve up a slice of the Political Pot Pie for their boss, the Governor, while also looking to advance their own careers. Some of the reviewers here have characterized the role of Gosling as idealistic at the start, but I see his character as more complex, as witnessed in the ironic opening moments. Gosling's character of Stephen has a stoic, graceful focus which is tempered by a street smart stance. All of this is a nice contrast to his boyish handsomeness. Hoffman plays his role of Paul with a nice mix of explosive staccato, peppered with a quiet stealth. Another fine turn for this gifted actor.Paul Giamatti also delivers as the political henchman for the opponent's team. I always like Giamatti, and I wanted to see more of him. I have some squabbles with the script quality in one juicy scene between Giamatti's character and Gosling. Giamatti's lines play out in a silly fashion. Subsequently, one of the final scenes between the two men loses it's momentum.Evan Rachel Wood is finely cast as a young temptress who serves as an intern to the Governor, and who happens to be the daughter of the head of the DNC. She offered some nice nuances to her role. Jeffrey Wright, who offers wonderful interpretations to his various roles, plays a Senator who offers favors, but is a shrewd player. In one scene, he comes off like a frenzied clown, whose job it is to hype up the audience, in support of the Governor. On the surface, Wright's delivery seems exaggerated, but we must remember that this sort of evangelical zest delivers ample votes to certain politicians.Overall, this was a quietly satisfying film, with a handful of script foibles. It would have been even more compelling if at least 3 of the roles were more fleshed out. "The Ides of March" reveals the narrowed odds a politician has for maneuvering the Puppet Show. Although this them will not come as a surprise to most modern day viewers, this tale still stands as a confirmation of sorts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gosling Is the Reason to See "Ides," Otherwise, It's Thin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling is the reason to see "Ides of March." Otherwise, the film is rather thin and can't compete with better political films, for example "Primary Colors," a film it is similar to in some ways.Gosling is a tall, thin, pale white man, and you'd probably pass him without notice on the street. The camera loves him, though, as do well-made clothes, and his combination of beauty and intelligence make him the center of every scene he's in. Gosling co-stars with acclaimed actors Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman and movie star heartthrob George Clooney. Giamatti and Hoffman are given plenty of script to chew up; Clooney gets to play a powerful politician; even so, these heavy-hitters can't steal a moment of the audience's focus from Gosling.While Giamatti and Hoffman seem all too aware of the accolades their acting has received over the decades, and seem to be forcing themselves to be as profoundly brilliant as every critic insists they are, Gosling is very quiet, never thrusting himself into the viewer's eyeballs. Even so, he is the one your eye travels to; he is the one you care about; he is the one you rely on for cues about how to interpret a scene. Gosling expresses naivety, rage, vengeance, resignation, sadness, fear, sardonic distance and disgust, just, subtly, with his facial features ? no need for screaming or flailing. And so you watch his face, with concentration. It's your roadmap through the film. In a key scene, when Gosling's character is at his most powerful, Gosling adds a slight shoulder stoop. It's very poignant.The film is not as good as Gosling's performance. The plot is very thin ? much ado about nothing. One character in the film is like the "redshirt" crew members from the old "Star Trek" series. This character is very underdeveloped and it's obvious that the character exists only to be eliminated by the plot so that other characters can react to that character's elimination. That this disposable character happens to be a female in a man's movie doesn't help the film any. The film's misogyny is transparent and causes the viewer to lose faith in the film. It becomes an all-too-obvious tick-tock writer's plot rather than an engaging story that allows for willing suspension of disbelief.The central conflict relies on a key character to be, in essence, two different people: one in private and one in public. This is a shallow and false take on politics. The problem is not that politicians are different people in private and in public. The problem is that we, the voters, embrace skewed personalities as our leaders. Bill Clinton let us all see what an oily charmer he was. His behind-the-scenes shenanigans were all too believable because we, like Monica Lewinsky, allowed ourselves to be seduced. Obama gave a good speech, and that's what we voted for. A speech maker. And that's what we got ? not a leader. The problem is not that politicians are different people in private and in public. The key moment for their voters comes when they see that the candidate that they voted for is exactly what they got, with all his flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting - mediocre plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a bit of a letdown. Some of my favorite actors were in this - and they did do a fine job - however, the plot was somewhat uninspiring, the twists (and I'm being generous by using the word twist) were only minimally surprising. One of the actors (Marisa Tomei) really was in a "nothing" role - a waste of her talents.So... If you want to see a movie with fine acting and want to focus on the actors without being distracted by getting caught up in an enjoyable movie, this is the one for you! Most of the time, after watching a good movie, one likes to spend time discussing the plot twists, hidden meanings, etc. - But I'm pretty sure that won't be the case for this one. You'll want to spend more time critiquing the popcorn than this lukewarm effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing doesn't cover it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The general buzz I've encountered regarding Ides has been one of anticipation. That has probably been enhanced by the fact that most of it was filmed in my hometown of Cincinnati. That, plus it has some decently heavy hitters, including George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Paul Giamatti. Portrayed as a compelling drama in a political setting, I was indeed intrigued, so I didn't put up much of a fight when my buddy suggested that be the movie we see during our impromptu outing. To say I was disappointed would be a gross understatement.The film opens with Ryan Gosling sitting in what appears to be a dark room, staring at the camera, with an expression of nonchalantness, fatigue, and an edge of confidence. Looking the audience in the eyes, he states "I am not a Christian. I am not an atheist. I am not a Muslim. I am not Jewish. My religion is the Constitution." While this may portray an idealistic political stance for some, as a film lover and Christian, this opening line created an immediate sense of anti-religious sentiment that I did not expect would vanish later in the film. I was right.So here we meet our protagonist, the person we, as movie-goers, should identify with and root for. Gosling plays Stephen, the second in command for Mike Morris' (Clooney) bid for the Democrat presidential nomination. Surrounded by cynicism and realists, Stephen is a beacon of hope and optimism, proudly proclaiming that Morris is the one, the guy who is going to fix everyone's lives and make this country great again. Of course, we see just how strong that loyalty and faith is when he's fired from the campaign and threatens to bring those (enter explicative here) down, but I'm getting ahead of myself.For the first hour or so of Ides, a shaky and altogether uninteresting drama unfolds through dull performances by the actors and a slow, scattered plot. The thin storyline is also overshadowed by a not-so-subtle tour of liberal theology. Obviously, since the setting is a Democrat campaign, platform issues are going to arise. I don't have a problem with that. I didn't realize it was focused on the Left going in, but I'm a big boy, I can handle it. This was over the top, though. I sat in my seat being slapped in the face with "good and perfect" platform of Clooney's character to end terrorism by removing oil from our lives, how the rich need to pay their fare share and support those who can't support themselves, how religion is a distraction (I told you that wasn't going away!), and how abortion is a woman's right to end an inconvenience. Ides also apparently feels the need to bash the Right while lifting the Left, describing how dirty, underhanded, and desperate they are to win a race at any cost. Needless to say, my face was as dead-panned as the actors'.The film shifts focus after that first hour of liberal propaganda and shows how two-faced and immoral pretty much every character in the film was. Of course, that's my interpretation of events. The film portrays their behavior as being natural, yet self-serving, and showed how all your dreams can come true. All you have to do is lie, cheat, steal, get even, and basically stop at nothing to achieve them. Sure, in the end, Gosling is as jaded and cynical as everyone else, but he's successful. After all, isn't that what all successful people in America are? Seriously, folks, this movie is a waste of time. There isn't a single moral character to mention, they drop so many f-bombs that IMDb couldn't keep count (literally, the site says its somewhere between 50 and 75), the political bias is stifling, and the plot is completely uninteresting. It is impossible to become emotionally invested in anyone, because every character is despicable. I would like to take a moment to clarify, however. Please do not take my criticism as offense. Truth be told, Ides isn't strong enough to be considered offensive, its just bad. There are several decent and enjoyable movies out right now. My advice is to go see anything but The Ides of March!For more of my reviews, visit HallOfFreedomProductions at BlogSpot!</fullReview>

I walked out a few times but in between I did not enjoy one moment of this film, nor did I hear one sentence of interesting dialog, or one moment that had any creative energy to it. as to the acting, which many reviewers liked, I must disagree in that all the major talent gave predictable performances, while the guy playing the protagonist was unappealing. the plot, what there was of it, made no sense, as it seemed to revolve around the hardly scandalous event of two rival campaign strategists meeting. If one watches an intelligent political film like the Best Man, for example, one realizes how far this genre has suffered in recent years, along with politics in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back-Stabbing Politics Behind-the-Politics in American Presidential Campaign--Most Biting Film Since Primary Colors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When political candidates wear their suits, their fine haircuts, and their grins to go in front of the camera, they seem like well-kept up-right people. Few of their constituents know what goes on behind the scenes. Few people knew prior to the breaking of the Watergate scandal that President Nixon regarded political adversaries as enemies and used offensive epithets when referring to them. Few people know that Bill Clinton attacked an aid and threw him to the ground during election night of one of his gubernatorial re-election bids in Arkansas. (That aid has since become a right-wing republican.) And recently, few knew at the time that presidential-hopeful John Edwards was hiding a secret extra-marital affair which is now coming out because of a court case at this writing in April 2012. The Ides of March is about the dark sides of campaign politics exposed.Governor Mike Morris (loosely based on Gov Howard Dean) is just about as ideal as they come in terms of presidential candidates. He's handsome, smart, articulate, and confident. In fact, confidence oozes out of him like toothpaste from a tube. Americans want that in their politicians even more than intelligence. Confidence and good-looks go further than morality and intelligence, albeit with one exception. Americans like to perceive their politicians as moral, especially in regards to their sexual life. As one character will express later, presidents are restricted from certain behaviors, while even doing things like running up national deficits can be forgiven. The only part which is a little fantastical is when Morris says he doesn't believe in God but only the US Constitution. Any presidential hopeful would be roasted alive by other candidates for making such pronouncements.One of his top aids, Stephen Meyers, works for Morris' campaign manager, Paul Zara. They are campaigning in Ohio, one of the final stops on the primary election road. Ohio seems to be slipping from Morris. If he loses Ohio and then loses the next stop, North Carolina, his presidential bid may be over. They need the Senator from North Carolina and former presidential-hopeful Thompson to endorse, but he is reluctant to do so unless he's promised a cabinet post, possibly the Secretary of State. Morris doesn't want to give Thompson this post because he disagrees on his foreign policy. However, if Thompson refuses to endorse Morris and offer his 360 delegates, Morris will be in jeopardy of losing the nomination.Meyers then receives a phone call from the opposition's campaign manager. Unsure what he should do, Meyers agrees to the meeting. Later, Meyers learns a dark secret from one of the interns on the campaign. Both fronts could either derail the entire campaign or jeopardize Meyers position as a top aid to the candidate. All of a sudden, Meyers becomes thrust into the center of a web of political intrigue from which he can't seem to escape.A brilliant film about the dirty laundry of politics. Star and director George Clooney is perfectly cast as the seemingly unflappable presidential candidate. Clooney in interviews related that one of his favorite films is "All the President's Men" which chronicles the investigation by Washington Post reporters who exposed the Watergate Scandal. "Ides of March" is probably Clooney's answer to "All the President's Men", showing an insider's look into the politics behind the politics. Stuff we probably shouldn't see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"An exceptional political film"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney's The Ides of March is an intriguing political thriller. Critiquing the corruption of American democracy, The Ides of March shows how tiring it really is to run a presidential campaign, while alluding to the idea that to win, we may need to abandon our personal idealogies. Starring Ryan Gosling, George Clooney, Paul Giametti and Philip Seymour-Hoffman, The Ides of March is both a thought provoking and entertaining film.Stephen Meyers (Gosling) is the PR guy on a Presdential campaign for Senator Mike Miller (Clooney). He's young, he has experience and a bright future, and he brings in the voters. While on campaign in Ohio, Miller's competitor meets with Meyers and offers him a job. The meeting eventually leaks to the press and damages the Senator's chances at winning the Democratic primary. To make matters more complicated, one of the young women working on the campaign is pregnant with Miller's child. If word of this gets out it would ruin Miller's stint as any kind of political candidate. This just goes to show the two-facedness of political candidates, as Miller seems in all ways to bet he perfect candidate. He's motivated, he believes in the constitution, he's likable, he supports strong moral values, he agrees to freedom of speech and action. However, even a guy like Mike Miller can have a seedy underbelly.Meyer's character is a true believer. He knows that Mike Miller is the only one who will really make a difference in people's lives, and this drives him to fight for Miller's campaign. However, Meyer's idealist views are shattered as he is exposed to the dirty side of politics during the film. While trying to determine his role in the system, he works to quickly mend any problems of Miller's campaign, as if it all falls apart, Meyer's career will be over. The more senior aids on the campaign can always get a job consulting in Washington, but the young Meyers will be hung out to dry if the campaign becomes a PR nightmare.The Ides of March focuses only on a Democratic primary election. In this way it doesn't choose sides in any political argument, but instead appeals to grander themes of politics and democracy than simply pointing the finger at the other party. The feuds which develop, particularly between the Senior Campaign Managers (Seymour-Hoffmann and Giametti) is an interesting one, these two go back a long time but are not hesitant to burn each other in the public eye. The Ides of March provides us with an interesting development of character. Stephen Meyers is perhaps the only central character not realistic at the onset of the film. As he views more and more of the political truth and scandal behind it, he metamorphoses into a colder realist.Ryan Gosling gives a strong performance as Stephen Meyer the idealist PR guy. Clooney is great as Mike Miller, he is very believable as the intelligent and likable presidential candidate, and when things take a turn for the worse Cloonry displays the moral dilemmas Mike Miller faces with the deserved integrity and dignity of such a role. These performances, along with the strong writing, are what make The Ides of March an exceptional political film. It focuses on the themes of politics more than the individual stories of campaigners, differentiating it from other political movies. While both realistic and entertaining, it might make viewers think twice about the face validity of American politics.</fullReview>

And this assertion also means that politics is a perfect topic to explore in a movie: it is only natural to recall Shakespeare and the tensions and emotions of his plays. The topic, I believe, remains underexplored despite the lack of good and fresh ideas obvious in the cinematography now.The Ides of March is based on the play "Farragut North" by Beau Willimon, and the influence of theatre can be sensed throughout the movie. Relatively short at approximately 100 minutes, it sets fantastic example to numerous recent movies in terms of how to keep attention of the audience. Just like in a theatre, the movie throws you right in the middle of the action, gives you a couple of minutes to familiarize yourself and then quickly throw a few problems in, and before you even decide for yourself what would be the best course of action, the movie proceeds to catharsis, leaving you pondering about the nature of human beings.Curious thing: the movie about politics feels more like a good tense action movie. It is like "Drive", but concentrated on people. It can easily leave you breathless for a couple of seconds on some turn of the plot; it is filled with events ? a quality that any moviegoer cherishes after watching slow-paced meaningless dramas.And this is the biggest beauty of this movie: it has everything you may be looking for in a drama. Hopes, ideals, loyalty, betrayal, money, smart people making very smart moves, another smart people trying to outplay the first ones, sweat, blood, tears ? everything is in there. The movie reminds of all the Shakespeare plays taken together and pressed to get a fresh mixed juice. Anybody can find in the movie something close to them, something to resonate with. The story of idealistic PR-man, the rising star of the presidential campaign who sees the dark side of the political battle, contains a lot of small moments for us to recognize ourselves in. Here is the fatal choice, determining our life for years to come. Here is kindness and care about people around us, but which does not really help. Here is a mistake, one little mistake that we will regret. Here are the ideals that we had but which were crushed by merciless reality. The Ides of March tell the story of one fictional guy from America, but by the end of the movie you are looking at your own life story. I think this is something the authors may be proud of.George Clooney is in this movie more as the director than the actor. As the presidential nominee, he doesn't shine; he doesn't show anything outstanding. However, he is solid as director and screenplay writer. The plot holds together perfectly, and every still in the movie is at the right place at the right time. Ryan Gosling as Stephen Meyers is, as opposed to Clooney, shining. Charismatic, convincing and complex ? what else could we ask for? He now has "Drive" and "The Ides of March" in 2011 in his portfolio, and these two performances are truly remarkable.VERDICT: The best movie any drama-lover could wish for. The whole spectrum of human emotions and human problems in one movie. Teenagers and Transformers fans are probably going to be disappointed.m-picturegoer.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My movie buddy and I spent quite some time after watching this talking about what Stephen would do at the press conference. This is a good sign of an interesting movie and we see a lot of them.The things that were so great were Ryan Gosling who I adore anyway portrays a young guy running into his emotions for what I think is probably the first time. Excellent stuff.The whole thing is just what I would imagine life on the campaign trail would be like - a series of moments that just have to be dealt with in one way or another.A great movie, one I would watch again. Well done Ryan for having such a huge range of talent I thought you were awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Beware the ides of March."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides of March, another directorial venture by George Clooney (nominated for the best director at Golden Globes for this movie) is another take on the politics of running for the President of USA. It is a well known fact, that politics is a game only for those who are ready to sleep with the lions, and this movie makes no bones about it. It offers nothing new in terms of the story. But where it deviates from the tried and tested, is the way it presents it and who it presents it through. Here we have the director himself acting out a crucial supporting role while leaving the pivotal role for the now Mr. Dependable ? Ryan Gosling (What a year he has had. Drive, Crazy Stupid Love and now this). He essays the role with considerable dept, at times using only his eyes to depict his emotions. Gosling is supported by a brilliant cast that includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Paul Giamatti &amp; Max Minghella. The cast is helped with a tight screenplay, which the director co-wrote, able background score, excellent cinematography &amp; crisp editing. A special mention for the strong hands of Clooney, who deftly handles this story with a variety of storytelling techniques: sometime letting the background talk through tracking shots (without any characters), and at time mixing it up by depicting conflicting emotions through references and surroundings. Although you know that everyone is out to get this share of the meat, it will still keep you guessing as to who will remain standing in the end. This is what first rate movies are all about, much unlike the unnecessary hamming that we get in out desi fare, in the name of main stream cinema.Watch it and be thoroughly entertained.Title Trivia: The Ides of March was the day (March 15) that Julius Caesar was assassinated. In Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" before being stabbed to death, Julius Caesar is told by a Soothsayer: "Beware the ides of March."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this film I didn't want to see it because I'm not a fan of George Clooney really and saw that he was writing directing and producing it. Some actors like Tyler Perry make not so great movies. But Clooney is no Tyler Perry and manages to direct, write produce and star in his own film. Basically it's a political movie or whatever you want to call it. That all I'm saying. The cast is impressive Ryan Gosling is perfect as the lead role too bad he didn't get any Oscar noms for this. Other cast members such as Evan Rachel Wood, Paul Giamatti, Marisa Tomei, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Jennifer Ehle. She has very little screen time sadly along with Jeffrey Wright.This film is definitely worth checking out on DVD 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A political melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides of March isn't a political thriller, although it may have faired better at one. If anything, it's a study of the mechanics in a presidential candidate's cabinet. It shows us the background and the inter-workings of a man on the campaign trail, rather than blatantly focusing on the person running for office.Despite being written and directed by George Clooney, he chooses to set his sights on Ryan Gosling's Stephen Meyers, a young campaign manager for the idealistic liberal Mike Morris (Clooney) who is the Governor of Pennsylvania seeking the role as President of the United States. His competition is the Arkansas Senator, Ted Pullman, played excellently by Michael Mantell. Both are about to take part in a very heated primary in Ohio, where everything is on the line.Morris's campaign is made up of cynics including a marvelous Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the Senior campaign leader. Hoffman's character believes that the most important thing about every human being is trust. Meyers disobeys that rule by agreeing to meet with Pullman's campaign manager Tom Duffy (Giamatti). Not to mention, Meyers also becomes romantically involved with Molly, played by an all grown up Evan Rachel Wood, an intern working for Morris.It's not surprising that The Ides of March was originally a stage play tilted Farragut North by Beau Willimon. There are very lengthy monologues that sometimes span longer than five minutes. George Clooney tries as hard as he can to not make them feel monotonous by adding a number of different camera angles and a catchy score, and that works favorably for the most part.The performances, from people with all different backgrounds and ages, are remarkable. This is one of the many political dramas in recent years, but it stands out for its incredible, ensemble team of stars. Everyone does an exceptional job, including Gosling who has tried pretty much every genre on for size in 2011.Despite what is brought to the table in grand amounts, The Ides of March still lacks a bit more than one would believe judging from the plot and cast. The film is a little slow, and sometimes takes a little bit to pick up. The cast has wonderful chemistry, the cinematography is anything but dull, yet sometimes, the film seems to be a bit lengthy. Also, it doesn't seem like the film broke any new ground. With such an incredible dream cast, and with an A-list actor directing and writing, we're under the impression that we'd see something new with The Ides of March. Sadly, everything is a bit familiar.What drops the nail in the coffin as to why the film isn't perfect is the unbelievable ending. It's truly one of the shallowest cop-outs in a long time. Still, it doesn't completely derail what was a very good film. The casting is pitch perfect, the acting is wonderful, and the dialog is delivered, most of the time, with zest and flavor. It's just a shame more care and attention wasn't put into the creativity field.Starring: Ryan Gosling, George Clooney, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Marisa Tomei, Jeffrey Wright, and Evan Rachel Wood. Directed by: George Clooney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most certainly a movie that will take down George Clooney and Ryan Gosling into the big leagues of Director and the next promising legend in Hollywood!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when one starts to accept its lights out for George Clooney, here he is again right back on his feet with a 4 time nomination at the 2012 Golden Globe Awards for his production THE IDES OF MARCH. Sadly the night did not go well for THE IDES OF MARCH however surprisingly well for Clooney. Clooney bagged in the award for the Best performance by an actor in a Motion Picture ? Drama Category for his performance in THE DESCENDANTS (That which I have not yet seen; hence I would not pass any verdict) however my personal favorite of the evening is indeed The Man of the Year Ryan Gosling. Both who put up a magnificent, precise and convincing performances alongside with Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman in THE IDES OF MARCH and that alone will for certain make it a worthy contender at the Oscars come Feb 26th 2012. The nominations are already out and rest assured there are multiple holdings on THE IDES OF MARCH. Isn't this alone good enough a reason to consider this a must watch? There is always a negative vibe that the audiences receive when you say that it's a Drama. Most would feel it isn't the best of ways to spend the weekend or your money for that matter. Then there is the female audience who always would rightly prefer to turn their heads if it has anything to do with politics. So how do you sell such a production? Timing is vital. The Screen play for THE IDES OF MARCH was initially done in the year 2008 and with the win of President Obama to the white house the appeal for such a distrustful themed movie would not have sold well with all the celebration of the change that arrived to America. It is after all called the filming industry and where there isn't money there indeed isn't hope. Now at a time with elections around the corner is the time they have decided to bring this to the theatres. Smart isn't it?Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney) and Senator Pullman (Michael Mantell) both with the potential of being the next presidential candidate are fair players. The kind of individual one would prefer to lead the nation. Paul (Philip Seymour Hoffman) campaign manager to Mayor Morris and Duffy (Paul Giamatti) campaign manager to the senator have their own game of dirty politics planned out. Hoffman and Giamatti are shrewd and evil. This is some sharp characterization by the director and the actors themselves. There isn't much of build in the characters as much as there is an outburst of corruption in them. They do not begin as fair players in the trade, the stand out as the best and definitely the finest in what they do; this certainly explains why they got the job with the top dogs. Stephen (Ryan Gosling) on the other hand is a newbie by age and looks considering the wrinkles the majors' sport. He isn't as much of a newbie as much as he is a game winner. If he believes in the cause he will fight till the end. Sounds a pretty scarce breed in the arena of politics of today! Ryan Gosling is indeed the movie. He is there from the beginning through till the end. In every single frame if I am not mistaken. It disheartens me that he missed out at the Golden Globes. Maybe an Oscar perhaps? Ryan's character of Stephen undergoes large magnitudes of turmoil in the presidential trail. He sports frustration, lust, confusion, betrayal and being betrayed. Stephen grows through the 101 minutes of playtime. If he grows into a better or a worse direction isn't that much of a hard choice to make. Yet when you consider the game of politics at times the direction he chooses seems always the only option.Most certainly a movie that will take down George Clooney and Ryan Gosling into the big leagues of Director and the next promising legend in Hollywood!Title: The Ides of March Directed by : George Clooney Starring: George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman &amp; Paul Giamatti Rated: R for pervasive language Rating: 08/10 101 Minutes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Electoral Films Year Has Begun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2012 is an electoral year in the United States, and every electoral year is preceded by a few months by the electoral films year. It must be a few months in advance which makes the electoral films year be a little different than the calendar year, but, hey, we do have the financial year, not to speak about various religious years and all are different. There are at least two good reasons for the electoral films year being different than the calendar year - the Oscars season, of course, and the fact than by June or September the real thing becomes too interesting for the Americans to care about movies any longer. So the time to watch electoral movies is about now, and The Ides of March is probably the first significant movie of electoral films year 2012.George Clooney is again here in front of the cameras as democratic presidential candidate governor Morris and behind the cameras as the director of Ides of March. I liked his work in Good Night, and Good Luck and I liked it here again. He has a precise hand, a good cinematographic feel, is inspired in casting and directs well his actors. However the show is completely stolen by Ryan Gosling, the actor who seems to dominate the season and is better and better each film I see him in. In a focused performance Gosling succeeds to bring to screen the vision, the hope, the doubts, the ambitions of political manager Stephen Meyers who in a matter of a few campaign days apparently makes the transition from idealism to real-politik campaigner and has to decide on the delicate balance between personal truth and the greater goals of politics. Philip Seymour Hoffman who has disappeared from my radar screen after a few great roles is back with a key role in the story, Marisa Tomei has a smaller role than I would have liked but it's always a pleasure to see her, Paul Giamati and Evan Rachel Wood are fine in a balanced and well directed cast. The Ides of March works well without being astonishing.Passionates of the genre and of American politics, George Clooney and Ryan Gosling's fans will all love the film. The rest of us can watch it as a reasonably well made and well acted political thriller, and as a story of political coming-to-age in today's American system, as well as an undeniable sign that the electoral films year has really started. There is one story line which seemed all by neglected to me and this is the personal tragedy of the young intern which is just a pretext in the development of the drama of the main characters. For once I think that what this movie lacks is a small dose of melodrama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan Gosling is 3 for 3 in 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is only one thing I value in this world and that's loyalty; without it you're nothing!  This is the third 2011 film starring Ryan Gosling and I must say he does a great job at choosing his roles because all his movies this year were really great. He also has done very diverse roles, and this time he plays an idealistic media consultant for a presidential candidate who he admires (played by George Clooney). This is a political film that teaches us how the campaign trail works, but it also has very intense and surprising moments. I'm not a fan of political movies, but the actors and the story make Ides of March a really interesting and entertaining film. It does get the message across of how dirty politics can sometime corrupt even the most idealistic and well intentioned people. Ides of March does this very well, and it couldn't be any other way considering George Clooney directed this piece and also contributed with the adaptation of the screenplay. The last time Clooney worked on a screenplay was in 2005 when he directed the six time Oscar nominated film Good Night and Good Luck. He did a terrific job once again with the script although he had some help from Beau Willimon who actually wrote the play in which this film is loosely based, Farragut Night. The performances in this film are also great. You can't go wrong when you have the talents of George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Evan Rachel Wood, and Marisa Tomei. This is an all star cast and the movie would be worth watching for the performances alone, but the script is also pretty strong so this is one of the films you won't want to miss this year.Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is working in the democratic nomination campaign for presidential candidate Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney) as his media consultant. Stephen is young, but very experienced and is the best at his position. Stephen's boss is Paul Zara (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who also is his personal mentor and the campaign manager. They are currently in the Ohio primaries where the race is tight between Morris and his other democratic rival, Senator Pullman (Michael Mantell). Pullman also has a very smart campaign manager who is doing his best to keep him in the fight: Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti). Duffy doesn't always fight clean, he is experienced and knows how dirty politics works. Paul Zara believes the key to winning resides in the endorsement from Senator Thompson (Jeffrey Wright), but Pullman's people have made him a very tempting offer which Governor Mike Morris is not willing to counter offer. Morris is idealistic and doesn't want to buy his way into the Presidential office by making offers to senators with whom he doesn't agree. This is one of the things that Meyers admires about Morris: his honesty and integrity. During the campaign trail Meyers has a relationship with an intern, Molly (Evan Rachel Wood), and soon realizes that not everything is what it seems. There is a twist that I don't want to give away here, but the movie then takes an unexpected turn. This is where the emotion begins and the movie picks up from here.Ides of March may start off slow, but it's just a delight to see these actors work together with a decent story. I wasn't disappointed one bit, and even though I am not into politics I found myself drawn by the story. I couldn't predict what was going to happen either since the movie takes some interesting turns involving deceptions and dirty politics. Even the most idealistic people can be corrupted by the political game and the movie makes its point. Ides of March is really worth seeing, even if you're not into politics, because the story is engaging, the performances are great, and George Clooney never disappoints as a director. Paul Giamatti and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are always at their best, and these kinds of roles are where they excel. Ryan Gosling has had one of the best years of his life career wise: Crazy, Stupid Love, Drive, and now Ides of March; they're all great films and Gosling gives strong performances in each. My favorite film this year so far is Drive, and his performance is just captivating in that movie. Ides of March is a movie you have to see, you won't regret it.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Towards its script and its design, this is a very delicately made film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is a campaign manager for Democratic presidential candidate Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney). He is extremely optimistic about Morris' progressive values and says that he will support anything as long as he believes it. Stephen is employed under the watch of Paul (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who values loyalty most and is precariously trying to sway a senator (Jeffrey Wright) for his support so that they can take the crucial state of Ohio. Friction arises when Stephen has talks with rival democrat campaigner Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti), who wants to hire him and promote his own candidate. This meeting is somehow traced by a hungry reporter in Ida (Marisa Tomei). Meanwhile, Stephen becomes loosely involved with Molly (Evan Rachel Wood), who is also hiding something. Despite the enormity of the cast, The Ides of March is a modestly produced and tautly written political thriller. It throws us into the deep end of American politics and for outsiders this can be daunting. This is because much of the dialogue in the film, though occasionally witty and funny, is also highly loaded. It is essential to read between the lines here and that leaves us on the outskirts from many of these ambiguous characters. The detail placed on single lines of dialogue remains purposeful and requires our full attention. When Stephen asks how old a character is there are more subtle implications as they suss and test each other out. Accurately, it reminds us of how cautiously people in this domain have to tread in both their public and private lives. The battle is here not fought between conflicting parties of opposition but the single regime of the Democrats. It is ironic to see such infighting because we know they will present a united front to the public come the Presidential election. The facade of the characters is reflected through the film's subtle aesthetic design. Many scenes, such as the opening in a hall and a late confrontation in a restaurant, are cast in deep shadows. It gives the film and the characters a classic noir feel of mistrust and uncertainty. Contrastingly, day time scenes are photographed down long, cold brick corridors or behind panes of glass, contributing a sense of a highly isolated work environment. Towards its script and its design, this is a very delicately made film.Although the start of the film is distancing and cold, a clever twist in the plot sees the narrative hit its straps. From this point the film becomes deeply entrenched with human power plays of loyalty, friendship and expendability. Due to the flawless casting and performances many of the intense confrontations, particularly late in the film, are of the highest order. Gosling has proved that this year that he has the range to not only play any type of role but to sustain his work at such a consistently high and entertaining level. He's exceptional again, with his role closer to the one he played in Half Nelson, as a man who is gradually deteriorating from the inside out. As Stephen's status gradually declines, the apparentness of his fear makes the performance human and compelling. Clooney again finds a way to tap into his own celebrity image because beneath the smiles and sincerity of his character is someone dark and entirely ruthless. The force in both of their performances peaks during a riveting showdown that reaches palpable levels of tension. Giamatti and Hoffman are in fine touch but Evan Rachel Wood holds her own too as the most vulnerable kind of damsel in distress. Closing the film is an ending that is part Shakespearean tragedy, hence the title taken from "Julius Caesar", but also Faust as well. It does not reach a high emotional peak but it's still a straight reminder of how quickly people are willing to sell their own moral and ethical values. We already knew that and it will not change the world but as long as cinema returns to a mature state of reminding us of the failure of human nature, like it does here, we're happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good Political Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually I only review pictures that I find are deeply flawed, but this one marches right through any slip ups. All the characters are believable; the political interchange and personalities are pretty much what I've seen in 20 years of campaigns. George plays the stereotypic Democratic candidate who is out to save the world but can't manage his zipper. Hoffman and Giamatti are exactly like guys I know in their jobs and are bang on. And the hopeful up and coming 30 and unders are just as randy and ambitious as such staffers are want to be. (Politics is Hollywood for the homely, they say). Only flaw is that when Molly leaves the movie, she leaves behind pill bottles for pain killers that were prescribed by an abortion clinic. Now Cinci / Kentucky coppers are out in the country... but are sharp enough to have probably noticed this and someone would have leaked it and the whole complexion of the picture would have changed. George is a little bit wishful if he thinks a US Presidential candidate could be successful in declaring himself an atheist - could never happen. 100% electric vehicles? Impossible, but the idea of requiring every kid to take on a two year public service requirement would give him my vote. Overall I give George a pass on the few goofs, overall it was a terrific watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sleek political drama which boasts of a solid cast and perfect performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is quite clear, isn't it? That this American political drama thriller film is an Oscar bait that will bag a few nominations at next year's Academy Awards. If the story of an idealistic campaign manager for a presidential candidate getting a lowdown on dirty politics isn't enough to hook the folks behind the prestigious awards, the stars headlining this movie will.The ensemble cast is made up of stars who have either won, or been nominated for an Oscar. Ryan Gosling (Half Nelson) plays the optimistic staffer running a campaign for George Clooney's (Syriana) Democratic presidential candidate. The senior campaign manager portrayed by Capote's (2005) Phillip Seymour Hoffman goes head on with Cinderella Man's (2006) Paul Giamatti. Elsewhere, there is a nosey New York Times reporter played by Marisa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny) to make the political drama more interesting. Other familiar faces include Jeffrey Wright and Evan Rachel Wood, who take on the roles of a senator and a sexy intern respectively.Based on Beau Williamson's 2008 play Farragut North, this adaptation sees Gosling's central character experiencing a roller coaster ride of twists and turns as a political scandal threatens to upset a campaign he once strongly believed in. With conspiracy themes and sneaky plots abound, this 101 minute film will go down well with viewers who get a kick out of dramas which uncover politics' deepest and darkest secrets.After Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), Good Night, and Good Luck (2005) and Leatherheads (2008), Clooney's sure handed direction is evident in his fourth feature film effort. Because this screenplay is based on a stage play, there isn't much visual flair to entice the audience. However, Phedon Papamichael's (3:10 to Yuma, The Pursuit of Happiness) cinematography is engaging enough to have you paying attention to what's happening on screen. Complemented by Stephen Morrione's (Biutiful, The Informant!) crisp editing and Alexandre Desplat's (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, The King's Speech) aptly tense score, the production values of this highly recommended movie is top notch.Of course, this wouldn't have been possible by the perfect ensemble which the filmmakers have gathered for this otherwise atypical political drama. Gosling once again proves that he is the star to look out for with his seamless portrayal of an idealistic man who gradually realises the filth he is involved in. Clooney doesn't provide much surprise here, with his signature suave image (nicely fitted suit and all) as the presidential candidate with a secret to hide.Seymour Hoffman and Giamatti are wonderfully unassuming in the movie, playing campaign managers from opposite camps. Tomei is also unexpectedly commendable here (come on, which one of you out there actually think she deserved that Best Supporting Actress Oscar statuette?), especially when she has limited screen time as the inquisitively curious writer. Also, watch out for Rachel Wood's seductive performance as the intern who changes the political game.While this may not be the cleverest political movie you've seen, its heavyweight cast and solid performances are enough to grip your senses from start to finish. When the film ends with an expectedly dark tone, you'd be suitably impressed with Clooney's sleek production, and begin to predict which categories this dark drama would be nominated in at the upcoming Academy Awards.- www.moviexclusive.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Monica Lewinsky moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's less to this movie than meets the eye. What mainly meets (and gladdens!) the eye is gorgeous George Clooney playing a charismatic John Kennedy-ish governor running for the Democratic nomination in the near-future Presidential primaries. Co-managing his campaign with hardened cynic Philip Seymour Hoffman is idealistic young Ryan Gosling. Governor Clooney is running on a "make-America-greener/no-more-war" ticket that almost invites the cinema audience to cheer along with the on-screen listeners.But - surprise, surprise - the Governor turns out to have feet of clay. There is - oh, no - a 'Monica Lewinsky' moment (offscreen). Young Ryan (he's meant to be 30 but looks about 22) is being wooed by George's opponent and must decide what to do with the nugget of dirt he now has on the Governor.We have been here before. A tarnished idol in the race for high office. Notable examples include ADVISE AND CONSENT, THE BEST MAN and several years of THE WEST WING on TV (Jed Bartlett, the best president America never had). THE IDES OF MARCH is adapted from a stage play and still feels very theatrical. Clooney co-wrote and directed it. The lighting is especially fine: lots of face-to-face scenes in dim corridors. And the acting is first class. Clooney will have an easier time of it than Ronnie Reagan if he ever does make a run for the White House. Ryan Gosling seems competent but a tad bland; will he be as charismatic as George in years to come? (Probably not, but you never know: look at Tom Cruise.)This is a slick piece of movie-making; more style than substance but highly watchable. The will he?/won't he? ending is extremely satisfying. In the real world you know exactly how this would play out, but the movie targets our higher aspirations (and then, as in the real world, pisses all over them).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film brilliantly acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this film was first-class and would recommend anyone interested in politics or the behaviour human beings in a powerful and highly-charged work place, to go to their nearest cinema. If you are interested in both then you really are in luck.The acting by all concerned was excellent with special mention to Ryan Gosling who was superb.Coming from England, when "celebrities" endorse a particular political party, half the time the public either mock them or take not the slightest notice. So maybe it is seen as more significant in the United States? Certainly the word has reached us over here that Clooney is a committed Democrat.That said, as someone heavily involved in the film both on and off the screen, he does his Party no favours here, which is how it should be in a balanced film. The tricks his "spin doctors" resort to, remind me, not in every scenario but generally speaking, of certain people in a recent previous government in this country. Probably in other countries too, some worse than others.For all of these people the ends justified the means, however nasty, to further their political philosophy, which they feel will enhance the lot of their fellow citizens. Listen out for the lady journalist near the beginning of the film which cleverly sets the tone for the remainder,outlining her scepticism of the idealistic Party worker. She probably speaks for the audience as the film progresses.This is a very good piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Clooney's new picture is proof that the movies can redeem even the most dull and uninteresting of subject matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney plays a central supporting role in "The Ides of March" but his most important contribution to the picture is what he does standing behind the camera. From Beau Willimon's play "Farragut North" he, Mr. Willimon, and Grant Heslov have fashioned a picture that stands several tiers above what I was expecting of it. It is proof, as far as I am concerned, that the old theory that the movies can redeem any subject matter for any viewer is hard and solid as concrete.I am not the biggest fan of politics. For me, it's always been sort of a sophomoric mudslinging match between well-tailored stiffs with very little really being accomplished, or even attempted to be accomplished in-between. Politics has been annoying whenever it's not just plain dull for this viewer, but "The Ides of March" manages to weave an interesting and informative story about the dirty, unethical things that take place whenever those fine-tailored stiffs are not muttering pseudointellectual mumbo-jumbo on their stands.The picture reaffirms my belief that they only believe half of what they are really saying, and that it is more of a mudslinging match. Here we have Ryan Gosling as a political campaigner working to get a oily-tongued governor into the office of president. In the midst of dodging and contending with reporters and rivals from the opposing party, Mr. Gosling finds himself in the bed of a pretty young intern (the always enchanting Evan Rachel Wood) and from there explodes a scandal of such proportions that it destroys his composure, his career, and his relationships with those close to him.We all read about political scandals in the newspaper everyday, but what makes "The Ides of March" such a great film is the way it exploits and delves into the dynamics involved. Half the time when I read an article in the New York Times or U.S.A. Today about an event like the one depicted here, I am left to speculate just how in the world something as astronomically common as an extra-marital affair would spiral into a world of absolute insanity beyond the betrayers' household. Half a century ago, nobody would have cared (do you recall J.F.K. and Marilyn Monroe and how little fuss anybody kicked up over that one?). The movie takes this into account and allowed me to believe in what was happening. It shed a little light on what I read in the paper every day.That's also what makes "The Idea of March" so efficient a time-passer: the amount of information that it has to offer. How campaigners work, how they prepare for speeches, how they spiff up and communicate with the figure they are trying to promote. As the director, Mr. Clooney wisely limits his screen time in order to provide more information for the supporting figures so easily overlooked and when he does appear, he is commanding the screen since like the character he plays, is ultimately the one whom the whole paradox revolves around. The screenplay is also so intelligently-written that "old hat speeches" about trust and betrayal are absolutely gripping. There's a scene where the campaign manager, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman (who seems to have played this part as a way to comeback for his degenerized work in the disappointing and impersonal "Moneyball") gives a sixty-second lecture to Mr. Gosling about the values of trust over friendship in a campaign and it's absolutely startling. Not only line is corny, not one syllable out of place."The Ides of March" is a hard film to really discuss without giving too much away, which I certainly do not want to do, since I want those who have not seen it to be as surprised as I was. Apart from what I've already said, I will warn those that the ending of the picture does come a bit suddenly and will leave some wanting a little more. But what comes before that, especially in the last twenty minutes or so, is some of the best writing, directing, and acting that has been seen in the otherwise unimpressive year of 2011.Comments on the cast.Mr. Gosling, a wonderful actor, is perfectly-cast as the campaigner who appears to throw his career away and then aggressively fights to get it back. Mr. Hoffman, as I said earlier, is superb and makes a memorable performance out of a part so many could have just done averagely. Miss Wood, as always, is enchanting, sympathetic, and strong in her portrayal as the intern. Paul Giamitti, using sharp dialogue and terrific expressions in his eyes, is conniving as a rival worker. Marisa Tomei, impossible to recognize beyond her acting ability, is in-character and sharp as a scandal reporter out to ruin Mr. Gosling's day. And I must not leave out writer/director/star George Clooney whose multifaceted talents obviously contributed a lot to the production."The Ides of March" is one of the best movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpleasant political drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A presidential candidate (George Clooney), his top aide (Ryan Gosling), and a young female staffer (Evan Rachel Wood) are the focus of this depressing political drama. Though utterly charming, the candidate is shown to have feet of clay, involved in a dangerous triangle with the other two.On the Ides of March, Julius Caesar was assassinated; in this Ides of March, we see the death of political idealism. This is most definitely not a date movie or a chick flick; it exposes the immoral underbelly of some political movers and shakers and shows them to be pretty repulsive characters. There are no heroes here. The acting was excellent all around, but the story is so grim and the characters so repellent I couldn't wait for it to end. There were a few very interesting scenes, but a lot of it was quite dull.I felt like shaking my head and giving up on all politicians when the movie was over. A good character study, but a definite downer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Happy Birthday to Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I liked George Clooney's latest, The Ides of March, he did an even better job (other than directing, starring and writing) of letting Ryan take the lead.Well, it really was Ryan Gosling's movie, and (looking a little too thin) Clooney made sure he did take center stage. And that was a wise and entertaining choice.Here's the problem: The movie preaches to the queer. OK, well, not everyone ? or Michele Bachmann wouldn't be anywhere in the poles, let alone any of the other recent Republican candidates? but I digress, the movie's message is to *gulp* say politics are DIRTY?Yeah, I know that. Luckily, that's not the only thing the movie's got going for it ? and I'm sure all the equally wonderful things will, at very least, get the movie a nod for Best Picture of 2010 at the Oscars. It has a fantastic and extensive cast that all do their very best while no one really steals the spotlight, ? la A Few Good Men. (Sure, in that case it was Tom chewing up the scenery as does Ryan here, but, overall, everyone's pretty much equal.) It has realistic writing, great cinematography and fun twists.Now, that said, again, it boils down to, SHOCKER, politics (notice: I didn't say POLICITIANS) is bad, mmmkay. It was spoiled to me, and I guess I'm doing the same here?that there's a twist. My buddy and I ? unbelievably, we were the ONLY TWO in the theatre when this was shown ? were both trying to guess (outloud) what the turning point would be and we agreed on one and, alas, were wrong.We were so convinced that I didn't see the real one coming. That made for good entertainment, but again?it's not really a big SURPRISE that Politicians (yeah, I used that word, this time) can do some bad things.Overall, I liked the movie ? it showed real humans and a few actual behind-the-scenes of a political campaigns, Republican or Democrat, and it's worth a viewing. Perfect, oh God no. Great, eh. It wasn't The Contender or All the President's Men, but then not many politician thrillers are.Side Note: Oh, my headliner's an inside joke and a bit of trivia?See if you can guess my Birthday?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stimulating and smart drama with some sad truths to reveal about politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It might not be an election year, but politics never take a break from being cutthroat. "The Ides of March" peels back the curtain on election campaigns, in this case those of two Democrats vying for their party's nomination. Based on the play "Farragut North" by Beau Willimon, who had a hand in the screenplay, "Ides" tells you everything you've always assumed but chosen to remain ignorant of regarding the political machine. Frank and whip- smart if not a bit esoteric, George Clooney's latest directorial effort provides ample intellectual fodder bolstered by a terrific ensemble.Clooney plays Michael Morris, a North Carolina governor and political idealism incarnate, essentially a caricature of Obama rhetoric (though the 2008 play was based loosely on the Howard Dean campaign). But he's not the focus: Rather it's his main staffer, Stephen, (Ryan Gosling) who gets the spotlight ,as well as campaign manager Paul (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Morris simply serves as that point of reference reminding us what the polished exterior of a political campaign looks feels like.The seemingly omnipresent Gosling utilizes his fittingly Clooney-like charisma as Stephen, but without milking it. His character's "loss of political innocence" and consequent sharp left turn end up much more believable. Stephen is a hotshot who's far from a rookie in attitude and behavior, but hasn't been through the grinder like campaign manager Paul and their rival, Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti).Stephen still has his convictions, for example, believing completely in his candidate and the Kool-aid he's serving. So he finds himself in a bit of trouble when he agrees to a meeting with Duffy and learns some valuable information that could completely tilt a pivotal Ohio primary that's just one week away. With his loyalty in question after his meeting leeks to their chummy reporter at the New York Times (Marisa Tomei), Stephen also starts an affair with a campaign intern named Molly (Evan Rachel Wood) and later learns a secret that will make him question all of it."Ides" takes the viewer behind the scenes into an ugly and somewhat superficial world. There's a bit of a soap-opera glamorization to various elements of the plot (affairs, back- stabbing, deception, etc.), but the actors hold it down with integrity. Vets Hoffman and Giamatti in particular give the film its backbone as two hard-nosed guys as blunt as the film's feelings on politics. Gosling and Wood demonstrate as much talent as any young actors working today, though Gosling's stardom should be a foregone conclusion at this point.Clooney excels at taking us on Stephen's journey and creating accessibility where the script lays on thick jargon. Various scenes that simply show Morris out on the campaign delivering a speech seem to meander, but Clooney understands that we must be exposed enough to Morris' public image to identify with that glitzy side of politics we get every couple years. Therefore, when all the new "info" comes to light, our perspective of Morris transforms so drastically it's fascinating to track."The Ides of March" asks that we accept certain truths about human nature and shows how the nature of politics feeds on some of our darker and more self-serving inclinations. Even as we take up arms along with Stephen's crusade to correct the (arguable) injustices thrust upon him, we can't help but to admit he has far from the clean record that a typical protagonist carries. Some might see the film's end as the beginning of a new chapter cut short, but it holds out hope that cycles of corruption feeding corruption do have the power to end.~Steven CCheck out my site, moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cruel world of politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie displays the cruel world of politics. One sees in the movie the leverage plays, dirty tricks, and dishonesty of the political game. The loyal good guy is destroyed by the ruthless player. Politicians compromise their values and sell out in the end. I believe this movie has some merit in being true. I found the movie too dark for my tastes. However, I like how the movie shows politicians and the political machine as liars. The whole screen play is set up when one of the rival politicians pulls a dirty trap on the other party organizers. I like the line Hoffman says I'd rather take a less talented man who is loyal over a talented man. Trust is a valued commodity. I believe that is a good message, which the movie shows will not seem to fit in with politics. I give the movie a six out of ten. Too dark of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Godfather for political lobbyists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides of March zeroes in on the rise and fall of Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling), media relations manager for the campaign of presidential hopeful Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney). Although Morris is a nominally a Democrat, his political allegiance is immaterial. The film's core question is whether changing the person at the top makes any difference - is Morris a paradigm shifting candidate you can believe in, or is he just the same old wolf in particularly well tailored sheep's clothing? The source material Beau Williams' 2008 play Farragut North named after a metro station which serves K Street, the dark heart of Washington DC's political lobbying industry, and loosely based on Howard Dean's bid for the 2004 Democratic Presidential nomination. It's no small irony (on several levels) that Williams, who worked with Clooney to adapt his own play, himself later worked as a press secretary for Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign. Initially Ides feels overwhelmingly like a campaign trailer for Clooney's own run for elected office (despite numerous denials both before and after the release of Ides that he harbours any kind of political ambition). It's hard not to interpret Ides as a 2012 warm-up ahead for Obama, if not Clooney when it's so liberally peppered with Vote Morris campaign materials that so ostentatiously mimic Obama's 2008 posters, right down to the pithy one-word slogans. Rousing stump speeches are strewn across the film: clarion calls for clean power, ending American dependence on oil and restoring the US to it's rightful position as world leader could all be drawn from Democratic Campaigning 101. Interestingly, with hindsight, the film even appears to keep a distance between the feel good flag waving of Morris' public campaign, and the cynical manoeuvrings taking place behind the scenes. It's only a third of the way in, once the film starts to mine a rich vein of cynicism that it becomes clear that this is no rabble rousing, feel good cheerleading effort. After initial scenes of bonhomie and even a whiff of romance, the rug is swiftly pulled out from under the audience as Morris and his public campaign move offscreen, becoming a catalyst rather than a locus for the film's backroom action. Likewise, and even more symbolically, the three female characters (Marisa Tomei's hard nosed journalist, Rachel Evan Wood's out-of-her-depth intern, and Jennifer Ehle's criminally pared down appearance as the governor's wife) are bit players, and occasionally pawns. It's a disheartening echo of reality in which journalists, candidates and women (more often what they're wearing rather than doing or thinking) may seem to make the headlines, but the real power broking is done in the shadows, behind closed doors, and on remote park benches between anonymous (and almost entirely male) figures. On the plus side, as rival campaign managers, Paul Giamatti and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are given free rein to chew up the scenery whenever they appear on screen, even as they disabuse us of any lingering belief we might naively hold in the fairness of a democratic system.However, there's no denying that it's Gosling's sensational turn which gives the film its centre of gravity.His metamorphosis from a superficially cynical but naive believer, to a deadened manipulator (warning: pretentious film analysis ahead) that serves as a depressingly fitting metaphor for modern Western political democracy. It's a powerhouse performance, and his transformation from sleepy eyed charmer to dead eyed power broker can be justly compared to Al Pacino's rise and fall and rise in The Godfather (the final shot of Ides is eerily reminiscent of Pacino's final blank eyed expression in Coppola's classic). Gosling deploys his trademark internalised style to devastating effect, a muted performance that makes his Bambi eyed response when his house of cards starts tumbling down all the more painful to watch. For all it's subtlety, it's at least as layered as some of the more bombastic performances, adorned with Obama-esque body language and fleeting twitches in facial expression. But what really differentiates Ides from the (many) politically inspired films before it is the refusal to sugar the pill. Visually Ides doffs its cap to the stoic investigative and campaigning films of the Seventies, as the colours and sets reflect the growing bleakness of the films events (the end credits look as though they belong to a film starring Warren Beatty or Gene Hackman in their heyday). But by eschewing the paranoia of films like Nixon or The Parallax View, and the cynical humour of Primary Colours, Wag the Dog or Bulworth, Ides delivers an even bigger sucker punch.Ides strips away the usual Hollywood figleaves to expose the dirty reality of the complicated mind games being played in pursuit of dubious ideals (one of the many quandaries of the film being whether ugly wrongs can be overlooked in the name of what is right). Even more refreshingly, it refuses to spoonfeed moviegoers the narratively convenient answers to such questions. Go for the performances and Clooney's bleakly assured direction, but prepare to have the curtain pulled back to reveal something very ugly - you definitely won't be in Kansas any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Political movie making at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides of March is to the USA what Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is to England.Each country's respective A teams line up to impress us with what they can respectively muster.It's a hopeless non contest. Aided mostly by the fact that the American material is richly plotted and deeply absorbing whereas the English mire themselves in dense sub plotting that renders the whole thing indigestible.The Ides of March is outstanding. George Clooney, overlooked by many critics in this role because he is not always the centre of attention, plays Governor Mike Morris, a Democratic presidential candidate (complete with Obamaesque marketing materials) so well that you would unquestionably believe it if Clooney announced tomorrow that he was running for the real presidency. And hell, if Schwarzeneger can run California and Reagan was good enough for the White House; why not Clooney? So let's clear up one thing from the off. Clooney is immense. Clooney is one of America's greatest ever movie actors and this is a subtly downplayed 'best of George Clooney' performance. Not only that; he directed it, wrote it and produced it. Is there nothing he can't do? Playing opposite King C is his heir apparent, Ryan Gosling. Gosling is the central fulcrum of this brilliant movie but he has a safety blanket of complete and utter class: Phillip Seymour Hoffman as his world weary boss, Paul Giammatti as his boss' direct adversary, Marisa Tomei as a grubby Wall Street Hack, Evan Rachel Wood as the love interest (well, love would be stretching it. Let's just call it lust.). All are superb, and it's great to see Giamatti not playing a buffoon for a change.But let's focus on Gosling for a second. Gosling can not put a foot wrong right now. I fancy him for at least two Oscar nominations this year for this role and for Drive. He has so stormed the Hollywood A list as to make it his own (Clooney beware) and you see him only getting even better if he can keep his eye on great roles in truly great movies. In Ides of March he sweeps through the movie with ease, just as in Drive he starts out all likable and decent but as it progresses his darker side emerges. I the case of Ides it all centres around his "affair" with 20 (or is it 19) year old intern Molly Stearn played seductively By Evan Rachel Wood.It seems that interns are both forbidden fruit and fair game in equal measure (Monica Lewinsky anybody?). Her sleeping with Gosling (who plays Morris' deputy campaign manager Stephen Myers) sets of a chain of events that it would be unfair of me to reveal. Suffice it to say the last half hour has more twists and turns than a slinky on a spiral staircase. It's gripping.This is a very fine piece of modern American cinema, the fact that is adapted from the stage makes it well crafted and honed to perfection. Expect serious rewards in the Ides of February in the Kodak Theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ides of March should garner buzz for Oscar nominations for Ryan Gosling, and is one of the best films of the year, easily making top ten lists for 2011.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney's foray into directing has been nothing short of a resounding success. Good Night, and Good Luck showcased the finest acting performances of 2005 in an enthralling slow burn. Clooney's previous effort, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, gave the world Sam Rockwell's finest performance (yes, edging even Moon). Clooney's motif asks what smart men do under arduous circumstances, and his strength is the space he gives his actors to shine, often by limiting his on-screen time.With The Ides of March, Clooney has once again crafted a taught situational dynamic of ethics and morality, choosing the modern political landscape as his canvas. The Ides of March is another worthy effort in Clooney's resum, and gives his lead one of the best performances of his career, allowing Ryan Gosling to captivate and charm with seemingly effortless ease amongst the highest caliber of supporting talent around today (Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman).The opening half hour of The Ides of March is nearly perfect, as the world of the campaign trial is displayed in "no top button conversations" taking place in hotel rooms and school band halls. The behind the scenes look is enthralling, which immediately sets up the narrative in an engaging way.Stephen Myers (Gosling) is the brightest political media mind in the country. The Ides of March opens as his candidate, Governor Mike Morris (Clooney), is sitting up double digits in the ever important Ohio primary. Myers and Paul Zara (Hoffman) are the two headed beast driving the political force of an ostensible shoe-in for president. Despite the weakness that the audience never actually sees Myers's savvy on-screen, Gosling's charm and sullen-eyed stared convey enough that The Ides of March needs only to posit these facts.Gosling is a magnet to those around him, playing everyone as pawns in his game of media chess, as well as the audience. His relationship with Paul grounds Myers from his idealist fantasy that Gov. Morris is "the real deal", as moral and idealistic in his actions as his views, essentially setting Myers up as a modern day Brutus to Morris's Ceasar.As the Shakespearean title would suggest, someone is going to get stabbed ? metaphorically, of course.Under the immense stress of the campaign, Myers makes the short-sighted decision to strike up a sexual relationship with Molly (Evan Rachel Wood), an intern (what a dirty word in politics). Meanwhile, Tom Duffy (Paul Giamati) proposes to Myers that he's playing for the wrong team, and through a series of political moves, can find himself on the wrong end of this democratic primary. Each plot development feels as if taken from the stage, with the remnants of Farragut North (the play which The Ides of March is based upon) in every scene. Giamati and Hoffman tackle each extended monologue with the vehemency of Bradley Whitford and Richard Schiff in their roles on Sorkin's The West Wing. These scenes are by far the best in the entire work, as Gosling stands in the middle, young and naive to the wiles of the elder political campaigners.The muted browns and sheering blue palette expose the Iowa chill that falls over the campaign, and in the hands of Clooney, the audience takes a place on the ticket as one event leads to another, spiraling out of control until the climax.The Ides of March stands as an exploration of politicians, the electoral process, and the implicit understanding of the term guile. The Ides of March is not an expos, and any critic taking up issue with The Ides of March and its want to simply explicate the struggle of Gosling's character, is asking The Ides of March to be something it doesn't aim to be; a fundamental misunderstanding of the entire point of The Ides of March.The Ides of March is exploration, a look in to a world everyone knows exists, but never gets the chance to see. It asks more than it reveals, and for those expecting something new in a political drama, it's time to look elsewhere. (You're a jaded critic, we get it.) The one truth in these dissents, i.e. the inability for The Ides of March to be more than the sum of its parts, is valid. The Ides of March won't stick with you as long as it should, given the quality of acting performances here.OverallThe Ides of March should garner buzz for Oscar nominations for Ryan Gosling, and is one of the best films of the year, easily making my top ten list for 2011. That said, those expecting something new from a political drama will be disappointed, while those expecting a captivating look at the inner workings of a political campaign (revelations and bias aside), will receive The Ides of March with cinematic revelry.On the Side Clooney's artistic flair shown on Good Night and Good Luck and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind are notably absent here. Clooney's Ides of March has a visual palette of note, but is decidedly bland in its angles and framing. The Ides of March never feels as if the audience is trapped within the struggle, but a willing participant that can exit the vehicle whenever needed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clooney should have stepped aside...for the right reasons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney is a great actor. But, he doesn't do much of it (acting) in this film. And, he is a good director. I can't attribute much to his 'personal style' because it seems to change with each film he has made. The one constant: The man likes to, in John Cassavettes fashion, use A LOT of closeups. And, there are many of them. Right there on the face, long cuts, and it almost makes the dialogue irrelevant, which the dialogue should be. I harken back to when a crew member asked John Ford once what they were going to shoot in the desert, and Ford replied, "The most interesting thing in the world: A human face."So, I like Clooney's choices for this piece, even if it was distracting sometimes to what he was trying to do with the story. Personally, I think he should have stepped aside in his role, and let some other "name" have it. And, NOT because he is not a good actor. A good actor had to be in the role for the scene of the climax. If a good actor is not in that role for the climax, you run the risk of destroying the movie. In fact, the only reason an actor with "draw" needed to be in that role was FOR the climax, and you will see what I mean when you see it. He should have just directed and picked the right person for it. That, and I don't think he's believable as a Governor.Ultimately, it is a pretty good film with very deep and true-to-life themes about what motivates people in politics, all encapsulated in a Social Drama that masks itself pretty well, until all the turning points start revealing and then closing themselves, and it becomes a thriller.There is about thirty minutes of build-up and character development, maybe even 45 minutes, before we reach the inciting incident: the very thing that can turn the whole story on it's head. And, from there it gets interesting, you almost get the idea that this actually happened, right underneath all of our noses. So, it drags until we reach that moment, and from there moves pretty quickly until climax.I first saw Ryan Gosling in The United State of Leland at Sundance in 2003, and he has not disappointed me in any film I have seen him in. He was very good in this, and proves to all of us the range he is capable of. Doing the range of emotions that was required for his role is very very hard for any actor to do and to sell.The Climax, Resolution and Conclusion is worth the price of admission. Especially the conclusion. It is chilling, and Gosling pulls it off perfectly in one of Clooney's great close-ups.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was in politics for 17 years. Worked at the local, state, and federal levels, as an elected official, appointed official, staff, and bureaucrat. In my opinion, this movie is a fair and accurate portrayal of the game. It is not Liberal agenda, nor is it Conservative agenda....it is the reality of politics. And politics is an, at times, vicious chess match which determines how people are going to live. Philip Seymour Hoffman very accurately portrays a Chief of Staff and the conversations that take place are close to reality. The writer got this movie correct. If a person wants to know what the game is really like at election time, they need to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Horror Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ides Of March" is a clever political thriller as much as it is a revenge story, character study. Actually politics themselves become a character studied.The movie is very entertaining though in the end it has some strong flaws in terms of how some may or may not accept decisions made by the characters and the ending itself is less of a story bookend and more of a message: politics are a dirty, evil business kiddos. I was okay with that ending because I was entertained.The acting: Ryan Gosling is great in most everything he does, and this movie is no exception. He has strong "presence" and his character is a quick, on his feet thinker, oozing confidence that all blows up in his face; How he reacts feels real and dirty like real life, and Gosling walked in those shoes perfectly. The other real standout for me was Paul Giamatti.This is an easy recommendation for a rental unless politics is something that just goes over your head and do not interest you. The backdrop of a political race may actually be a deal breaker and a turn off for many looking for a lesser investment on their part in the watcher to watched relationship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ides of March</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I just saw the Ides of March on Friday... and it was truly fantastic. However the first half of the movie or so dragged on quite a bit. But the moment the dirty politics start playing out, that's where it gets exciting. Ryan Gosling is just fantastic in this movie as well as Phillip Seymour Hoffman. George Clooney wasn't bad, but he didn't have a big enough part for me to determine whether he was really good. Now, this movie has a lot of dialogue, so if you're looking for a mindless political thriller blow em up movie, this isn't for you. The dialogue is what essentially made this movie, the level of intensity was just so great when the conversations went on. The cinematography was truly amazing in this movie. They had a shot that showed the silhouettes of Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ryan Gosling arguing behind a giant American Flag, and that was awesome. The one thing I loved about this movie were the face shots of Ryan Gosling, you can tell by the look on his face how corrupt he really got throughout the whole movie. This movie is an easy 4/5 stars and I would recommend it to anyone who has the patience for a slow start, otherwise it's a great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Give George Clooney credit for much of what works. Actually no need to give him credit as he took four credits, Actor, Writer, Producer, and Director.Originally a play, it is extremely dialogue driven. Except when we wait outside of the SUV while there's some getting fired dialogue in the SUV. It takes more then in your face close-ups to open a play into a movie. George seems to forget that it's the Gosling characters story and includes the Clooney character making campaign speeches which only serve to give him good looking screen time.Ignore the "does that make sense" and the "wow that was awkward" moments. Besides, who would believe a near President would sleep with an intern? It's a good movie, but there's no need to see it on a big screen. You won't miss anything, except maybe product placement, if you wait for it to come to cable or DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good political drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In these trying political times, full of lies, deceit, treachery, and cynicism, it's a bold move to make a strongly political film, especially one that is a work of fiction. But leave it to George Clooney, the political and social activist icon of Hollywood, to be the one to do it. In his newest directorial effort, The Ides of March, Clooney plays Mike Morris, a governor running for the Democratic nomination and subsequently the president of the United States of America. The film itself focuses more on Morris' political team, namely Stephen Meyers, a young hotshot staffer who promises big things for Morris' campaign. However, his idealism blinds him from the way things really operate in politics and he succumbs to the dirty back room deceit that is all too fervent in today's political waters. The film hosts a cavalcade of stars whose characters are all ready to screw each other over in a heartbeat in this bleak and cynical look at American politics.George Clooney has once again proved through this film that he is an actor very capable of being a director, but perhaps one who should remain solely in front of the camera. The Ides of March is a very good film but with its lineup of stars and its highly relevant and intellectual subject matter I expected more from the film. Clooney gives it his all in front and behind the camera here and it is obvious he cared about making this an excellent film. The same goes for all the stars who act their hearts out and do a magnificent job at every turn. But, overall, The Ides of March is good, not great.This is a film that is riveting at points and dull at others. It flip flops the whole way through, never keeping a consistent tone. Thus, there are moments of the film I greatly enjoyed and found to be truly excellent cinematic moments. But then there were other moments where the film starts to drag and things begin to get trivial and redundant. It also lacks a hard emotional core. Instead it goes a more logical, sophisticated, and high brow intellectual route. It's a film that could have been backed by much more emotion, but instead was rigid with deadpan sincerity. In context this works to make the film very enthralling, but in retrospect it's easy to pinpoint this subtle flaw.I think what we have here is just another decent film that I'll never regret seeing, but won't be talking about this for a long time. It is indeed a well made film and all the parts are there, they just don't click together as well as they should have for a film of this calibre. The Ides of March is a film worth seeing, but I don't know that we will see its name pop up again during awards season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passionate champion of justice to cutthroat backstabber overnight, that's politics for you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'THE IDES OF MARCH': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Political thriller documentary based on the 2008 play 'Farragut North' by Beau Willimon. It was directed by George Clooney, written by Clooney, Willimon and Grant Heslov (who also co-wrote 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' with Clooney) and stars Ryan Gosling and Clooney. It also stars Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Evan Rachel Wood, Marisa Tomei and Jeffrey Wright. The acting is all exceptional in the film and it's highlight. The script is intriguing and very relevant to the times but it also contains some glaring flaws. I'm not entirely sold on Clooney as a director either. His film projects are always interesting and amusing but they haven't represented anything special or memorable coming from him behind the camera (in my opinion). He is a good actor though and this film, like his others, is still entertaining and worth a look.Clooney plays Mike Morris, the Governor of Pennsylvania and top Democratic presidential candidate in the coming election. Gosling plays Stephen Myers, Morris's Junior Campaign Manager working under Senior Campaign Manager Paul Zara (Hoffman). Myers is full of hope and idealism and truly believes in Morris. When the Campaign Manager (Giamatti) for a rival candidate approaches Stephen and offers him a job his whole world is turned upside down. Suddenly his allegiance and trustfulness is questioned and his whole livelihood is at stake. Things are further complicated by an affair Myers has with a young intern (Wood) and a secret she reveals to him. The movie continues on a heavy downward spiral as Myers dreams and morals are quickly shattered.The film is obviously depressing and very cynical and dark. It shows how quickly one's beliefs and ideals are compromised in the world of politics. Even the good guys quickly become shadows of the great men with big dreams they once were. Once you make one slight compromise and cross a line you continue to make more until the line you were once hesitant about crossing can no longer be seen (I've seen this happen a lot with people I've worked under). The problem with the film is the Myers character goes down that path just a little too quickly. For me it wasn't believable that he would make the change from passionate champion of justice to a cutthroat backstabber so quickly and without a strong enough reason. Other than that the movie is near flawless though. Like I said the acting is exceptional and the dialogue and politics (which are surprisingly up to the minute relevant) are great as well. Like I also said Clooney's directing could use a little more polishing though. There's nothing too memorable in visuals or style here to set this apart from any number of other films. Despite it's flaws the film is entertaining and involving though and definitely worth watching (in my opinion).Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUMkZYiXwNQ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politypical ( But Intriguing Nevertheless )</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is highly recommended.Politics is a dirty business. That's a fact, a sad one, but a fact nevertheless. In The Ides of March, the new political drama solidly directed, written ( with immense support from Grant Heslov and playwright Beau Willimon ), and starring Hollywood star, George Clooney, the backstabbing and betrayals are of a more literal variety, but the wounds rarely heal as lives are thoroughly altered and selfishly destroyed.Based on the Off-Broadway hit, Farragut North, the renamed film successfully blends political intrigue with adult dialogue and strong characterizations. An idealistic campaign staffer sees first-hand the tragedy of our political system as he becomes embroiled in a scandal that could cost an election. A subdued Ryan Gosling portrays Steven Meyers, an ambitious and smart disciple who wholeheartedly believes in his godlike leader and presidential Democratic nominee. The ever charismatic George Clooney fills those shoes in a wonderful supporting performance as candidate Mike Morris. Looking the part of the dashing politico, he creates the necessary persona with his dashing exterior that hides a more complex man beneath the custom-made suits, patterned ties, and patriotic flag pins. Steven learns to ply the tricks of the trade from his experienced mentor and strategist, ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) while combating his rival counterpart (Paul Giamatti, giving another strong performance ) and dancing around the issues with a feisty reporter ( Marisa Tomei ). He also finds some free time in his busy schedule to bed a beautiful intern, Molly ( Evan Rachel Wood ). All of these well-written characters have their star moments and deliver their scenes with much style and zip. The cast is exceptional, but it is Hoffman who brilliantly commands every inch of screen time. It is especially evident in one of his final moments with a particularly powerful monologue about ethics and loyalty in today's political climate that just might net him another Oscar nomination.While The Ides of March is rather conventional in its narrative structure, it still is engrossing and thought-provoking entertainment. There is really nothing new in this clichd world of politics and its strange bedfellows. Certain events occur within the script that become a bit melodramatic with predictable outcomes for some of the stereotypical characters, but the film triumphs due to its densely taut screenplay with its eloquent use of language and intricate plotting redeeming these minor flaws.The film harks back to the well-constructed political dramas of the sixties, like Advice and Consent, Seven Days in May, and The Best Man, films that prospered in a less cynical time. The Ides of March is definitely a product of our times, with a liberal-minded progressive candidate unafraid of change, an underdog for the common people and a skillful orator willing to buck the Washington scene ( Sound familiar? ). It gathered my attention and gets my vote as one of the best films of the year. GRADE: B+NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb: a new take on a classic story: in fact a classic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Think West Wing without the fawning self-admiring liberalism; or Shakespeare's Julius Caesar without the murky historical and linguistic inaccessibility.This is a political thriller which translates seemingly effortlessly from the page into what will be a minor classic movie. Clooney is more than a pretty face. He was shrewd to pick the story off the bookshelves, smart in co-adapting it into an intelligent and gripping screenplay, brave in directing sequences where the camera lingers outside of events so your mind paints in the action within, and gutsy to cast himself in an unsavoury role effectively playing No2 to Ryan Gosling.All credit to the producers. This may not be a box office smash (and don't go see it if your idea of a good movie is cretinous shoot-em-up goodies against evil banality) but over the years it will reward them deservedly and richly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ides of March is the slowest movie to start. Oddly enough though the movie flies by before you know it. One great part I loved was the use of shadows as a motif in the film.I wanna start off by praising Gosling. He shines in this role as a man who has to make tough decisions on subjects such as loyalty, integrity, as well as a few others. I can see why he is getting a lot of Oscar talk. As for the movie itself, I personally don't see a Best Picture nomination. But since the Academy knows a few things about LOYALTY don't be surprised if Clooney gets a nod for director.No spoiler here for the end, but I'll leave you with this much info. Gosling is put in a position where he has to choose between what is right and what is wrong. The ending is left for you to interpret. The final shot is great, it's his face half in the shadows half in the light, truly showing you he may choose the bad choice or the right one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depravity and corruption in politics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about the depravity and corruption in politics, of how influence is sold for favors, all in order to win. Ryan Gosling gives a powerful performance as novice political staffer who learns the facts of life while on the campaign and then applies what he learns. The story itself is not only plausible but, if anything, understated. Given the series of well known and at times infamous scandals that have shaken the public's confidence in the integrity of the democratic political process, this movie does not really present anything new. Rather, the movie presents a story that confirms what the public already knows, that politics and politicians are open to influence and make huge mistakes which can cost them the or political career. The question is: how effective is the damage control and can the mistakes be smoothed over and even turned to a candidate's advantage? To find out the answers to these questions, watch the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ides of March is a "grab you by the throat kind" of political drama. I don't want to call it a political thriller like The Manchurian Candidate, but it has certain elements that make you stand on edge (confrontations, secrets revealed, intense dialogue). It stars Ryan Gosling as Stephen Meyers, a young and talented man who is second in command on presidential hopeful Mike Morris' (George Clooney) campaign staff. When he has an unauthorized meeting with the opposing candidates campaign manager, all hell breaks loose as friendships are tested, news stories are released, and the worst thing a campaign can buy pokes its ugly head out; a scandal.Along with Gosling and Clooney is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Clooney's head campaign manager, Paul Giamatti as the opposing manager, Marissa Tomei as the news reporter for the Times, and Evan Rachel Wood as the young intern who catches the eye of Gosling in more ways than one. A terrific ensemble cast that pulls off a terrific political drama in a political climate that is volatile and overflowing with unethical behavior.Gosling continues his dominance on screen. Not just as a heartthrob but as a dramatic force. Not since Paul Newman flashed those baby blue eyes has there been an actor with such intensity without saying a word. There is an intense scene between Wood and Gosling where with just ONE look Gosling lets the audience know what he is thinking, what he wants to do, and what he has to do. This performance along with Drive make 2011 a really special year for the young actor.Clooney pulls off the rare quadruple crown by acting, directing, writing, and producing. Though not as prominent on screen as Gosling, Clooney's presence is vital to the film, especially towards the end. In just his fourth film behind the camera, Clooney is building up a pretty decent resum (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Good Night and Good Luck, Leatherheads). He calls on the help of Phedon Papamichael to photograph (he also photographs Clooney in Alexander Payne's Oscar hopeful The Descendants), who cleverly shows us what the people see and what is going on behind the scenes of politics (flipping back and forth nicely between the two). There is a scene where Clooney is giving a very enthusiastic speech in front of a large American flag, meanwhile Gosling and Hoffman are having an intense discussion on the reverse side. I saw Clooney on one side speaking of the light side of politics while on the other side, in front of an illuminated AND reversed American flag (used on soldiers uniforms in times of war), two men delving into the darkness of politics. They are the soldiers of war. Clooney is the poster child (literally).There are so many reference to the Obama campaign that are hard to ignore like the advertisements, the political messages, the overall feeling of goodness. I don't think this is in any way shape or form a slant at Obama. No, no, no. I think they are trying to mimic the political climate and using images and ideas we have recently seen. I DO believe this is a huge slap in the face of politics and even a little jab at the current administration, saying that no matter how hard you try to do good if you want to succeed in Washington, you need to get dirty.There are so many levels to dissect here. It's a story about survival, idealism, morality, politics, and a big reflection on the political machines that are in play in our nation's capital. What we see on TV is Clooney's character, Mike Morris. A clean-cut, righteous politician who wants nothing more than to change the ways of government. What we don't see are the nasty, backstabbing ways of politics, where one candidate's agenda doesn't mean squat when it comes to getting elected. There are others waiting to bring you down or raise you up.Rome wasn't built in a day, and much like Roman politics there are friends waiting with open arms and knives at the ready.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cast Delivers Excellent Ensemble Work Despite the Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched "The Ides of March" mainly because of its powerhouse cast. Imagine a movie that has names like George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti and Marisa Tomei headlining it! The topic is American politics which I have to admit I have very limited knowledge of, apart from what we can glean from the foreign news. But I had to watch it to see that all-star cast in action.The story is not really about Democrat Gov. Mike Morris (Clooney) who needs to win the primary in Ohio to secure his presidential bid. It was more about his campaign staff headed by Paul Zara (Hoffman), his junior Stephen Myers (Ryan Gosling) and intern Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood), and how they deal with intrigues, both personal and political. It was about loyalty and trust, but then again this is politics, so there is a different definition for these virtues here. Giamatti plays the campaign manager of the rival candidate, while Tomei plays a vicious political writer of the NY Times, both of whom complicate Myers' career with their incursions.After you have seen the film, or even while watching, you will be wondering why certain characters do certain things which their supposedly smart characters uncharacteristically do. This detracts somewhat from the whole experience of this inside look behind what goes on behind a campaign. But as expected the top-notch cast delivers the best ensemble work despite the script problems. Clooney also directed and wrote this film, so we do look forward for more in the future from this multi-talented star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Started off interesting enough, awesome script and intelligent interplay of arguments from the various topics but then it went deeper into the characters which for some strange reason felt fake. The characters just weren't real enough like the reasons behind the defining moment in the plot line (wouldn't wanna explain the spoiler). Suffice to say, the movie couldn't quite capture the character's transition and growth towards the end of the movie. The topics became too obvious and overtly blunt. Perhaps its just me who found it too petty, that there should be a greater persona out of the main character. but then again, perhaps this really is politics, and i'm the idealistic one.Still a sufficiently gripping tale</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but rather dull fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like some US thesps doing their stuff well up front(Seymour Hoffman, Giamatti, Tomei etc) then this is for you, but really the movie is rather too well satisfied and smug with its own liberal self regard. It is too prosaic - it is meant to be a cynical view of modern day US politics, which it certainly is - and does not really provide any new insights or critical depth to an outmoded, cash rich process that wastes time and energy in choosing a US President. Really they could just as well put up a banner saying that Obama is going to raise one billion dollars to defeat a Republican no hoper - and we would have more cynicism about the process than this film provides. The acting is good, the script too self satisfied, the plot too stagey and has too many holes, and the direction plodding. Until the denouement when Gosling faces off with Clooney, the spark is missing. Then watch George Clooney make up for all the rest of the dispiriting missed opportunities in this film - he is magic and really brings home the bacon. Watch Redford in 'The Candidate' - similar themes, much better film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ides of March, The (2011)*** 1/2 (out of 4) Extremely well-made political drama bout press secretary Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) who has a little over a week before the election and he's trying to win Ohio for Gov. Mike Morris (George Clooney). After making the mistake of meeting with the opponents campaign manager, Stephen is forced into a web of lies and cover-up, which were the things he vowed never to do. THE IDES OF MARCH contains some brilliant acting, a good story that carry us through and there's no question that Clooney knows how to handle a film. With that said, the film still falls a tad bit short of being a great movie and I think the reason is quite simple. I'm not sure if this was done on purpose of the filmmaker or not but there's just nothing here that really explodes in terms of drama. In other words, the film is extremely good at everything it does but it seems to have been made about twenty-years too late. I'm sure the story of dirty politics would have been a little more dramatic years ago but in today's day and age all the "dirty" stuff we're seeing here isn't shocking and you really just keep telling yourself that you knew this type of stuff happened. There's just nothing here that makes the material seem fresh or groundbreaking no matter how well made it is. With that said, there's no question people are going to have a very good time watching this film and thanks in large part to the terrific cast. Gosling turns in another winning performance as the rather naive person who finds himself doing things he said he wouldn't. You have Clooney being all polished up and delivering a strong supporting role. I won't give away the twist that leads these two actors to one final showdown but it's certainly one of the more memorable moments of cat and mouse. We also get the always dependable Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman doing great work and Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood round out the cast. A lot of times these all-star films have you losing focus on the story because of all the stars coming in and out but that doesn't happen here as all of them really fit their parts and make you forget that you're watching actors. Clooney's style is very laid back, which is exactly what the story needed and there's no flashy camera-work or editing. You can tell that Clooney is an actor's director and that certainly fits this film. The film really plays all its cards down the middle as it appears to just want to show you what it's like in the final days before an election. The movie will certainly keep you entertained from start to finish but the fireworks really start to happen in the final twenty-minutes when we're hit with one twist after another. I doubt anyone will be shocked at the twists or won't see them coming but the performers just take the material and raise it many levels. THE IDES OF MARCH might not be the masterpiece everyone was hoping for but it's certainly much better than the majority of pictures out there right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Ides of March</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney for President? If his persona as Governor Mike Morris in the first half The Ides of March is anything to go by - an excellent orator blessed with natural charisma and a dedicated and talented campaign team, it's no surprise to find people throwing their weight behind him. But this is not the one man one vote system we have here, but the US democracy system involving electoral divisions, which may baffle some of us not familiar with it, but even if so, this film will not alienate you, but draw you into its proceedings about how the greed of man influences one's desperate cling for self-preservation, and pride.It's pacey and punchy, and is what everything about what a political thriller does best, in making it easy to identify with its broad themes for the man on the street involving morals, principles, integrity, trust and power, having likely tradeoffs between characters all trying to gain the upper hand, because the pot of gold at the end of this dark tunneling journey is the Oval Office of the White House, where the person you back, if you're right, takes on the hot seat as Commander in Chief, your job is more or less secured for at least four years, with an option for another four.It's very pronounced in today's context with the American elections due another 48 months, and this serves as a sneak peek set in the context of a crucial party nomination run off centered about the decider in the state of Ohio, where Senator Thompson (Jeffrey Wright) is being wooed by opposing nominees Morris (Clooney) and Senator Pullman (Michael Mantell) for the Democratic nomination. Running their respective campaigns are seasoned veterans Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti) in opposing camps, with Ryan Gosling as Stephen Meyers, a young, promising media savvy hotshot supporting Morris because of belief in the message and values the latter demonstrates, and is seen as a tremendous asset by both sides of the camp.So begins the cajoling for news, quotes, insights from opponents each trying to feel and strategize against the other, and from not-so-innocent bystanders like the press (Marisa Tomei) eager for scoops as the campaign heats up, feeding on information and leaks with threats that can make or break anyone in print. Information is currency, and knowledge is power in this game, and we're thrown into the thick of the action from the onset, primarily charting how events unfold and Meyers' wheeling and dealings, cajoling, half-deals under the table and behind the scenes, all starting from a single phone call for a meeting from Duffy to call upon Meyers which translates to a flatter, that catalyzes into a measured, political chess game.It's about Meyers' pride that will lead to a seduction, turning one against his own beliefs and value system, allowing us to witness how easy it is for anyone to blackmail or be blackmailed, about who's playing who, and how everything isn't as simple as it seems in the race for power. The last film I've seen that involves political campaigning was in Definitely, Maybe, a romantic comedy, but The Ides of March is more State of Play in its intensity and gripping narrative, based upon the play Farragut North by Beau Willimon, that made this film truly stand out under Clooney's astute direction. If you're dreading a film with plenty of dialogue, trust me in this film the lines are like honey as you marvel at brilliant conversations laced with plenty of in-betweens.I am not that big a fan of Ryan Gosling, but his powerhouse performance here has changed my mind. While Clooney may be the biggest name on the marquee, this is clearly a Gosling vintage performance as the ambitious young man who thinks the world of himself, until as the Chinese saying goes, the old ginger is always hotter, meaning his lack of experience and savviness in some areas exposes his shortcomings, but as already recognized by his more veteran peers, his character of Meyers possesses the undercurrents and potential of becoming a major player and game changer, it's only a matter of time before he wises up. Gosling portrays this transformation with tremendous intensity, swinging from one end of the inexperienced campaigner who got blindsided, sacrificed, and caught offguard, to making the best of the situation with cold, calculated moves of his own. This is the movie, and Gosling made it his own.But that's not to discount what his co-stars have brought to the table. Flanked by powerhouses in Philip Seymour Hoffman as his mentor of sorts (in a relationship that bears all the hallmarks of Star Wars' Obi-wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker somehow), and Paul Giamatti as the equivalent on the opposite camp, Marisa Tomei also held her own in her bit role as the New York Times reporter more like a double agent, making deals with either side to further her career, and Evan Rachel Wood balances the testosterone levels to star as, well, yet another seductive temptress, a young intern working at Morris' camp who holds a very crucial secret that can make and break the nominees.With beautiful cinematography and an excellent soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat, I enjoy it best when Clooney goes behind the camera for politically charged dramas, and besides the blip in Leatherheads, perhaps this genre is indeed his forte as he charms his way on screen, while creating something sleek and sexy behind the scenes. Definitely a must-watch political thriller, and one of the top, top films of the year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhere inbetween Tinker Tailor and Charlie Wilson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thank my better half for introducing me to Ryan Gosling. Although the first film I saw him in didn't blow me away ('The Notebook'), every film since has. From 'The Believer', a strange film about a Jewish neo-Nazi, to 'Lars and the Real Girl', an even stranger film about a man who forms a bond with a blow-up doll, his performances stay with me. I cannot think of a better young actor working today. Gosling plays Stephen Meyers, a campaign adviser to Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney), a Democrat who's running for President. Meyers is young ? only 30 ? but he's worked on more campaigns than most have by 40. He acknowledges the dearth of Democratic Presidents in recent decades but that doesn't deter him. Morris is the only one he feels will actually make a difference. Clooney ? Mr Hollywood I call him ? directed, co-wrote, co-produced and stars in this fine film. I used to dislike him, but I now realise he is an exquisite actor. His direction isn't bad either. I consider him to be in a minority - that group of thespians who don't require much acting versatility to hold our attention. Others include Clint Eastwood, Paul Giammati, Steve Buscemi, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Denzel Washington. Each of them could be considered a brand. Clooney has made an accessible political thriller. Not like the delphic and dull 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'. There are twists, which aren't obvious. It's not a straightforward contemporary re-enactment of Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar'. The sinuous plot allows several players their turn as Caesar and Brutus. Seeing the machinations at the top of government is always entertaining, but no film has done this better in recent years than 'Charlie Wilson's War'. Philip Seymour Hoffman is engaging as Morris's campaign manager, though his character is not much different to his CIA henchman in 'Charlie Wilson'. Jeffrey Wright ? still underrated ? is good as the king-making Senator, as is the ever-beautiful Marisa Tomei, here playing an inimical journo. Paul Giamatti's presence as the opposing Democrat candidate's campaign manager is the icing. The only criticism is that the dialogue is perhaps too accessible. Do people at the top of government sound this ordinary behind closed doors and in front of opened ones? It's an art balancing the needs of a disparate audience whilst maintaining the script's integrity. 'The Ides of March', while not a standout in the great pantheon of political thrillers, at least has enough to boast about. www.moseleyb13.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this second directorial project for George Clooney one can already see the traits materialising. It's a succinct film that makes its point and doesn't outstay its welcome. It's also ever so slightly opaque - the story is told competently enough but one always has the feeling that because he production team has lived with material for a long time that they mean to say more than is actually presented on screen.But then, maybe that's an unfortunate function of the subject material. Like The West Wing, this Machiavellian tale of power and putsches in a Democratic primary is littered with dialogue and delivered at a tempo that seems authentic for political discussion but can seem impenetrable. It doesn't matter a huge deal. The drama is clearly discernible on the surface of this vernacular. However, I feel that Clooney is another capable director who is happy to let the richness of the technical subplot simply support the drama. There's more to be had.Gosling is very good here, better than in any of the rash of roles he's presented us with recently. Naturally he has to play to the top of his game opposite Philip Seymour Hoffman, playing a less Guignol version of his adviser in Charlie Wilson's War, and a truly conflicted Paul Giamatti. Evan Rachel Wood is also commendable see-sawing wildly between the confidence of youth and its easy disabuse. Clooney (as the Governor) is a bit part. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not personal. It's just politics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mao Tse Tung said: Politics is war without bloodshed. War is politics with bloodshed. Ides of March proves the truth of this.In George Clooney's more recent movies, he has become an acting chameleon moving with the deftness and surefootedness of a mountain goat, winning five Academy Award nominations and one Oscar for Syriana.Up in the Air I considered good though over-hyped, the thriller The American, brilliant but underhyped. It's a personal favorite. I particularly loved his collaborations with the Coen Brothers, the on screen chemistry with Catherine Zeta Jones in Intolerable Cruelty, and the epic re-imagining O Brother, Where Art Thou?.Ryan Gosling, I consider to be perhaps the greatest actor on the planet. Nearly every movie performance he has given has been nominated for some acting award, even though many of the movies were not mainstream. Have you heard of Half Nelson, for which he got Oscar nominated? He starred in Crazy, Stupid, Love also starring Marisa Tomei, earlier this year, and did an amazing job.Ides of March may be described as a political thriller, and if you're like me it will certainly grip you and have you on the edge of your seat at times, with its twists and turns.Ryan Gosling plays a campaign assistant manager, who works for Paul played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and both work for Governor Morris, played by George Clooney, a man with eyes on the presidency. Paul Giamatti plays a veteran campaign manager for a rival politician. Evan Rachel Wood plays a young intern who gets sucked into the intrigues, and Marisa Tomei plays a hardscrabbling reporter always looking for dirt to dish. In fairness, though her methods may be dubious, she is seeking the truth.Ides of March, and its characters portray every shade of dark, and you may wonder how something as innocuous as agreeing to meet a rival for a drink in a bar can become such a potential disaster, and how going on a date with an intern when you're single can lead to such complications. Certainly Stephen Myers (Gosling)is left to wonder how minor personal actions can have such potentially dire personal political consequences.I have to say the story is brilliantly constructed and told, and as you might expect with a political movie, it contains tons of soundbites. We all know that politics can be quite dirty with lowdown tricks and negative campaigning, but I don't think you have seen anything quite like this except in real politics. One persons pain becomes another persons political gain.I loved the setup and payoff of the opening and closing scenes. As the movie opens Gosling cynically delivers soundbites to camera. The movie closes with soundbites to camera.Early in the movie he has passion for his work, and says he wouldn't do it if he does not have faith in the candidate. Will he stay true to this when his values are challenged? I loved the confrontations between Gosling and Hoffman, Giamatti, Tomei, and Clooney in different scenes.I loved the sexual tension in the early scenes between him and Evan Rachel Wood.I loved the the contrast in this character who in some way cares, offering an intern in trouble a ride to and from a place, even helping her out of his own pocket, and then making the hardscrabbling choices he makes, as the Darth road beckons, and romantic ideals can disappear faster than a political friendship.While the movie does not scream surefire Oscar winner it certainly yells, and I think Gosling will get nominated perhaps even win, particularly after being so cruelly overlooked last year for his brilliant turn in Blue Valentine. George Clooney wears three hats as actor, director, and co-writer, and who better to play a smooth politician. Hoffman and Giamatti as usual are brilliant. Either or both could be nominated. In fact you will see few movies with such a strong ensemble this year, with three Oscar winners on board.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the thing...you will certainly like the movie, if you're somewhat interested in politics. That is what I've learned today. I went to the movie theatre to see this movie with two of my friends, one of whom is really into politics, has followed campaigns before, etc. and one who doesn't really care about politics at all. Guess what...the second friend was booooored out of her mind. But my other friend and I simply LOVED it!!!!!!!!Everything about it was good. The pacing of the movie, the acting, the musical score...and the plot. Alright, I agree that it might not be the most original story ever written, but it is relevant and realistic, and very entertaining. Plus the cast of the movie is great! Ryan Gosling does and amazing amazing job. The movie is suspenseful, it keeps building up until the end, it is entertaining and even funny at times, and most importantly, it is a smart movie. Good job directing that George Clooney!If this is really your type of movie, I would be very surprised if you didn't enjoy it! Brilliant.Definitely one of the best movies I've seen so far in 2011.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie in engaging, I will watch any movie with Ryan Gosling in it. The problem with this brilliant piece of propaganda is that it gives a kind of credit to the US elections that is so far from the truth of the circus as to be laughable. It has all the in and out of what a real race may look like but the fact that American politics is 1000 less noble than this and infinitely more of the bad taste that there is no actual left right dichotomy, i.e. that there is no actual left or right, would mean that this is a complete exercise in propaganda to convince the average American that this is how politics are fought for behind the scenes. The truth is that in actuality the winner of an American election is agreed upon by everyone involved in the race well before hand by the Rothschild banking cartel and that this interesting movie only serves as the ideal of what the nation actually expects happens. If you don't mind the propaganda of this film, the sole reason that it was made and you can suspend your disbelief then you will be fine with this whole facade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ides of March due to the cast primarily was one of my to-see movies this year. And it lived up to expectations. Ides of March mayn't be exactly new in terms of concept and the odd scene in the first half drags, however I think with the high quality of the film no matter whether it makes you feel good or not, though Ides of March is not that type of movie, you do feel rewarded by the end.Ides of March is a well-made film, the scenery throughout is very striking and the cinematography and George Clooney's direction show lots of skill. The film also has a hypnotic score by Alexandre Desplat, a clever and purposefully cynical script, sharp and well-defined characters(particularly Gosling's, Giamatti's and Hoffmann's) and a compelling moral-driven story.Ides of March has a terrific cast, not just Clooney, whose performance and character are very powerful, but also an appropriately rough-edged Marissa Tomei and a splendid Evan Rachel Wood. Not to mention brilliant turns from the consistently great Paul Giamatti and Phillip Seymour Hoffmann and the quietly confident and completely enthralling performance of Ryan Gosling.I would also like to mention Ides of March's final shot, to me it is one of 2011's most effective final shots. Overall, maybe not for all, but really there are so many things I feel to be impressed by. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things pick up in this political thriller after middle of the night cell phone call</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Republicans should rejoice! Finally a movie made by liberals about ethically challenged Democrats! The setting is the Ohio primary where a liberal Governor Morris (George Clooney) is pitted against another liberal Senator, Pullman. It's all based on the play 'Farragut North', where Governor Morris is only referred to by the other characters and never makes an appearance on stage at any time. Clooney, who also directs, has injected Governor Morris into the action for the movie, and except for a strong face-off with the film's protagonist at the denouement, has little to do but mouth various Democratic party platitudes.The film is very slow moving for a good thirty to forty minutes. The inciting incident occurs when Pullman's campaign manager Tom Duffy (played by a very believable Paul Giamatti), calls Morris' Junior Campaign Manager Stephen Myers (Ryan Gosling), who meets with him and is offered a position on the Pullman campaign. We don't really learn of the significance of this meeting until later on in the film, so we're still guessing until the break into Act Two.Act Two also comes late. This is where Myers has bedded Molly Stearns, an 20 year old intern on the campaign, who also happens to be the daughter of the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee. It turns out that Myers answers Molly's cell phone while she's half asleep and it's Governor Morris calling. At this point, one's interest in the film really picks up as we soon learn that Molly is pregnant due to her brief affair with Morris and she later becomes a bargaining chip in a tug of war between Myers and Governor Morris.After a NY Times reporter tries to blackmail Myers by claiming to know about his meeting with Duffy, it becomes clear that Duffy has leaked the information in order to have Myers dumped from the Morris team (Why Myers actually met with Duffy in the first place, knowing full well that Duffy could have used the meeting against him, is not completely believable). An unforgiving Paul Zara, the senior Morris campaign man (played by an impeccable Phillip Seymour Hoffman), immediately disposes of Myers, who then goes to Duffy, begging him to hire him on the Pullman campaign. Duffy admits that he set Myers up and orders him to leave.After Myers takes Molly for an abortion, she later learns that Myers has been fired from the Morris campaign. Believing that Myers will use the information about the pregnancy and abortion against Morris, thus exposing her to scandal, she takes a fatal overdose of prescription medication. Myers then uses the information to blackmail Morris, who caves in, fires Zara and promotes Myers to the Senior Campaign Manager position.One possible plot hole still bothers me. During the investigation into the intern's death, wouldn't have the police discovered the three in the morning phone call from Morris to Molly by examining her cell phone records? This is after Morris claimed that he had little contact with Molly during a press conference. Had he thought about the implications of the phone call, Morris may not have taken Myers' 'bargaining chip', a purported suicide note from Molly, and instead resigned, after realizing that no amount of well thought out 'spin', could save him from the barrage of bad publicity.There's a generic quality to 'Ides of March', as the story could be applied to both political parties. Nonetheless, the transformation of the idealistic Myers into a cut-throat politico, outdoing his ruthless mentors, Zara and Duffy, is a compelling theme that holds one's interest. This, even after the slow-moving intro. Clooney has only one really good scene and that's when he caves into Myers after being blackmailed at film's end. Gosling holds his own and compliments the most compelling performances served up by veterans Giamatti and Hoffman.'The Ides of March' is in the end, more in the style of a legal thriller than documentary about what happens during a political primary. While it's not all that original, it will keep you glued to the screen once things pick up with that cell phone call from the Governor in the middle of the night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All-Star Cast Doesn't Disappoint in a Film that Rivets by midpoint.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides of March: An All-Star Cast That Doesn't Disappoint Some of the best movies I have seen have been viewed in an otherwise empty theatre.Such was The Ides of March, a political drama of weighty intrigue that has too much intellectual substance for the Real Steel crowd if the box office receipts are any indication (the robot prize-fighting flick took No. 1 during its also opening weekend, beating the George Clooney-directed movie 3-to-1 at the box office).So it was really no surprise my movie partner and I had the entire theatre to ourselves for the 7:15 p.m. screening on a Sunday night. However it is by far more bad reflection on the movie crowd's taste in that area than on the movie itself. For myself, I am trying to figure whether the film is worth consideration in my personal Top 100 movies.In a movie about a presidential candidate and the campaign managers that steer them in their campaigns, along with the intersection of primary power plays, sex and loyalty, there is plenty of room for the principals to shine and none of them disappoint. The weight of the drama is carried admirably by Ryan Gosling and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the lead campaign managers in the presidential campaign of Gov. Mike Morris (Clooney), and their opposing counterpart played by Paul Giamatti.The star, Gosling, does not break any new ground with respect to his acting range, but he doesn't have to with this compelling story, which starts off somewhat slowly as it captures the Morris campaign team moving toward a critical Ohio primary that has whittled down to two Democratic candidates. The role is tailor-made for the nuanced Gosling, who did nothing in this film to diminish his growing status as a screen thespian.When the film begins reach the midpoint, some may impatiently begin to ask if the rather lame campaign speeches, town hall meetings, and behind-the-scenes political maneuvers is all there is to this film. However, some pretty problematic monkey wrenches in what had been a relatively orderly campaign operation work to give the film a riveting quality that lasts throughout the remainder of the story.The mostly believable complications in the plot begin piling up, and there are political and livelihood casualties, of whom the audience are left guessing until the end. However there are a few implausibilities along the way, such as a scene where Gosling's assistant campaign manager character hashes out a critical political platform question with Gov. Morris while the two are surrounded by an army of campaign staffers and interns who are taking in the discussion in what would certainly be done in private in the real world.However, the compelling weight of the story is not torpedoed by those minor and infrequent plot imperfections. There are some great moments with supporting cast members, such as Marisa Tomei, who plays a critical role as a season political journalist, and Max Minghella as a young staffer. Because it is plot more about the strategic moves behind the political stage, Clooney is not required to fill major screen time as the candidate standing to benefit or be harmed by the twists swirling around him. However, the movie features an outstanding showdown between Clooney and his conflicted campaign manager played by Gosling.Evan Rachel Wood, as the vulnerable campaign intern, is probably the weakest acting link among the main cast, rising only to the level of adequate in her performance. Jeffrey Wright turns a performance in limited appearance that nevertheless spurts subtle acting power, making viewers yearn for more screen time for the man (as has happened in a number of his film appearances).Gosling could eek out an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, but unless it is a weak 2011 field, it is unlikely that he will win it with this performance. There could be a Best Picture nomination in the works as well, so don't let the lower attendance figure for this film persuade you to overlook The Ides of March.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By unfinished what I mean is that it felt more like half a movie. The Ides of March is competently scripted and acted but really doesn't tell you anything you didn't know about the ruthless nature of political life. With a cast this great you're expecting quite a lot, and the acting is fine. It has to be said, though, that most of these actors could play these roles in their sleep and only the ever-watchable Paul Giamatti really stands out. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Marisa Tomei especially are badly underused. Unfortunately, the story builds to an interesting place and then it's over. Not a bad movie, but i'd rather watch my old DVD's of The West Wing for my fictional political entertainment...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware The Ides of March</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ides of March is a tepid political thriller that fails from the outset to gather much steam or build in any way over the course of it's slim storyline. The acting is anemic with characters unrealistic and poorly outlined while the direction is a compendium of half baked conversations without much spark. Politically idealistic Steve Myers has hitched his horse to the campaign of progressive Democratic candidate Governor Mike Morris. Locked in a close battle with Senator Pullman for the nomination Ohio is a key battleground state Morris must have. Problems both personal and political arise and threaten the campaign. Myers is approached by Pullman's people to jump ship. Torn between loyalty and ambition Myers steels himself for a course in Realpolitik.Clooney's meager talents as a director (Leatherheads, The World's most Dangerous Mind) never allows Ides to grow much out of its stage play look with murky, lifeless compositions heavily shadowed to inform and emphasize political double dealing. His only deference to the cinematic end is to bombard the audience with close-ups to points of fracture and lame symbols (yes, a back alley ) like a hip Stanley Kramer. Clooney matches his prosaic direction with an equally drab and fatigued performance for someone that's trying to project a vitality to run the country. He's Clintonesque (handsome, intelligent, predatory ) but without an ounce of Slick Willie's charisma.Ryan Gosling's Myers comes across a bit too naive at times and his transformation or baptism into this seamy world of hypocrisy is a little late in coming. Conversely Evan Rachel Wood for twenty is a little long in the tooth and worldly to suddenly regress in the face of reality. Only Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman as campaign managers look comfortable in their roles as rumpled veterans who have no illusions. Ides of March would have been better off to follow these guys around. It would have made it a far more engrossing look at the political process than this flaccid stab at it that doesn't even break the surface.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong acting performances fighting to break out of a sub-par story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, pretty much everyone who has seen this film acknowledges the fine acting performances from the entire cast. This is evident for anyone who has even seen the 2 minute trailer for the film. Personally, I found Evan Rachel Wood's performance to be the strongest of them all, and worthy of a supporting actress nomination at this year's Oscars. She demonstrates a great deal of nuance to her performance, typically speaking extremely quietly and by proving that less equals more. Hoffman and Giammatti are also spectacular, as always, however, they are not given enough scenes to work with in the entire film. Gosling is serviceable in the lead role, but I personally found his character to be somewhat flat and one-dimensional - we don't really see him at home, hanging out with friends, or showing much depth to who he is as a private person. We only see him as Mr. campaign manager/press secretary 24/7, and never really get to know anything more about him. Clooney's style of direction is old-school, with scenes of dialogue that are slow-paced and go on forever, allowing tension to build up during individual scenes numerous times throughout the film. There is also very little music in the background throughout the film - it truly feels like a low budget character study film that could have been made in the 1960s. In my opinion, this is one of the film's strengths. Its style is the anti-thesis of the video game / ADD afflicted movie generation that theaters typically spew out to the average Mountain Dew gulping, 16-year old moviegoer hanging out at the mall with their friends.The main problem here is that the movie has a very basic, typical soap- opera script that just doesn't take you anywhere or show you anything you haven't already seen in previous movies or political TV shows. The last 30 minutes is fairly weak, aside from an intense scene between Clooney and Gosling involving who has possession of a "suicide note." Its story and writing overall is deserving of nothing more than a late- night cable movie. It's as well acted and well directed as it can possibly be, but the material they have to work with is very unoriginal and uninspiring.My rating of 6/10 might be a little low for some...I just prefer better scripts and more creativity in my movies. Some who are content with great acting may give this an 8 or a 9. It just depends what components of the movie you feel are more important. If you're looking to see very strong film-making in theaters now, I recommend seeing Moneyball and Contagion instead of this film.</fullReview>

The first half of the movie has you wondering what direction the plot is going to take.

		<fullReview>Upon starting, The Ides of March grabs your attention, and I'd say carries it through to the end. There is a twist, as with every good movie, about midway through that goes on to dominate the rest of the movie, and I liked the direction it went in, however, felt that the movie as a whole was not concluded.In the end, Ryan Gosling's character has a choice to expose the corruption of Governor Morris or to keep it a secret and thus propel himself in the political world. As a viewer, you naturally want to know which way he goes, however, the movie ends before he can make a choice. I can see why this ending was chosen, as it does leave an impact, however, it is also mildly disappointing. Overall, though, this movie was very good, with great performances, especially by Evan Rachel Wood and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I'd definitely recommend it as a well thought-out, modern- day political thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know a great deal about American politics, so parts of this movie pretty much went straight over my head but for the parts I understood I have to say I really enjoyed them, Ryan Gosling, who seems to have starred in ten thousand films this year, plays an ambitious young guy who is working on a presidential campaign which seems set fir a winning streak, that is until all the twists start.This movie is a very entertaining look at what happens when backs are turned and trust is broken between. The cast was a big drawcard for me, Ryan Gosling, Paul Giamatti and Marisa Tomei are all fantastic and I shall also mention that Evan Rachel Wood finally seems to have taken an acting class as she is the best she's ever been in this, hopefully she stays on this track. And Mr Clooney has a great scene towards the end of the film.The twists are somewhat predictable, most of the time I knew where the story was going but it didn't stop me from enjoying the film, I just knew what was around each corner. I think this movie is probably more of a big thing for Americans, but me being an Aussie I didn't take as much from it as others probably have.But definitely give it a go, you could do a lot worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie, the acting was excellent and the plot was entertaining. It was a kind of cautionary tale about politics, or, rather, Clooney's reply to the (oft-asked) question about why he doesn't actually go into politics himself.The movie is not without its faults, though. There are some clichs like the "I'm Catholic" line which was a little too twee and made me wince slightly. I also thought the suicide was a bit extreme. Was it because she would have had to work for Ben? Or was it because of the shame of being used by two powerful men she once looked up to? Also, the new young female intern shown at the end of the movie seemed to have been offered up as "fresh meat" to the powerful men she worked for. Have I assumed too much? Thank God for the Ida character, though. Without her, the only female characters would have been weak and victims of (potential) exploitation by powerful men.Despite its flaws, I enjoyed this movie and have enjoyed discussing it, which is even better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a candidate outlasts more than a year of primaries and the general election, it's a phenomenon that he's still strong enough to govern at all. The Ides of March poses the predicament of whether it's feasible for any candidate to win and still keep integrity to his initial ideals. We follow Stephen Meyers, press secretary for Gov. Mike Morris, an idealistic liberal with that rare iron backbone that makes him a hopeful fantasy of modern democracy. Philip Seymour Hoffman is Paul, his experienced campaign manager. Challenging Morris is Michael Mantell's Sen. Pullman, managed by Paul Giamatti's Duffy. All of these men, excluding young Stephen, are cynical and occasionally mean, but all on the grounds of something they have faith in. Most of Meyers' faith is in himself.The big picture is highlighted in diminutive vignettes: campaign stops, glad-handing, speech writing, sleep loss and acute fatigue that compels the characters virtually to the verge of collapse. Irresponsible sex under these conditions is surely frequent, and Stephen makes romantic gestures toward Evan Rachel Wood's dubiously young intern Molly. Her naivete may be useful to him. He also has an evasive rapport with ruthless correspondent Marisa Tomei, as they labor one another for information. Clooney as director eschews action for stratagem. Here he holds certain of Stephen's cards very wisely close to the vest, as the lad uncovers a ruthlessness that startles even the case-hardened experts above him. The movie's ending close-up is protracted to unnerving effect.The screenplay is resourceful in how it interlocks personal and political determination, particularly when Duffy puts out to goad Stephen into defecting. His intentions are fishy, and surely Stephen is eager beaver for prospects to his gain. The movie doesn't take direct aim or even much involve Republicans. It transpires wholly within a Democratic primary campaign, and while sympathies evolve and alliances shift, they're all Democrats. There isn't the sense in The Ides of March, as there was with Primary Colors or Nixon, that we're gleaning the inside scoop on real-life politicians. It's more about the ironic catch-22 of prevailing media politics.The movie's prize asset is the class and skill of the acting, with Gosling yet again playing a character with an adamant charisma done with a less-is-more approach. He has a concentration that sticks to others and gets to the bottom of every moment's intention. That deep sincerity succeeds on many levels. Since the script is rooted in a play, it features some floodlight monologues that Hoffman and Giamatti make not only credible but stunning under the closer real-world study of the camera. Hoffman has some powerful scenes with Gosling, in which he learns the real definition of his scenario. Jeffrey Wright has a little but central role as Sen. Thompson, whose powerful endorsement can't be bought but might be open for lease.Clooney as director, "Part Frank Capra, part Michael Mann" as admirably well-described by Salon.com, is a discreet craftsman with mature cinematic instincts and New Hollywood prudence of allowing his actors to move the narrative. The Ides of March has been received reverentially, but not with as much enthusiasm as it deserves, which may suggest the muted disposition of its storytelling. Again, Clooney casts himself as a supporting character, that unruffled and enigmatic Democratic presidential contender who exhibits himself as a progressive champion and still preserves a concise, pointed detachment from even his closest consultants. Jennifer Ehle, best known as Elizabeth Bennett, has a tidy role as his wife. Morris is our pipe-dream hopeful, a governor who has squared the budget and promotes an impressive program of national reform, equalized with universal healthcare and free of lobbying interests. He's also an agnostic who declines to confer any religious beliefs, likely the character's least realistic ingredient.Most realistic is that Morris might not quite be all he seems. What candidate ever is? Ultimately, he's simply the handbag for Meyers and his ethical predicament. Indeed, the film is a casual wedding of actor and director, with Clooney freeing the crux of the movie to give Gosling's effortless solemnity and vigilance the hub. Even as he and Molly are in the seeming fits of affection, Stephen can't keep his attention off the breaking newscasts.In this world of lingo-loaded, confrontational dialogue and the overcast, springtime Cincinnati streets I've grown up loving, Morris is braced in a level match with Pullman, about whom we never gather anything except that the GOP thinks he's more vulnerable than Morris. The Ides of March may not be quite as idiosyncratic as Confessions of a Dangerous Mind or Good Night and Good Luck, but it's idiosyncratic in its quality in today's machine, and welcome installment in the exciting mid-career reinvention of Hollywood's arguably shrewdest star. Releasing nationwide right when the GOP is at the heart of its primary stink bomb, he comes to my town, a home of his as well, and fashions an understated portrayal of a more everyday sort of political takeover, but is plainly intended to illustrate a society descending on the same trajectory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow burning thriller but a great last 45 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ides of March" didn't grab me for the first hour or so. We all watch the news enough to realise that US politics is a sleazy business so it felt that we were seeing nothing new.However a fast paced last 45 minutes more than make up for this.Ryan Gosling plays Stephen Myers, the media savvy deputy campaign manager for Governor Mike Morris, played by George Clooney. They are in the run up to the crucial Ohio Democratic Party presidential primary. The race is neck and neck and whoever wins Ohio will be in a great position to take the White House.Myers, though battle hardened genuinely believes that his candidate can will a real difference if elected. This came across as a bit na?ve to me, but I suppose George can persuade you he can do anything! Two actions set in motion the crisis that will envelope the main characters. First Myers, again rather naively in my opinion, secretly meets the rival campaign manager. He also starts an affair with a young campaign intern.It is when the consequences of these events become clear that the movie really gets going. The ending is filled with tension though you are left with the inevitable conclusion that politics is a very dirty business and you have to look out for number one.Clooney directs and co-writes as well as acting and he does a fine job. The film lasts less than two hours but packs in a lot of characters and a fairly complicated plot.The cast is excellent. As well as Gosling and Clooney Philip Seymour Hoffman , Paul Giamatti and Evan Rachel Wood put in great performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering the troubling times we're currently stewing in, "The Ides of March" has been released at an opportune moment, tempting the discontented with a story of utter political corruption. Of course, we've been here before, with cinema always there to expose the evils of ambition, especially when it concerns the fanged machine of Washington. The feature is a perfect fit for co-writer/director/star George Clooney, who constructs a decidedly modern take on underhanded business, yet channels the movie-making masters of 1970s to help reach an unsettling position of stillness, watching as corrupt men and women slowly come to the realization that they've lost their integrity. It's a sharp, satisfying plunge into duplicity, perhaps Clooney's most intriguing offering as a filmmaker.Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is a hotshot aide to Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney), a Democratic presidential candidate using rampant idealism to bewitch voters. Stationed in Ohio, the Morris team scrambles to secure local support, with campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman) frantically working his connections to help the cause. On a whim, Stephen decides to take a lunch meeting with Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti), a top dog with the party rival, curious as to what he'll find. When word of that meeting spreads to New York Times reporter Ida Horowicz (Marisa Tomei), Stephen slips into panic mode, a prison cell of paranoia exacerbated by his affair with Morris intern Molly Stearns (Evan Rachael Wood), a young woman holding numerous secrets that could bring down the entire campaign.Adapted from the play "Farragut North" by Beau Willimon, "The Ides of March" sheds every bit of stage-bound immobility, pushing forward as a charging piece of drama, perfectly at home on the big screen under Clooney's expert care. Established as just another tale of innocence lost in the pro-wrestling world of modern politics, the material proceeds to introduce subtle changes of behavior, revealing itself to be a thematically rich investigation of honor in a vocation that feeds on dishonesty. The screenplay doesn't blare any horns, instead assuming a serpentine route of revelation, observing Stephen's arc move from buoyant political conductor to a cheated man out for revenge, only understanding the true purpose of his work when he's finally tasted fraud, comprehending that gamesmanship, not optimism, is the key to winning public office.This is a cynical film, kept afloat by its thriller overtones, gradually morphing into a tale of suspicion as Stephen comprehends the depth of sin inside the Morris campaign. "The Ides of March" is provocative but also enormously entertaining, held in place by Gosling's riveting performance in the lead role, supported by a superb ensemble of meaty character actors having a ball chewing on the juicy acts of intimidation and humiliation that litter the story. It's a stellar cast, sniffing out that uncomfortable place between professionalism and utter chair-throwing rage, summarizing politics as a world where everyone is out to get everyone, but there's always a handshake and smile to greet even the vilest opponent. Clooney captures such visceral frustration, that it keeps the picture fresh, even when the finale encounters formulaic acts of blackmail. The script needs a little convention to provide a conclusion, but the moments leading up to the climax are irresistible in their extraordinary discomfort and eye-quaking wrath."The Ides of March" retains the sensation of a terrific Sidney Lumet film; steady with dark material, yet procedural enough to make the viewer feel like they're learning something about the system. The balance is wonderfully maintained by Clooney, who saves his knockout punch for the final shot, studying the life in Stephen's eyes drain away, capturing the exact moment where the soul has dried up, replaced by steely, rehearsed political ambition. Chilling, but the truth often is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well acted drama on the dirt that goes on in a political campaign</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This political drama is worth watching even for fans who may be put off by the subject matter. The plot has quite a few characters and a few twists and turns so you have to concentrate to remember who is who and who is doing what to whom. Good acting all round. Evan Rachel Wood is quite mesmerizing as a young intern. Ryan Gosling is suited to his role as the main character working to elect a presidential candidate played by George Clooney. Supporting cast like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti are good as campaign managers and Marisa Tomei as a ruthless reporter.The story is cynical in in that there are so many flawed people and some plot elements are a bit melodramatic but it makes for a good entertainment. I saw the off Broadway play "Farragut North" on which this movie is adapted from with Chris Noth in George Clooney's role. The movie version is of course feels grander in scope and I think has more impact. Whatever your party affiliations this movie is a good illustration of dirty politics. Although a bit sad in its message that ideals have to be compromised, the things that have happened to some politicians recently show what is isn't too far fetched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality script and acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one sense, this is George Clooney's film and I have been a fan of his since forever. Not only does he direct (his fourth such outing), he is co-producer and co-writer as well as taking a lead role as the charismatic and liberal contender to win the Democratic nomination for the White House. In another sense, this is Ryan Gosling's movie and I've been impressed by him since "Blue Valentine" and especially "Drive". He is the face we see first and last in this story and he plays the pivotal character, the idealistic press officer to the candidate. But there is even more acting talent on display, notably Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti who are both terrific as heads of campaign for rival Democratic candidates in the key primary of Ohio in the melting snows of March. What attracted such a stellar cast and gives them such a vehicle to shine is a sharp script, based on a play by co-writer Beau Willimon who was himself once a key aide to a political candidate (Howard Dean). The play was called "Farragut North" which is the nearest metro station in Washington DC to the hub of lobbyist organisations in the capital. For an international audience, "The Ides Of March" works better as a title, giving us not just a calendar reference but a clear indication that we are going to experience more than one act of betrayal.This is no cinematic equivalent of "The West Wing", my all-time favourite television series. The small-screen team may have fallen short and even messed up on occasions but were fundamentally decent and honourable political operatives. In the more cynical "The Ides Of March", everyone is compelled sooner or later to make compromises which represent an abandonment of principles. The plot details do not bear too much post- viewing analysis, but this is an intelligent and serious work that captures some of the flavour of American political campaigning and the pressures to sacrifice means for ends faced by decision-makers everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insightful and engaging tale of deception and political corruption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boosted by a compelling script and a terrific ensemble cast "The Ides of March" is a profound and well-made political thriller that resourcefully addresses current political matters. It's a truthful and distinctive depiction of the cynical world of greed and betrayal.The brilliantly intellectual George Clooney (who stars, directs, and co-wrote the script) lures the audiences in with sharp camera-work, fascinating political intrigue and breezy pacing. He also manipulates the audience with accurate and concordant points about America's suppressed and demoralized political economy, while sending out moral messages about the importance of trust and commitment. The immensely talented Ryan Gosling (who stars alongside Clooney) effortlessly immerses himself into his role as if the character were an actual human being and shows that he has the distinctive personality and bittersweet charm to become a gifted A-Lister. The supporting cast which includes: Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote), Paul Giamatti (Sideways), and Evan Rachel Wood (Thirteen) are uniformly excellent and all serve a purpose to the storyline. Even though it proves to be too heavy handed for some, this is a rock-solid powerhouse thriller with Oscar-Caliber performances and a provocative storyline featuring astonishing twists at every turn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cynically brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't remember the last time I've enjoyed a movie so much. More to the point, perhaps, I don't remember the last time a movie so completely overwhelmed me. By the end, I felt as if the wind had been knocked out of me.The Ides of March is a rich, carefully, indeed brilliantly made movie that does not settle for simple caricatures and stereotypes. The main characters all have three dimensions, and, as the movie progresses, we learn not to trust our first impressions of any of them.One of the most brilliant strokes was casting Clooney as the apparently idealistic candidate, Mike Morris. Because Clooney directed the movie, you buy into our initial positive perception of the character, - spoiler alert here, folks! - which makes our discovery of his feet of clay at the end of the movie that much more devastating.Another brilliant decision was the way Clooney shot the very end of the movie, when Stephen - spoiler alert again! - manipulates his way to the top with what amounts to blackmail. Had Frank Capra directed this movie in a different time, Stephen would probably have finished the movie with a powerful speech denouncing the hypocrisy he witnesses, and that could have been very dramatic. (Think James Steward in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, etc.) But here Clooney has Stephen swallow everything he has seen, the betrayal of all the ideals that first made him go into politics. And we are left with just his face, horrified at what he and the man he works for have become.The Ides of March presents a very cynical view of how presidential politics works. It does so in a devastatingly powerful way. At times it may make you sick to your stomach, but at no time does it ever let your attention flag. It is one extremely well-directed and acted movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done... too political</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The moral of this story seems to be 'trust no one'. "The Ides of March" is a new political drama starring Ryan Gosling, George Clooney, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Paul Giamatti. Mike Morris (Clooney) is a democrat who is running for president and Stephen Myers (Gosling) is his media strategist.In the democratic presidential primary, Morris is running against Senator Pullman. When Pullman's campaign manager, Tom Duffy (Giamatti), makes a meeting with Myers asking him to switch campaigns, things take a turn for the worst.The entire movie is quite intense and depressing. It shows all the dirty, ruthless, backstabbing, disloyal aspects of politics. It makes me wonder if our presidents were elected for reasons other than the people's opinions.The acting was very impressive. Ryan Gosling was phenomenal, as usual. Many people I've talked to agree that he made the movie. However, the story had a few flaws. Many questions were left unanswered and the ending is a huge cliffhanger. My last complaint is that George Clooney seemed to be shoving his political views down the viewers' throats. He took every opportunity possible to voice his thoughts, which seemed unnecessary, in my opinion.My mind didn't wander once throughout the whole movie. I was completely focused on the story and didn't take my eyes off the screen. It is an extremely fast-paced film that requires your full attention. This is not the type of movie that you'd take a bathroom break during the middle of.The only reason this film is rated R is because of language. I don't think it's too inappropriate for most teenagers. I do think it might be confusing to many. Not everything is spelled out for you.I give "The Ides of March" a 7 out of 10 for being well done but a little too political, if you know what I mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is supposed to be a political thriller, but it follows more the rules of a Greek drama. Stephen the talented young campaign manager wants to enter the big boys league in politics. Now, as every field politics has its own moral standards and required skills. To prove his aptitude, Stephen has to accomplish an initiation ceremony, that turns out to be cruelly Spartan. I like the political movies of George Clooney, because he is interested in the human aspects of his stories but still manages to not over moralize things. The ides of March was not striking to me, but still I liked it. The characters are well played, the directing is okay, the story however is a little bit foreseeable. Nevertheless, it was good to watch some other kind of plot between all the shiny superhero movies and remakes. I definitely recommend it for watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever and high tense political drama that's full of ego, intrigue, secrets, and behind the door backstabbing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ides of March" is clearly one film that can be described as looking at the underworld of politics and it's dirty games of lies, secrets, and under the table and behind the door deals. As if like most you follow the political world and pay close attention you know that sadly that's what the political game contains you can trust no one it's a cold business of every dog for themselves. And the man Mr. everything George Clooney who goes rounds as both director and key star shows with this film that the political world can be exciting, entertaining always having high drama present and it proves secrets can be deadly, as the film can be seen as a need for good loyal and moral calling. And the cast is top notch with all pro talent especially the work of Gosling and Giamatti stands out.The film is set during the presidential primary season in Ohio a battleground state for the Democratic nomination, and leading the way is Pennsylvania governor Mike Morris(George Clooney)a big ideals liberal who wants to change the face of America. Along the way he's guided along by veteran campaign manager the loyal and tough Paul Zara(Philip Seymour Hoffman), yet underneath it all is the new shining star of the team that's new aide and press secretary the young and cocky pretty boy Stephen Myers(in Ryan Gosling's best role)and Stephen is ready to take over the world in many ways. It's then after these central players are introduced this film takes a deep journey into the world of political intrigue and office backstabbing, and this is most evident when Myers has a behind the scenes meeting with a rival democratic campaign manager for another candidate during this meeting the clever and brilliant Tom Duffy(Paul Giamatti)knows how to work a plan that will lead to a cat and mouse game of second guessing and betrayal.Only this film has a good subplot in a twist that complicates matters more a young sexy intern on the Morris staff named Molly Stearns(Evan Rachel Wood)has eyes for young pretty boy Stephen and after the passion of one stands play out a deadly hidden secret is revealed that could destroy all in the Morris camp. However in the dirty political world one has to twist things with promises and undercover blackmail as an endorsement from a democratic senator Thompson(Jeffrey Wright)sure patches the wounds up for this political campaign. Really it's tough for New York Times reporter Ida(Marisa Tomei)to get a straight story with all of the twist and turns that these political waters take.Really this is a detailed film that shows just what the political world is about it boils down to favors and backstabbing deals that have to overshadow the scandal and shortcomings that is all to common to candidates and political staffs. It sure showcases what I already knew along with others that the political world is a dirty game a cutthroat business every man for himself. And Clooney did a fine job showing how it works as his film was spiced with tension, suspense, drama and intrigue and some secret subplots. In the end this film had me thinking about morals, seeking the truth and wanting more loyalty as one can still seek hope even in a dirty business like politics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Death of an Ideal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ides of March" is not about the assassination of the Emperor on the Senate floor. However, the title serves as a metaphor. George Clooney's "The Ides of March" sublimely mourns the murder of idealism in one of the best movies of the year. New York Times Reporter Ida (played by Marisa Tomei) requests a favor for a press comment, reminding Ryan Gosling's Stephen Meyer that they are friends. Standing tall with a soulless stare of absolution Stephen says, "You are my best friend." Earlier in the Gulfstream ride, vibrant idealistic campaign press strategist Stephen tells his man, Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney), "? I have to believe in the cause." Gosling is powerful as Stephen, a good man trapped in betrayal choosing the lesser of evils, selling his soul with both eyes open. Director and Writer George Clooney's vision is fluid and captivating in his modern day tragic fable. Clooney is deceptively brilliant in his portrayal of Morris, the poised charismatic man of integrity. He boldly shades an unexpected darkness, in this tale of deceit and human frailty.Clooney along with Grant Heslov ("Good Night, and Good Luck"), and Beau Willimon wrote the screenplay for "The Ides of March" based on Willimon's play, "Farragut North". The story follows the Democratic Presidential Campaign of Governor Mike Morris (Clooney) converging upon the critical tipping point of the Ohio Primaries. His opponent Senator Pullman (intentionally nondescript Michael Mantell) is pretty much a vanilla flavor candidate, but close in the polls. Both are vying for the endorsement of Senator Thompson (brazen Jeffrey Wright), who holds 350 delegates?effectively anointing the nomination. Stephen and Campaign Manager Paul (great Philip Seymour Hoffman) discover that the Senator's endorsement comes at a price: Secretary of State. However, Morris knows Thompson is a dirt bag, refuses to play ball, essentially committing political suicide.Stephen (Gosling) takes an ominous phone call from Tom Duffy (earnestly manipulative Paul Giamatti), who is Pullman's Campaign Manager. He discloses a pivotal game changer, and asks Stephen to abandon Paul and Morris and work for him. Stephen declines, staying his course. Unfortunately, things get convoluted as information of their informal meeting is somehow leaked.Meanwhile, engaging in a diversion from the all consuming campaign 30 year-old Stephen has a tryst with brilliant and seductive 20 year-old campaign aide Molly (strong and sexy Evan Rachel Wood), whose Dad Jack Stearns (solid Gregory Itzin) happens to be Democratic Party Chairman. Seemingly free-spirited Molly hides a tragic secret. Here Director Clooney seamlessly and effortlessly blends the unsavory and unforgiving narratives. He always displays such confidence in his actors, as if we are ease dropping on their conversations.All is not even what it had seemed to be. Gosling's Stephen is left drowning in a Machiavellian quagmire of avarice and deceit. Evan Rachel Wood is tragic and vulnerable as the collateral victim of the cause. Philip Seymour Hoffman is amazing as Paul, the man who values loyalty above all. Hoffman compels as a man who can't out smart his tragic flaws. Clooney is awesome. His surprising dark turn is powerful, although it seems a bit out of context aside from the dramatic arc. Ryan Gosling is mesmerizing. Ultimately, "The Ides of March" soars because he solemnly captures the fall from idealism and grace. He embodies great humanity as a man transforms into what he most despises. "The Ides of March" has deep sadness in the loss of idealism, and poetically asks: At what cost do the ends ever justify the means? "The Ides of March" is provocative and one of the year's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Clooney directs a fascinating political thriller; Do the right thing or get your candidate elected?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Physically compare experienced political operatives with their interns. More than wrinkled faces and less hair up top separates them. The interns still have fresh ideals and expectations of the candidates they choose to support; the experienced staffers know better. There was a point on a campaign in their past where their own ideals took a left turn; a point where reality jumped up and showed them no candidate is perfect and a time when it became less about the future of tomorrow and more about just beating the other guy.Stephen Myers (Ryan Gosling) is at the intersection. He is the number two on Governor Mike Morris's (George Clooney) presidential campaign. He not only shares the Governor's political platform, but believes in the man himself. It is not the hero worship of the interns he supervises, but it is not the same almost numb feeling the number one campaign managers sometimes show. Stephen's boss and the Governor's main guy is Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman). He is on board because he shares in the political faith, but he knows more and it shows. His shoulders are hunched, he smokes too much, and he believes in loyalty to the candidate even more than he believes in his own mother.The Governor is towards the end of a tight Democratic primary and there is only one more candidate between him and the general election, one which will most likely favor the Democrat in the race. The campaign has stopped for the week in Ohio which is fast becoming a make or break primary state. Stephen and Paul are expertly drafting speeches, maneuvering the candidate where he needs to be, and cozying up to the New York Times political reporter Ida Horowicz (Marisa Tomei) for some favorable coverage. The other candidate is also in town though and he has his own political attack dog in Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti). Tom knows the real deal just as much as Paul and sees in Stephen what they all used to be, smart and talented, yet still a bit wide-eyed.Speeches are made, debates are contested, and each side is courting various political kingmakers. Every time it comes down to Stephen to make a decision, it becomes more and more a matter of what is right or what will get my candidate elected. What if you do the right thing but it causes your candidate to fall in the polls? What if you compromise your values and it gives your team the boost it needs to clear that last hurdle? Stephen has some tough choices to make and what The Ides of March really comes down to is will Stephen the individual still be the same somewhat fresh idealist he was at the beginning of the week? The Ides of March has a serious and tight screenplay and it matched those characters from the page with tried and true heavy hitters. Ryan Gosling is fast becoming one of Hollywood's premier true actors but even he loses the screen to the fascinating performances of Hoffman, Giamatti, and Tomei. These guys must tire of waiting around for that perfect script to come along because when it does, they are usually first in line to give it what they've got, and in The Ides of March, these three knock it out of the park. Gosling and Clooney are no slouches and must carry a lot of the film, but their roles are not as juicy as the supporting cast. Evan Rachel Wood also shines as a campaign intern.The Ides of March opened this year's Venice Film Festival and won its Brian Prize, the first American film to do so. The Brian Prize champions the values of rationality, human rights, expression, etc? and it must have been an easy choice. Scripts like this one do not come around once a week. True actors such as Hoffman, Giamatti, and Tomei rarely latch on to roles in the same film where they each have in-depth, staggering monologues. When one of them gets going, they could go on the same spiel for minutes on end with hardly an interruption. The choices people make really can change them as an individual. Do you choose the right thing every time or is the end all that matters no matter what the means?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tremendous collaboration and a rewarding effort that hearkens back to Clooney's success with Good Night, and Good Luck.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides of March, based on the Beau Willimon play "Farragut North," is a superbly adapted, perfectly acted, deviously brilliant drama that carefully examines its gathering of corrupt political minions. The characters are intriguing, clever and not of the cookie-cutter variety, despite journeying down the expected path of power-hungry and extortive. Although they're all antiheroes, betraying seemingly gallant introductions, the plot remains suspenseful and the scripting inspiring. Clooney has crafted a forte in political thrillers and brings with him an exceptional cast not likely to be forgotten by the time the Academy Awards roll around (although an early October release generally bodes ill for nominations).Charming Stephen Myers (Ryan Gosling) is the second-in-command to manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who works tirelessly on presidential candidate Governor Mike Morris' (George Clooney) campaign. As they prepare for the Ohio Democratic Primary Debate, it becomes obvious that their opponent Senator Pullman and his campaign manager Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti) are going to keep them on their toes. Stephen isn't accustomed to the dirty wheeling and dealing necessary to come out on top, but he's about to get a first-hand lesson on what politics are all about.Young, blonde intern Molly (Evan Rachel Wood) has a few dark secrets of her own, and looks to the idealistic Myers for help. Meanwhile, Paul attempts to recruit him to the other side, Senator Thompson (Jeffrey Wright) demands a cabinet seat to swing his delegates' votes, and Ida (Marisa Tomei), a reporter for the New York Times, is always at the ready to blackmail staffers into giving her sensitive information. Backstabbing, bribes, mind games and trickery are commonplace components of the presidential campaign and Myers' trip to the dark side ? for each of them, winning respect is merely confusing people into believing that their fear is actually love.Zara states that loyalty is the only currency in politics, but The Ides of March sheds light on a more powerful tender: information. While dissecting the crooked acts exhibited by every party in politics, revealing the nonexistence of integrity, and highlighting the inner workings of corruption, the film also presents genuinely exciting characters and award-worthy actors in those juicy roles. With their delivery and the natural, calculating dialogue, there's never a misstep ? it's a tremendous collaboration and a rewarding effort that hearkens back to Clooney's success with Good Night, and Good Luck. The new title, referring to Julius Caesar's assassination, isn't nearly as subtle as Willimon's original moniker, but the themes and outcome are just as affecting in the arresting contemporary landscape of governmental affairs.- The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In The Ides of March, Stephen Myers (Ryan Gosling) is a young press secretary working on the campaign of promising presidential hopeful Mike Morris (George Clooney). Days before the Ohio Democratic primary the campaign begins to unravel from the inside when Stephen makes a poor decision. However he may just have dug up enough dirt to really complicate matters.Based on a play by Beau Willimon, I must confess that I'm not terribly familiar with the source material. The film take on this story, however does reflect theater. There isn't a scene that can't be envisioned in a play. No chases, no CGI, no explosions. For that matter Clooney, who also directs, doesn't seek to achieve a movie presentation. Probably not the wisest choice since the political thriller is already every bit as endangered as the giant panda thanks for its history of lacking spectacle. I can only imagine the unnecessary 3D conversion proposed somewhere at the offices of Sony Pictures. It's somewhat bold of Clooney to give himself this role in the background, and not to give too much away it's an unorthodox way to paint oneself. Though the rest of the cast fairs well, the standout performance comes from Philip Seymour Hoffman. As Paul Zara, Mike's campaign manager, Hoffman gives the best speech of the film, shows vulnerability, and is ultimately the closest thing to a sympathetic character The Ides of March has to offer.The Ides of March is rated R for some political hot potatoes that come into the picture as well as cussing that would make sailors back down. I'm uncertain if the language is supposed to shock, lend surprising immaturity to politics, or make for bad jokes.An unorthodox conclusion doesn't help The Ides of March win over a crowd. There are movies designed to leave the viewer downtrodden, but ultimately the ability to project that emotion is appreciated. Here, the ship full of rats approach makes for a film where there isn't a friendly face to confide. The screen goes black and you have to look at yourself wondering if what you saw is the nature of politics getting dirty. Then you have to wonder why a movie about Democrats that takes place in March is running at a time when the Republicans are looking for a candidate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A couple cautions for the uninitiated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I very seldom write about the movies I rank at 9 or 10 (of 10), because by the time I see them on IMDb everyone and their brother already has written them up. I will make an exception in the case of THE IDES OF MARCH for a couple reasons. Firstly, some of my family members assumed this would be a modern-day updating of the the Shakespeare play JULIUS CAESAR (famous line: "Beware the ides of March!), following the likes of the wonderful RICHARD III (with Ian McKellan in the title role) or the mind-blowing TITUS (with Anthony Hopkins as the ill-fated Roman general). Alas for them, while THE IDES OF MARCH may have some parallels to Caesar's story, there is no iambic pentameter (or any other meter) in this George Clooney vehicle. Secondly, for what it lacks in "Et tu, Brutus?" literal lines, IDES more than makes up for with its main story line, which could be subtitled THE EDUCATION OF STEPHEN MEYERS (Ryan Gosling's character). Just as any true Christian fundamentalist is likely to believe ALL American million- and billionaires are facing a future of eternal torment (no way to get around that pesky "camel-through-the-eye-of-a-needle" thing), THE IDES OF MARCH simply constitutes another cinematic proof that one cannot climb much above the level of a road commissioner in American politics without rubbing shoulders with Satan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's just politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Hollywood genre with well-known dramaturgy is the election movies. It's always telling how rotten it is. Intrigues, sex, humiliation, lies. We all know it since long ago, but it would sometime be surprising to meet at least one film politician who is a good guy or girl.You don't meet anyone here, of course, but you get 100 entertaining minutes, including the as usual marvelous Philip Seymour Hoffman. George Clooney's script-writing and directing are better than his acting this time.You can't say these movies are recommending for democracy, but they are recommending for the typical Hollywood handicraft. In this case, anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ides of March</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides of March is based upon the play Farragut North by Beau Willimon, who here adapts his play for the screen along with George Clooney and Grant Heslov. The film takes a look at the behind the scenes world of American politics involving a Democratic governor seeking the presidential nomination as well as his campaign manager and team, journalists and rivals for the Republican candidate seeking the nomination as well. When, The Ides of March started, I really was not sure whether I liked it or not. The acting was all very good, but I did not like a single one of these characters and I found it getting to the point of melodrama and almost like a political soap opera of sorts. The film suggested different messages and things that I think it was trying to get across, but I really was not sure which of these messages it wanted to go with and what type of film it wanted to be. Thankfully by the second half of the film, my problems with the first half were all resolved and I found myself really enjoying it. The melodrama and soap opera features that I first had a problem with, I now discovered were plot points and triggers to bring the film to the point where it needed to be and the execution of said scenes were all done quite well and it reminded me more and more of a really good movie and not a weekday afternoon soap opera. I could also now see the message that the film was trying to get across and I understood that message and I think the film delivered it and made it quite clear in the second half. Also because of the message the film is trying to get across it makes for some interesting scenes and scenarios for the different characters in the film and it makes you the viewer riveted and on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. It really is an involving and engrossing little film. Who knew politics could be so exciting? I think the fact that none of these characters is really likable added to the film once I understood it better because what I think it was trying to do was just be honest and show us how crooked and one sided campaigns and politics in general can be. Anyone who watches a week of the news can tell you that surely. These characters are all out for their own gain and they do not care who they have to hurt, or manipulate in order for them to stay on top and remain there. The film is quite riveting and it leaves us the viewer with questions about morals and decency and is the type of film you would love to talk to others about afterwards. Just do not spoil it for them. Like, I said the acting is all very good here as is the dialogue and writing and the direction is very well put together and edited. If you look this film up, or decide to watch it, you will notice all the big names and talent in this movie and behind the screen as well. I can safely tell you that none of that talent was wasted and it is all put to very good use here. Also for those perhaps cynical, or afraid to see the film thinking it is more one sided to one party than another, I can say rest assured because I found that this film made both the Democrats and Republicans look really bad and that I do not think it is a biased film leaning to either the left, or the right. It is just very well done entertainment. The kind that gets noticed at awards season and believe me this one will get recognized and rightly so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Modern Classical Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I saw this film tonight , in Greece, and I ' m not very well accustomed with the American voting system which is completely different from ours, I have to admit that I enjoyed the film tremendously. I can also understand why this film is so annoying for the American people and of course the critics, who don't want to accept the disillusionment of the fake American Dream, but I can tell you this: George Clooney is getting more mature as a director from film to film (though his "Goodnight and Good Luck" was excellent, too) and is one of the (unfortunately) few American directors who are still carrying the flag of the unparalleled classical American cinema, that is a combination of entertainment with a social or political message in a masterful equilibrium." The Ides of March" is not an easy film to watch but it's made of Oscar staff, especially for its script, direction, camera and performances.Thank you George! We are very much obliged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made political drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Meyers(Ryan Gosling), is a young campaign manager for Mike Morris(George Clooney), a governor running for President of The United States. Stephen is really sure that Mike is gonna the next President. But when so many scandalous incidents that connect to the campaign, Mike is gonna discover in the world of politics, nothing is quite what it seems.Such a great film, George Clooney does well as actor and director, I like the way he sets up such intense moments that make you want to grab on the edge of seat. Ryan Gosling was good, he is in pretty much everything, from Crazy,Stupid,Love, Drive, and this. Phillip Seymour Hoffmann was good, so was Paul Giamatti is also good, both of them can't help but be awesome in there performances. Lets not forget Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Education in politics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clooney directed this film and did a halfway decent job. There were a couple of weak spots but overall he kept up the pace and kept the story interesting. A few truths come out in this film to remind us what politics is about: #1 loyalty is the currency of politics. #2 the longer you're involved in politics the more jaded one becomes. One of the best lines paraphrased: we don't make mistakes, we make decisions, (no one decides to make a mistake). Gosling was good as a young idealist, falling in love with Clooney's politics, but that changes and that is what makes the store interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stellar directing, excellent acting and a well crafted script makes this political thriller a must see film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philip Seymour Hoffman delivered an outstanding performance! Evan Rachel Woods delivered the right mix of sexuality and innocence which made her character likable and yet an object of pity. George Clooney proved once again that he has what it takes to become an A list Director and the acting skills to stay on the A list. Real emotional moments leaped from the screen drawing the viewers deeper into the plot. Scenarios from this political drama could have easily played out in the corporate world where a thirst for power often leaves loyalty and morality in a dry barren often forgotten place. Realism was the force of the day in this modern day drama. A sound script, an excellent cast, as well as all around excellent performances will probably lead to Golden Globes and Oscars nominations. Angelina Stevens gives this must see little political thriller 2 Bravos!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Clooney's Valentine to Republicans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We decided to see this movie for sure after reading the strongly negative review in The Washington Post, the unofficial messenger of the Far Left. Perhaps if they were motivated to discredit the film with their manipulative and dishonest review, there's gotta be something here to pay attention to.George Clooney plays a stereotype Liberal Democrat candidate: filled with empty and deceptive slogans, and cheap-shot distortions of his opposition; both Republican and Democrat. Every single person in the film, except perhaps the reporter played by Marisa Tomei, is a Democrat. And every person in the movie (including Marisa) is a viper or a snake --- engaged in backstabbing (thus the title), treachery, lies, distortions, extortion, manipulations, AND the seduction of underage female interns. These are people you would not have lunch with, let alone want as national leaders.Even though Republicans are shamelessly lied about in Clooney's film, they are infinitely better (in their total absence) than the corrupt Democrats the film highlights.This is a compelling drama, by 2011's lame movie standards; but I've cut my rating from 7 to 5 because I do not like being offended. No, not the politics; any screenplay which seeks to promote the phrase "Jesus f..king Christ" ought to send the writer to the woodshed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The paucity of the left/right paradigm is not much basis for an intriguing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this short and sweet. Don't bother with "Ides of March" unless you're a Gosling fan who has to see everything he's in; it's just not worth what they're charging these days at the theaters.I'll admit my expectations were high with the star firepower of Gosling, Clooney, and Hoffman all in one film, which, of course, led to inevitable disappointment. While I fidgeted in my seat, I kept being drawn back to my experience of seeing "Primary Colors" and the bad taste that silly film left in my mouth. Here we are in 2011 with dozens of cities being occupied as I type this, with thousands of disenfranchised Americans sleeping on cardboard in wet, chilly weather, and we're supposed to enjoy being told for 100 + minutes how corrupt our electoral system is? Bad timing, George.But beyond this cognitive disjunction is a starker problem: how all these characters with their obsession with poll numbers, or what Rachel Maddow and Chris Matthews are saying on cable shows that generally average much less viewership than talk radio has listeners--we all know it's the Emperor's New Clothes mind control. Corporate media is as dead as the two party, left/right paradigm BS that Americans have finally awoken to. It's difficult to willingly disbelieve otherwise in order to con yourself into liking this movie, and so Clooney tries to milk all the dramatic tension in "The Ides of March" around the repercussions of sexual politics. Thanks to the skill of the acting, this ploy almost works, but not quite because you can't help disliking or even hating these characters for choosing to waste their lives pushing this propaganda paradigm down our throats every four years.So I will slip on my Guy Fawkes mask now, taking on my role as "Anonymous," and beg you to skip this movie. It's a better movie than "Primary Colors," but that's not saying much. If you must see it for the acting, wait until Thanksgiving and get it off a torrent site.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Script + Predictable = Another Clooney Bomb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Within 5 minutes I had figured out the entire plot. Somebody in Hollywood needs to wake up because Clooney has zero clue as to what he is doing. Yet he keeps getting to make more movies. I watched the movie mainly because Giamati and Gossling are in it. Say what you want, but I don't what's worse this or Up in The Air or The American. Reviewers can say what they want about how those movies were artistic, but I guarantee if you made those same people sit through those movies again they would refuse. Like usual another hyped up Clooney bomb. I honestly cannot think of any reason to suggest to somebody to watch this. The political plot lines are so obvious a five year old kid could figure it out. This is not by any means a political thriller, at best it is a movie about politics and nothing more. I'm sorry great actors actually signed on to this movie, didn't they read the script or did they really need a paycheck that bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing leftist propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had hoped I would never have to think of this movie ever again, but I feel compelled to warn other unsuspecting movie goers. I was duped by the wonderful reviews and a preview that looked like, finally, I was going to see a movie with an actual conflict and a character who struggles with what is the right thing to do. I wasted my time and money on this leftist propaganda. What we actually have here are characters without a moral compass. And writers who assume (wrongly) that we all want the same things politically. They think the end justifies the means and they throw in a few digs as if to say "everyone is doing it so why not us?". It's so depressing. Those involved with the making of this movie tried to leave us with the message that all human beings are basically pond scum. I don't share that view, but I suspect those involved were being introspective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick and Classy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ides of March is a slick piece of political movie-making, accomplished actors playing out parts we have seen for decades on the real political stage. About the story, John Edwards or Bill Clinton could have written it.It's a dirty business when it comes to gaining delegate votes from our election-defining state, Ohio. Ryan Gosling as campaign media guru Stephen Myers once again shows he is our premiere young actor today. George Clooney as Pennsylvania governor and presidential wannabe, Mike Morris, is believably smooth, charismatic, and smart--and stupid like the rest of his fellow humans. Philip Seymour Hoffman as Paul Zara, campaign manager, like his role in Charley Wilson's War, is the consummate rumpled operative who has seen it all but remains vulnerable like the rest of the ambitious political animals.The plot, alas, is clichd; at least Clinton and a host of other libidinous legislators made sure it's a clich because sex with an intern has become the one rule no politician should break. Need I say more about this film's plot other than that Myers faces the erosion of his youthful idealism as he and his governor face extortion over dalliance with an intern? While the interplay of loyalties and lusts is entertaining, and nobody can beat Clooney, Gosling, Hoffman, and Paul Giamatti (as opposition campaign manager Tom Duffy) for ensemble honors, the film has a hollow center of imagination. I guess I have been so exposed to the expos that I demand more originality.The film's strength is the smarts that become necessary to avoid political death by disclosure. Even the venerable New York Times can be seduced, a slightly different angle of vision when the Washington journalists Woodward and Bernstein dealt with Watergate. Therein lies the weakness of an otherwise classy film: All the President's Men relied on tough journalism and mysterious operatives; The Ides of March relies on the expected, which is neither imaginative nor mysterious, just professional and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling and Gripping Political Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ides of March" opens in theaters on Friday, October 7th. Idus Martias (Middle of March) were the first words that came to my mind when I read the title of this movie on my calendar, reminding me the story about the assassination of Julius Caesar, a story of idealism, betrayal, conspiracy and political corruption and that is exactly what this film brings to the table. "The Ides of March" is a compelling and gripping political film directed and written by George Clooney and is an adaptation of Beau Willimon's stage play Farragut North. This is the fourth film directed by Clooney. The movie has a great cast starring Ryan Gosling, George Clooney, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Evan Rachel Wood, and the list goes on. No doubt it will have a few Oscar nominations. It's one of the best political thrillers I have seen.The plot evolves around a political campaign battle during the last days of the Ohio presidential primary. Winning Ohio will determine Mike Morris(Clooney) presidential nomination for the Democratic Party and eventually the presidential seat in the White House. Mike Morris is the liberal Governor of Pennsylvania who plays a Charmin, exceptional candidate who later on will remind us again the cynical side of politics. Stephen Myers (Gosling) is a young idealist press secretary willing to do anything for a noble cause as long as he believed in it. And he truly believes that Morris is the only candidate that will actually make a difference in peoples' lives. Ironically, his eyes are opened to the truth of the dirty game of politics; he learns a lesson and gets his first bite of the bitter sweet taste of success.</fullReview>
