		<shortDescription>A Fantastic film... but not for everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a member of the Hollywood community, I was blown away by this film... By the tight screenplay, the professional direction, and the phenomenal acting. In my opinion, I think this is one of the best films of the year so far. With that said, it is not a film for children. It is not a film meant to portray ideal role models for children. It IS a film meant to realistically depict the lives of people who live at the very bottom of America's socioeconomic ladder. If you find yourself unable to reserve judgment against people born into a life so vastly different than your own, you will probably not like this film. In order to appreciate it, you have to be able to see past the moral and ethical ambiguities of these characters.So if anyone feels unsure whether they can handle the ugliness of this type of world, but still feels curious enough to see it, take a cue from the Anthropologists... When studying a culture vastly different than your own, make sure to leave the rights and wrongs of your society at home. Because once you impose the moral judgment and ethical standards of your world upon another's, you've sacrificed your objectivity. And by doing so, miss the very point of empathy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw it at the Los Angeles Film festival as well....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and I enjoyed it. What saves the film from being just another badly made 'hood flick, is Terrence Howard. I am so glad Craig cast an actor and not a rapper to play the lead. Terrence brings depth of character, pathos, and sympathy to a low brow pimp with low quality product to hustle.This movie could've turned out bad with clichéd acting and over the top performances (there were moments where I felt his strip club whore was too much), but what makes you stick with the story, is that you really feel sorry for these people and you want them to succeed. The producer Stephanie Allain was at the L.A. premiere, and said that the character wanting to have a dream of better things was the universal theme that struck her. Craig (the director) also said that the story used bits and pieces of his own life and people he has met in Memphis to craft a story that really does happen to a lot of black people trying to get into the rap game. True, the hook of the story, a pimp wanting to be a rapper, sounds really funny. Lord knows if Mike Epps or Brian Hooks (or God forbid, Snoop) had been cast in the lead, this movie would've turned booty real quick. But once again, Terrence Howard makes this story come alive. I enjoy rap, but don't find crunk and a lot of lyrics enjoyable, but I must admit, in the context of the world it comes from and the hopes that these characters have, I was one of many people (the black ones in particular) who found myself swaying and singing the lyrics to "Whoop that Trick" et al.As for the person on this board who commented that he too was at the Los Angeles Film Festival and found the white characters "acting black" tiresome, it must be said that in the south, black speech patterns and culture get picked up by whites. Living in close proximity creates that, and I didn't feel that the white characters were playing black. There was one comment in the movie where DJ Qualls arrives and Terrenc Howards character pulls Anthony Anderson aside and and questions the white boy's skills as a beat junkie, but that was the only time his color was brought up. But it was natural, no different than guys from Metallica questioning the skills of a black dude auditioning for a guitar gig. The subtext was simply "Does this dude even listen to crunk music?" Once his skills are proved, there is no question of race anymore.The film should do well. I will see it again with my mother. Yes my mother. She loves Terrence Howard as much as I do, and I feel the movie should have a wide audience, young and old (with parental supervision). I enjoy watching Terrence Howard work, he makes you feel everything he feels on screen, and if this thing doesn't make him blow up, I don't know what will. He is the movie. See it for yourself and decide for yourself. Cuz it's hard out here for a pimp, ya'all.Ps. For those feminists who get their panties all twisted because of any images of female exploitation, I must comment that all the women in this film (as broke down and trashy as they are) have dreams too, and Terrence's character realizes that they deserve better and strives to help them by helping himself. There is no such thing as a good pimp (like there is no such thing as a good slave master) but what redeems Terrence is that his pimp transforms his life and all those around him for the better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>most fun I've ever had in a theatre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this flick to a packet house in NYC and the entire audience, myself included was with every frame of this film. Every single beat hits exactly where it is supposed to. Every review I read talks about the music and the acting, but how about how genuinely funny this film is a way that few are?They took the material seriously rather than letting it devolve into schmaltz or comedy. The direction is straight on, no BS, no showy shots. They take their time with each scene.Good story, perfect characters well realized. Witty, crackling dialogue. You can't make this stuff up. And comparing this to 8 mile is like comparing dogshit to gold.A deeply flawed protagonist who is able to reach into himself and transform himself through the power of art, larger themes involve the disillusion with fame, consumer culture.This is everything a film is supposed to be. If it makes you feel good to knock this film, then you are a snob. If you think can make a better movie than this, then go ahead!People who love movies love this film. This is what film is about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrence Howard is phenomenal!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredibly moving, yet definitely not for everyone, Hustle &amp; Flow tells the story of D-Jay, an incredibly conflicted Memphis pimp down on his luck. In one of the most raw and intense performances of recent memory, newcomer Terrence Howard embodies D-Jay with an animal-like ferocity that will help you overcome what few formulaic clichés embody the script. In his mid forties, D-Jay seems too old and far too nice for his profession, and his "hos" seem to take notice. You see, D-Jay represents a lifetime of failed dreams, ambitions, and wrong turns. It seems as if it could all be over, but then fate offers him the opportunity to realize his life-long goal of becoming a successful rap star. D-Jay pours his heart and soul into his music, just as Howard pours his into the performance, and the result is somewhat of a urban Rocky, a true underdog tale. This is perhaps the first hip-hop film to actually get it right, and everything that 8-Mile should have been. Don't let the subject matter keep you from enjoying Howard's brutal tour-de-force.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent directorial effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hustle &amp; Flow" is a very strong directorial from writer/director Craig Brewer, and it is very worthy of the buzz that it has been generating for the last couple of months. I got to see it last night at an AFI screening at Arclight Cinemas in Los Angeles, and the audience really reacted positively to what they saw. The story is similar in some respects to "8 Mile," but it is a far better movie (and "8 Mile" was pretty good too). It features a tremendous performance by Terrence Howard as a low level pimp who suddenly breaks out of his dark surroundings to become a respected rapper. Craig had commented that had he made this movie within the studio system, he probably never would have been able to cast Terrence in the movie, and that would have been tragic. Anthony Anderson is also excellent as his friend/producer, and there is also Taryn Manning who is very strong in a role as a prostitute who wants to do more with her life. It's a movie with a lot of heart and integrity, and will appeal to anyone who has ever aspired to something with all their heart, regardless of the road blocks ahead. Here's hoping that "Hustle &amp; Flow" gets the audience it truly deserves!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Howard plays a Memphis pimp who decides to give hardcore rapping a shot in this arresting, gritty drama. Howard plays DJay, who pimps girls out of his beat-up Chevy Nova. When he comes into the possession of an electronic keyboard, DJay plays around with it and finds he has a talent for writing and performing hard, violent lyrics.On its face, this seems like a typical "man rises from the ashes of his hardscrabble life to experience success and then watches it all crash down around him" kind of movie. It's not a movie about suffering, success, and redemption, in other words. But it's not as predictable as it may seem at first blush, and Howard is not your typical actor, by any shot.DJay lives with his small stable of prostitutes in a tumble-down shack in the Memphis ghetto. As pimps go, he's not exactly Donald Trump. Some dance for an exotic club during the day and hook at night; some hook all day. But the money's not rolling in for DJay, who remains somewhat confident that he'll someday come out ahead. When he obtains the keyboard, inspiration strikes, and a chance encounter with an old classmate (Anthony Anderson) who's now a producer (of sorts) gives DJay the opportunity to jump out of the rotten life he's carved for himself.This never feels like a typical rise-and-fall story, and that's thanks in no small part to the powerful performance by Howard, who's much better here than in the critically lauded (by some) Crash. Appearing with Howard in Crash was Ludicrous, who also has a big role in Hustle and Flow - hey, some rappers are very good actors, it turns out. Howard, aided by a crisp script from Craig Brewer, who also directed, never portrays DJay as simply a nice guy with some flaws, someone who's been handed a bad hand and is making the best of it. It's clear that DJay's made all of his own choices, and the situation he finds himself in - depending on hookers for his livelihood - is of his own doing.But neither does the script show DJay as being entirely bad, either, as evidenced by some surprisingly tender, moving scenes between DJay and Key (Anderson) and DJay and Shug, his pregnant woman. These scenes don't come off as stilted or insincere, and that's thanks especially to Howard's strong performance. True, too, are the scenes in which DJay lays down a rap track in his home; you can feel the rage seeping through your television.This movie might be a difficult sell to those who have trouble relating to the environment and atmosphere in which DJay operates. Undoubtedly those who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks will recognize aspects of their own lives, identifying strongly with one or more of the characters. But even those of us who have never lived in squalor, who've generally had advantages that others do not, can appreciate the intense, gray world in which DJay and his associates live. Had this been a simple, typical biography of a musician from the mean streets, it wouldn't have had near the effectiveness, the passion of Hustle and Flow. The movie intrigues you, makes you want to know what happens to DJay, even when it's obvious he's a bit of a jerk. But because he's not a stupid man, his actions cannot be painted as simply good or simply bad. Howard, in particular, is well deserving of his critical accolades here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The subject matter and lyrics are a little rough, but the movie is a good one to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Synopsis) DJay (Terrence Howard) is a streetwise hustler and Memphis pimp with a stable of 3 girls, Shug (Taraji Henson) who is pregnant and not working, Lexus (Paula Jai Parker) who works in a strip club, and Nola (Taryn Manning) who works out of DJay's old beat-up car in a back alley. Even with two girls working and DJay selling dirt-weed on the side, it is hard for them to make ends meet. The utility company is about to shut off their utilities, if they don't pay the bill. DJay feels that he has hit rock bottom, and he needs a change in his life. A bum trades him a Casio keyboard for some weed, and DJay takes it home. While playing the keys, DJay gets an inspiration to write rap music. He begins to write down his pimping style raps, his flow, in a little notebook while Nola is turning tricks. DJay runs into Key (Anthony Anderson), an old friend and sound engineer, who takes him to a church choir performance that reaches DJay's soul. DJay looks inside his soul and decides to get out of the business, and now he has a dream of becoming a rapper. DJay teams up with Key to make a demo song. Skinny Black (Ludacris) is a platinum selling rapper about to return to Memphis for the 4th of July. DJay believes he can hustle Skinny to hear his tape, and his dream will come true.(Comment) The movie was filmed all around Memphis during 2004. Memphian Craig Brewer wrote and directed 'Hustle and Flow,' and I went to the red carpet movie premiere in Memphis on 6 July. Craig Brewer told the audience about his father's watch that was used in the movie, and he was wearing it for good luck that night. He was also wearing a 3-carat diamond ring that belonged to Sam Phillips. As for the movie, Terrence Howard's role as DJay is a remarkable one in that he becomes immersed in the character of DJay. Howard comes off as a real pimp with all the anger, conflicts, and frustrations, which he encounters in life. There is no such thing as a good pimp, but the character of DJay realizes that his women have dreams too, and that he wants to change everything around him and them for the better. The subject matter and the lyrics to the rap music are a little rough, but the movie is a good one to see. (Paramount Classics, Run time 1:54, Rated R) (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh take on music movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies and music, that's the winning combo when it comes to industry amalgams but haven't we seen it all? We have the good; The Bodyguard and 8 Mile, the bad Honey and the downright ugly aka Glitter (put the crossbow down, I had to mention it). However, this John Singleton produced flick snipes at the genre from a different angle.The increasingly talented Terence Howard (recently seen in Ray and Crash), plays DJay, a pimp turned rapper who wants to prove his worth and swap his tricks for a trade in America's crunked up south.Newcomer Craig Brewer takes the helm as we visit Memphis and see it through the eyes of the down but not outters consisting of DJay and his working girls. When he reunites with school friend Key (Anthony Anderson) they decide to take charge of their lives and realise their dream by putting together a demo tape of their skills, with the hope of hitting the big time.This is not a bad movie, in fact Howard is equally as convincing as a pimp with a newly found heart and as a rapper, something that was both a bold and a fruitful choice. If the star hadn't convinced on any level it is a sure-fire guess to say a non-rapper would never be allowed to rap in a movie, but he did and he did it well.The standard underdog making it to the big time route has been bypassed and replaced with a story that hold's your attention and has an unpredictable and real conclusion.Amongst Flow's supporting cast, Isaac Hayes takes stage as the bar-owner who puts DJay in touch with the hometown's former star- Skinny Black, played sneeringly by Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges. As well as these two familiar songsters, Anthony Anderson and DJ Qualls, of Road Trip fame, make up the group and put in solid performances. The female cast who constitute DJay's trade are Eminem's ex-girlfriend in 8 Mile, Taryn Manning and Paula Jai Parker as the outspoken Lexus, again all providing non-sterling but convincing turns as part of the phat pack.But it is Taraji P. Henson's part as the heavily pregnant Nola who catches the eye as a sweet and na?ve part of the outfit. It is her who seems to be the only person that allows DJay to relinquish his sometimes brutal pimp suit and put on something more responsible and caring as he ventures out hustling for his right to fame.This is not your standard cheer at the screen rise-to-fame story that Americans seem to love, too much. What it is, is a well thought out project that takes you on a journey of trials and tribulations that are the all more convincing when performances by Howard, Manning and Henson garnish the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly Surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently had the pleasure of viewing a local Hustle &amp; Flow screening. I referred to this site beforehand to look at the technical details of the movie and to gain a general understanding of the buzz from the message boards. All I seem to recall reading were negative comments about the movie saying that it was such a cliché. Well, maybe I haven't seen as many movies in the hip hop coming of age genre, but the only movie I recall being remotely close to this one was 8 Mile (which I liked btw). Anyways, I saw the movie and I really don't think it was that cliché. The dialog is definitely original, the characters are original, the location is original, and there is a lot of depth within the character of DJay, the pimp trying to become a rapper. I thought the acting in the movie was excellent and I am glad that there is a wide release movie out this summer that isn't a sequel and didn't cost $200 million to make. This movie is bound to do very well, it only cost $3 million to make and it is a pretty good movie. The only problems I had with this movie were with some of the logic and character motivation. I don't think the movie explained very well WHY DJay (the pimp) wanted to become a rapper all of a sudden. They make the entire music making process seem like a piece of cake, but hey it is a movie and there are ultimately time constraints. I thought DJ Qualls was gonna be just a really lame piece of comic relief, but he actually adds depth to the film. I found Hustle &amp; Flow to be very enjoyable and much more memorable than Batman Begins (which I saw last night!). This movie is definitely worth seeing this summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>close to real life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very good film. I have noted criticism that the film slips into formula in its second half; true. But the situation is so bleak for these characters, I doubt that American audiences would have accepted a more believable ending; and, after all, there were far worse "happy" endings that it avoids.The gritty staging, the solid no-frills camera-work and editing, and some really excellent performances make this well worth the effort to confront dishonest characters struggling to find some sort of integrity in their efforts to survive and succeed. These characters are not likable - none of them are, they each have a tic that denies them total sympathy from the audience. But they are all very human for that, and so ultimately win our respect if not approval.Among the actors, two performances especially shine. Terrence Howard as DJay shows timing and expression worthy of much older, more "schooled" actors. Anthony Anderson is a real and pleasant surprise; stuck in character roles for the past decade, Anderson has become a real annoyance to me, as the usual character he plays is really excessive, a caricature. In this role, he is allowed to just act, and he delivers a wholly believable multifaceted performance.Hollywood has been producing such bad films that saying this film is among the best released this year may not be saying much (there are real and undeniable weaknesses to the film). Nonetheless, on the whole, the film is a commendable and rewarding effort to present a drama involving human beings living close to real life, and not cartoons. I credit that effort, and recommend a viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading through the comments, it looks like at least a couple of people saw the same movie I did. Hustle &amp; Flow - this movie is a hustle and more of us should follow our instincts to flow out of the theater in the first minutes of the film - No, It doesn't get any better the longer you stay. . . misogyny, stereotypes, sexism, patron-ism, Hustle &amp; Flow has it all. Yevette finally "sees the light", abandons her middle-class existence and joins the crew at the house full of ho's. Nola don't mind DJay messin with her head cause sometimes it needs messin with. DJay, the sympathetic reformed pimp throws one of his girls, and an infant, out on the street - wow, my kind of hero. I'm not sure what audience this "black movie" is intended to reach, but I am definitely on a crusade to minimize the number of people who waste too much time and too much money watching this, yet another in a long line of movies that denigrate Blacks and women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A combination of strong acting, realistic direction, nice music and real emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D-Jay (Terrence Howard) is a pimp from Memphis trying to do more with his life. When he learns that a hugely successful rapper, played by Ludicrous, is returning home to Memphis, he plans to become a rapper himself, writing songs about life as a pimp in hopes of being discovered. Hustle and Flow is an inspiring, engaging and intense film of becoming something. The majority of the film is realistic with relatable characters and situations. It shows the many struggles of life and it proves that hard work does pay off. The beginning of the film was a little tough to watch because of the living style of the main characters. It was a little scary to see what some people have to do just to get by. I think director Craig Brewer did a fine job at portraying these situations without making them seem too cheesy or over the top. The second half of the film focused on D-Jay and his struggles to find his right music. The music is surprisingly good and meaningful. I say "surprisingly" because rap doesn't really interest me but the film actually made it tolerable. The lyrics don't hold back and they may be offensive to some. I thought they were okay and they had more to do about life rather than the usual stuff you hear in rap songs. My favorite scenes were the ones that took place in the recording room. As cheesy as this may sound, they were more inspirational and engaging. It showed different types of people working together and coming up with some nice material. The final act features D-Jay meeting with Skinny Black and hoping his songs get picked up by him. The conversation between Skinny and D-Jay was pretty good but it was also a little depressing. It's sad to have someone lie right to your face about how good you are and then find your music in the toilet. It just shows how tough the real world is and it makes D-Jay tougher for not giving up. The ending wasn't as strong as everything else. It was a little cheesy and unrealistic. However in some ways, it was nice to see a sort of happy ending.The acting is terrific and everyone gives a good performance. Terrence Howard plays D-Jay and he gives a very engaging performance. His character isn't very likable but it was easy to root for him. His performance was just that good. Taryn Manning is just as good as Terrence and she also deserved an Oscar nomination. I can't believe this is the same girl from Crossroads considering her performance is really strong. I don't really like Anthony Anderson but even he gave a good performance and it was easily his best performance ever. Taraji P. Henson and DJ Qualls are also just as good as the other actors. Personally, I think Ludicrous gave a better performance in this film than in Crash. While the film is pretty good, it's not for everyone. Most of the characters are unlikable due to their lifestyles and attitudes. Some people may find it hard to care about these characters if they think so low about them. Also, the women in this movie are mistreated and some people may be disgusted by this. The story is also unoriginal and it there were a few clichés. Personally, I thought that the acting and the direction were strong enough to overcomes these weaknesses. In the end, Hustle and Flow is a difficult film to watch at times but it's still a strong film that's worth checking out. Rating 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting example of modern disrespect for women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is useless as a "realistic depiction" of life as an up n coming rapper. Sure some people may actually live like this, but I think it is more a portrait of what white America thinks black America is like, not how it actually is. Also, I was shocked with the way the women characters were repeatedly emotionally pulverized and abused mentally. This is quite an interesting insight into a real, right now, modern perspective of gender inequality. Forget all the racial stuff they tried to push into our faces here and think about how the women were treated. It was completely awful and it is not reality... it is a glimpse into the warped male minds that made this movie.Who cares about all the cuss words... the truly troubling stuff in this movie come out in unintended innuendo, none of it is intentional.God what an awful 8-mile wannabe, and 8-mile sucked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performance in the lead but the material isn't all that it needs to be and slips away totally at the end (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DJay is a smalltime pimp, selling his one or two worn girls out of his battered Cadillac or seedy strip-joints. However time has worn his enthusiasm for the game and he longs for more. Meeting up with an old classmate who has recording experience, DJay sees the opportunity to take his experience and use it to make his dreams come true through hip-hop. His aspirations cannot get him away from the reality of his situation but the impending visit of local rapper-made-good Skinny Black could be the break he needs.It is not possible to talk about this film without focusing on the person that really puts it all on his back and carries it from start to finish ? Terrence Howard. Never someone who has impressed me, Howard did well in a small role in Crash and has improved again to produce a convincing central performance here. DJay could have been a big cliché played by a rapper that deeply enjoys the credibility of the pimp role but in Howard's hands the role is much closer to being a real person. He doesn't enjoy the pimp life so much as convincingly mire himself in it ? his eyes are filled with an anger and pain that say more about the person than a thousand Jay-Z songs ever will. His character is key to the film and it is Howard that makes this part work.The rest of the film is more or less worthy of him but loses its way right at the end. For the majority we are allowed to act as witnesses without sides in his story ? we aren't pushed to see him as a good man or a bad man, nor to allow the fact he might be "good deep down" to excuse his violent exploitation of women. It is a fine line but the film balances it well. This success helps to make the plot more interesting considering that it is only ever a note away from being just one big "making it out the hood" movie. The scenes of hip-hop hope are a bit cheesy but they are well balanced out by the sleazy and unglamorous reality of the lifestyle. It could have been deeper and more about the characters but it is still interesting enough to do well ? up to a point.Unfortunately this point is about 20 minutes before the end of the film when suddenly Brewer abandons his approach and falls back on cliché, easy options and, worst of all, an optimistic ending that sees him holding DJay up in a way that he had mostly manage to avoid doing. The whole end flies in the face of what had gone before and throws off the balancing act it had done up till that point. It is a shame because it should have been more downbeat and interesting but instead it takes the line of least resistance. It may have been Brewer but, in his defence, it does smell slightly like the work of a studio executive or an American test audience. It still just about works although not even Howard can cover the disappointing in the final act.The rest of the cast do well to help him. Usually Anderson is enough to make me avoid a film but, as with the most recent series of The Shield, he shows that he can act and has a solid serious side. He is good and surprisingly unshowy support for Howard. Manning is good as Nola but again the end of the film sees her betrayed and asked to be something she is not. The vulnerable and pregnant Shug is really well delivered by Henson; her character may be simple on paper but she does well to be really quite touching and sympathetic. Parker has a black cliché in her finger-clicking, swearing performance but she is good enough to do the job without dragging the rest down a notch. Ludicrous (who also impressed me in Crash) is pretty close to his rapping personae in an easy role but he deserves credit for taking a beating on screen and being convincing in his one role. Hayes is a bit distracting in such a small role but again is a nice addition.Overall this is a pretty good film that pulls off the balancing act and avoids judgement for the majority, helped in no small way by a very strong turn from Howard. However at the end it undoes all this god work with an ending that is so easy and pat that I genuinely doubted it had been delivered by the same person who had written and directed the first two-thirds. Close to cliché and corn at times but it mostly mixes them well and the film is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Hard Out Here for a Child Molester Too...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, did I ever detest this movie. I shut it off after an hour and can't find anything good to say about it.Now we're glorifying pimps? It's incredibly offensive to me that the song "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp" won an academy award. (worst of all, I can't get the stupid hook out of my head). We're supposed to feel bad for how hard this guy's life is? I could feel bad for him if he was the one having to sell his body day after day ? but I really can't get much sympathy going for a pimp. How about, "It's hard out here for a child molester." Does that grab you?It's hard enough out 'here' for a law-abiding, gainfully employed black man ? how about showing THAT in the movies. Instead of the same representation black men get over and over ? pimps, drug dealers, addicts (or the 'success' stories: rappers and athletes). Even though the movie doesn't show him beating on his 'employees,' you know that he must ? the women are clearly scared of him and his first song is entitled, 'Whoop that Trick' (toned down from his original title, 'Beat that Bitch'). And no, I don't believe he's referring to beating up a customer (which is not really too common). Some statistics: "80% of prostitutes are sexually assaulted by pimps via sadistic sex; 71% of pimps use drugs to control the women; and 34% of the women received death threats from pimps personally or to their family." - from "Sex Trafficking In the United States, Coalition Against Trafficking of Women Study," Raymond, Hughes, Gomez (3/01)The women are all incredibly superficial characters (the weepy, weak-willed caregiver; the dumb but docile white girl; and the bitch).And Djay's dream of being a rapper. I'm sorry - just because he has something he needs to 'spit out' doesn't mean it's something worth listening to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black on Black Hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hustle and Flow must be the favorite movie of The Klan, David Duke, and Clarence Thomas. Not since Birth of a Nation has there been a worst depiction of African American people. Every character in the movie is completely self loathing and full of misogynistic thoughts and actions. Terrance Howard plays a failure of a pimp who mistreats his prostitutes and throws one of them on the porch in the middle of the night along with her crying baby in his walker.This movie depicts that there is no craft to making rap music and that it is the theme music of the slime of society. Every song is about drugs, violence, bitches and hoes.He later beats up a drugged rapper and shots his way out of the situation. He goes off to jail but not before he convinces his white prostitute that she is in charge. What a movie hero.John Singleton is the new D.W. Griffith perpetuating destructive black stereotypes. What did we do to you John? Who hurt you? Hustle and Flow should be called Black on Black hate. The hustle is the marketing to hip hop audiences; the flow is the cash flow the studio will make.uptownbill@hotmail.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When, people originally are told about this film, understandably the idea of rappers and gun crime can seem a little cliché, and almost annoying watching another film about idiots shooting each merely for the sake of it.However, this film could not be further from that, this is deeply psychological movie, which in its own way can make you sad and Happy at the same time. Terrance Howard (D Jay) plays a what can only be described as a philosophical pimp, whose desire to better himself is truly up lifting.Though whats makes this film so spectacular is not really the music, but how the music is made. In this film we watch the process of not only the lyrics but the beats and original sound, that separates this movie from its grotty genre and elevates it to that same level as pulp fiction and reservoir Dogs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Craig Brewer's 'Hustle &amp; Flow' is one of the finest independent films to come out in Hollywood. A films that shows reality in its truest form. A story about a pimp aspiring to become a rapper. The idea is fantastic if first of all, and the execution is just a cherry on the cake. Agreed the film ends up sad, but it leaves you satisfied and energetic. 'Hustle &amp; Flow' rocks.Performances: Terrence Howard is fantastic, the soul of the film. He's astonishing in every frame he appears in, and is easily one of the best performances of this decade. Anthony Anderson is as usual, excellent. Taraji P.Henson delivers an earnest performance. Taryn Manning is a revelation. She's superb. Others are decent.on the whole 'Hustle &amp; Flow' is a brave and reverting film. I love this film, and I recommend each and every cinema this film.

		<shortDescription>What a shame!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a real shame! This film has a LOT OF QUALITIES : the acting is good, as well as the photography and even the story is not so bad...so, what's wrong? First, there are too many problems with the montage : so many time, you feel that a scene could be shorter, because what is shown is not so interesting, or because what is meant at a time is so obvious that it could be just suggested and shorten but not shown entirely. And that is to me, the worst waste in this film. Especially for a musical movie, rhythm is the key, and here, it lacks rhythm, which, pardon me, for a rap movie is a kind of paradox, isn't it? The second weak point, is about the acting : I agree that THE ACTORS ARE EXCELLENT, but you feel sorry for them, as the direction missed to bring some changes, some variations in their acting, so without those variations you get more and more tired, even with the best actors. So, because I am not a modest person, I will say as an advice for everybody here that want to make a film for me:0) be more suggestive, and never forget VARIATIONS, and Rhythm!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>story sort of boring. I didn't think this was that great of a film. Yes, Terrence Howard gives a good acting performance, but I didn't find the movie that entertaining since it doesn't have much of a plot. It's about a pimp who just has a couple of girls he pimps out of his car. He wants to become a rapper like one of the guys he grew up with. He runs into an old friend who is in the recording business and gets him to record some songs. He gets into some trouble at the end, but still gets his music played on the radio. I don't really find a pimp to be someone to root for.Since I'm not much of a fan of rap, I didn't care for all the music in this. Plus, it has a lot of unnecessary cursing I didn't care for.FINAL VERDICT: Over hyped. But, if you like rap, I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a movie as much as it is a film. It depicts the seaming underbelly of the drug-infested music scene in the poor areas of Memphis. The cinematic properties and writing are like something out of a rap video crossed with a John Woo movie. It allows the viewer to delve into the life of an up and coming rapper slash drug dealer going through a mid-life crisis. Everything is so miserable that you can't help but develop a sense of compassion for the struggling performer that is the protagonist. You find yourself wishing for a happy ending. There is actually a sense of purpose within watching the film; something rather rare in this genre. All in all this is definitely a film worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Hard Not To Love The Singing Pimp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hustle &amp; Flow is the Baadasssss of 2005. It's a well-acted, low-budget flick about black culture and it seems to have been made with equal parts heart &amp; talent. Both films are emotional, entertaining, and completely riveting. The more popular comparison is to Rocky, which is perfectly valid too...if the Italian Stallion had been a Memphis pimp instead of an illiterate club fighter in Philly. I won't continue comparing director Craig Brewer's 2nd picture to ones that came before, except to add that it's not only similar to Rocky and Baadasssss, it's almost as satisfying as both of those. And for a movie with some dark themes, it's a lot of fun to watch.If you're a fan of music, you're bound to love the lengthy scene in which DJay (Terrence Howard, in a fabulous Oscar-nominated performance) is trying to lay down a track for his breakthrough hip-hop (and Oscar-winning) song, "It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp." It's fascinating to watch the whole process. Maybe the speed and success with which the song gets put together isn't realistic, but that doesn't stop the scene from being fascinating. DJay had been a fairly horrible guy up until this point in the movie. Here's his turning point. When his natural talent for hip-hop shines through with ample support from his friends and hoes (yes, they have a role to play in this music venture), DJay becomes a new man. Howard is a good actor and it's hard not to be on the side of a good actor, even though DJay does and says some terrible things to his ladies.His faith in Nola (scrappy Taryn Manning) and his apparently genuine love for Shug (a spectacular Taraji P. Henson, stealing scenes in the Adrian Balboa role) redeem his earlier thuggery. Those 2 actresses are terrific and so are Anthony Anderson and DJ Squalls, who play Howard's music gurus. Brewer, who also wrote the script, guides them all with a steady hand. He even manages to create some real tension in the climax because the end result isn't telegraphed from the start. Can the guy who sells women for a living sell himself to super-rapper Skinny Black (Ludacris)? The final scenes that follow are bittersweet, although more sweet than bitter. What's ENTIRELY sweet about Hustle &amp; Flow is the music, the acting, and coolness factor. Definitely 2005's Baadasssss.</fullReview>

That girl is the only Academy Award nominee that might emerge from this easily overlooked mood piece.

		<fullReview>People, let me tell you something, and please read this through so you don't get the wrong impression here: I'm not a big fan of movies containing similar plots that involve mostly "black" culture, Ebonics, pimps and the kind of materialism they promote. And that's partly because I've seen a number of them. So, first time a friend of mine told me he had "Hustle &amp; Flow" on a DVD, I said "Nah, thanks." But then after about 4 months, for some reason I went to check the reviews for this title and decided to take a chance. I rented it and then ripped it to my hard drive, for those evenings when you have nothing better to watch. Then one day, I helped this guy with his motorcycle and he wanted to pay me for that. I refused to accept money from him but instead he tucked about 1g of pot I'm my pocket. I's been a while since I've taken any and I though, hey, let me refresh my memory. So there I am, stoned like an Indian cow, in front of my 24" widescreen LCD, starting this DVD with the following mindset: "If it's not entertaining in the first 10 minutes I'm zeroing this movie for good".And the the very first scene, where he reveals his riped mind to this ho' who couldn't compose one simple, meaningful sentence as a reply to his 5-6 minutes dissertation, blew my fckng mind to pieces. I couldn't stop watching, my eyeballs where drying up, I didn't want to blink. The whole movie flows with such characters, each is worth studying. But most of them develop throughout certain time period, while DJay was already developed, fully bloomed. So here we are, watching this knightly character who knew what he wanted so much more than the others that he simply hanglides through them throughout the whole movie.You must see this movie stoned cause I cannot guarantee what would I say if I wasn't. So take no chances, get some weed from your neighbors teen and rent this mottafuka at once. And make sure you watch it with someone who has the similar mindset like you or just be alone.Let me know what you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Musicians (and those wanting positive black characters) will hate this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know Hustle &amp; Flow was highly regarded and that I'm alone in my viewpoint, but as a musician I couldn't stand it. The best music in the movie is the Gospel music that supposedly inspires the protagonist "pimp with a heart of gold." Being inspired to be a rapper after hearing gospel music is like being inspired by basketball to take up bowling. What's the connection? Anyhow, it's all downhill after that.For example, in the scene where the white dude teaches a woman the "hook," it's clear the director is not a musician because every time there was an edit the key of the tune changed. The "hook" itself was not a good one, neither catchy nor interesting: "You know it's hard out here for a pimp/When you're trying to get the money for the rent/With the Cadillac and gas money spent/We'll have a whole lot of bitches jumping ship." Okay, there's a chiasmus in the rhyme scheme (ABBA symmetry) which is quite sophisticated for rap. But the "woe is me, I'm a pimp" sentiment is laughable. We then have every cliché in the book to show how hard he struggles. The only thing missing is a drunk mother like in 8 MILE. It ends with him having a hit single after getting into a gunfight and doing time, so I guess the moral of the story is "anyone without talent can succeed in rap if you are violent enough." Sadly, this is probably true.Although I am completely against censorship, I found myself agreeing somewhat with those who felt films like this one, Get Rich or Die Trying' , etc. are a bad influence on everyone, particularly black youths. The fact is people are impressionable. If they weren't, advertisers wouldn't be spending millions to persuade us. So gang violence doesn't happen just because they saw a particular movie, but certainly these movies glorify and validate a lifestyle that gang members will then emulate. Sometimes life really does imitate art.And as someone who has argued against the negative portrayal minorities in the media, I find it much harder to defend blacks since their negative portrayals are now being perpetrated by black filmmakers themselves. But you can't have it both ways: either the black community is badly served by these movies since blacks are really just good people like everyone else; or these films are truthful, blacks are to be feared and therefore the police are justified in racial profiling. What's is going to be? I sure hope it's the former.Where's Spike Lee when you need him? He is the lone voice in the wilderness pointing out that rappers and gangstas are nothing more than minstrel acts -- gross caricatures of an entire community. People who think this is reality are selling themselves short.To paraphrase Public Enemy (when rap actually had something to say), "50 Cent is a hero to most/But he never meant sh*t to me."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hustle and Flow will have you hustling to a theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance Hustle and Flow may appear to be a goofy film about the hard- knock life of a pimp trying to break into the rap world, but after viewing the film at Sundance it is clear that this dramatic film stands heads and shoulders above its peers. TERRENCE DASHON HOWARD has a break-out performance as DJay, the pimp with bigger dreams of becoming a rap star. TARYN MANNING and TARAJI P. HENSON share the screen wonderfully with HOWARD as his "supporting ladies". ANTHONY ANDERSON and DJ QUALLS complete this rat pack as the men behind the music. As the film unfolded, I found myself invested in the characters fears, hopes, and dreams. They are stuck in a world of prostitution and drugs, and everyone's hopes to break out of that cyclical world are resting on DJay's shoulders. I enjoyed watching the characters develop and learning more about their inner wishes as the plot progressed. They may be rough around the edges, but they know how to work what they have. Also the music in the film should be credited as a supporting role. A great soundtrack will be coming out of Hustle and Flow. The film avoids a cliché ending, yet it still satisfies the viewers needs.</fullReview>

It's a typical underdog story, but there's something about the detail and small steps towards achieving something great that I loved. You can feel DJay's frustration, passion and push forward towards achieving a goal and a dream, something that unexpectedly infects the people surrounding him, to the point of creating a cult following and loyalty. An interesting character, crossing thin lines between abusive and comprehensive, but through passion creates empathy. With an AMAZING soundtrack, great acting with heavyweights like Terrence Howard and Taraji P.

		<shortDescription>The roots of "Empire".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I are HUGE of "Empire". So, imagine when I discovered two of my favorite actors, Terrence Howard ("Lucius") and Taraji P. Henson ("Cookie") had appeared together 10 years earlier in a similarly-themed movie about hip-hop. Unfortunately, while "Empire" is consistently entertaining, "Hustle &amp; Flow" builds slowly and unpleasantly. While Terrence Howard's "Djay" is an earlier incarnation of "Lucius," Taraji P. Henson's "Shug" appears mentally-challenged. Worse, the two characters responsible most for the outcome are white. Also, the scene where "Shug" gives "Djay" comes out of nowhere. Just WHERE did the very-pregnant "Shug" get the money to give "Djay" this VERY expensive gift? Not to mention, the Oscar-winning song, "Its hard out there for a pimp" is not as good as the original song created for "Empire"; and it pretty much the only song in the movie.I fear many of those who see the reviews and awards for "Hustle &amp; Flow" are going to be as disappointed as my wife. I liked "Hustle &amp; Flow" for its raw honesty. However I resent the "tools" given to white racists who will watch "Hustle &amp; Flow" and say, "See?" I give "Hustle &amp; Flow" a "6".</fullReview>

Henson) is a pregnant mess. When he buys a kid's keyboard from a street drunk, he renews his music dreams. He bumps into his old schoolmate Key (Anthony Anderson) who with Shelby (DJ Qualls) helps him record his songs. It's a struggle as he hustles for the recordings and the chance to get his music played. He aims to bring his music to successful rapper Skinny Black (Ludacris), but it's a long winding road.This movie has loads of atmosphere due to the gritty Memphis locations. On the surface, it's another blaxsploitation movie about the hustle, rappers, drug deals, pimps and hoes. But it's much more about the downtrodden who still have their own dreams. It takes the stereotypical characters and give them life. Also there's a scattering of white characters here. So it's not a simple movie about pimps and hoes. Then there is also the great music. There is still no other Oscar winning song quite like "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp". The performances are superb especially Terence Howard. Even Anthony Anderson puts in a solid dramatic performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty Rag-to-Rich Tale!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hustle &amp; Flow is a good tale although it's slight Hollywood-ized version of a rags-to-rich story. But that doesn't stop this movie from giving effective performances and a gritty hustle and pimp story. This story is one that the small-town people can relate with and it's well-written one at that. Now, this is not my kind of music but I can still appreciate the way people have come to succeed in this music industry especially when things seem the darkest.Craig Brewer's first feature is about a full-time pimp named Djay. Djay wants to get out of that business and prove to the world he has skills to be a rapper. When his childhood friend, who is a millionaire rapper plans on coming to town, Djay enlists the help of his friends to make sure he can succeed.In 2005, this film as well as Crash put Terrence Howard on the map. He is brilliant as Djay. We can see his earnest passion to become a rapper and he brings much to this role. This character is what brought Terrence Howard to stardom. The supporting cast is decent as well even though some of the female characters are quite annoying.Overall, this is a borderline great film that tells the traditional rag-to-rich tale. This is not my kind of music, but I can appreciate all the hard work these people do. I don't know where this film would be without Terrence. I enjoyed this gritty tale for the most part. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do the pimp and rap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hustle &amp; Flow is a strange hybrid. Part rap, part urban drama and set in the south. Terrence Howard is a Memphis pimp, Djay who runs a stable of prostitutes and still has trouble making ends meet. No wonder life is hard for a pimp.After an encounter with an old school friend who also works as a music mixer he decides to write and rap about his life experiences, record music and hoping to have a shot at the big time. He hopes to this by persuading a big music star played by Ludicrous to listen to his tape on his return to town for a July the fourth party.Terrence Howard would not be seen as your first choice to play a rapping street hustler as he tends to be known for more urbane characters in films such as Crash but holds attention as the hustler and rapper who lives for today and then struggles to do that. He is no hero or even that sympathetic, he just wants to survive but at least he does have dreams and talent as the words seem to flow out of him.I guess the films might be problematic if you do not like rap and the subject matters of the rap songs with its swearing might be off putting for some.There is tenderness, when Djay, Shelby and Key get together to make music and its at this point the film displays its heart when before that, its Djay pimping out his women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confounds Expectations With Powerful Ensemble Acting and Relatable Idealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly powerful performances dominate what is essentially a familiar story of a man who dreams of having a better existence than the one he has. What's revelatory is the atmosphere that director-screenwriter Craig Brewer paints in this bitingly realistic film focused on DJay, a Memphis pimp desperate to change his marginalized life and become a rapper to get out of the ghetto. He's obviously bright and articulate but morally bankrupt, as he makes a living selling the services of two women, the young but world-weary Nola and the embittered stripper Lexus, with a third prostitute at home, the self-defeating Shug, pregnant with his child. In the midst of a mid-life crisis, DJay reconnects with an old schoolmate, Key, who is now a sound engineer for a local church, who in turn, introduces DJay to Shelby, a white musician with his own beat machine. Together they cut a demo tape that DJay plans to give a local celebrity, hip-hop rapper Skinny Black, at a 4th of July party thrown by a mutual friend Arnel.The film takes a while to gain its momentum, as Brewer establishes the gritty realism of his setting before moving the plot along. Credit Amy Vincent's verité-style cinematography, which makes us inhabit the ghetto setting without caution. Thanks mostly to Terrence Howard's searing portrayal of DJay, the story gains a palpable soul in his struggle to make it. Make no mistake in assuming the movie will be unrelentingly bleak and violent. It is, in certain ways, an idealistic film about finding one's destiny no matter how onerous the odds. Brewer is wise to keep his focus on the characters rather than the situation as the actors deliver the goods in unexpected ways. Comic actor Anthony Anderson is surprisingly subtle as Key, and along with Elise Neal's sharp turn as his high-strung, upwardly mobile wife Yevette, represents the middle-class black lifestyle with observational precision.The three women who play the prostitutes leave vivid impressions - Paula Jai Parker powerfully shows the angry desperation of the aging Lexus; Taryn Manning combines the hick and huckster of Nola, the only one making DJay money; and in the film's most poignant performance, Taraji P. Henson brings heart and painful melancholy to Shug. When she discovers her vocal chops during a recording session or innocently brings in a lava lamp, Henson is heartbreakingly impressive. Ludicrous makes his key moments count as the nihilistic Skinny Black. There are also some predictable plot turns that move the story toward cliché, including a conclusion that teeters on melodrama, but the Brewer's original execution compensates. Above all else, it's Howard who makes the film resonate with a rich, multi-dimensional characterization. As he moves fluently back and forth between scarifying and tender, Howard makes DJay not heroic but real and painfully wanting of a better lot in life.The DVD has several extras - Brewer's insightful commentary on an alternate audio track and three solid featurettes that lend insight to the production - "Behind the Hustle", which includes the cast members talking about their roles and showing their various auditions; "By Any Means Necessary", in which Brewer and producers John Singleton and Stephanie Allain talk about the struggles to get the film made; and "Creatin' Crunk", which showcases the various funk and rap stars called upon to create the memorable songs DJay and the others perform throughout the film. There is also a disposable clip of the Memphis premiere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LAST 20 MINUTES - *****A real SPOILfest*****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS UNTIL END What's the problem? I thought it worked in every way. And it wasn't a Hollywood "happy ending." It was Memphis happy ending, not to be continued. The 4th of July party at Arnel's Bar. Skinny Black's annual homecoming, to keep in touch with his roots (more like to remind him why he never wants to come back). This sets up DJay's last big chance, a tiny doorway to crawl out of his hole. His first attempts to get next to Skinny are met with rejection and insults. Frustrated, he keeps coming back and through his well-honed hustling skills, finally gets the cassette into Skinny's hands. What a negotiator. But Skinny's "Everybody gotta have a dream," is just an empty platitude he uses when accepting one of the thousands of cassettes he's handed. At that point, DJay was too pleased with himself to see that Skinny had no intention of listening to it or remembering where he came from. In the mens room, Terrence Howard pulls off one of the most-gut wrenching performances of a guy's dream being crushed before your eyes. A really shrewed guy would have worked the situation, but he does what a DJay would do, shoots himself in the foot. Crushing a urine-soaked cassette in Skinny's mouth and beating him to a pulp is unlikely to get DJay a meeting. DJay has talent, but look where and how he lives and makes a living? His MO is making bad choices. By the way, he stinks as a pimp. I thought he'd kill Skinny but then he pulls back and expresses not regret but recognition of how he just blew it, and then survival mode kicks in. These guys carry guns but ah, they aren't professionals, and the shootout was stupid and sloppy like real life not like it's usually portrayed. The fact that DJay arrives back home well after the cops and the crowds are there makes it clear that he parked somewhere, thought it through, and said to himself 'I can hustle my way out of this.' He needed Nola at a time when he also sensed she was ready for a different kind of hustle "dressed for success." DJay's criminal notoriety getting him some air time is also no cliché. That's the American way. And Nola's delivering the cassette is the best marketing the music could've had--there are plenty of whores in business. Knowing what a *beep* Skinny was, the Memphis radio guys were probably falling all over themselves to give DJay a chance just for slapping Skinny. What goes around. So what's the problem with the ending? It wasn't a cliché. Cliché would have been.... -they play the tape at the party and everyone goes wild. -Skinny is sincere -DJay's a big success -Let's put on a show... or -Skinny and everybody give it a listen and laugh. -We are invested in the cassette, and we want it work but a total downer ending would have been a complete dream killer for everyone. So that wouldn't work. Dramatically, narratively and cinematically, this ending works. WHAT WOULD ALL YOU GENIUSES HAVE DONE? (I posted in the message board too if you want to take a shot). DJay has his moment but I just can't see his going much further. I'm actually happy for him, that he gets that moment. He'll have to live on it for the rest of his life because, inevitably, he will screw things up again. At the very end, when DJay says "Everybody gotta have a dream" you feel the sting of his rejection sweetened with the irony of his success. Will he listen to the cassette? He's in prison, I guess he will but at least this time and in this moment, he's the man. The last 20 minutes were not absolute perfection, but I thought it was real and can't think of a better way to close the piece. And the first 96 minutes were even better. There was some great acting going on in this movie from everyone. I swear, I really didn't think about this until now, but I just watched a "black" movie without really even thinking about it or judging it that way. Wow. So many movies with predominantly black casts make a white middle-aged woman like me feel like a voyeur. In this one, I was right inside the story. I gave it a 10 and I will watch this again and again. And I think it'll be a 10 10 years from now. I admit my judgment may be effected by the fact that Terrence Howard is one gorgeous man, but he's a babe that can act. Not unlike a young Paul Newman or Al Pacino, both of whom have had long respectable careers with many memorable performances. Great job. P.S. Great music too. Stax rules. Take on the rest but don't even bother debating that point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performance from Howard, great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film about a music industry that hasn't gotten much shine in Hollywood. I mean you had your occasional successes in 8 mile and many failures such as State Property, Get Rich or Die Trying or even Belly to an extent. This film is realistic and not over the top. I liked Howard in the lead as a pimp turned rapper from Memphis. I liked Brewers direction and writing, this is a gritty film that is thought-provoking, emotionally packed and entertaining. Anthony Anderson and Ludicrous both give good performances too and also Taraji henson and Taryn Manning were very good in their roles as the women who were pimped by DJay (Howard). This film is wellwritten, acted and directed. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film. Very powerful. Very entertaining. Great acting performances. Great casting. Great script. Characters you really feel for. One of 2005's best films. It's a great story of a man trying to live his dreams, and get out of the mediocre life he's leading. Very inspiring for all of us who want more than life's given us, and feel we have the potential for more than we've done. If we all took a shot, we'd have far less regrets. I'd rather know for sure, than wonder "what if?". I'm sure a lot of people will say it's ripping off 8 Mile, but I think this film is far superior, and much more believable. I loved this film, despite not liking rap music, so it really transcends audience demographics. It's a film about a would be rapper, but it's not just a film for rap fans. It's a film for anyone with a dream, which really should be everyone...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrence Howard is one of those actors who seemingly can do anything. No matter what the role he intelligently chooses to play he is always phenomenally fine (Crash, Ray, Lackawanna Blues, Their Eyes Were Watching God, Four Brothers, Hart's War, etc etc etc). In HUSTLE &amp; FLOW writer/director Craig Brewer has finally given him a vehicle that allows him more screen time and the opportunity to create a character that burns his image on our memory indelibly.The story of a pimp and drug dealer in Memphis, stuck in the poverty level and rapidly drowning in mid-life crisis, who pulls himself into the stream of his need and dream to be something different, a rapper star, has been told before but never in the gritty realistic atmospheric way this film does. One of the most telling sequences of both writing and acting is the opening scene of the film when Djay (Howard) quietly talks his philosophy to Nola (Taryn Manning), his primary prostitute, simply sitting in the front seat of his car, awaiting johns. Howard makes this soliloquy pungent yet quiet and in the words we hear provide the outline for the story to follow.While Terrence Howard's is towering, the supporting cast is superb also. Anthony Anderson, DJ Qualls, Taraji P. Henson, Paula Jai Parker, Isaac Hayes, and Ludicrous all offer genuine portraits of difficult characters. The smarmy side of Memphis is well captured by cinematographer Amy Vincent. This is a fine film, a bit difficult to watch at times because of the bruises of poverty and the depths to which people must descend at times to survive. But the story is pungent and tough and Terrence Howard is a marvel to watch. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is purely a character driven picture. The acting is very good on all counts. There is frustration, angst, and hope that is palpable. The director wisely cuts out a lot of the gritty details of the hustle and focuses more on the characters as humans trying to survive. It helps to identify with care for the people involved. The story is simple yet focused and involves some growth and learning. Particularly enjoyable was Djay's friendship with the people around his life. The ending was a bit of cop-out though causing me to wonder if the character had actually learned anything about humility. A bit of a letdown. Otherwise it was a good drama worth the watch and rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From all I'd heard about it, I had high expectations of this movie before I watched it, and I was not disappointed. Wow. It was not a good movie, it was a GREAT movie. D-Jay is a Memphis pimp trying to get out of the hustling game. In his heart and mind burns the flow of rhythm and lyrics born out of the gritty streets, where he ekes out a living for himself and his "girls". But he dreams of more, of bringing his verse out, knowing its cathartic nature can be his only hope for escape and freedom from his life of drug dealing and pimping. Hustle &amp; Flow has a rock-solid supporting cast, but Terence Howard needs an Oscar for his portrayal of the rapping pimp, D-Jay. He made it real, he brought D-Jay to life, he gave him his heart, the good, bad, inspiring, self-defeating, overcoming, and redeeming. Maybe Terence Howard isn't "big" enough yet in the Academy circles, but in my mind, if he doesn't deserve an Oscar, no one does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of my favorite movies of this year if not of all time. After I watched it I was hooked on Terrance Howard. The man is the greatest thing to hit Hollywood since plastic surgery! And directors know it, he's been in plenty of movies this year and I have yet to be disappointed. But, back to the movie. This movie brought the Pimpin' life of DJay to you in near perfection. Terrance Howard was great. I loved the songs so much that I went out and bout the Soundtrack and it's just as good as the movie. DJay is in a rut pretty much and decides that the only way to go is up. He meets an old friend from High School(Anthony Anderson) who has become a producer (or whatever you call it in the case of classical music) and sees the opportunity. The song he decides to make for his premiere called "Whoop That Trick" delivered a great scene while being made. Anthony A. says to Terrance H. while the song is originally called "Beat That B****" "We're trying to get Radio play man, no one will play this. It's degrading to women." "Well what you mean man?" "We gotta change the title, it's degrating to women when you call them B*****s" "Well I ain't trying to call no H* no B****. How bout "Stomp that Ho" or "Whoop That Trick." This is my favorite scene!!! This is getting a little long... Bottom Line - MUST SEE!!! It's too late to see it now, but it's coming out on DVD January 10,2006!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The character of Harold played by Claude Phillips was the most on point acting in the movie. Phillips' performance as a street bum who sold D Jay the small keyboard that helped hook the main character to pursue his dream was the strongest and yet, most understated scene in the movie. The interplay between D Jay and Harold was natural and believable. I expect to see Claude Phillips appear in more films in the future.The movie in itself did not meet the hype of the film. Although we saw the inner workings of a particular pimp and his whores relationships, it did not express exactly how most black confident pimps operate in this game. For example, most pimps do not pimp out of their car, like D Jay. That is "chilli pimpin" and "spot pimpin." That mode is reserved for the shaking pimps. D Jay appeared to be more confident of his game and his control of his hoes. Conseqently, pimps who fit that profile, they instruct their lady or ladies on how to act in regards to procuring business and set them out on automatic pilot to ply their trade, with him or her behind the scenes waiting on the money.Although, the acting was good, Terrance Howard and his pregnant ho overstated the Southern dialect in trying to talk Memphis. However, Howard hit a homerun with his rapping. Perhaps, he should consider exploring that talent further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of '05</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the best film I saw in 2005 and I doubt anything this fall will be able to top it. When I first saw the previews, I assumed that it would be another in a string of weak hip-hop films that have been released recently. However, the Sundance buzz and critical acclaim hooked me in and I'm glad because it is a really great film and though the Oscars will probably snub it, it deserves an award for Best Actor (Terrence Howard). Howard's character, DJay, is a Mephis pimp who is struggling to make ends meet after his number one moneymaker, Shug, becomes pregnant and another hoe starts acting up and he has to kick her out of his house, in a particularly violent and disturbing scene. A chance run-in with old schoolmate Key, who has small business recording gospel choirs and legal depositions, encourages him to re-think a career as an emcee. With a little convincing, Key agrees to help DJay and the two set about recording DJay's raps with the help of an enthusiastic white boy (played by DJ Qualls) who has a penchant for making dope crunk beats. The film has been compared to "8 Mile," but it is actually a much different, much better film with more focus on the music and less on the protagonist's personal problems. There are some great lines, including DJay's soliloquy at the start of the film, and some very humorous scenes, especially with Nola, DJay's "snowflake," who steals every scene she is in. And the music is amazing! These beats are as fresh as anything coming out of the Dirty South right now. It is rare to see a film where every character is played perfectly, and this is one of them. If you don't like hip-hop, you might not understand the power that this film has, and if you are bothered by prostitution you might be disgusted by some scenes. But I feel that it goes a long way toward humanizing pimps and prostitutes and does not just portray them as the dirty side of society or as ridiculous caricatures. Also, DJay's hunger to become a rapper is more poignant than Rabbit's and 8 Mile. So if you want a film that will make you laugh, cry and nod your head to some cutting-edge crunk, this is it.</fullReview>

Along the way,if we are lucky we have a dream. Hustlers understand this intuitively. I appreciate artists and craftsmen who grab hold of a dream so vibrant it's alive. Bravo to the community of artists who hustled allowing this movie to flow.This was a film draped in passion and raw vision.

		<fullReview>This movie definitely was not intended for immature audiences. This movie is rate R for a reason. Now that I got my kiddie disclaimer out of the way.This was one of the most interesting movies that have since "Crash". This movie takes you into the harsh side of the world of hip hop. So many people live lives thinking they will make it big. For others the only option they have to survive is to make it big.In this movie hustle and flow you see the struggle the main character, Dee Jay, takes as he sees a way out through music. As a small time pimp and drug dealer he is simply tired of hustling.This movie pulls you into it's world. It's not a world that many I know would ever be involved in, but it was like looking at a documentary of the next big hip hop star. I was amazed. Visually this movie is just astounding. The camera angles and shots chose. The pace of the movie, everything was absolutely perfect.I am predicting Terrence Howard to get nominated for an Oscar because of his strong performance in this movie as well as his supporting role in Crash. The combination of these two great movies should have him with at least one nomination. It's amazing he's in both of my top two movies of 2005.Keep them coming Terrence! He also has an HBO movie that came out this year called Lackawanna Blues it's an interesting movie based off a stage play. If you can find it watch it! Hustle and Flow is one of the most unique movies made this year! Definitely if you are over 18 and can bear through hearing language you don't speak yourself, then go watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hustle and Flow ending not so absurd **SPOILERS**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In response to other's posting I thought I would share my thoughts on the Hustle and Flow movie. I personally liked Anthony Anderson's performance, it was decent and compared to his stereotypical roles of the loud mouth funnyman, it was certainly different and a shock.As for the gunplay in the movie I found that to be realistic and not fluff. It shows that even though DJay has tried to turn his life around legitimately, he cannot completely leave everything behind. He will always have a street mentality first and foremost which includes vengeance paid out in the form of retribution, the only way he knows how. Eleven month jail sentence for attempted murder? Thats not far from reality. Rappers being immortalized for violence and criminal endeavors? That is nothing new--just pick up any hip-hop magazine (XXL, Source) and you can read endless exploits. The scene which struck me as most odd was in the correction center where the two prison guards *happen* to have a mix tape on them right when DJay gets booked. That seemed a little far-fetched, along with his "Everyone needs a dream" cliché line. To me that was the flaw in an otherwise pretty good film.**** While "Hustle" trucks along proficiently enough, even creating some future crunk hits through DJay's flow along the way (with song titles like "Whoop That Trick"), the film's goodwill is obliterated in the final 30 minutes. If the film wasn't teetering enough on the edge of formula for the first two acts, it sinks like a stone into absurdity when tempers flare and guns are drawn for the finale. Brewer had a curious way of mounting a big audience-pleasing urban film experience with "Hustle," but his instincts turn to dust with this closer, which props up DJay as some type of hero when the film wisely never bothered to take sides before. Brewer also sees fit to hand "Hustle" a happy ending, which is preposterous, and taints the entire experience. Even DJay wouldn't swallow that much good fortune coming to him. ---- 6/10</fullReview>

So really are all the actors and actresses.Characters. Rough bunch, to be sure, but all ... especially D Jay ... showed such deep humanity under very difficult circumstances that they were attractive, appealing, likable. I wanted to know what was going to happen to each and every one of them.Story. The plot, combining rags to riches with ghetto life with rap emergence ... was not in the least original, which is fine by me when the story is told with such skill and color and flavor and verve. It's a helluva yarn.The World. The world of the movie is one with which I am myself very unfamiliar. So I sure can't comment on Authenticity. But I can comment on Believability: and this movie has it and then some. A whole world was created and depicted and maintained with a strong, convincing presence that I found very, very deeply moving.Theme. Yes, it has a message. Not all message movies are effective. This one is, at least it is for me. The message is We gotta have dreams, and pursue them as best we can, within the parameters of the world as it really is. I came away from the movie feeling a sense of Hope and Gratitude. What a gift. What a movie.Combine a helluva story with great characterization with superb acting in a compellingly believable world with an uplifting theme ... and you have Hustle and Flow. What a wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrence Howard delivers a great performance as the pimp with the dream. However, I can't compare that performance to that of Jamie Foxx's in "Ray." In other words, it wasn't this mind bending, memorable performance people like to call it. But it was good. Maybe good enough to earn him an Oscar nomination depending on the competition this year in the "Best Actor in a Leading Role" category. He is torn between a charismatic man who wants to inspire the people in his life versus the man who has to be that mean boss that everyone can relate to. He just throws his employees out on the street instead of smiling in their faces, then slapping them with a pink slip a day later.The directing was right on. I felt that the director was able to call great shots without taking away from the story. He was able to also provoke believable, great performances by his actors. I thought the lighting was appropriate for the telling and the editing was good also.The script could've been better. I didn't need to know about his past or what made him turn out to be a pimp (don't confuse me with these nosy, non-imaginative, wannabe film goers that need to know every thing). However, the story starts off slow. It didn't capture me in the first fifteen minutes like a great film usually does. I also didn't see where the crisis decision happened. That's where we really get to know the true character. Also, the argument wasn't clear. I get the whole man and his dream aspect. But I didn't fully understand what the writer/director was trying to say about the dream. Is it like the message of dreams in great stories like "Raisin in the Sun." It would've been that much better if we knew and was able to see a fair and just argument on why dreams do or do not come true.Now, I would like for people who don't understand life, who live in sheltered worlds where reality is on the opposite side of the bridge or those who know of that reality but want to act like it doesn't exist in order to avoid stereotype and to fit in with others, STOP MAKING RIDICULOUS COMMENTS ABOUT MOVIES PERIOD. How can that uptown bill guy compare "Birth of a Nation" to "Hustle &amp; Flow?" I bet all my money, with the lent in my pockets, that Uptownbill didn't even see "Birth of a Nation" in it's entirety. If he did, he would see that "Birth of a Nation" was awful not because it was about the KKK trying to make things look a certain way in their own minds, but it was awful because it wasn't honest. And I saw this film to further my knowledge on what not to do as a storyteller. "Hustle &amp; Flow" on the other hand, well, I know a few pimps and despite popular belief, they do pump blood through their veins and they do have hearts. And yes, they can be manipulative and brutal to women as well. But that's just their harsh reality.And Terrence Howard's character was able to capture all that reality. So, I'm sorry to wet on uptown bill's parade but the film doesn't even come close to "Birth of a Dishonest." Then the guy compares John Singleton to D.W. Griffith? Is he crazy? No comparison. "I understand Mr. Singleton. From Boyz N'the Hood to Baby Boy, you're looking for the truth that exists in the human community (not the black or white but human). You're not compromising that, pulling the wool over our eyes to the reality that exists in the world. Don't pay any mind to people comparing you to D.W. Griffith."One Caucasian woman is afraid that the film is going to bring heat to her biracial son when he goes back to school, predicting that white kids will be ridiculing him about the whole "pimp" thing. My advise lady: send him to karate class. If someone is that ignorant to ask him questions about pimps after seeing Hustle &amp; Flow, a biracial kid who clearly doesn't live anywhere near the ghetto (she's a doctor, black father is a college professor), then it's just a sad reality of where the next generation's minds are at. Wow, we have to look forward to a lot in the future. Can't wait (thumbs up with a cheesy smile).Then one person said "One of the worst films of the year." Actually, in my humble opinion, "Crash" was worse than Hustle &amp; Flow. The Wedding Crashers wasn't much better either. And if you really want to see a poorly executed film that serves no purpose other than to glamorize white men taking black woman, then just wait for "Constellation," starring Billy Dee Williams (at his worse) and Zoe whats-her-name. The same people that say Hustle is the worst of the year are the same people that have "Diary of a Mad Black Woman" and "Are We There Yet?" in their DVD collection, and they have "The Honeymooners" on hold for them when it comes out.Bottom line, Hustle &amp; Flow isn't that bad and it's not that good. And don't worry about stereotyping. Hollywood and these poor excuses for filmmakers of color, that in their zeal to convince us all that all people of color are successful people in medicine and other respected fields, executing these ideas with "on the nose" laments about finding or not finding love in their own communities, they can continue making these films and most white people will still come to their own conclusion about who people of color are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrence Howard is Absolutey Mesmerizing, Intense, and Engaging!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hustle and Flow will keep your attention from beginning to end. All of the characters, especially "DJay" portrayed by Terrence Howard is sensational. Djay is a Memphis pimp who rediscovers his dream of being a rapper. With help from his childhood friend, Key, played brilliantly by Anthony Anderson, he embarks on his mission to get his rap music on the radio airwaves. With a wonderful supporting cast, which includes Taraji P. Henson (best known for her portrayal of Yvette in "Baby Boy"), Elise Neal (from the television series "The Hughleys"), Paula Jai Parker, Taryn Manning, Chris 'Ludacris" Bridges, and DJ Qualls, those who dislike Hip Hop will find themselves silently cheering DJay on. The year 2005 will be remembered in the acting community as Terrence Howard's Year. This intense, underrated actor is finally getting his long, overdue share of the spotlight. Terrence Howard who resides in Philadelphia, uses his seasoned acting skills to mix Philadelphia Soul with Memphis Sound to create a Hollywood Hit. After seeing "Hustle and Flow," be sure to see him in "The Four Brothers," "Crash," "Their Eyes Were Watching God" and "Lackawanna Blues."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was shocked to see Caucasian elderly's in there &amp; people you never think would be interested. We had to check to see if we were in the right show! &amp; I live in Oakland, Cali. They loved it! &amp; the movie has us rolling! I cried on several scenes being it was so real &amp; I was feeling it all over again. Thanks Singleton for giving the world a better perspective into the struggle &amp; also helping them to realize what some of these rappers go thru when starting from rock bottom. For those of you who never lived an oppressed life only to rise up out, these actors played their roles to the tee &amp; the cast was well chosen, especially the white girl who reminded me of my ex neighbor's lily skinny stable sister whose now a social worker. No doubt the ending will motivate many, mainly our youths in disadvantaged communities. And the music was bumping! Loved it all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Because we're mankind..........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.......We're all entitled to our opinions and points of view, mostly based upon our idiosyncrasies, prejudices, beliefs, and our experiences.Hustle and Flow was an excellent feel good movie about change, love, faith, perseverance, facing and tackling one's fears to make dreams reality.Albeit told, excellently mind you, from one of the grimiest of life's many stories (and there are grimier out there) and for those of us that have come from (or still live in) the inner city, none of this is cliché' but simply art imitating life on a level that we can identify with more than others.This is our culture.However, as far as I'm concerned my opening comments make it clear that you don't have to be a pimp, ho', black, rocked a mic on stage, studio, or dreamt of doing it, live in the ghetto or like hip hop/rap/crunk music to identify with this movie.All you'll have needed was to have been in love, been hated on, done things you hated and you'd like to be forgiven for, attended church, dreamed of becoming a lawyer/doctor (Mrs.Taylor) or any other profession and had to overcome "REAL" hardships and make sacrifices to get there, forgotten where you came from, decided to throw caution to the wind and say "Something's got to change in my life" and start changing it, or simply had to get your hustle on to put food on the table or make that change in your life possible to identify with this movie. The entire ensemble put in exceptional work, making each and every character real. You have to give Terrance Howard his props on this one, but as I look at each actor's performance and try to grade them, they all come up with high marks. I especially dug "Key" Anthony Anderson's character as he's usually cast as buffoonish comic relief. It was refreshing to see him in a serious role and his character was extremely down to earth, identifiable and likable.Taraji P. Henson (Shug) subtly stole every scene she was in, most times with just her facial expressions which conveyed so much about her and Terrance's (D-Jay's) characters.This wasn't just a story about a pimp/drug dealer trying to make it big in rap....it's the human story.I haven't experienced a more satisfying and triumphant movie ending since Shawshank Redemption.Hustle and Flow's ending ranks right up there.I have to give a shout out to the comment posted by nitejrny282.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay I went to see this movie and had the hardest time finding the movie theaters! I'm from Indianapolis and think that I know the city pretty well cause I've lived here my whole life, but I couldn't even find the theaters on my side of town! Then when I finally found the dang on place everybody in there made a comment about how they never even knew there was a movie theaters at that location! What does that say! Why did they play this wonderful movie in the butt-crack of nowhere! I thought that after a week of being out and seeing how well the movie was doing the other more popular theaters in Indianapolis would acquire the movie. NOPE! Flippin idiots! Then not three days after the movie came out I was at someones house and what did I see, the bootleg! This was not those crappy bootlegs either it was one that said "Propety of paramount pictures" across the bottom! I asked when this person got the movie and how much it cost. He got it the day it opened for $10 and had been showing it at his house all weekend! I was like go to the theaters support the movie and he said it costs too much! Flippin idiots! With all that said this movie was great! I loved it and I've gone to see it twice! I felt this was not just about rapping this is about everything. For someone who as seen life go drastically wrong like myself this movie will strike a cord. I don't want to be a rapper like DJay, but like DJay I want to be something greater than what I've become. For all who feel that way you will love this movie. This movie is not about pimps and their Ho's it's about seeing that even if you've been doing something for a long time and you're used to it, doesn't mean you are stuck for life. Change is good. DJays opportunity knocked and he answered, if it happened for a pimp then it could happen for that guy at McDonalds too. You know what I mean?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hustle and Flow- doesn't glamorize, only realizes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this film today and I have to say I was intrigued and drawn into the film. Howard's portrayal of a drug-dealer/pimp in a mid life crisis is pure and true. This movie is about a man who has made the wrong decisions and wants to make right. Right in whatever it takes. RIght in the only way he knows how. It's not here to glamorize the lifestyle of a pimp. It's not here to say drug dealing is OK. It's here to show that people make bad decisions and you can change. None of the images or lifestyle make the life of a Memphis Pimp enviable or desirable. Come on, if you say this, did you actually see the movie?? In fact, a God loving Black man with a wife, a respectable paying job, whom D-Jay respects and listens to, is the character of hope.The character's feel real, real in a way of the area they live in. You get drawn into them, believe them. This movie is not a poster child for anti-drugs, it's not a poster child for blacks who live in a crime free environment, it's a poster child for people living in hard times and hard ways. To find your faults and try to change. The imagery alone was to the respect of the film. Grainy and raw, no special effects here, no glossy imagery. Blown out stylization is nil, this is not a music video. Come'on the guy drives a beat up Cutty with a bad paint job. As for people saying the ending is anti-climatic. Well what did you want??? A high speed car chase lasting 15 minutes, a no-holds bar shootout with explosions and draining bullet shells??? NO, the only thing this film gives IS a sense of hope. A hope for people who have gone down the bad road and can take these roads "less" traveled and use them to help themselves and the people around them. Life isn't easy folks and just because this film shows the hard side of life, doesn't mean it glamorizes it. Hollywood didn't want to make it, because no Black men die. Sure there's confrontation, sure there's strife and sure there's street activity, but to go and say that this is negative is to forget that fact that most blacks live in this. Live in this environment. just like D-Jay's lyrics say " this may be new to you, but I've lived with it for years."Kudos and respect, I give it a "10" just for staying real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With apologies to Michael Moore, one can be a "stupid white man" and still like this movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To quote from the Cramps' anthemic cover of the 1950's hit "Rocket in my Pocket": "Well I don't know about art but I know what I like?." I sure don't know much about Rap/Hip-Hop/Krump/Crunk/whatever, but I know a nice little well-told story when I see one. I'll admit "Hustle &amp; Flow" had not exactly been high on my must-see list but this past Saturday I really wanted to go to a movie; since I don't live in New York or Chicago or Los Angeles, what was available was stuff I'd either seen or didn't care to see?. Then I thought "Well hell, let's give this a shot." Proved to be a good decision on my part.We're introduced to a somewhat unassuming-looking black guy in his mid-to-late-30's sitting in his vintage car smoking a cigarette as he lays out some down-home philosophy (which gets tellingly repeated near the end) to an unseen character who then is revealed as a young strung-out-looking white chick. If we hadn't known in advance, we needn't have been Einstein to grasp that she's a prostitute and he's her pimp. Eventually a customer pulls up; when the pimp's initial sales pitch fails to sink in, he exasperatedly tells his "ho" to (paraphrasing somewhat) "explain to this gentleman how this situation should proceed." She gets into the john's car and off they go as the pimp sits and watches and smokes. I don't know how the pimp knows that the client is not some psycho who wants to murder his employee. I suppose one develops a "sixth sense" for that sort of thing.The pimp is played by Terrence Howard, about whose performance even haters of the move have been raving. I kept wondering where the heck I'd seen this guy before---turned out he'd been in "Crash" which I'd seen relatively recently, as a completely different kind of character. As the pimp he's rock solid, never hits a wrong note, a guy born on the wrong side of the wrong tracks suffering from being just intelligent enough to know what a waste his life has been thus far. He sucks on those cigarettes like an oxygen tube. He's followed the "path of least resistance" to become a pimp, has three in his "stable" under his roof; one of them has an infant son, plus another one is pregnant; it's all he can do to keep them all and himself more or less functioning. I doubt I've ever seen a pimp portrayed this realistically in a movie before. I've known plenty of managers in "legitimate" jobs who didn't remotely have the level of "people skills" needed here.He takes possession of a Casio mini-keyboard which in the movie's best scene he uses to pacify the squalling son of one of his hookers. This gets him thinking about a music career like that of one "Skinny Black," a Memphis "homeboy" he may or may not have known once. He enlists the help of a childhood chum to concoct a recording studio in his home with egg crates stapled to the walls for sound-proofing; they have to turn the fan off to record and (in the second best scene) the pimp has to go placate his hostile neighbor (using marijuana, apparently the universal medium of exchange) whose music is seeping into their recording session. There's a nice atmosphere in all this of "real" people giving it their all to break into a tough business, hinting back to those "Let's put on a show in the barn!" epics from the 1930's. I couldn't begin to say if the music they eventually record is "good" or "bad" by the standards of that genre, but they sure put a lot of heart into it. The bashful stammering pregnant woman who gets dragooned into being a backup singer and who blossoms with each "take" is an absolute joy to watch. She alone was enough to make me believe this really was the South.Unfortunately it gets a little formulaic towards the end with the requisite violence which we know in advance won't lead to death because at that point too much time has been invested for such a drastic departure. The "somewhat happy" ending seems just a little contrived. But it's all played with absolute conviction &amp; I for one was perfectly happy to "buy into" it. Not since my 1990's favorites "Smoke Signals" and "Ulee's Gold" has a movie made such an appealingly "human" impression on me. It may be the first movie this year since "Kung Fu Hustle" that I see twice.Towards the end the pimp tells his friend that if the new baby of a prostitute and an unknown john ever asks him if she could be President, "I'll look her in the eye and lie to her?.'cause sometimes that's what you gotta do." Damn, that was poignant. Some day, I reckon, there'll be a black President, and a female President, maybe even both at once; it'd be kinda cool if I could live to see that?.The part of the church-going somewhat-happily-married sound engineer must have been a cakewalk for Anthony Anderson after his turn as the demonic drug lord on the best cop show on TV, i.e. "The Shield." This guy has a genuinely approachable "everyman" quality; I predict he'll have the next long-running "mainstream" sitcom after that of Bill Cosby and Will Smith.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard that they are positioning Terence Howard for an Oscar. But the real movement already began when the H&amp;F soundtrack was sold out in Los Angeles with major and mom/pop retailers and I had to find it in Hollywood. The soundtrack is so dope (yeah, I said dope) that any new appearances by Terence Howard for movie promotion should be restricted to musical performances by D-Jay doing live performances(where appropriate). I'm excited about the buzz in the streets on H&amp;F--the movie, and soundtrack. It's phenomenal that Howard has pulled it off so well that people are paying more attention to D-Jay, and "Whup Dat TricK", than actually seeing the movie--although the tracks are a hit, you cant get the full scope and feeling without seeing the movie first. I'm officially casting my nomination and vote for D-Jay as best new hip-hop artist. 'Yeah, Mane!!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breakout role for Howard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often an actor will kick around Hollywood without getting the awards or accolades and be one of those recognizable faces that pop up in films (Robert Duvall, Paul Giamatti) but every once in a while things can change in just one year with just the right role and performance that opens everyone's eyes. Story is about DJay (Terrence Howard) who's a smalltime Memphis dealer and pimp but hates what he's doing and dreams of doing something else in life and one day gets the idea of becoming a rap artist. Djay runs into an old friend named Key (Anthony Anderson) and learns that he's a sound engineer which gives him the idea of asking for his help to make a demo tape so that he can give a copy to a rapper named Skinny Black (Ludacris) whom DJay knew years earlier.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Nola (Taryn Manning) is DJay's cash cow but she also hates what she's doing but he still needs her to use her services in order to make money to finance the recording of his tape. While DJay writes the lyrics for his songs Key has his friend Shelby (DJ Qualls) help mix the music and they also enlist the help of DJay's pregnant girlfriend Shug (Taraji P. Henson) who is used for backup vocalization. Once the demo tape is finished DJay heads to a local bar (run by Isaac Hayes) where Skinny Black is having a party but after handing him his tape things go horribly wrong and DJay ends up in the custody of the police.This is only the second feature for writer/director Craig Brewer and immediately his script sucks the audience in with the very first shot of DJay talking to Nola about his thoughts of not only about being a man but one's opportunities in life. Howard's performance is revolutionary and with his James Brown-like hair his character DJay is shown as a man who clearly knows that he can't be a pimp forever and Howard perfectly channels this man's desperation and focus in trying to change his life. Howard has been a respected character actor for over 10 years and his face had become pretty familiar for audiences but this is the year that should not only change his career but also the way others will look at him in terms of his talent. Earlier this year Howard gave another solid performance in "Crash" and 2005 seems to be his breakout year and will hopefully lead him to being a leading man in other interesting films because he's one of those actor's that has paid his dues to get to this spot. This film also boasts some good supporting roles with Manning and Henson standing out as the women in DJay's life and it's time for some filmmaker to give Manning a bigger and well written part. I found her character a tad under written but she does have one strong scene where she admits how much she hates prostituting herself and one can't help but think her character deserved more to do. While I can't say that this film is truly realistic (although it's more relevant than the Eminem myth "8 Mile") it still captures the look of the seedy side of Memphis perfectly and shows DJay for all of his flaws like taking his whores money and throwing out one of his girlfriends (with his own child!) into the street. This is one of those low budget films that not only gives a young director the opportunity to show he's a filmmaker to watch but it also gives an actor like Howard (who for years has been under-appreciated) the role of a lifetime and show that he's ready to establish himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At Last, Some Honesty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I ask a movie like this to be is honest. If you're not going to give me romance and white dresses and beautiful vistas, then be honest. But if you're going to be honest, don't be cynical. Hustle &amp; Flow is wonderful. It will never be a Hollywood movie. But the grit, the sweat, the hurt, the grimness of poverty, the hope and yes, love - it's all there. I didn't see one phony face, hear one phony line. Like his first movie, The Poor &amp; Hungry, Craig Brewer has an intelligent eye that I haven't seen matched by anyone except perhaps Satyajit Ray, for the poetry of poverty and small lives. Brewer doesn't romanticize it, doesn't condemn it, doesn't celebrate it (that would be a Hollywood movie). He just sees it, and somehow, miraculously, let's us see it. Then he takes us beyond our preconceptions and judgments into the hearts of the people he portrays. I can't call them characters because they're too real. Terrance Howard is superb; so many people have already lauded his performance that I won't say anymore about that here. So is the rest of the cast - Sug, Nola, Key. I can't say enough good things about this movie. So, turn off your TV and walk yourself to Hustle &amp; Flow where the good stuff is. Even if you detest crunk / rap / hip-hop, go see it. Even if you don't want to know about 'niggas and hoas' go see it. If you value honest movies, you won't be sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If like me you hate overly formulaic films, films that you have seen over and over again with different titles then Hustle and Flow will be a real treat. The movie focuses on what makes a movie great, the acting and the script. Everything else is an extra.The movie shows that the reality of life is that a lot of people end up living lives that were not their dreams or not even lives that they would have chosen but instead lives they just fell into. Nevertheless, you live that life the best you can while still holding on to that dream. Often that dream is simply nothing more than there has to be something better or something more.</fullReview>

This is not that boring ass 8 mile crap,and if your afraid of hearing the "N" word then just don't go to see this movie. This story is painfully easy to relate to because it's about struggling to achieve a blurred dream and convincing yourself that "it ain't over for you" as one of the songs say.Most people can relate to this unless they've already given up.The casting has a natural racial mix that really really felt good. Too bad Spielberg and Scorsese can't cast like this. The raps were hard and good ...they were actually a member of the cast and a real pleasure.Whether you like rap or not you'll enjoy the honesty of it. Terrence owned this role while not over acting it,like so many actors do lately.I'll buy this soundtrack even though I'll have to use earphones on it because it's pretty raw.</fullReview>

Paula Jai Parker, is no stranger to playing a street hooker, as she played in the movie PHONE BOOTH, she was very convincing. I just hope she does not get "locked", into these type of roles. It could be damaging to her career!

		<fullReview>Is Hustle and Flow about dreams? Most definitely. Does the film tell us that dreams can come true no matter what? No, it doesn't but what it does get across is the message that you should try to achieve them, no matter what happens or what situation you're in. This is the kind of lecture Hustle and Flow gets across in an engaging and realistic manner thanks to the final few scenes which border on tragedy at its very best when a certain someone who a certain someone else looks up to dismisses the dream in an instant after so much work. For a film to focus on someone whom most would consider part of the dregs of society; have them go through so much, but not in the way of neatly plotted narrative, and then to have the bubble threaten to burst is a brave move because it could so easily be misread as a message that no matter what, you will fail. But right nearer the end, the film bails itself out by having its protagonist placed in a position of power from which others will look up to him in the same manner he once looked up to others. This is a brave film that introduces Djay (Howard) as someone you wouldn't give five minutes of your time to before taking him on this journey and then having the audacity to hammer home the wrong ideation. Djay is an African-American living in Memphis but he represents any living being who feels as if they're stuck in a rut without having found their 'form' or their calling. Like most African-Americans in Hollywood films, he is a pimp with few redeeming qualities. But the surprise here is the manner in which Hustle and Flow grabs this protagonist after a relatively low-key; urban cause and effect fuelled opening and has them suffer an epiphany so early on with two incidences opening his mind: that being the acquiring of an old electronic keyboard and the chance encounter with Key (Anderson), an old school buddy.The fact Djay specifically mentions his childhood when toying with the mock keyboard is one thing but the further emphasis on Key's character as a friend from school and the fact he is now in the music producing industry are two things that I feel call Djay into the world of music ? they push him over the line if he was not already on the brink, albeit he perhaps did not know he was. The film at its core is about how one man can venture outside of the boundaries he knows like the back of his hand. Djay is a pimp and while he is not happy in that role, it is a role he seems accustomed to. His trading and dealing within his profession sees him sit in a car and talk every so often to customers perhaps interested in the girl he sits beside ? it is simplistic and Djay is in a groove but the film follows a 'promotion' of sorts when he is elevated into the world of music. But the film covers the dangers of venturing outside this groove if anything else and the study is quite brilliant.It is not only Djay that the film touches on when it comes to characters being out of the boundaries of comfort. The film tells us the basic message that in order to achieve, do not keep yourself in the passage you're currently in and this counts for Djay but Key's scenario of already having a seemingly 'perfect' life is equally interesting. As a character, Key has elevated himself above Djay's prior position and has a nice house compared to Djay's dwelling; a loyal wife whom we elevate above Djay's girls thanks to the scene in her living room in which they sit in opposing positions, the simplest of compliments breaking out into an argument between Djay's two representatives and he also has a living in the music business which we put in stark contrast to Djay as a pimp. As the friendship rekindled wears on, Key will be tested in his patience and so will his relationship with his wife who is most concerned about the time he spends at the house with so many of the loose women she has recently had prior contact with. But as the film develops through its musically driven narrative complete with Oscar winning 'It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp' which in itself is about the rut and prior groove Djay found himself in, it becomes apparent that the hero of the hour is eyeing up a bigger prize and that is a rendez-vous with now legendary rapper Skinny Black (Ludacris). For the final third to be so involved and so decisive with the climax of this dream is quite extraordinary. The feeling of all or nothing is really put across in an impressive manner during this particular passage and the 'certain failure' which partly comes with this sort of story is somewhat harrowing in the sense that not only does it seem Djay might fail but the film may seem as if it will put across the wrong message completely. But the film is not that nasty and isn't about to undo all its hard work. A grittier and more hard hitting ending might well have worked against the film more than anything but for what it is, Hustle and Flow is an interesting and satisfying film which will give a sense of feeling and one of brooding atmosphere as it steers its way towards a dramatic climax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect to like this film, but I've recently seen Terrence Howard in Idlewild and Craig Brewer's wonderful Black Snake Moan, so when my wife suggested we try it, I agreed. I was knocked out by Terrence Howard's performance. I've wondered what I'll say if someone asks me "What's that movie about?" On the surface it's the story of a pimp who wants to be a rapper. What it's really about is human aspiration, the hopes and dreams which keep us alive. It's about caring for the people around you. It's about perseverance in the face what look like insurmountable obstacles. It's about real people.I'm a 60-year-old white guy, and even the rhythm of rap usually makes me want to run from the room and plug my ears. Having now, through this film, shared DJay's creative process, I can now appreciate the message and emotion behind it. I still don't like the medium in which the message is sent, but I'm no longer instantly repelled by it. I've found myself humming "It's hard out here for a pimp," which is so ironic that I just laugh when I find myself doing it. I didn't watch last year's Academy Awards, and was not aware that Terrence Howard had been nominated for his performance in this film. I was delighted to learn that he had been, as performances in low-budget films seem often to be overlooked. This an excellent, if disturbing, film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best film of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 30 minutes into Hustle and Flow, not only did I think Terrence Howard had already earned his Oscar nomination, but had already won it. In DJay, he creates a very deep and layered character capable of brutal violence and unexpected moments of compassion at times. But mostly, he's just a real guy caught up in unreal businesses pursuing a dream.While Howard absolutely owns this film, the film is made great by the supporting cast that surrounds DJay, especially the women. In what is a very weak field of Supporting Actresses, both Taryn Manning (Nola) and Taraji Henson (Shug) would have been very worthy nominees this year. It is through these women (and the performances of the actresses) that we are able to see the gentler side of DJay. The moment where Shug tells DJay how much singing on the demo tape meant to her was one of the films best moments. As was the exchange between DJay and Nola as he's being arrested. Another great sequence happens when Key's wife Yevette (Elise Neal) gives up trying to fight her husbands dream and instead brings over the sandwiches. Every character in this film is deep and makes you care about them.I thought that, towards the end of the third act, when things take a turn for the worse between DJay and Skinny Black, that the film briefly spiraled out of control and got a little away from itself. Thankfully, it reeled itself back in pretty quickly once DJay was in prison. Maybe the three minutes or so of brutal violence and gunshots could have been replaced with a different way of DJay being incarcerated.Terrence Howard hooked me from the beginning and his performance didn't let me go until it was over. I was very much on the edge of my seat the whole time in a film that doesn't have much edge of your seat action. Hustle and Flow is frequently funny, dramatic, moving, shocking and sometimes all of them. And it's moral is that it's OK to have a dream and pursue it. And it doesn't do it in a hokey way. Unforgettable and possibly the best film of 2005.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie OK, problem with nomination...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK ? I know this movie wasn't made for old white guys like me. I rented it because Terrence Howard was nominated for best actor, and I was curious. So the fact that I don't think rap is an art form, don't think it's music, don't think it's worthy of the money it generates is irrelevant. I find the whole rapper, guns, ho's, violence, ghetto deal ? with the strutting, macho posturing that accompanies it to be very irritating. And while I understand the money they have (and I don't) is a big factor to this dislike, hopefully I'm not too obvious about it? But as to the film, Terrence does a fine job of playing a ghetto black ? he was very believable as some no-hoper hustler. And my equally old wife and I watched the whole movie and found it entertaining, funny at times, and were very appreciative that it wasn't as profane and violent as it could have been. So the movie is not the issue, although I couldn't refrain from commenting on rap above.But I do not understand the acting 'stretch' I keep hearing regarding the lead actor; and why this justifies his nomination in this somewhat above average film. He's an actor, and judging from his role in 'Crash', he can play other roles as well. But that's just it ? I don't think for a black actor, that playing upper class, and then playing ghetto is all that tough of a stretch. Oprah does it whenever she wants to make a point, Denzel does it at a drop of a hat; Richard Pryor was another example; heck, I bet you could even throw in Bill Cosby. Black entertainers do this easily (and hopefully this doesn't qualify as insensitive stereotyping). Hell, almost all the rappers who go on to acting roles CAN act between these extremes. Now, some might say 'why should you penalize this talent (or even minimize it) by not recognizing it at award time? You wouldn't talk about ignoring or penalizing Bobby Bonds just because he makes it look easy would you?'. And I don't have an answer for that one ? it's a good point.Possibly this performance being nominated is not all that bad a deal anyway. It's just that maybe it took a nomination away from a Morgan Freeman, or heck even a Jeff Daniels. Besides, I'm still carrying a grudge that Guy Pearce wasn't nominated for 'Memento'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought Provoking Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was great. I came away thinking about all people who have a dream...no matter what. Although I am not a huge fan of rap I can see it's value. Some of the lyrics in the songs are much better than the stuff that some popular rock songs are made of. (I didn't really think these lyrics were very inspiring but I did like the beat) Think of all of the kids that want to grow up to be a rock star? I think it's great that your 15 year old has the opportunity to teach other kids, who are either yanking his chain or are quite possibly ignorant, not to believe what they see in movies. It would be great if he felt confident enough to help them be critical thinkers and to lose the tendency to generalize. I think it would be great if you could talk this through with your son and have it be a learning experience.</fullReview>

Great performances from Terence Howard ( who was also great in last years's Crash) &amp; from Taryn Manning &amp; Taraj P Henson (who was also great in 2001's Baby Boy). Everyone else was really good as well but these 3 made the film.And,when the Academy Award Nominations are announced,it'll be a damn shame if Terence Howard is left out for his wonderful role, as the first time ever in a movie a pimp,is portrayed as a decent human-being,when really he's not! And,it will be a so sorry day if MS. Henson is denied a Best Supporting Actress Nom at least, if not a win, as the character of Shug is a very powerful role. Great movie about people who are on the lower tiers of society today. Great rapping &amp; great screenplay.Terence Howard will be the next Denzel Washington! **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sums up the M town music scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a filmmaker from Memphis living in NY, I picked up a lot of small things that neither the audience or my film-making circle understood. The hand held rough, blues-y, new south is new to a lot of people. They have been exposed to the commercialized view of the new south and not what it has and will always be to many people from that region. I enjoyed Howard's performance in the fact that there are a lot of people "coming- of-age" in Memphis and there is a lot of stories to tell of the new struggles and glass ceilings that remain. my work reflects my hometown and is something that the south does to an artist: it creeps into your work with conviction. The best scene of this is the scene where Terrence and Nola are in the church. Even though he is a pimp he still goes to church!!! Now many may think this is contradictory, but in the south, everyone's profession is rooted in the church. The scene where he describes his midlife crisis and tries to restrain his fear is something that is programed in the south for us...to be hard on women, and maintain a sense of control of everything around you....Craig Brewer does this very well with his characters. If you notice, ALL the female characters in the film are submissive to some male character or another...another staple of the south. But also, the idea goes the same universally-men are even harder on each other as we saw in the skinny black and DJ 3rd act climax....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Pulitzer -Worthy Beginning to Pat Ending - SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The performances were all (except that of Ludicrous, which was just OK) outstanding. I thought the first third of the movie was so spectacular that I said aloud to myself, "Forget Oscar, this should win a Pulitzer!" But right after I thought that, the movie changed. The movie went from layered and rich poetry to pat Hollywood formula. At the moment when the pimp made his #1 girl kiss the microphone, it all came crashing back to Earth for me.The microphone as penis metaphor was so obvious and on the nose it made me mad. Making her kiss the microphone is no different from making her suck a d$#k. I'm sure that analogy is what the writer/director intended; but nonetheless, in either case the hooker has little power. Isn't she supposed to be on an upward trajectory of self-empowerment? Didn't she just participate in that "I'm in charge" scene? Rather than oblige and actually kiss the mic, she should have sung into it or spoken into it or somehow changed what he asked her to do so that she preserved even an inkling of personal power.After that scene, the movie continued to be typical and, I dare say, more and more sexist. The male protagonist becomes increasingly nice and "gives" his women more and more power. The women don't claim it for themselves, they have to wait for it to be delivered. OK, fine so he's an ogre with a heart, but then what? Then the "hero" gets ridiculous. He becomes cartoon-angry over the tape in the toilet. Hasn't his character grown to be smarter and more proud than that? Surely his character would know that if Skinny didn't like it someone else would. Cut your losses and move on.The whole ending sequence made the hero small and ignorant. He wasn't small and ignorant in the beginning, he was just a victim of circumstance embarking on a journey to self-empowerment. His actions at the end were regressive, not progressive. They were the actions of an idiot, not a hero. Sure, we can empathize and understand that he is angry and feels betrayed and that he had all his hopes on that one tape and with that one guy; but any reasonable person, let alone a hero on an upward spiral, would know to not overreact so hugely.Anyhoo, despite those aspects that I found irritating, it was still a rich and interesting cinematic experience with unbelievable performances, especially from the pimp and his blond "primary investor."</fullReview>

I believe she appears in almost every movie ever made. Of course in H&amp;F, there is a twist, which is that she is counterbalanced by the "pimp with a heart of gold". I like this twist. I give the movie 10 stars for being the first, I know of, to use this character. The other thing that made this movie good was the acting. Also the costuming and set design. The music also was very good. I'm only adding this blather because the algo says I have to. I guess there's no prize for brevity in criticism any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good version of a clichéd story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Small time pimp and drug dealer decides to screw on his courage and make a big push to become a rap star. Basically a very traditional, even corny story, tricked out in urban gear: but scrape away the pimps and hos and you're not all that far removed from something Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland might do. The performances help push the material past the clunky spots: I agree with all of the plaudits for Mr. Howard, in particular. He's a charismatic actor and he makes you feel the pain and frustration of his character's life. He helps bring life to the cliché. Movie staggers a bit in making Howard's character unusually kind and charming for a pimp and drug dealer, and structurally it's adherence to formula means it'll never go beyond a certain level. But for what it is, it's quite good, with some real nice stretches of dialog and some fine acting up and down the line. Recommended to those who like this kind of story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dislikes: 1. We never see the Pimp sell any weed, yet he gives this wad of money to his supplier. His women don't pull down that much that's why he's poor, so there is a gap in the logic since he's such an unsuccessful Pimp. I think this could have been treated better by the writer or director. 2. In real life, Pimps beat there woman and not hard core rap stars. So this was fairytale like. This character could well have been a working stiff with more than one woman and then the love/hate relationship with his women would have worked. I suppose the character had to be Pimp for Hollywood to bite. 3. Inconsistency of camera work and cinematography. I think the grainy poor quality could have worked in this film IF it had been consistent. I think it would have given it almost a "period piece" mood. As it was it comes across somewhat annoying.Likes: 1. Excellent performances by the ENTIRE cast! 2. Overall directing 3. Excellent casting 4. Exposing the poverty and living conditions to such an extent 5. Except for the weed issue, the level of detail to the people and environment. Even the powder on Suggs chest on that hot day.

		<fullReview>Decent film that accurately captures how the less than wealthy Memphians scramble, and plot to survive. Of course, most hustlers here think they can rap and most of them can't. I thought Djay was a pretty "nice guy" pimp and his women looked pretty good compared to most of the street hookers around here. Nice knock against folks in this town who make it and then forget where they are from. The store, the neighborhood, and the bar are all for real have a familiar look. The people who populate the film are also pretty realistic. My only beef was that you pretty much knew how it was going to play but at least Craig Brewer is trying to do the 70's tribute without the Tarentino vibe. I loved the beat up car with the nice rims you see that here all the time and yeah that white trash low rent look is all in here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess the old saying "Every dog has its day" is true but also perhaps no more in a way than it can be applied to Southern hustlers and pimps. "Hustle &amp; Flow," written and directed by Craig Brewer, is a movie about that one shot. It's about how everybody's got a dream, and they only get one chance to grasp it and hold on to it.From the outset, this could have been a laughable, if not completely stereotypical "gangsta hustla" flick about aimless Memphis layabouts who attempt to brighten their dim outlook on life through hip-hop. In all respects, from the advertisements on television, that's what it appears to be but when you actually see the movie in action, a whole new dimension is revealed."Hustle &amp; Flow" flows through its story the same way most "dream" movies do but somewhere in there, we get a genuine feel for the characters and their motivations, and an especially profound performance from lead actor Terrence Dashon Howard as DJay, a Southern hustler who suddenly finds himself writing rhymes almost every minute of the day.As I write this, I'm still humming the words in my head ("Whoop that trick! Whoop that trick!"). Of course with those words, come sounds and with the sounds come images, powerful ones. The makings of a truly good rap song, in my view, originate in deep meaningful words that are written from the heart, and that's how DJay's lyrics flow. (I'm aware his lyrics are hardly inspiring, but you get the idea.)As the Southern hustler/pimp in a mid-life crisis, the mode is turned on for DJay when a junkie sells him one of those old Casio electronic keyboards. He toys around with it for a little bit, as he remembers that he had one himself when he was little boy but soon a light switches on, and DJay is tossing around lyrics like a football.He presents his ideas to an old high school buddy, Clyde a.k.a. "Key" (Anthony Anderson, in a nice turn-around role from his usual comedic antics), who currently records demos for his church. When DJay first pitches his plan to him, Key is discreet, "A lot of people talk the talk, but don't walk the walk," as he at first believes he's not serious. Key's wife Yevette (Elise Neal) isn't especially happy by this sudden turn of events for her husband but he's profoundly touched, as is DJay, by the sound, and the two are quickly chanting "Whoop that trick!" like it's the Gospels, but Yevette is at least supportive enough to remind them that even they have to eat dinner.Meanwhile, DJay must also contend with the worrisome troubles of his current reality, from live-in stripper Lexus (Paula Jai Parker) and her baby son, both of whom he eventually throws out of the house, to his pregnant ('ho, or main girlfriend? I'm not sure) Shug (Taraji P. Henson), who eventually sings the chorus of his demo, and Nola (Taryn Manning), who also aspires to do something else with her life. Together, with Clyde and white boy disc jockey Shelby (DJ Qualls), everybody, in a fashion much like a family, begin recording demos left and right with a makeshift studio in DJay's house."Hustle &amp; Flow" is pleasantly surprising in a way that a lot of black-themed movies aren't anymore. It has a genuine spirit that's carried on the shoulders of its lead performer, Terrence Dashon Howard, who speaks with that unique Southern hustler drawl and slang that makes his character all the more realistic and believable. He's simply brilliant in this role, as I've heard he's no stranger to music himself and his lyrics in this film seem so inspired you'd think he has a shot at a career as a rap star.What all of their hard work eventually culminates in, of course, is a chance meeting with a rapper from Memphis who managed to blow up and is featured prominently on television and such; his name is Skinny Black (real-life rapper Ludicrous), who DJay insists he attended school with. DJay sees the opportunity on July 4th to slide Skinny Black his demo tape and have him put the thing on the radio."Hustle &amp; Flow" ends on a note of deep profundity. Does DJay blow up and become the huge star he wants to be? I won't tell, but the movie ends in such a way you'd think it was true about people with dreams. Key says that life doesn't always pan out the way it should for some people, but that also, sometimes, it does. The thing about it is, he's right.Note: As a fan of rap, it is true what Shelby says about how much of popular music arose from or originated in the South (in addition to a lot of good rappers), from Arrested Development, to Outkast, to the Geto Boys, to Ludicrous himself (whom I'm no big fan of).Note #2: Yes, I'm aware that "Ludicrous" is typed correctly; it gets auto-corrected by IMDb for some reason so please just ignore the spelling.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very pleasantly surprised with "Hustle &amp; Flow". I expected some heavy booty shaking and bling bling-stuff but the movie had more profound soul than its surface did tell.Djay (soulful Terrence Howard) is a pimp. Beside this not so rosy job he has a dream to become famous singer. With some help with right people might make his dream come true...I have never been a big fan of rap music. When I first heard the Oscar-winning song: "It's Hard To Be a Pimp" I thought that the other Academy Award nominated songs were much better. Nevertheless the song was much much better when I heard it while watching the movie. It was definitely a theme song of the film. The other music in the film was also great. I never thought I'd hear myself say that! "Hustle &amp; Flow" is touching, funny and entertaining musical drama. It is a story from rags to richness. This time you really hope that the lead character will make it. Djay is very sympathetic man who really wants make his dream come true and not only for the money. Respect and dignity are more important things than possessions.High recommends!</fullReview>

I couldn't believe how good the music was in the film. The music by itself was worth the admission. I loved the dialogue. It's creative and clever without being contrived. You find yourself rooting for the pimp and justifying anything he has to do to get himself heard. Luckily, our hero is a good person and it's not a stretch to be on his side. The pacing runs at a good clip. Every scene moves the story forward. I love the trailers they made for the flick. They were shot separate from the movie and just as entertaining.

		<fullReview>Hustle and Flow is different from other movies within this genre. Terrence Howard plays a pimp named Djay but wants something different from his life. When he meets up with his friend from high-school(played by Anthony Anderson), Djay gets an idea of trying to become a rapper through the help of his friend (a producer of church music). While most movies with this kind of theme feature star rappers who can't act as the lead role, Howard takes his character to a new level. Howard takes you inside the mind of Djay and the audience is able to see that his character is more than just a filthy pimp. That he actually in a weird way cares a lot for the girls who work for him. Djay wants to offer these girls a better life as well. But, in order to fulfill his dream, it will take more than just hard work. He will also need some luck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "upward economic and social mobility through musical talent" genre has never been one of my favorites. This is, remember, the genre that begot "Glitter." In the past three years, however, the genre has risen high in the ranks of populist entertainment in both its fictional ("8 Mile") and non-fictional ("Ray" or "Walk the Line") forms."Hustle and Flow" crackles and pops onto the screen in its first frames as a throwback to character-driven 1970's movie-making that explored a certain criminal or non-traditional subculture of society (ala "Taxi Driver" or "Mindnight Cowboy"). The filmmakers do a great job early on of giving us an intimate and sympathetic, though never glorifying, look into the life of a Memphis pimp and the relationships he has with his environment and hoes. A great ensemble cast and hyper-intelligent script give it a surprising emotional resonance and moral complexity, much in the same way P.T. Anderson peered into the dysfunctional family of adult filmmakers in "Boogie Nights." The characters in "Hustle &amp; Flow" use music in the same way the characters in "Boogie Nights" used filming sex, as an abstract way to connect and communicate with the people around them.Terrance Howard (previously seen in a pivotal supporting part in the socially conscious "Crash") gives a powerhouse performance in the lead role. He displays a certain gravitas few performers possess, and it's truly put to the test as he is still able to carry the film even as it descends into a series of gangster-rap clichés in the final thirty minutes. The filmmakers really missed a golden opportunity to put out something that could've served both as a grandiose tragedy (ala John Singleton's "Boyz in the Hood") or biting social commentary (ala "Network" or "Bullworth"). After displaying such promise in the first three quarters of the film, it's ashame they copped out, as their amazing cast and lead performer never did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mainly went to see this film because I like Terrence Howard and he got a great review from Ebert and Roeper. At first, the movie was bombarded with the stereotypical images seen before in black flicks. People fighting in bars, pan handling, of course the drugs and prostitution. It seemed to only show the negative sides that I was hoping wouldn't be seen as the norm in the community. But, as the movie unfolded it showed the birth of a dream, a coming together of friends for a common cause, and true emotion. It showed that even the dregs of society can be lifted up somehow, by their dreams being fulfilled. DJay began to be a man to root for. He started to put in the necessary work, drive and effort to be a team leader and then to go out on the limb -- though not in the most respectable ways, to achieve an end. The cast did a phenomenal job. Based on the diversity of the audience that was with me, I think many will understand the process in getting a recording heard and also appreciate rap or hip hop, more. Terrence is a good actor and has played mainly the 'tough guy' roles but he really showed an emotional side. As one poster eluded -- we are now giving credit to a Pimp and feeling sorry for him. It doesn't make sense because a Pimp should be looked down on and shunned by society. Who cares if they reach their goals or dreams. They don't deserve it --- leading the life they do. It is comparable to how some like "The Sopranos" -- killers that they are, but we somehow see that they have a heart and somewhat normal family dynamics as everyone. The movie wanted everyone to have that common denominator -- realizing that everyone has a dream and may want to validated, heard and improve their life. This was a very unusual vehicle to make that point, via the "Pimp Mobile," but Terrence may have nailed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have only seen two great films this year. "Crash" and I just saw "Hustle and Flow". It just so happened that Terrance D. Howard is in both. Now that is absolutely great acting. Not just by him, but by the other actors too. What a raw and real film. After watching this, my husband said he has a better understanding of RAP also. There better be some awards around the corner for this film and this actor. Brewer has captured something both in the writing and directing. An athlete would call it "Being in the Zone".Kudos to Brewer and the crew.Jo Ann A. , Huntington Beach, CA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of the Human condition!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so gritty and real, it touches upon the human condition so well. I did not know what to expect and it blew me away. Not only did Terrance Howard provide a great performance but the storyline was excellently done. Terrance you alway have been a great star and with this performance you have truly made a serious turn. The story conveyed the longing of all the characters to live a better life in the face of poverty and few options. There are some very memorable scenes in this film. The first is when DJay (Terrance Howard) spits his first rhymes in the makeshift studio of his bedroom with Anthony Anderson and DJ Qualls characters. As they layer the sound of his first song one begins to not only see but, hear the potential of DJay dreams of becoming a rap star. The second is through a series of flashes during a jail visit when the audience is treated to what the future may hold for DJay(that is the most I will say because I want everyone to experience the film without giving too much away). That scene brought me to tears and I was uplifted as I left the theater. They say the sign of a great movie is when you are left thinking about it for days. Hustle and Flow has done just that for me. Praise to John Singleton for finding a way to finance this movie and get it out to the masses and major praise to the writer and director Craig Brewer for not only telling but giving us one of our(African American)stories in such a profound manner. I know there are many more stories out there and if any studio heads are reading this, DON'T BE SCARED TO GIVE US MORE!!! We are multi-faceted people with universal stories that everyone can relate to when it involves the human condition. I only hope the buzz keep growing and that this movie is a great success. It needs to be put in more theaters by audience demand. Maybe then can we get more tales like this that reaffirm that even the lowest of low can dream. My final words get out and see this movie! It's a must see!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that I really wasn't expecting a lot from this movie. The trailer and previews were interesting enough but I assumed it was just another "hip-hop" movie. To my surprise, the storyline and the actors were excellent. Terrence Howard is a great actor and he gives DJay such character. Actually, the entire casting was great. I was surprised that it only brought in $8 million but maybe that's pretty good since it was only showing on 1000 screens. I hope that people go out and support this film. When I heard that John Singleton financed this movie personally, I thought "he must really have faith in this film". It is an excellent film and it deserves all of the great reviews. This is a must-see film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take a look at Terrence Howard's performance in "Crash," and then go see what he does in "Hustle &amp; Flow." The guy does all the little (and big things) a film actor has to do to be credible. Not only that, he has an absolutely mesmerizing screen presence. If he doesn't become a major superstar, winning accolades and awards along the way -- as opposed to the kind of superstar status of, say, Tom Cruise or one of the other lightweight pretty boys -- then we'll know once and for all that the system is totally gamed."Hustle &amp; Flow"? I went to it the night it opened in NYC, having heard the buzz about it in reviews on NPR and in the NY Times. I was somewhat skeptical, yet I bought my ticket with an open mind, hoping I'd be entertained, enlightened, etc. Maybe what I really wanted was something other than the Big Bucks Production Crap that the major studios turn out so routinely. I wasn't disappointed. Because "Hustle &amp; Flow" didn't overwhelm me with effects. Instead it got me involved in a story about some downtrodden yet ever hopeful characters. Craig Brewer's script crackled with wit, pathos, hope and rage, and his direction was blessed by so much verisimilitude that the part of Memphis he intended to portray became almost visceral on the screen, tiny elements (wisps of smoke from a cigarette, beads of sweat, the oily smudges on an old fan) adding volumes to the back story. Brewer's casting decisions were inspired. Terrence Howard (DJay) will get all the "star" play, but he's got some terrific support in Taryn Manning (Nola), Taraji P. Henson (Shug), Paula Jai Parker (Lexus), Anthony Anderson (Key) and DJ Quails (Shelby). All in all, this is a "don't miss" film. A breakout by its writer/director, star and cast. Will it win big in this year's Hollywood awards shows? Hard to say. It should, in my opinion. One thing is sure... it's infinitely better than the "5.9" rating it's been given up to this point in time. Almost forgot... all hail John Singleton for producing the film! On NPR I heard that he put $3 million of his own cash into getting it done. Let's hope he cashes in big-time...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently viewed this film and the moment I walked out of the theater, I made phone calls to inform other friends and family that they should see this film, ToDAY(opening). I was amazed(not shocked because he is an excellent actor) at Terrence performance. I could really feel his spirit as he brought this character to life. The supporting cast was excellent as well. Taraji P. Henson, Paula Jai Parker, and Taryn Manning. There were some excellent scenes between all three. This film reminds me of the origins of blues, the true blues. Although its coming from a pimp and his so called "hoes" it is his blues and his struggle. Very real to life. Of coarse some will look down upon this film because it deals with a pimp and his hoes, but this is the most real to life experience I've ever seen in the media about this lifestyle. This film showed the rawness of it all, that it was not "bling bling and slap a hoe". I suggest you check out this film, you wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't take my eyes away, wondering what will happen next - the way film was meant to be. The story builds and then there is a climatic turning point that gets you really engaged. Amazing film-making!I think Terrence Howard is one of Hollywood's best kept secrets, that is until now. By starring in Hustle &amp; Flow, his talent shines. He embodies the soul of this pimp-turned-wannabee rapper character so intrinsically that you swear it's really the story of HIS life.Nonetheless, I must admit I was somewhat put off by the stereotypical characters at first. The movie quickly overcame those hesitations. At least there is a balance of imagery amongst characters; some depicting conversely positive roles.The casting was perfect from Anthony Anderson to Elise Neal, Taryn Manning to rapper "Ludacris". This award-winning indie is a must-see.I'd like to say a lot more but it's one of those times where, "You have to see it for yourself" is best suited.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes a movie is successful, engaging you but leaves you feeling dirty.Sometimes a movie is well enough made to seem worthwhile but gives you nothing, nothing at all.Sometimes a movie purports to be a genuine visit, an exploration in real, raw human dynamics from a world we wouldn't other wise see. This does advertise itself that way. And it is a fraud.The "true" part is the story of the guy, the Memphis rapper who sold CDs out of the back of his car. He tricked his way into a meeting with the director ? a polished white guy ? and made a demo in 24 hours from scratch. That song won the Oscar prompting the ghetto/ trailerpark hoots half the world saw. That part is genuine, a man "making it."But what false is everything else. Oh, I know folks get offended at the misogynism, but that's excusable here because that is the way most of the world runs. What is obnoxious is that we see a man "finding himself," following his path," and other sorts of soft notions about moving from irrelevance to a full life. The opening speech gives it to you in terms of dogs and man.And we see him do so in the context of making the song that both redeems him and forms the sonic backdrop of the movie. It seems so genuine on screen: a whore finds her center to sing; a repressed producer finds his groove la la la. And our pimp finds untapped resources that must exist lest we wouldn't have a movie.But in reality this is not the case. The top musical talent in Memphis (which is saying something) is turned to giving us what we see as genuinely from the man's soul but could never be. Never. And even if it were, does this song do anything but make your head bob for three minutes?The acting is impressive, and we should give Singleton credit for that, I think. But what a waste these actors must have known this to be. We like it, but it is lies. We like it because it is lies. There is no genuine black culture any more. It is all packaged to be sold, pimped.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrence Howard Is A Brilliant Actor, But....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Howard, as "DJAY," is, as usual, brilliant in HUSTLE &amp; FLOW. There are too many stereotypical characters and events in this movie for it to have the real depth I expected. It's as if someone told the screenwriter, "this is how black people MUST be portrayed. They must live down to THESE stereotypes." There are several hiccups in the flow of this story, certain plot points that should have been either explained or omitted. As seems to be expected, DJAY resorts to violence, and is arrested, as so many unenlightened people expect of black males. There is no explanation given for any of the relationships DJAY has with the women he exploits, though they seem to have strong bonds with him and each other. Ultimately, this is a movie that had potential, but seems to have needed some script revisions. It is a vehicle that is far beneath Terrence Howard's brilliance. I won't give up on Howard, though; I still intend to see every movie he is in. I just hope he makes better script choices than HUSTLE &amp; FLOW.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I broke with my weekly movie group to see HUSTLE AND FLOW alone, something I've never done in the past. As I had expected from the reviews I had read, it was a gritty movie with strong performances by the leading and supporting cast. What I did not expect was that the movie would linger with me--sort of a haunting presence--for days and days. Terrence Howard did a masterful job of portraying DJay as a complex, flawed character, but I think that the other actors were equally as convincing. The subject matter of the movie probably is a little harsh for some people, but it is handled with so much sensitivity for the characters involved that the performances really make it a film well worth seeing. I think I can guarantee that it's not a movie that you will easily forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie flowed very well. Terrence Howard (D-Jay) gave a very believable performance as a pimp. Taraji Henson (Shug) was also very good. Even though D-Jay was a pimp he had a good heart and even though he was verbally abusive, he did not physically abuse his "ho's". The movie also made you feel like these people were only doing what they had to do in order to survive in the poor area that they were living in and to appreciate the opportunities we have where we are and that we're not there. Because, "except for the Grace of God it could be any of us trying to live the best way we can". I only wish the movie had elaborated on what their life would be like at the end but I guess this way we can have a sequel.</fullReview>

Some will complain because of the negative images, but they are part of our society and ignoring them won't make them go away. I rated it based on my level of enjoyment - not on movie snob criteria like sophisticated dialog, elegant sets, etc. It made me laugh, made me cry - just made me feel. While I can't personally relate to the characters, it allowed me to see up close what happens when people have little or no resources. Each character was different yet most were the same - stuck doing what they had to do to survive. I was rooting for DJay. Like another reviewer, I'm glad Terrence got to make this film and showcase the depth of his talent. I was even feeling his flow and wanted to "Whoop that trick" too!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie. Not great, but definitely good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Hustle &amp; Flow" yesterday at the Los Angeles Film Festival.The movie's plot and feel are similar to "8 Mile." A gritty underdog story about a lower class guy with one shot at making it as a rap star.But instead of Eminem, we get Terrence Howard as DJay, a Memphis Pimp. Howard is very good in this movie. He's very believable as a dirty, foul-mouthed chain-smoking hustler. His accent is serviceable enough for you to suspend your disbelief. And he is at times scary, funny, and sympathetic as he goes through his "mid-life crisis" and tries to live his dream.In fact, the believability is one of the main strengths of the movie. The hoes are all overly made-up, potty-mouthed, or appropriately nasty for you to believe them. Anthony Anderson does a good job as a church-goer trying to mix it up with a friend who took a different life path.While the audience generally laughed their heads off (I found some scenes funny but not all), the best parts of the movie were easily the sequences where DJay and his friends create their music. You get to see Shelby, a skinny white guy, surprise DJay (and the crowd), by creating a tight beat to match DJay and Anderson's "Whup That Trick" chant. Later, a ho sings the hook on one of his songs, and they turn it into a catchy track. The audience really got going in these parts, and the songs will stick in your head.But the movie definitely has weaknesses as well. There is some inspired humor in it, but a lot of the jokes are stale and lazy. How many movies have we seen that try to wring laughs out of a white guy acting black? Ten thousand? Add this to the pile. If you're one of those people who laughs at that type of thing every single time you see it, expect to laugh more here. But if you're sick of it, like I am, you'll be rolling your eyes. Other than that, while it's funny, there's nothing that will really rock your world in terms of original or snappy humor.The story as a whole is also fairly pedestrian. It's one of those movies that wants to use an original setting and characters, but plugs it all into a run-of-the-mill plot. The dialogue was somewhat flat and average. It definitely felt like a "Festival-quality" film instead of a high-quality studio release.But with that being said, the plot functions well-enough, and the ending is a clever double-reverse of sorts. Overall, it was a crowd-pleaser. And I got my money's worth, which is more than you can say for a lot of indie films.A good movie. Not great, but definitely good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate rap music and anything that promotes pimps, gang banging, shooting cops or beating women. I'm a middle-aged white guy; you'll never see me wearing a gold chain or spending a lot of money on rims for my car. I can't stand people who drive by blasting music out of their car as if I want to hear their stupid music. With that said, I really enjoyed this film.Why? Because of its combination of great actors, direction and a multi-leveled script that made you care about the characters no matter how shady. Brewer has done an amazing job with this screenplay, and although there are couple cheesy parts I hated ("I'm gonna get you a head set to talk into and make you feel important" - boy, if you couldn't see what that was leading to you don't know movies), but overall, he made the characters three dimensional beings that you actually pull for, despite their disrespectful standing in life. Howard is always great in anything he's in, I love how he says "mine" instead of "man" (like he did in Dead Presidents).This film might have done real well at the box office had they promoted it to the general public, rather than the black community. I live in LA and work in the entertainment industry and saw how it was promoted and remember thinking "man, there's one movie I'll never see," and that's not my fault, it's the promotions department fault. It was promoted as a movie about a pimp loser who wants to be a rap star, not as a person with a dream, who gives it a shot and almost loses everything.Of course, its one huge negative aspect is how it promotes racial stereotypes: the blacks want to be rappers, refer to women as "hos" and being a pimp is where it's at. Outside of that, for pure entertainment value, I recommend this movie highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Rap Movie Ever, and Then Some!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this at the 2005 Sundance film festival and must say this was a fantastic movie. It should easily be the best movie to come out of the festival, and best I have had the opportunity to see there in my half dozen years of going (Its lucky to get tickets to anything these days, let alone something great). Right off I have to say the cast was absolutely amazing, several break out performances for sure,I really liked Taryn Manning (what a beauty) and Taraji P. Henson was simply emotional to watch. Then Terrence Howard, this guy has been doing some supporting roles and been rather likable, but this is totally something else, he lights the screen on fire. You could say he's the next "it" black actor, but really black,white,yellow,magenta whatever this guy drops it like its hot here, this performance will make you keep an eye out for his next movie on the IMDb. As for the story, well its about a hard livin pimp from Memphis wanting to accomplish a dream of becoming a rapper and getting his songs heard. The plot isn't that complicated which in this case is just fine because the greatness is in the details of the characters. I felt like you really became more attached to each character along the way, thus making for a much anticipated ending. The ending, I wont give it away but it is doesn't sell out and at the same time is very satisfying. If you are a fan of rap music, hip hop,crunk whatever you will very much enjoy this movie and the music is very well done. However I will also throw this out there, my 50 year old mother who thinks rap music is foul and has zero interest in gritty subject matter (ie, Pimpin) saw this movie at Sundance and thought based on the acting alone it was the best movie she had seen.

		<fullReview>DJay,played by Terrence Howard, is a pimp and drug dealer who is dissatisfied with his life and wants to make a change in Hustle And Flow.After acquiring a keyboard and reacquainting himself with an old friend from school,Key, played by Anthony Anderson,who has become a sound technician. Then,he decides to try making hip hop songs. Key and sound-mixer friend,Shelby,played by DJ Qualls coordinates with DJay put together several songs. The group experiences many setbacks throughout the creative process. DJay must hustle those around him in order to procure proper equipment and recording time, and Key's relationship with his wife becomes strained. At the end of the film, in a bit of irony, sees a duo of prison guards who have their own rap group asking DJay to listen to their demo, much as DJay had approached Skinny Black. After the guards request him to listen to the demo, he accepts their tape and responds with the following: "You know what they say, everybody gotta have a dream," which was the slogan for the film.Hustle And Flow was a great independent drama film.Terrence Howard was exceptional as DJay.The screenplay by Craig Brewer was also great in trying to tell a story of a man who sought change in his life.His direction by was crisp as well. Highly recommended for viewers who seek themes about the welfare of disenfranchised people particularly African- Americans. Highly recommended indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hustle &amp; Flow" bears some resemblance to the 2002 Eminem vehicle "8 Mile", which is a better-known, but not better, movie. Again we have an aspiring rapper, this time one chasing a dream once forgotten in order to make ends meet working as a pimp. He convinces an old friend to help him record a demo but it'll all be for nothing if they can't get their demo in the right hands.The star of the film is Terrence Howard and he delivered an excellent performance, one that was rewarded with an Oscar nomination. I'd like to say that everyone else was as good but the rest of the cast is of variable quality. The under-appreciated Anthony Anderson contributes the best performance in support while the rest of the cast is at least passable.Director Craig Brewer put in a workmanlike effort and the film is pretty much free of Hollywood gloss. I liked the retro opening and closing credits, too. Of course, there's lots of music and, even though I'm not much of a fan of rap, I'd have to say it was all well done, especially "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp", which (deservedly) won the Oscar for best original song.In the end, Brewer &amp; company unfold a compelling story with enough grit to give it an air of authenticity. Quality music and a star-making turn by Terrence Howard add to the film's appeal, resulting in a movie that's likely to surpass your expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hustle &amp; Flow has the perfect balance of. Drama, Music, and performances. I firmly believe without the passionate performances, this movie wouldn't have been as strong as it was. Terrence Howard's character is a tad bit abrasive at times, but his heart of gold, and his never-give up mentality made the character perfect in my opinion. What really made the movie for me was it's realism.. The characters felt real, the situations seemed real, and the ending wasn't all that far-fetched either, and really made me smile. The ending is one of the best things about the movie because it wasn't all that unbelievable. You will hate Skinny for what he does, and it will certainly mess with your emotions. I firmly believe this movie isn't for everyone, due to its violent language and the fact that not everybody is into Rap. But it is worth it in my opinion.Performances. Terrence Howard is Oscar worthy here. It truly was a star-making performance, and I loved everything about his character. Despite some of his abusive and abrasive actions, he remained likable. He was the heart and soul of this film. Anthony Anderson can actually ACT!. I was shocked at his maturity and how good he was here. Taryn Manning is fantastic as the vulnerable, and often overlooked woman. I felt for her on many occasions, and thought she did a great job. DJ Qualls is excellent as well surprisingly. He injected a nice amount of humor into his part. Taraji P. Henson is solid as the love interest. She was likable and never overdid it. Ludicrous played scum perfectly. I couldn't stand him as Skinny.Bottom line. It's powerful, engrossing and a joy to watch. Don't be turned off by it, because of its subject material. Critics were 100% right about this one. A must see.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply amazing &amp; inspiring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this movie about a dozen times now, and finally decided to give it a rating here on IMDb: 10/10.The movie is so close to flawless, so brilliant in it's depiction of real people, so well put together that I find myself just dumbfounded every time I watch it. Like another reviewer, I find myself moved to tears by the poignancy of the struggles these people have to make something special and beautiful out of literally nothing. Life is hard for most of the people on this planet, and the continuous beatdowns take their toll, yet somehow, people find the courage, the will, to keep on keeping on and trying to create order out of the chaos. The depiction of this situation in this movie is inspiring.The characters are the lowest of the low, stuck in horrible lives, in terrible conditions, and cognizant of it. Yet they find inspiration in their desperation, find the strength to keep struggling, even when it seems that every turn is a dead end. Like Sisyphus, they never give up, never let the boulder force them back down the mountain, and it is this indomitable characteristic in all the main players that keeps you watching, keeps you interested, keeps you caring about them and what will happen to them.Amazing performances from all involved, great direction, great script, AWESOME music and a realistic feel that really hasn't much existed since the great films of the 1970s; this movie is one of very few that I will ever call flawless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story of a small time pimp with big dreams to enter the rap game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hustle and Flow is a very good come-up story of a small town southern pimp slash small time drug dealer D-Jay and the people in his life who help him along the way to realize his goal of making it in the rap game. D-jay is at a mid-life crisis in his life and is looking for a way out and a way up in the rap business. Terreance Howard gives a great performance as D-Jay a very believable character, also giving a good performance is Taryn Manning as Nola, D-Jays main girl in his stable of women. Every one else in the film gives a good performance too even usually over the top character actors DJ Qualls and Anthony Anderson give more realistic performances.Good soundtrack very original. Good directing and writing by Craig Brewer. Even though this film takes place in modern day it has the feel of a 70's blaxploitation soul cinema film, a genre i am a huge fan of. I like this film the most in the recent genre of rap musician life movies that have come out around the same time i.e. Get rich or die trying and 8 Mile. I am not a huge fan of rap music but this film and it's music is very believable and it captures you're attention from the start and holds it until the end, definitely worth the viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was quite a surprise. Terrence Howard definitely made himself a name for his inspiring performance as an all around "hustler" rapper. This movie is packed with vulgar language, sexuality, and drug use, but it illustrates the hard knock life of a hustler. This is an excellent movie to watch. No kids in the room just a warning. But overall, a great movie. If you're into the hip hop lifestyle then this movie is definitely for you. If you don't like the hip hop lifestyle then maybe its not for you, but even my friend from Europe liked it. Therefore it does apply to all audiences near and far. You can pick up this movie from your local Family Video in the 2 for $1 section so go pick this movie out next time your out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrance Howard's performance spectacular/script sinks in the creek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Howard's performance wrenched this script from the ordinary to the extraordinary. Other members of the cast tried hard and shone well--but the script was so leaden that it was difficult for them to do as well as they should have (DJ Qualls, Taryn Manning, Taraji Henson were among those who were wonderful but who were pulled down by the script).For me, this movie was a collection of wonderful instruments (the actors) who were desperately striving to do better than the trivial tune they were given to play. With this cast and a script that was not the cliqued, run-of-the mill job that this was, this film easily would have been a 9/10 instead of a 6/7. What a loss!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>complete spoilers contained--The film is produced by John Singleton, and written &amp; directed by Craig Brewer. Terence Howard plays DJay, a Memphis pimp of middling means, who shares a ramshackle home with his three working girls: Lexus is the eldest, a part-time stripper whose toddler son also lives there; Nola is white and apparently DJay's main money-earner; mousy Shug is pregnant with DJay's baby. In his early 30's, DJay is having a mid-life crisis of sorts?he's weary of spending his days pushing sex and nickel-bags of marijuana, but he doesn't know exactly what else he wants to do.A chance barter gets DJay a Reagan-era Casio keyboard, and he takes it as an omen to try and become a rap singer. Arnel (Isaac Hayes) is a sympathetic bar owner, who tells DJay that a Memphis local, Skinny Black (Ludacris) has recently become a mainstream rap star, and he's poised to have a 4th of July party in town. DJay swears he used to know the guy, and now he plans to record a demo tape to pass along to Black in time for the party.Soon, DJay rekindles a friendship with an old high school chum Key (Anthony Anderson)?now married, Key's an audio engineer recording depositions at the city courthouse, and he becomes DJay's producer. They jerry-rig a recording studio in DJay's house, and along with vending machine-stocker/church organist Shelby (DJ Qualls) they set about to creating DJay's sound.All the actors do a good job; Howard is very convincing as DJay; despite his role in his relationship with his hookers, he's just as lost and desperate as they are. The film doesn't glorify the pimp lifestyle but instead offers a glimpse at the reality that probably exists for most people involved: DJay doesn't drive a new model Cadillac, but a beat-up early-80's sedan; he's dressed not in flamboyant suits, but casual gear. The casual brutality of that world is glimpsed when DJay kicks Lexus and her son out of the house, and when he prompts Nola to do a sex job in exchange for an expensive microphone.--Climax Spoilers-- DJay's ambitions increases the pressure not only on himself, but everyone around him?Lexus is constantly surly and snarly; Nola is increasingly antsy about turning tricks; Key's church-going wife is aghast at his newfound choice of friends. Eventually, DJay's group finish a song, "Whoop That Trick"?on cassette?and DJay prepares to approach Skinny Black at Arnel's bar. It isn't easy?Black is surrounded by a posse of boorish hangers-on, and it takes DJay offering Black a batch of high-end marijuana to break the ice.Unfortunately, Black turns out to be a drunken jerk, who ditches the demo tape in the restroom; when DJay finds it he beats him up, but then one of Black's henchman shows up, and a firefight gets started?DJay ends up doing some time. Key visits him, and lets him know what's been going on since then: Shug gave birth to a baby girl, and its clear that she's still holding a torch for DJay; Nola turned into DJay's defacto manager, shopping his song to assorted radio stations; as he's about to be released, his song finally hits the radio; even some correctional officers offer him their demo tape. "Everybody's gotta have a dream."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed it this movie. I know you could easily argue that it was clichéd, manipulative, misogynistic, one-dimensional and so on, but I just found it immensely likable and well crafted in all departments. It genuinely felt like a Rocky or Saturday Night Fever for the 00s while I was watching it.Terrence Howard was outstanding as Djay. It's a fresh, vibrant and charismatic star turn fully worthy of his Oscar nomination. Seeing this after his wildly different role in the same year's Crash just confirms his striking versatility. There was a lot of justifiable praise for Taraji P. Henson as Shug, the pregnant hooker who sings the chorus on "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp", but I think Taryn Manning almost stole the show as Nola, the young hooker with the blonde braids that Djay confides in; I'm surprised there was so little mention of her performance in most reviews. The songs were all naggingly catchy ? I can't get "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp" out of my head now. All in all, this was pretty irresistible entertainment.</fullReview>

I Thought that the feeling of having an absolute need to express yourself really came bursting threw, the the story moved a little slowly. I think Terrance Howard put in a great performance, his strife and feeling were very believable.I liked the song; I thought it was catchy. The character development was a little weak, I would have liked to have seen more of a back story for the three hookers. The characters and the acting were all good, but since the plot struggled along it was hard to fully appreciate them. One of the coolest parts was how they set up the make shift recording studio and I was able to admire the balls -to -the- wall attitude that the characters had about making music and chasing their dreams. I think this is worth seeing, but it drags a bit.</fullReview>

Terrence Howard is an unbelievable actor, and yanks you right into the movie from the first drag of his cigarette, the first words of that opening monologue. The supporting cast is truly unbelievable as well. Everyone involved in this movie must have had a blast. The story is meaty, and if I, as a white kid from Canada, can sink my teeth into it, than probably anyone that sees it will too. It moves at a steady pace, and before you know it, you're laughing, crying, hoping and dreaming along with the characters in the movie. It's a movie about pushing through with your dreams, and does a fantastic job maintaining focus on this theme, without preaching, or losing touch with reality. Get it, watch it, watch it again.

		<shortDescription>Character-driven drama spotlights Terrence Howard...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...as an actor to watch, along with several of his supporting cast mates.Writer/director Craig "Black Snake Moan" Brewer tells his hometown story with economy and conviction, rarely straying into Hollywood-ish excess. Aging pimp Djay (Howard), in the midst of a self-identified "midlife crisis," capitalizes on a chance encounter with homey Key (Anthony "The Departed" Anderson) to pursue his dream of becoming a pro rapper. The outcome is unsurprising, given Djay's temperament and environment, but "Hustle &amp; Flow" draws its audience into Djay's sordid, dead-end world almost without effort, and actually makes that audience root for people they might not otherwise grant the time of day. Superior acting all the way around is provided by stars Howard, Anderson, Taraji "Four Brothers" Henson, the very foxy Taryn "Cold Mountain" Manning, Paula Jai "The Proud Family" Parker, Elise "All of Us" Neal, and DJ "The Core" Qualls, along with actor/performers Isaac Hayes and a very effective Ludicrous as Skinny Black, the rap mogul that Djay pins his hopes of success on. All in all, a very impressive ensemble.Production costs were relatively low, but "Hustle &amp; Flow" looks great. Production design, art direction, and costuming are all flawless, placing the audience smack in the middle of Djay's world. Amy "Black Snake Moan" Vincent's cinematography abjures showiness for solid storytelling, along with Billy "Band of Brothers" Fox's editing. Scott "Black Snake Moan" Bomar's music sets the appropriate tones, along with the ostensible Djay hit, "Whoop That Trick." There hardly seemed to be a false note in the entire production.A bit rough for delicate sensibilities, "Hustle &amp; Flow" delivers solid human characters caught up in the web of their own sins and proves them to be as worthy of our consideration as anyone else. Definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You know the saying, everyone's got to have a dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent surprise, Hustle and Flow was a great film that exceeded my expectations. I remember during the Oscars, I hated this film, because to me, Jon Stuart saying how Martin Scorcese hasn't won one Oscar, but 3-6 Mafia has won because of a song called "It's hard out here for a pimp", it was insulting. But I figured I shouldn't judge and give it a shot after all this time, and I'm glad I did, because I understand the flow(no pun) of the movie and what was needed.It's about a man, Djay, he's a pimp and he's having a hard time with his ho's and trying to make it. But he knows he has talent and wants to make something of himself, he gets together with an old friend, and together they create a cool beat album. But there is one problem, getting the record out and played on the radio. Djay has an idea to get an old friend from Memphis called Skinny Black to spread the demo, but that's a problem when no one is taking him seriously.Hustle and Flow is a great and dark film about the gritty scary truth of being in the tough neighborhoods and trying to pay the rent when you can't even get your act together yourself. It was truly inspiring and touching that Djay didn't want to rap for money, but to get his voice heard. I apologize for insulting this movie, it was a good one.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>movie never quite matches Howard's performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrance Howard earned a well-deserved Best Actor nomination for his strong performance in "Hustle and Flow," a modern urban fairy tale about a two-bit drug dealer and pimp who dreams of making something better of his life. "D-Jay," a singer/songwriter who long ago gave up his ambition of hitting it big in the music business, barely ekes out a living selling dope and pimping cheap hookers in his rundown Memphis neighborhood. Lately, he's been suffering from what he himself calls a "mid life crisis," as the realization has begun to dawn on him that his life is going nowhere fast. By chance, he runs into a high school acquaintance with some recording equipment who agrees to hook up with him and start cutting some records. But will D-Jay be able to break into an industry that seems closed to all but a select few hardworking and lucky enough to break down the doors? Although Howard hits all the right notes in his performance, the movie itself is never quite as good as he is in it. As written and directed by Craig Brewer, the film lacks the authenticity and grit that a sturdier, more seasoned hand (a Spike Lee, for instance) might have brought to it. The scenes often have an air of contrivance about them, as if Brewer didn't trust the audience to get the meaning without his spelling it all out for us. The storyline often veers dangerously close to melodrama (as in D-Jay's encounter with a big star hip-hop artist) and the dialogue often has that overly explicit, self-revelatory quality that makes it sound forced, unconvincing and phony. Moreover, with the exception of Howard, the acting is woefully uneven and even downright amateurish at times. One admires what Brewer is trying to do in the film - providing a sort of upbeat antidote to all the downbeat urban black dramas we are always being subjected to these days - but "Hustle and Flow" never manages to convince us of its own authenticity.Still, the movie is worth checking out for Howard's acting, which is indeed rich, varied and amazingly subtle at times, and for some nice moments of emotion and insight scattered along the way.</fullReview>

Nonetheless, I was extremely surprised at how well it was pulled off. The characters were real and not cheesy. The neighborhood scenes truly captured the aura of a 'hood'. Terrance Howard's performance as D Jay steals the show. I know a lot of people liked Phillp Seymour Hoffman in Capote, but Terrance Howard nailed this performance. If you get the DVD watch his real-life interviews sot you can truly see what a stretch this character was for him. And he does all his own raps, which are so good they've been stuck in my head for days now! Check it out, even if you're sceptical...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie With A Theme Everyone Can Understand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start in on this review, I think I need to make a few things clear: 1) I don't watch MTV, and 2) I don't like rap music. Hopefully that will help put things in perspective for those who choose to read this because this isn't a tale about a rapper nor about music; it's the story of never giving up on one's dreams, a universal theme that takes on an entirely new scope in writer/director Craig Brewer's excellent film HUSTLE AND FLOW.I didn't much care for BOYZ IN THE HOOD and I felt that 8-MILE was over-hyped, so I was hesitant to watch something with a similar sounding theme. But my worries were unfounded. Although what you've probably heard is true ("It's the story of a pimp and his whores"), chances are you're only getting a snapshot glimpse of this amazing character film by listening to such a basic definition.Terrence Howard plays D'Jay the pimp, a good pimp, struggling to make ends meet by employing three women in his "crib". But a chance encounter with a music mixer whom he used to go to school with lifts his spirits and makes him feel as if he's having a mid-life crisis. D'Jay's attempts to cut his own music consume him, even to the point of using one of his employees' skills to obtain a $250 microphone (sparking off a rather heated exchange, I might add).The fact that the story takes place in Memphis added a genuine sense of realism to the film, too (from the down-and-out neighborhoods and on-location shoots near bridges and underpasses).The actors ? without exception ? reached deep down into themselves and pulled up some of the finest performances of 2005. Every single actor in the movie LIVED those roles. All of the Oscar nominated films in 2005 (although this one wasn't nominated for Best Picture) held a valid message, and I absolutely loved how different yet similar they were. GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, CAPOTE, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, CRASH and MUNICH all had amazing historical or cultural aspects littered throughout them, and HUSTLE AND FLOW is no exception; why it wasn't nominated in the Best Picture category ahead of MUNICH is a mystery to me, though.Never giving up on your dreams ("By any means necessary") is both the message of the film and of the film-makers. Watching the extra features on the DVD, I learned that the producers shopped around Hollywood for financial backing but couldn't find any. Year after year and studio after studio, they got turned down. So, in the spirit of "let's go and do it ourselves", they put their own money forward (a measly $8 million sunk into it from pre- to post-production).If you haven't seen this movie just because of what you've heard, you're cheating yourself out of an excellent night of entertainment. Just remember, you don't have to be young to enjoy the themes talked about here. This is dreaming at its ugliest and its best. And I still don't like rap music, but I may be buying the music track to this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HUSTLE &amp; FLOW is one of those rare movies that reminds you of what cinema should be. It has a gritty and raw story, flawed characters, solid performances, and a catchy tune. Craig Brewer does an excellent job balancing the performances of the characters and leaving us wanting for more at the end. Djay is a struggling pimp, trying to make ends meet taking care of a pregnant girlfriend and keeping business moving during the hot summer by selling the services of young Nola, a disturbingly good Taryn Manning. Djay goes to his friend, Key, to produce a demo, one that Djay promises will be heard by local superstar Skinny Black. With Nola earning hard cash, Djay and Key, assisted by Shelby, start making music (and living the dream). The one flaw in the film is that Brewer might have thought the audience wouldn't want a twist. We learn early on that Djay really doesn't know Skinny Black and is lying to Key about their friendship. Brewer even has an ended flashback / summary to remind viewers that this relationship never existed. It would have been more powerful if Brewer had let us, as the audience, believe the lie and then we learn the truth as it's happening. All in all, a fine movie with a great cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know it's hard out there for an anglo film director to orchestrate a film focusing on the dreams of a struggling pimp's thrive in becoming a successful rap artist. However, Director Craig Brewer was able to accomplish it with a superfluous flow. You know it's hard out there for an actor to dig deep into the protagonist role of DJ, the aforementioned pimp who's relentless pursuit of self-accomplishment is the thrust of his life. However, Terrence Howard's star-making performance saved this DJ from a broken acting heart. Terrence's titillating work is probably the most passionate acting performance of the year! You know it's hard out there for supporting actors to compete with Howard's extravaganza thespian effort; but Anthony Anderson, Taryn Manning, D.J. Qualls, Paula Jai Parker, Taraji P. Henson, and Ludicrous go with the flow admirably and do the supporting acting hustle impressively. You know it's hard out there for a rap song in a movie to win the Best Song Academy Award. However, 3 Six Mafia put a hit to that myth by deservingly getting the aforementioned golden boy recognition for the hit single "You Know It's Hard Out There For A Pimp". "Hustle &amp; Flow" was engrossing, spirited, and succulent. So get some flow and do the "Hustle &amp; Flow". *****Excellent</fullReview>

This was probably the best movie I've seen this year, at least this far. And soon I will tell what's so great with it.The story may sound silly ( I thought so). The movie is about small time pimp and drug dealer D-Jay( A stunning Terrance Howard), who drives around with his prostitute Nola (Taryn Manning, and looks after guys who will buy Nola or drugs. After D-Jay hears about a guy called Skinny Black (Ludacris) who is from the same area as him, who has broken trough in the hip/hop-rap game he gets an idea that he can become an rap star too so he begins to write lyrics and with help from some friends he begins too record music.When I first heard about this movie about 7 months ago I immediately wanted to see it but it didn't become that way. Since I live in Sweden it didn't go up in the cinemas so I forgot about it rather soon again. Then when it was time for The Oscars and then I heard about it again and then last week I ordered it on import because it hadn't come too Sweden. Was it worth the wait and the 40 dollar I paid, yes and then some! What a great film! Right from the first frame to the last I was: Laughing, crying, and was just stunned. First of all I have to congratulate the team for the great soundtrack, I have almost seen non other movie which has so excellent soundtrack and scoring, so congrats! Then the actors... That Terance Howard could make such a great role is beyond my understanding and that he didn't won that Oscar is just a damn shame. The others is also great, Anthony Andersson as the record producer does his best role to date also Taryn Manning is excellent. Everybode is excellent and director/screen writer Craig Brewer is one of my new idols. This movie is just, as you get it from my review, excellent and the fact that this wasn't even nominated for best film is just sad. Go watch this now! You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails to answer the question of why it's so hard out there to be a pimp.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, so even after watching the entirety of Hustle &amp; Flow, I'm still quite uncertain why it's so hard out there to be a pimp. It's not that the movie doesn't try to tell you, it's just that it doesn't do a hell of a good job doing it.Save spoiling the whole movie, DJay (Terrence Howard) is a pimp, who longs to make something of himself. He acquires an old keyboard through a drug deal, and after playing it, finds something he can do in order to stop having to pimp. He runs into an old pal (Anthony Anderson), who helps record music, and finds his way to achieve his goal.Without going into too much description, the plot doesn't go too far from there. Long-winded symbolic speeches, and tons of rap music abound, but they don't allow a whole lot to be added to the film. The movie basically goes nowhere in just under two hours, and when it manages to try and attempt to, it becomes grounded and flies head-on into clichés. You get the sense that DJay wants more for himself, but his motivation is never really explained. He pokes at his upbringing, but not much is revealed other than a short, casual exchange. Yeah, the hookers he lives with whine and complain, but he really shows very little interest in that fact. Even after they yell at him for making them do the things they do, he still plays on their mind in order to make them want to continue.Hell, he has millions of fans all over his house because it's too hot, and complains about not having any money, yet he manages to buy a new top-line keyboard through drug deals and pimping, what he was doing before when he claimed to have no money. So how did he pull off buying a new keyboard? It's never explained of course.Another thing that doesn't help is the fact that while his performance is excellent, Terrence Howard is the whitest African-American in the world. His speech, his mannerisms, they aren't quite true to what is thought of to be a pimp, and they barely make a convincing black man. He just doesn't have it in him to play this kind of role, and it shows. He just seems to be having an awkward time throughout, and while he's trying to broaden out, he needs to learn his limits. His performance is easily the weakest of the five Academy Award nominated Actors, and could have clearly been filled by the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Eric Bana or Russell Crowe. Howard's acting was far superior in Crash, and should have been nominated over cast-mate Matt Dillon.The supporting performances are all pretty good for their tightly written parts. While not particularly dramatic, Anthony Anderson does prove here that he play more than just the toking' black guy in an action or comedy movie. The two female leads are great, and Ludicrous even pulls in a pretty good performance (not that it was a whole stretch for him, but still).The locales and film-making style are all pretty good (the title sequence nod to the 1970's was a good touch), and stay consistent throughout. The music of course, for a rap film, is loud and swear-word filled. But in this case, it works perfectly. The songs are all very well written, and even pretty catchy. Even though it's completely ridiculous, I'll be damned if I can't stop humming "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp".In the end, it's not a particularly memorable film, but it's a worthy attempt.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulsing with the heart of Memphis streets - a must see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An outstandingly realistic portrayal of the struggles of DJay, a Memphis pimp, to break out of his dirty job on the streets and transform his life as a rapper of note. Inspired by the gospel recording done by his schoolmate Key, DJay gathers together a small team comprising himself, Key, Shug (one of his ladies living with him) and Shelby (a sound mixer) and lays down a couple of peppy rap tracks. He is helped along the way by Nola, another of his ladies, who pays for his equipment with her services. A much-awaited meeting with Skinny Black, a leading rapper of the time, ends up going all wrong and DJay lands in jail. The language is real, off the streets of Memphis. Terrence Howards' portrayal of the passion is touching. Definitely worth a watch. In my opinion, this movie is far superior to "Crash" which won the best movie Oscar!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the language was a little explicit, and portrayals were a little degrading, but the fact remains that this is part of our society, and people who don't want to look at it refuse to accept that these evils do exist in our society, and people have to find ways to deal with them.I read a review by an African American woman on another website, and she said that it's degrading to the whole black community. Did she not see the white people that were in the film too, living the same lifestyle? Did she miss the love story plot, or the message of what hard work and perseverance can get you in the face of adversity? Terrence Howard demonstrated that essence in every conceivable way. And he may have been pimping women, but they weren't forced into it, and he treated them with respect. You didn't see him hit them or anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody Gotta Have a Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Think back to the days of the "blaxploitation" film. Now imagine if one of these films had production values, a real budget and a professional crew, all the things a modern Hollywood movie takes for granted. Now imagine the lead is not just a solid actor, but a revelation, so good that he makes every actor around him elevate their game into something mythic. If you had all that, you may just end up with "Hustle &amp; Flow."The film isn't perfect; D.J. Qualls stumbles in his dramatic scenes, and Anthony Anderson is only good at playing Anthony Anderson. Those two aside, every actor absolutely vanishes into the roles they play (though Taraji Henson as the pregnant Shug does waver back and forth, occasionally overdoing it) and the result is a powerful, real, absolutely watchable film for anyone who just loves a strong, character-driven story. These aren't the cartoons we're used to watching in movies about "the streets"; these are real people, they exist, and anyone who says different has never ventured out of the suburbs.Despite the problem actors, they do each get at least one moment where they are just as real as those around them. And Terrence Howard is a revelation, though I'm surely not the first person to say it. I didn't see this movie because of the reviews, I saw it because of Howard's performance in "Crash" and the trailer for "Idlewild." He's got a presence, and he lives and breathes this role in a movie that is almost, but not quite up to him, which is exactly like Charlize Theron in "Monster," or Hilary Swank in "Boys Don't Cry," or Denzel Washington in "Training Day." The movies are very good. The actor radiates.A quarter-century after the death of blaxploitation cinema, the African-American film movement is in a shambles. Spike Lee and John Singleton only have one good movie, each, to their names, and the Hughes Brothers have moved out of black cinema and into a different genre entirely. There are powerful stories to tell about the black culture, about the black experience, and this pulls no punches, telling what could be a true story as if it WERE the truth, because it IS the truth... uplifting in parts, brutally ugly in others.How proud was I, then, that writer/director Craig Brewer had such an incredible story to tell, and finally, at long last, that culture has a name and a face to do it right in cinema. And then I see an interview with the guy, and he's a middle-aged, bald white cat.Like D. Jay says, man. Everybody gotta have a dream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And I Usually Hate Rap Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a avid hater of rap and everything that has to do with it. I only watched Hustle and Flow because it got a best actor Oscar nomination. I was needless to say not looking forward to it. Boy o boy was I surprised. It was hilarious and made perfect sense. The rap songs didn't make me want to throw the TV out the window and the performances were wonderful. But the thing that surprised me the most was how wonderful the film itself was. It was one of the best films of the year. I sat in my seat with a huge smile on my face watching a guy singing a song called "Its Hard Out Here for a Pimp" and actually really enjoyed it, even the song. This may be because of several reasons, but the one I think helped the most is the screenplay. the screenplay is just wonderfully written. The author really knows his stuff, not just about his subject but about people and how they talk and act. He makes the wonderful movie all the more powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HUSTLE &amp; FLOW : Film-making Dynamite With The Searingly Good Terrence Howard...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HUSTLE &amp; FLOW HUSTLE &amp; FLOW, featuring a blazing turn from the enthralling Terrence Howard, is an unexpectedly wrenching movie that moves along at a beat just as pulsating as the music genre it centers around.The movie wraps you around it's finger with it's opening "calm before the storm" monologue where D-Jay (Howard) sits in his hot Chevy with Nola (Taryn Manning), his best prostitute, talking about the world. You can see this is a man doped up on some drugs while she is as well, but the artistic soul inside of him is clearly trying to push itself out of D-Jay in a way he can't yet grasp. And as soon as the audience sees the core reality and humanity of the character... the beat starts driving the film.When D-Jay starts to rap, Howard shows you that this isn't a passion slowly coming out of him... it is a tidal wave of frustration, passion, talent, and desperation pounding against a wall of drugs, depression, and disappointment that he has built up for years. Yet, even in his childlike excitement over the new prospects in his life, he can never break free of the lifestyle and situations that life as a pimp has put him in.This truly is a brilliant performance from Howard and he deserves the attention he has received from the Academy and other critics organizations. But it's also refreshing to know that this ensemble was recognized at SAG. It truly was some of the best ensemble work I've seen in a long time (faaaaaaar surpassing CRASH... which was an example of true ensemble work sure, but this is an example of true ensemble work on a superior level with the talent leaping off the screen). Taryn Manning was especially compelling in her role as D-Jay's "cheif investor". It's a shame no buzz developed around her for a Supporting Actress nomination.I've read some reviews cite this film as ridiculous... but to me, the life of a Pimp is in some ways "ridiculous". Despite the terrible living situations and rough lifestyle... their lives are filled with over-indulgence in all the wrong things. Sex, drugs, and music.However, this movie never looks down on the struggle and dream of D-Jay... partially because of brilliant pacing, and very much so because of Terrence Howards searing performance. HUSTLE &amp; FLOW is a genuine surprise. Fully engrossing, heartbreakingly honest, entertainingly open-minded... everything to add up to greatness.I probably never would have rented it had I not felt required to b/c of it's Oscar nominations. But I am thrilled I did, b/c despite it's lack of "important messages" and "political topics"... HUSTLE &amp; FLOW is one of the best films I've seen this year.Film-making dynamite....

		<shortDescription>Whoop that trick (GET EM)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a nice surprise. The acting is great and the elements played out are deep and mesmerizing. The screenplay is perfect for the setting of Memphis, and the overall southern hip hop feel really works. A tough street-wise pimp having a middle aged breakdown is fed up with ghetto livin and the struggle to get by with his few prostitutes, and relatively small drug game. He resuscitates his rap game with an old high-school friend with limited studio equipment. While the protagonist is rough at times, and has few morals when it comes to women, he is surprisingly likable. The complexity of "Djay" is that he is so simple. Obviously largely uneducated and in touch with how the streets work, he still formulates his musical ability with a hustler's ambition. He knows what he wants and he won't stop until it is obtained. Everyone has to have a dream, whether you have to lie for it or put everything on the line. Luda plays a Memphis boy that made it out of the ghetto with his rhymes, but then becomes consumed in his own image and the fortune put upon him. It makes him a despicable person when it comes down to it, and he really pulled the roll off. I had my doubts about Luda as an actor, but he does a splendid job with it. Overall a good effort by all parties. My pet peeve with this movie is the music is just average. Being involved with rap for years now, you have to understand movies like 8 mile really focus on the lyrics and music makin it a whole different type of movie. While this movie was better acted than 8 Mile with a grittier feel, the musical sequences were completely dominated by 8 Mile. Djay is supposed to come off as a good artist attempting to overcome insurmountable odds, yet his music is just average. On the other hand, there is so much more going on in this film that the music, it really plays a secondary role. Don't get me wrong it still has that Memphis feel to it, it just doesn't compare to 8 Mile's music. That said, it also points to the fact talent isn't always considered more than the actions you do and who you know. If you do a violent act, or have one happen to you that will get you noticed, the rap game will be faster to pick you up regardless. Overall this is a well-done flick and it gets my praises. 7/10</fullReview>

Good performances, a solid script, enjoyable music, and just the right amount of humor peppered throughout.DJay is a pimp and a drug dealer who begins to have a mid-life crisis. He's got his three Ho's, one is a stripper, one is pregnant, and the other is a country runaway. After hearing about a local rapper whose gone on to bigger and better things, Djay begins to reconnect with an old friend and his love of music.In the process he changes his attitudes, &amp; his views on life...channeling his newfound creative energy into his music.Terrence Howard as DJay gives an incredibly subtly yet powerful performance. This one drug dealing hustler that you will hate to love. But you will love him nonetheless. And that my friends...is what good acting is all about.All the supporting roles are fleshed out nicely and very well acted by the rest of the ensemble cast.This is a powerful and rewarding movie. Hustle on down and pick yourself up a copy. You wont regret it.Highly Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch this story FLOW</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember those classic hip-hop flicks back in the day like BOYZ N THE HOOD and MENACE II SOCIETY and how instrumental they were in showing the struggles of growing up in rural areas? Even though those classics and more recent hit's like 8 MILE are not for everyone, they offer up a good story to follow and enjoy. And that's really all you can ask for when watching a drama and reason why the new "indie" HUSTLE &amp; FLOW needs to be on every movie fan's radar. Because it's not just about the compelling story, as it's about life and how your dreams can be reached if you try hard enough. That underlying story is something we don't often see in movies over the summer and why this film should be praised now and during Oscar time.When it comes to rap music, there are a lot of things that need to take place, but if you have no rhythm, you have no song. In this story, all that rhythm flows through D Jay (Terrance Howard), as he throws out ideas upon ideas of lyrics for rap songs. But, just having talent isn't enough these days, especially for a guy who lives in the tough streets of Memphis. And for years, those ideas would be just that for D Jay, as he made his name as a local Pimp. But, when he ran into an old high school buddy Key (Anthony Anderson), a sound engineer that was also wanting to get back to his roots, a beautiful thing happened. Not only did the two agree to collaborate, but D Jay started to write all his "ideas" on a pad of paper and the next thing you know the two, along with Shelby (D.J. Qualls), a local musician with a beat machine, are making music. But, it wasn't just D Jay, Key and Shelby; they also enlisted the help of two of D Jay's women, Nola (Taryn Manning) and Shug (Taraji Henson), both of which that were more than willing to do "something" else, something that had some meaning to it. Having everything he needed, all that was left for D Jay was to hustle his way into the rap business, which you might expect was no walk in the park. But, for D Jay, it's not about how hard or easy it is to break into the rap scene as it was more about fulfilling that dream that no one said he could.I have to admit, when I first read or saw anything about HUSTLE &amp; FLOW, I had no idea who Terrance Howard was. Sure, I had seen him in a couple what I would call "B" movies, but never really knew what he was capable of on the movie screen. Well, now, not only do I know who Howard is, I know what he is capable of, plus some. It's been awhile since I have been blown away by a performance, but Howard did it and he did it without me expecting it. And when that happens, for some reason, it's just so much sweeter. His nonchalant nature makes everything he does on screen real, which allows the audience to believe and be a part of the emotion his character is going through, a characteristic worthy of Oscar praise. And that nature can't help but rub off on the rest of the cast, which included Taraji Henson, D.J. Qualls and Taryn Manning (8 MILE), who gave more than an admirable performance as Nola. But, then there was Anthony Anderson, who most people know as that "other" funny guy in recent comedies. Anderson (CRADLE 2 THE GRAVE, ROMEO MUST DIE), who makes his days now working on FX's THE SHIELD continues to show his dramatic talent, which is almost a blessing in disguise, considering just how stupid some of the comedies (KANGAROO JACK, SCARY MOVIE 3) he's been in were.It's been awhile since director John Singleton has graced us with this type of film, and although he was just the producer, I must say it was worth the wait. HUSTLE &amp; FLOW has everything in it that made previous Singleton films BOYZ N THE HOOD and HIGHER LEARNING so popular and loved, which is why first-time writer/director Craig Brewer deserves all the credit in this one. I don't know, when I think about stories like this, I think John Singleton has to be behind the camera, so for Brewer to be the director speaks volumes of how great of job he did. Like Spike Lee and John Singleton have done for years, Brewer was able to bring all that raw emotion into the story that you can't help but be a part of. And seeing this new Brewer/Singleton "joint" reminds me how much I miss movies like this and how I wish we had more of them throughout the year. It's films like HUSTLE &amp; FLOW that can't help but make you a fan over and over again.There's no doubt that most people won't see or even here about HUSTLE &amp; FLOW until it's too late, unless of course, it experiences some of that NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE "word of mouth" mojo. But, either way, this film is every aspect of quality and should be seen by anyone with a pulse. If it wasn't the tremendous performance by Terrance Howard, it was the raw shots of the streets of Memphis behind the story taking place all combining to make one of this year's best. After watching this film, you can't help but walk away from the theater singing "Whoop That Trick!" A</fullReview>

Watching him go through his everyday life made me want to open my arms and take him in. When he cried, I cried. When he got mad, I was mad.

		<fullReview>I think I saw Todd Hood (previous reviewer) (from Hawaii and a crack head) on dog the bounty hunter. I just cant remember if it was before or after I saw this movie. Apparently no one actually previews any of these reviews otherwise this never would have made it onto this site. There was barely any relevant information on the movie at all in this review. the only thing I can be sure of from reading this is Todd needs a job, and rehab!! The movie was enjoyable but nothing to write home about. Terrence Howard did an excellent job and was the primary reason I enjoyed the movie. Apparently I need to fill in one more line to get this onto the site so here it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shockingly awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not since "Daylight" and "John Q" have I been as offended by black stereotypes in the movies.The message is something about reaching for a dream. Even if you are a pimp who abuses, sells drugs and can't form a coherent sentence, you can have dreams. The portrayal of DJay by Terrence Howard is no better than your average SNL sketch- I can't believe the high regard the critics have for this film and the acting in it.We are meant to somehow empathize with the lead character even though he beats up a defenseless man, shoots another innocent man, and even when being led away by the police, he says nothing about taking care of the supposed woman who was closest to him- he only cares about the pad with his crappy lyrics on it. Ridiculous.The music(if you consider rap music) was annoying, repetitive, and completely unrealistic (gosh, that was the quickest voice lesson in history, given by a guy who doesn't even sing!). The writing and recording of the songs were the slowest parts(among many)of the film- thankfully the remote was nearby.Here's a good idea for a movie: an African American who is a politician overcomes deep prejudice in his own country to become President of the United States.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't see how it gets so much love. It wasn't a great movie at all. The acting was really not great or anywhere near perfect, and the script is so stupid and random. I hated this movie as a fact, but in all fairness, I suppose it's not the worst. It did entertain, I guess, and I loved Taryn Manning's character; If it wasn't for her this movie probably would've gotten a 1 from me. So, the rating is just ridiculous, and it's especially ridiculous that this filth won an Oscar, but I guess to each his own, or in my case her, so if you found it to be a good movie, that's fine with me. I just didn't take that much of a liking to it at all, and I don't think I ever will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted, but typical hip-hop movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I'm not really sure what I thought of this one. Normally, this is the kind of movie I wouldn't even look twice at on the shelf in Blockbuster, but I'm trying to take in as many Oscar nominated films as I can this year. Like I said, I'm not totally sure what I thought about it. Terrence Howard doesn't by any means deserve the Oscar, but he definitely earned the nomination. Very well acted on everyone's part, actually. However, many scenes were pretty uneven in parts. For example, the scene near the end where he was talking with Key. At first, it was a pretty tense scene, Key seemed pretty upset and almost hurt. But after the little flashback with Nola, they were both happy as a clam. That kind of thing happened a lot, but that's the best example. There was also a bit of unfinished business with certain characters. Lexus just disappeared about half way through, and while she wasn't a great character anyway, it would have been nice to know what happened to her. Overall, it was a well made, well acted movie, but if you normally wouldn't be interested in this type of flick, don't bother with it.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Believable as the Bush Administration's Reasons for Invading Iraq</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not to be outdone by Julia Roberts, Craig Brewer and his earnest cast led by Terrence Howard set out to prove that pimps, as well as whores, can have hearts of gold too. And despite the gritty 70s movie finish they spray over their film, "Hustle &amp; Flow" is about as grounded in reality as "Pretty Woman." Howard does a decent job, and anyone who's seen him in person knows how different he is, at least in his mannerisms and voice, from the character of DJ in the film. But he didn't really stand a chance when up against the ridiculous screenplay he and everyone else were forced to slog their way through. Howard's character, a small-time pimp stagnating in some Tennessee back water, who dreams of breaking out into the hip-hop world, felt about as authentic as the cartoon blacks Steven Spielberg created for "The Color Purple." There are some involving scenes built around DJ and his motley assortment of fellow music lovers creating their songs, and it's easy to be swept along in the funky rhythm of these moments. But the ghastly plot twists toward the end of the film that find DJ going to jail for injuring a thug in a shooting, and then finding stardom on the airwaves while he sits behind bars, surpassed mere over-earnestness and sailed headlong into plain stupidity. Are we really supposed to believe that just because DJ's hooker sidekick dropped some demos off at a couple of local radio stations that suddenly the whole world knows who he is? Or that prison guards are going to be handing him their own demos and seek his help in breaking into the music biz? Even Spielberg isn't that corny.And not since "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" assaulted our ears has a movie's theme song more quickly worn itself thin due to its sheer catchy repetitiveness.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Gentleman" makes a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He was looking for a break in the mid-1980s when he made his own luck and got on The Cosby Show. He played lowlifes and sidekicks until he made an impression in Dead Presidents and The Best Man. This led to intense performances in Crash and Ray in 2004. In Hustle &amp; Flow, he had a break-out performance as a two-bit pimp who wanted to be a rapper. The energy that Terrance Howard brought to this film was tight. He was back by great supporting performances by Anthony Anderson, Taryn Manning, Taraji P. Henson, and DJ Qualls. Howard just keeps getting better every time I see him. I am looking forward to seeing him again with Henson when I watch Four Brothers, and with Big Boi and André 3000 in Idlewild. Vanity Fair calls him "The Gentlemen," as they mark him among the fresh faces that rise above the current set of reigning stars. This will be Howard's year, and Hustle &amp; Flow marks him as the man to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HAIKU: Midlife crisis turns / Mediocre pimp into / A jail-house rapper FOUR PLUSES &amp; A NEGATIVE: 1) Oscar nominated performance by Terrence Howard. 2) Rousing rap music. 3) Reminded me in the end of "The Harder They Come." 4) Strong supporting cast. 5) Runtime of 116 minutes felt much longer.RANDOM THOUGHTS: I have to confess that I am not a Terrence Howard fan. As a Black Man, I am turned off by Black guys who "relax" their hair. I did like him in Crash, or at least the role he played, and the relaxed hair seemed to be part of the character making it less distracting. When I saw previews for Hustle &amp; Flow, not only was the relaxed hair there (which might be a pimp thing), but so was the thug talk, drug use, rap music, prostitution, etc. Nothing against that aspect of life, but it depresses me in reality, so I generally try to avoid it in film. However, having recently joined Netflix, I am going overboard with DVD rentals. Ultimately, I'm glad that I saw it and would recommend anyone who questions the Best Actor Oscar nomination to rent it and decide for themselves. If this movie were about 10 minutes shorter, I might have enjoyed it more and rated it higher!If you would like to read more of my haikus, visit my blog at richardwallenhaiku.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of a nobody, a nothing, daring to have a dream. Daring to aspire to be something more than what he is. More than what society says he'll always ever be. THAT is what Hustle &amp; Flow is. The main character is not perfect because life is not perfect. He's flawed. He's damaged goods. Just like the damn rest of us. But there is something deep within him. Something that wants more out of his life than to 'end up like this'. Gritty, emotional, sometimes hard-to-watch but always real, Hustle &amp; Flow captured the soul of the ghetto. That desperation for a better life that is intrinsic to all human beings. This film was awesome and Terrance Howard did an unbelievable job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Echoes of "Rocky" &amp; "Saturday Night Fever"; Howard is a galvanizing force to be reckoned with</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HUSTLE &amp; FLOW (2005) ***1/2 Terrence Howard, Anthony Anderson, Taryn Manning, Taraji P. Henson, Paula Jai Parker, Elise Neal, DJ Qualls, Ludicrous, Isaac Hayes. An amazing film-making debut by rookie Craig Bower focusing on a Southern pimp named Djay (a breakthrough defiantly brilliant performance by the immensely talented Howard that has Oscar written all over it) attempting to break away from his hedonistic lifestyle as a dealer and flesh peddler by becoming a rap artist with the unlikely help from an old high school buddy (Anderson in the best role of his career thus far too), an audio engineer who sees a spark within as well as the friend who has a glimmer of talent too; a white boy musician/techie (Qualls) with a knack for finding hooks, and his hookers Nola (a genuinely surprisingly good Manning), stripper Lexus (Parker) and the pregnant Shug (a heartbreakingly affective turn by the sweet soul of Henson and my pick for Best Supporting Actress) aiding their support and talents to live the dream of a better life. Howard truly is a galvanizing implosive power to be reckoned with and gives off a primal wave of desperation, moxie and genuine need to be a better human being. Echoes of "Rocky" and "Saturday Night Fever" underline the anti-hero's quest but some of the storyline could've used some tweaking especially the subplot involving the homeboy done good rap star played by rap star Ludicrous that borders caricature. Still undeniably affective even if you hate rap (like yours truly). Give it props peeps!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thuis picture is so good that I know that I will go see it again. Terrence Howard has given a performance that is worthy of an Oscar nomination. Many people are put off by the content of the movie but they should not be. It is really a movie about redemption, dreams, desire and hopes. The subject matter is only a vehicle for many of these universal themes. The characters are well portrayed and fleshed out beautifully. Although the choice of career is questionable to most of us, we must remember that choices are often foisted on us. It is the will to change the life we may have been led into that makes this a movie about the human spirit. In the end, although DJay is seemingly a user of women, he really does love the ones with whom he is involved. His rough demeanor is offset by his humanity, in the end. The ending is Hollywood but, in these times of terrorism and despair, it is uplifting to see something positive. Yes, the movie may not seem as if it can be positive but, in my opinion, it is.The other players in this movie are also well played. Anthony Anderson is consistently good at any role he takes on. DJ Qualls is right on as a white wannabee who is respectful of the art of rap and hip hop.The women, although seeming to be only part of the background, are what give this movie its substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the stereotypical story line, Hustle and Flow approaches this material in a fresh way with excellent performances by all of the actors - not just Terrence Howard. The cast in this movie takes control of roles that accounted for almost 100% of what black actors were offered in the 70's and subsequent decades. The Manhattan theater I was in was packed, without one empty seat. The performances were true and deep and the audience was completely absorbed. I am glad this movie got the $2.8 million production money it needed to be made right. I saw The Island the next day and was glad that "Hustle" gave me at least one satisfying movie experience for the weekend. Do not let the storyline put you off, this is a movie worth watching.

There were people in the movie theater, at which I saw this film, that had interesting reactions. Several people were expecting a "movie" that was basically an extended rap video. If that's what you're looking for (50 cent fans), you will not find it here. This is a "film". Art. Truth. Maturity. The medium was definitely respected.

		<fullReview>I really thought this movie was excellent, if not one of the best I've seen this year. Great story, very inspirational to the "little guy with a big dream". I've been a fan of Terrance Howard for years and am very happy to see him finally get the spotlight he should have had a long time ago. Why he hasn't is beyond me. He's got the talent in bucketfuls and has a great yet unique look. Before I knew his name, I used to call him the "really good black guy with the green eyes" that was in so many films and the occasional music video. Taryn Manning also really helped make this movie for me as the lovable hooker with a sweet heart. One thing I appreciated - that usually drives me nuts - is that you really got to know and CARE about all the characters. You know how they met, why, what their dreams were and you cared to see them achieve it. The entire audience was laughing, gasping or sucking in their breaths during the film and it's just a shame I had to drive so far to see it. It's not playing in any of the theaters around my house...but I'm OK to get in the car for something good. Did it for Layer Cake, too. Anyway, no spoilers here...just a great film (Singleton can't make anything bad) that was a real inspiration. Speaking of real, I'm glad he kept it real with the Skinny Black/bathroom scene and didn't "Hollywood" ending it. That's exactly what usually happens in that situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not get blown away like this often, but Hustle &amp; Flow is a perfect piece of cinema. Don't shy away from this one because there are pimps, drugs, hookers, and strippers. Terrence Howard is the soul of Hustle &amp; Flow, and his portrayal of a Memphis pimp who discovers a passion for rapping is Oscar worthy. Every character is dead-on believable and every word spoken is poetry. I don't care if they're being stupid, funny, gritty, sarcastic, or violent, every ounce of this dialogue is delicious.Describing the downside of his job to a prostitute named Nola (Taryn Manning), Shelby (DJ Qualls), a vending machine stuffer, says, "I always smell like sticky buns and Skittles." The hooker replies, "Wow, and I thought my job sucked." That's just funny! The whole movie, though, isn't so light-hearted. The drama definitely knocks you down, but the music keeps you going. I usually don't even like rap music, but I loved the music in Hustle &amp; Flow because I understand where it comes from, and I care about these characters. In a summer full of uninspiring remakes, this movie reminds me that creativity and brilliance is still alive and well...if not in Hollywood, then at least in Memphis!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dream Deferred</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Craig Brewer summed it up here:"For many of us, creative expression and collaboration with others is nothing new. But we must never forget that there are many in this world who've never been asked to express themselves with movement or words or paint.Regardless of our given circumstances, we are all entitled to contribute a verse. It is our right as human beings. A right that belongs to you, to me, and to a country stripper named Tequila." - from Landmark Theatres newsletterHustle &amp; Flow was very much about pimps, tricks, and hoes, about the down-on-their-luck folks and the dreams that often lay dormant...deferred. Langston Hughes once wrote"What happens to a dream deferred?Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore-- And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over-- like a syrupy sweet?Maybe it just sags like a heavy load.Or does it explode?"In Hustle &amp; Flow, DJay ponders this question and soon he discovers the answer and it's not a happy ending. That would have been too Hollywood, to end of the rainbow and not the point. The question, "What happens to a dream deferred?" appears to be answered with nothing but more questions. But take the time to analyze each question and you'll get an idea of what Hughes and DJay really believes about dreams being postponed. The "dream" is a goal in life. Hughes position is clear that any important dream or goal that must be delayed can have serious negative affects. As DJay ponders the question we find out what those affects are. Like Hughes' poem, Hustle &amp; Flow offers a possibility of each negative affect. The dream or life goal of a human being is central to what makes the human a valuable member of society, but suppose that person with the dream is told he cannot fulfill his goal just yet...it's a cycle of self-fulfilling prophecies.I thought that the writing in Hustle &amp; Flow was inspiring and the acting well done. I've been to Memphis and other cities like Cleveland, Louisville, St. Louis. I have relatives who are living in the same conditions as what people see on screen. Like DJay they all ponder the question: What happens to a dream deferred? Hustle &amp; Flow shows us that having to postpone one's deepest desires can lead to destruction.</fullReview>

Here he burns through the screen, with the intensity of a young Al Pacino. It's a very sweet film (but still macho and gritty for all the guys out there). You rarely see such a detailed, sympathetic portrayal of an "alternative family" formation such as this - here it's a pimp and his current and former girls, who live together and support each other. Also unusual is the detailed depiction of the creative process of rap music - the writing, the layering of the beats, the recording.

		<fullReview>This film - intended to be a character study of a pimp who has a dream of becoming a rapper, and the prostitutes who live with him in Memphis, TN - could have been powerfully rendered with sensitivity and realism. Instead it was filled with clichés, weak dialog, and the overall aura of an ABC After School Special. The cinematography is also sub-par: there's not even a visual aspect to cling to in this middle-brow mess.As a person who grew up in the South and who has actually been to Tennesee on many occasions, I absolutely do not agree with the opinion that this movie accurately depicts Memphis.This movie glorifies stupidity and mediocrity, not only in it's subject matter but in the manner in which the film was executed. While some of the music is excellent, the rap "hit" (Whoop That Trick) at the core of the plot is generic, the beats overly simple, and the lyrics could have been written by anyone lacking talent.In conclusion, "Hustle and Flow" screams "made for television."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't feel the same way towards this movie as many of the other positive reviewers. I thought it was a pretty weak movie. It just dragged on. Yes the actors are good, definitely, but the story itself was just silly to me. Yes, I like some of the points being made in the story, but the story as a whole was empty to me and useless.Although there seems to be a decent metaphor about coming up, why choose a pimp trying to become a rapper to embellish coming up? It just doesn't work for me.The movie was a little dry and straightforward. If a movie will be that way I think there should have been more interesting dialogue and scenes. Most of it was empty, except a couple of scenes.For example, when the prostitute comes out of the music shop and tells Djay she is sick and tired of not having a say about things was one of the most interesting scenes to me. Have more scenes like that, especially in such a silly movie!Terence Howard is a great actor though. Ludicrous did good in "Crash," but I think he looked funny in this role.I think John Singleton can direct better movies than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the story of DJay, a pimp and drug dealer. (Played by the versatile Terrence Dashon Howard.) This movie doesn't glorify his life; far from it. His whores are worn out and unglamorous, and his drug trade brings him no prosperity.One day, on a drug delivery to a regular customer, DJay discovers that a local rapper named Skinny Black who made the national scene is coming back to the old neighborhood to celebrate the fourth of July. Skinny Black is played by Ludicrous.DJay remembers Skinny Black's humble beginnings and his own days as an amateur deejay and rapper. DJay believes that if Skinny can make out of Memphis, he can too. And so the quest begins. DJay turns his attention to making a rap recording that Skinny Black will hear and thus get the break that will take him off the streets.DJay is aided in this endeavor by an old acquaintance named Key (Anthony Anderson, who does some nice, understated work here) who works as an audio technician, recording high school concerts and court depositions. Key makes a living at what he does, after a fashion (just like DJay), but his middle-class lifestyle is no more satisfying to him than DJay's pimping is to DJay. They are joined by Shelby, a guy who knows a little about audio production and supports himself with a job filling vending machines.There are a few subplots involving DJay and his whores. One works as an exotic dancer, another is too pregnant to turn tricks, and the third rides around in D-Jay's beat up old car tricking at $20 a pop. Shug, the mother, just may be the love of DJay's life if he could afford such a luxury. She is the most supportive of DJay and his schemes and even helps lay down a track for the recording.In the course of this movie, DJay actually becomes an Everyman of sorts. I know nothing at all about rap and care for it even less, but I certainly have felt the same way DJay, Shelby and the others feel. They want to rise above their station for a while. They want a moment when someone looks at them and doesn't see a pimp, a whore, a vending machine filler or the guy who pushes buttons on a tape recorder.They want to be seen, for one moment, as artists. As someone who has done something bigger with their lives than they have ever done before. And in this struggle, DJay ? pimp, thief, drug dealer, thug, loser ? becomes heroic and even noble.I can't tell you exactly when it happened, but there was a moment in the movie I started to get restless. Not because I didn't like it, or that I was bored, but I actively wanted the same thing that DJay wanted. My wife asked me if I was all right, and I told her that the characters were getting under my skin. I was itching for DJay to win.Hustle And Flow is a well-written, well-acted movie. I was sure that I would be able to predict the ending, but I was wrong. It is entertaining, and fun (sort of) and tragic and triumphant in unexpected ways. And it's got a killer score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hustle and Flow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Hustle and Flow is great. I really enjoyed it. While watching the movies all my emotions were touched, the acting was some of the best. I don't go see a movie twice, but I have plans to go back and see Hustle and Flow again. The first time I saw Hustle and Flow I went to the movie by myself. I'm going back to see it again, this time with a friend. When I walked out of the movie I found myself humming...It's hard for a Pimp out here...........I was digging into my handbag for my cell before I could get into my hard...calling friends and telling they need to see the picture. I think one of the reasons I liked it some much is that most blacks know someone that could be the characters in the picture. As I sat there watching it took me on a trip down memory line. No I didn't live the life style of those in the movie but It was all around me in the community and as it was then, so it still is; but to see "DeJay" rise above it all I think can be a positive image for the young folk of today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining Hip Hop Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hustle &amp; Flow" shows the power of ambitious arts expression among poor and working class folks that recalls "Billy Elliott" and "The Commitments" though crossed with "Rize" and "Glengarry Glen Ross" as these characters are more Mamet-ish than "The Full Monty." The initiating plot device of a home town success's return as a networking aim or a big audition has been done before, including in showing how a community or faux family bands together to support the aspirant, but writer/director Craig Brewer showcases some original elements, especially in the ironic conclusion.Brewer is helped enormously, beyond some of the stereotyped, if very funny, language in the script, by the heartfelt cast. The film belongs to Terrence Dashon Howard, from the opening focus on his mouth, and he is electric in conveying "DJay"s calculating and changing moods, from salesman to paternal partner to artist to enforcer.Anthony Anderson well plays a very different hard-working, a bit hen-pecked if loving husband, than his gang leader in "The Shield" but is positively charming.Ludicrous has to play a bit more of stereotype, as a gold-toothed rapper, than his low level criminal in "Crash," but is quite good.While the women characters are considerably problematical as to why they are even with these guys except for being dumb or some possible abuse in their backgrounds that has led to their lack of self-esteem and/or drug addiction (including in their self-denying appearances as the black women have hair straightened or died blonde and a blonde with hair extensions) despite some occasional signs of rebellion, the actresses surmount that to create very individual people with burgeoning hopes of their own, as they hesitantly are drawn into "DJay"s fantasy, including one's role as "principal investor." The cooperative artistic creation process is among the best scenes in the film, even if has an updated Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland "Let's put on a show!" feel.Dedicated to the late Sam Phillips, the founder of Sun Records, and co-starring legendary songwriter Isaac Hayes, the film portrays a bit of a fantasy of a cross-section of the Memphis African-American community from the '50's to the present in its diverse musical soundtrack and look, even as it finally recognizes that times have changed, from musical equipment technology and air-conditioning to showing that the cops and prison guards are also black. It is kind of wistful to think a jheri-curled, rapping pimp would have a blues station button set on his radio, consider Otis Redding his singing idol, cry at gospel in church, as the hip hop culture isn't usually so old school, not to mention the odd boast that hip hop originated in the South, especially as the final catchy product sounds like last year's summer, Bronx-created hit "Lean Back," even if the language still won't get it radio play. Memphis, though, is so evocative of music, that almost every shot recalls its history, like the bridge that overlooks where Jeff Buckley drowned. Without quoting Langston Hughes, certainly all these characters are haunted by the theme of "What happens to a dream deferred?" even if hip hop culture isn't quite the Harlem Renaissance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved it. It wasn't just about hip hop. It was about someone finding who you are and working for your dreams. Terrence D. Howard was very impressive. He showed the emotion that's rarely depicted of a pimp, hustler, or rapper for that matter. Hopefully this is the type of role that can propel Terrence into bigger roles , just as Collateral &amp; Ray did for Jamie Foxx. Hollywood need these actors.Also as a hip hop lover it was cool to see the sound &amp; way of life of the 'Dirty South". As a East coaster from NY that was a first where the Southern hood is represented well. I thought Taryn Manning, Anthony Anderson, &amp; Ike Hayes were exceptional performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>improbable dreamers, impossible dreams, real inspiration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Everybody gotta have a dream." That such a banal statement at face value can come to mean something far more profound and inspiring is reflective of the feat writer-director Craig Brewer achieves with HUSTLE &amp; FLOW. In fact, the title pretty well sums up the contradictions that he somehow makes fully functional in his Sundance sensation: taking ideas and material that seem rather forced and contrived on paper and make them flow into a naturally cohesive, rousing, and surprisingly moving whole.The premise sounds easily dismissible, almost like knowingly preposterous groundwork for parody. A Memphis pimp named DJay (Terrence Howard) in a midlife crisis decides to take up rapping when he happens into the possession of an old Casio keyboard. The plot machinations of the early going do feel like just that as so many things seem to magically fall into place for DJay's transformation--the keyboard; a spontaneous run-in with Key (Anthony Anderson), an old acquaintance and sound engineer who then takes him to a soul-stirring church choir performance--in an almost implausibly pat manner. But from the outset, Brewer holds the trump card--namely, Howard, who lends legitimacy to the character and story from frame one. This marks reliable veteran Howard's first big-league lead, but he wholly disappears into the role of DJay with the chameleonic immersion of a character actor; if the plot circumstances surrounding him initially come off as a bit much, Howard's DJay never comes off as any less than real: his frustration, his desperation, his stalwart ambition.And that's what ultimately drives HUSTLE &amp; FLOW--those genuine, universal vulnerabilities and yearnings for something bigger and better than the hand one is dealt. If the circumstances setting DJay off on his journey do feel a bit rushed, it pays off in that Brewer is then quickly liberated for the rest of the run time to flesh out not only DJay's pursuit of his goal but also the dreams of those around him. Everybody gotta have a dream, and as it comes clear, everyone in DJay's world has one, spoken or unspoken, earth-shattering or modest. Key has designs on being a big-time producer; DJay's main moneymaker Nola's (Taryn Manning) wants to make things happen for herself for once. While those read as typical movie goals--though in execution they certainly do not--Brewer goes the extra mile in painting the whole spectrum of dreams; resonating particularly poignantly is DJay's pregnant girl Shug (an astonishingly unrecognizable Taraji P. Henson in a revelatory performance), for whom singing the hook on a demo track is far more than anything she could have ever thought to achieve in her downtrodden world.Such authentic grit and grime also lends HUSTLE &amp; FLOW's tale of improbable dreamers dreaming impossible dreams extra weight. Never once to we get the sense that DJay's world is a glossed-over movie version of the grimy Memphis underbelly. Brewer, operating from the old school, down-and-dirty mind of '70s cinema, admirably doesn't pretty anything up, from the sweaty humidity and the lived-in homes, and the scene is made all the more unforgiving by the grainy 16mm photography by Amy Vincent. Above all, though, is the acute awareness of the surroundings given off by the characters; whether blatantly through dialogue (as in the case of Nola's character in one pivotal scene) or simply the weary looks in their eyes.Thus when DJay and his crew lay down their demo tracks in his makeshift recording studio, the sense of hope that comes over them is all the more startling and piercing. Not only is DJay's music genuinely catchy, they convincingly emerge from his life and experiences, and that added cathartic weight justifies DJay's life-or-death drive to get a demo to big-time rapper Skinny Black (Ludacris)--not to mention makes his palpable joy when making music all the more infectious. In a world where dreams appear synonymous with futility, one can strongly feel the weight of many hopes and dreams behind each note, each beat. Young or old, hip-hop fan or not, DJay's raps become the voice of anyone who's ever dared to think larger than who they are.So goes Craig Brewer's hustle and flow in HUSTLE &amp; FLOW--while never sacrificing any of the hard-knock authenticity and specificity of his characters and their milieu, he has crafted a deeply felt film that can speak to and empower just about any audience. Everybody indeed gotta have a dream, and ultimately the dream is the same for everyone, whether a pimp in Memphis or a moviegoer in a multiplex: we're all waiting for our own Casio keyboard to fall into our lap and set us on our path.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in LA at a special screening. This movie is very, very good. I'm going to go again when it is released. A great movie makes you feel a connection with the characters even when they are very different from you. I felt this connection with the characters in this film. Even though this film is about a pimp and his hos and his dream it feels relative to the audience because we all have our own dreams, we all have been in a rut that we have desperately wanted out of and this film communicates these feelings in a truly original manner.The actors all performed superbly and the Memphis mannerisms and music were right on target. There are a lot of expletives used towards women but I was not offended by it because of the fact that this film successfully immerses the audience member into the subculture that it is attempting to unveil. This film was emotional and funny in all the right places. Terrence Howard performed exceptionally and so did Anthony Andersen. I believe he is a very talented actor and I hope that he can successfully make the transition from comedy into more dramatic roles faster than actors like Jamie Foxx. He did a great job in this movie. The two main white characters in this film also were not cheap props put there just to be laughed at in a film of mostly black characters. They both had substance and made smart remarks. I respect that. Overall this movie was well written and well acted. I hope the subject matter doesn't deter moviegoers from seeing it because they would be missing out on a great film.P.S. I wouldn't take my kids to this film. This is definitely a movie for adults although there are no real sex scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>kind of a surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a person who listens to all kinds of music I was interested in this film. I was surprised by it. Perhaps I shouldn't have expected it to be anything special. Rap lines like 'it's hard out here for a pimp' don't quality as anything in my book. To me that sounds the same as 'it's hard to be stupid.' I like Run DMC and a few others, who I feel have some artistic credibility, but I think this movie does significant damage to the idea of rap as notable street poetry. I feel this film makes rapers look like they all have their heads on backwards, which I think is not always the case. Coming nowhere near the stinging social commentary of an Ice-T, this film is sly reductionism rather than entertainment or enlightenment. In a world that turns out hundreds of films a year it really should not surprise me that something like this came along. Given enough time just about every point of view gets represented,unfortunately.</fullReview>

This film took me for a complete surprise because we've seen this type of character and film so many times before but this film here doesn't fall into the same clichés and in the end this comes out as a complete and totally original film in all its ideas and messages. After seeing him in Crash and now this, Howard has became an actor I'll certainly follow more closely in the future. The supporting cast is equally great and I'm a bit shocked this thing didn't get more than the Best Actor nomination at the Oscars. This is certainly one of the best films of 2005, if not the best.</fullReview>

The soundtrack is as dirty and gritty as the characters and story from the film.Despite the film's clichés, despite the difficulty in feeling affection for a repulsive pimp ... this is an oddly compelling, very watchable film. The pimp's "meeting" with famed rap artist "Skinny Black" is a scene that will go down as one of the most memorable in cinematic history.And you do end up feeling affection for the pimp.

		<shortDescription>Why do so many people praise this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films like "Million Dollar Baby" where people ask you if you "have seen it YET", like everyone should be mandated to see it. There is another element similar to "Requiem for a Dream" or "Fight Club" where its COOL to see this film because its fresh and bleeding edge. It really does not fulfill either of these categories. Its made by MTV, and it feels like it was made by a typical MTV viewer. The acting was mediocre and the script was filled with melodramatic, stereotyped mush that made watching it really sour. The music wasn't good, the message wasn't good, and the aesthetics were nothing exceptional. This film is some young, inexperienced director's masturbatory work. He did not have an objective when he began making this film, and he definitely did not end up with one. Seriosuly, the message is "If you try hard enough, you can achieve anything!" My mom used to tell me that until I was like 4 when she decided that it is better for me to know how the real world works, and not remain in some fantasy world for the rest of my life. This guy is a pimp and a drug dealer. He is a bad human being. I am sick of praising people in films who live off of other peoples misery. Johnny Depp in "Blow"? Aww we are sad that you can't see your daughter again. No. You provided most of the cocaine that was snorted during the 70's. Who cares if you can't see your daughter again. They are keeping her away from you because YOU ARE A ROTTEN HUMAN BEING. Same concept here. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

In short, you can't go a minute without the f word being used. It's utterly disgusting.The premise that this ghetto hustler wants a career in rap music is interesting but the film soon deteriorates into a cliché molden atmosphere of the deprivation of his people.Howard's unfortunate meeting with a rap mogul leads to tragedy, but are we really expected to think that this must be the way of ghetto life?This is not the life of Van Gogh. The latter achieved stardom after he killed himself. Dee Jay makes the grade but is in prison for murder. Perhaps, the writing should have been smoked out as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You know, it's hard out there for a pimp.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't say that a movie about pimps and Ho's is exactly my favorite kind of entertainment, but if it had been, this is a superb pimp and ho movie. Set in N. Memphis, it takes us right into that world, and why people stay in those "jobs." I even began to like 'rap' a bit after seeing it. At least I had a better appreciation for how it is created, when a good part of the middle was spent on how they put together that mesmerizing song, "You know it's hard out there for a pimp."Terrence Howard was nominated for Best Actor, for his role as Djay. I have been a fan of Howard's since I fist saw him in "The Best Man", and wished he had played Ali, instead of Will Smith. I also wish Howard had been awarded Best Actor, because in my mind he won it with this gripping performance as a pimp who didn't really want to do that for the rest of his life. As well as his bottom ho.At best, Djay was a small time pimp, riding around and parking with his cute and tiny ho Nola (superbly played by Taryn Manning). He would drum up business $20 at a time, and back at the apartment had a pregnant ho Shug (Taraji Henson) that couldn't work right then. As hard as Djay appeared on the outside, there was an inner tenderness inside that had him taking care of Shug. And, when Nola said she wanted to do something better, but didn't know what, Djay didn't slap her around, instead asked her what she wanted to do. Also, when Djay and Nola happened in on a recording session inside a church, we see a big tear stream down Djay's face. A gentle man seemingly trapped inside his job as a pimp and minor drug dealer.But Djay had a bigger vision, and it was rap. With the help of his friend, who was a recording specialist, he wrote some lyrics and made a demo tape. Needing a 'hook', his pregnant girl Shug sang the background chorus. But all didn't go smoothly, the microphone was cheap and distorted his sound, so they had to find a better one. Again, Nola came in handy, to get the pawn shop owner to cut Djay a deal, but Nola hated being used that way.Rapper Ludicrous plays a famous rapper and former N. Memphis resident Skinny Black, who now had become a record mogul and was back visiting for July 4th. Djay figured that if he could get close to Skinny, have him play the demo, he would get onto the radio and his career jump-started. But it didn't quite work out that way, but you have to admire the hustle that Djay put on. All in all an excellent movie about a very unattractive subject. It is a story about redemption, even if it is not all the way back to respectability. And Howard's performance alone is a reason to see it.MAJOR SPOILERS. When Djay goes to the men's room and finds Skinny passed out on the floor, he first tries to help him to the toilet, then realizes Skinny threw the demo tape into the toilet. Angry, Djay began to beat him about the face, when one of Skinny's handlers came in, drew a gun, Djay got Skinny's gun, wounded one man, managed to get out of the nightclub, but the police were waiting when he got home. While being arrested he told Nola to take the demo tapes and get them played. She was "in charge." Convicted, Djay spent a year in prison, but became known for his song. Nola had found her "other" career, she had dressed up in a smart but short business suit, and marketed his tape, and his career was waiting for him as he left prison. I suppose, as long as Skinny's guys weren't waiting for him!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pimp movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hustle and Flow is the movie that Master P and all other gangster rappers turned movie moguls wish they could make. The movie tells the story of a pimp named DJay (Terence Howard) who begins to question the meaning of his life and turns to music to express the emotions he's kept bottled up his whole life (you know, that old story). A chance encounter with Key (Anthony Anderson) begins his journey into the rap game. Don't expect Anderson to be the comic relief of the movie as he puts in a brilliant performance as DJay's producer. DJ Qualls adds not only some comic relief, but does an excellent job portraying the keyboardist of the group, Shelby. Taryn Manning gives a memorable performance as the dim-witted southern girl, Nola, who is DJay's main source of income. Showing the human side of the pimp game, the movie involves real emotions in an occupation that has been, sadly, glamorized in countless rap songs. This movie is a far cry from the blaxploitation movie of the seventies as DJay is not portrayed as some one dimensional pimp and/or badass, but a man who struggles emotionally to understand his own life. Terence Howard gives an amazing, memorable performance in this role.Watching DJay, Key, and Shelby create their first rap song is an excellent scene that reminds one of the studio sessions in the movie Ray (a must-see). On the surface gangster rap and jazz seem like two completely different genres of music, but (as expounded by Shelby in the movie) the two genres actually include many of the same musical elements. Much of today's gangster rap has devolved into commercial, cliché garbage. The movie gives a sense of origin to gangster rap, and in doing so adds legitimacy to the genre that's never been seen before. Ludicrous's casting as the generic, commercial gangster rapper, Skinny Black, is brilliant, because that is exactly what Ludicrous is. Craig Brewer (the director) has not created another 8 Mile, but something better that revitalizes southern gangster rap and shows the real life side to being a pimp. Now, if pimping and gangster rap sound unappealing, definitely go see this movie as it depicts those two things with such humanity that previous stereotypes will slowly dissolve as the movie progresses. Fans of gangster rap will definitely enjoy the soundtrack, while those "hataz" of the genre will appreciate the music in the context of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess those of you dogging this movie wanted some big budget overdone film. Well that was not the intention of this movie. The look &amp; feel of this film is exactly what its supposed to be. Maybe some of you don't know about the hood so you can't relate. Guess what, there are people living just like that, more than you know and maybe, just maybe, they appreciate their lives being reflected sometimes. People who live in the hoods look at things opposite... they see the Cosby Show or movies with well to do black families &amp; you know what they say..."that ain't real, regular black folks don't live like that... they may not have had the opportunity to see &amp; know anything more than what they know. They may think only celebrities or doctors/lawyers can live like that. That's why so many young folks from these hoods aspire to be a rapper or look to make fast money w/drug dealing or working in the strip clubs. There are hundreds of rundown neighborhoods with pimps, drug-dealers &amp; prostitutes trying to hustle on the streets to pay their rent. No its not pretty but it exists. This movie isn't far-fetched, for many its a reality. Any of you ever been to the booty-clubs... yes many strippers do turn tricks... prostitution is still rampant &amp; ho's still get pimped. Guess what, most pimps aren't nice, some are abusive, that's how they feel like they "keep they ho's in check". There are pimps who will put a ho out in the street with a baby. She is money to them, nothing more. For those, "oh, this movie is stereotyping black people" get a grip. Be confident in your race &amp; who you are. No movie can put us all in 1 category; blacks are a diverse people in every way. Be real, such places &amp; people do exist. People trying' to get over, broads taking the easy route out to make a living(take care of kids), folks out there hustling daily trying to get by. Sorry, everyone isn't a hard-working American. Many people don't have a lot of privilege &amp; opportunity so they do what they know, and all they know is the streets. I'm not glorifying it but it's what is real. Are you all living in fantasy land? Stop acting like this stuff doesn't happen, like these "hoods" don't exist. Be real, be OK with both sides being reflected; everything about blacks don't need to be like the Cosby Show. It's real, it happens so get over it. Are some of you mad because the rest of the world can see it. They can see it on the news plenty (like w/Katrina). Guess what, there are "white" hoods too, trailer parks... whites who grow up in black hoods speak &amp; dress like what they're used to being around. In 8-mile, Eminem grew up in the hood. On the O.C. Ryan is from Chino. Yet no one gets mad with those portrayals. Did you ever think these movies are made because these places exist? People live in old beat up neighborhoods w/broke down homes getting by the best way they know how? Rappers write lyrics about what they were exposed to growing up in the hood. Do you think it's just fairytale? No it exists all over this nation! How many rappers go to jail yet still sell albums &amp; make money? Those 'lil hole in the wall clubs exist. Fights &amp; shoot outs do happen at clubs, drive bys, etc. Some guys still have permed hair dos. Some white girls do wear black hair styles. People do have golds &amp; grills. I've seen it all and so have many of you. For those who haven't, maybe you need to leave your little comfy nests and take a ride over to the hood in your town. Every city has 1,2,3?5,6,10?. To the "Dr." who is going on about her biracial son going to a "white elite" school, that is information you should've kept to yourself. Who cares? If that's where you choose to send him, fine. But instead of trying to shield him from it all, maybe you should let him know the truth which is there are many people living out there in these hoods, dirt poor, some work hard, others "hustle" to get by because that's all they know, and it just ain't black folks. Let him see some of those movies with "your race" (as you stated) seen living in trailer parks or 'lil run down back in the woods country towns. Those exist too. Then let him know that is why he should take full advantage of all the opportunities he has because everyone doesn't get them. For those of you who may think I'm black... I may not be; it shouldn't matter, what's real is real. Keep your kids away from this movie, its not meant for them. "Rate R" has a meaning. BTW, did some of you even watch this movie? He didn't live w/his girlfriend, she was not carrying his baby. She was just like the rest of the girls, he was her pimp, she got pregnant by one of the tricks she turned so he let her "stop working". She was just very supportive of him &amp; his dream; that's why he grew close to her in that manner. He did not slap her to get her to sing, he popped her on the butt. Pay attention, then maybe some of you could like this film as much as the rest of us did. For the rest who don't mind seeing people being reflected in lower socio-economic circumstances, go see this movie... you will enjoy it. Terrence Howard gives his break-through performance. This movie wasn't low-budget. You are supposed to feel like you are seeing their circumstances &amp; "the hood they live in". It was what it was supposed to be so take it for what it was.</fullReview>

Most rappers have served time in some form or another--jail or government housing projects / welfare. And remember that the truest "gangstas" are dead. Unfortunately, this country was built on the backs of Mexicans, Chinese, Filipinos, Italians, and specifically Blacks. Regretfully, Blacks continue to get the scraps off the government, corporate, and academic plates. Many rappers have not sought upper levels of education, but still manage to reach white kids in Iowa and Utah--that's power. Many of these same children can't tell you who the Vice-President is, but they know 50 Cent's whole life history and want to be like him. The premise of this movie is pretty solid. If you laughed at the suggestions in this movie you don't FEEL the pain coming out of hip-hop. Regretfully, you think that life is fair in America too. If you feel embarrassed, like some that posted on this site, then hold your head high. What African-Americans feel embarrassed about is the fact that this tale is more truth than fallacy. Don't worry this movie is just holding a mirror to the American face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Characters Were Total Jerks In This Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrance Dashon Howard was a hateful pimp who treated women like dogs. He treated the token white girl like dirt! He threw Paula Jai Parker and a crying baby out on the streets in the middle of the night! He slapped a pregnant Taraji Henson for not singing as well as she could have! Elise Neal was trying not to act black in this movie. Anthony Anderson couldn't be in the movie for 5 minutes without acting stupid like he does in all of his movies. And he was a hypocrite. He played gospel music in church and profanity music at home. Terrance's character DJay shouldn't have kissed up to Ludicrous' character. But he needed to beat him up for putting his demo tape in the toilet stool. How did DJay's demo get played on the radio even though he was in jail for whipping Ludicrous' character?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's a great hero we have here..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot imagine how one can see this movie and not be completely disgusted with the main character, DJay: A drug-dealer, a pimp, heartless and a liar, with childish allures and incapable of self-control. He does not deserve a shred of sympathy, yet the movie at the same time tries to depict him as somebody to look up to; a true hero of the underclass who fights himself to the top. But with what means! This movie perpetuates negative stereotypes, and while some of it surely reflects the grim reality, I don't think things should be treated this way in a movie (which might just possibly have an influence on people - especially minors - viewing it). Most of DJay's actions remain without consequence, in fact even the brutal beating and shooting he goes to prison for is only a means to complete the image of a typical gangster rapper, the missing puzzle piece for his success.Even if you are talented, you can still be a bad person. Why should we cherish this talented (well, he can rap) criminal? I would much more have liked to see the struggle of a talented and yet good-natured person to escape from his circumstances, using hard work and perseverance (DJay uses other persons - a lot).In other aspects the movie is just average, maybe a bit too slow-paced even for a drama. The characters look and act authentic, and on the whole the atmosphere is portrayed well. But this is not the real world, and while some may climb the ladder to success by stepping on others like DJay, most do it using their talent and hard work, like Isaac Hayes, who has a guest-appearance in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the acting here is great. The main characters are very charming, and the viewer wants to support them. But, remember, the hero here makes his living selling teenage girls. Moving from selling girls to singing about selling girls is an improvement, but still hardly noble.The word "pimp" is commonplace today. MTV, for example, has shows with the word in the title. And these are not shows warning girls away from pimps. Instead, they are about cars and materials things. "Pimp" is undergoing one hell of a PR spin these days. Hustle and Flow aids in this. Remember, pimps are not heroes. They are amongst the lowest forms of scumbags. And we certainly don't want a film showing the world of prostitution as heroic or a way to get a record deal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the DVD extra making of, you find out every studio passed on it till John Singleton decided to finance on his own. Well, those studios for once were right. This "pimp" never shows any musical talent, nor a Dream to be involved in the music industry at all-then Wa-laa, he has a burning desire to start spitting, and the world needs to listen. And somehow, this has been a lifelong dream? Its more like his life long dream has been to make money by any means necessary, so I guess becoming a rapper fulfills that dream in a way. This main character isn't anyone of any morals or ethics, his one admirable quality is that he allows a pregnant whore to stay at his crib, wow, this guy is my kinda guy. And in the making of extra, the cast and crew treat this piece of garbage like it was the most important film ever made-and a story that HAD to be told. God help us.</fullReview>

The worst part of this movie was the fact that Terrence Howard could NOT play a black man, and he invented a new word which he used for EVERY OTHER WORD: "mein" which I guess means man. And how old is this guy, it was so unbelievable that anyone would want to hear a washed up pimps songs on a tape!

		<fullReview>Hustle and Flow was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was so bad that I registered on IMDb just to counteract the overly-positive review posted for it. The premise and plot were feasible, especially since it's a poor man's Get Rich or Die Trying.I didn't like the character's name: D Jay is a stupid name for someone who used to be a DJ.People laughed at Howard's portrayal of D Jay. (Maybe it was the hair?) He's not bad enough to be a pimp. The dialogue was wooden and trite. Brewer needed to hire a screenwriter. The songs were okay. I thought they were going to be worse. Don't be a fool like me. Don't waste your money on this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This afternoon I saw Hustle &amp; Flow at my friend Mara's house. I had heard about the film, and I remembered the ads when it came out in theaters, but I hadn't seen it. Also, I just heard that Terrence Howard has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, so I was curious to see his performance. He's the best thing about the movie, by far. The actresses are pretty good, too -- Taryn Manning, wow, and Elise Neal and Taraji Henson. Oh, and Ludicrous should be up for Best Supporting Actor for his performance (he's not). As far as the plot goes, though, without giving away any secrets, I'll just say: It had me, and then it lost me, and then it had me again, and then it lost me for good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that this movie held the attention and empathy of a middle class white person throughout tells you it was very artistically done. The movie actually has character development even of street hookers and a pimp. You don't necessarily sympathize them them but you sure can empathize with people going through midlife re-considerations. The cast is great. Very realistic and heartfelt acting. The direction has a light touch but is very mature and sure. The music is great, especially the hook they record for one of the pimp's demo songs in the studio. The little white hooker is a bit of an enigma, which is as it should be. Overall this unlikely film is one of the year's best. It puts dumb big budget Hollywood flicks to shame with the quality of the script and the casting and acting. Plus it is just plain entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>living the dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost walked out of this movie a couple of times but am glad that I stuck it out. This is a cut or two above the blaxploitation flicks of the 1970s and a more realistic portrayal of the black culture, I think, than "Shaft" (I'm white, by the way). I sympathized with D-Jay, the lead character, who wanted to quit pimping and live his dream. Most movie pimps are stereotyped, but D-Jay's character looked at prostitution (the world's oldest profession, we're told) as a means to an end. So, I was disappointed when D-Jay, rather than beat up the man in the electronics store for eyeing his woman suspiciously, lends her out in return for the microphone he wants. The movie heats up when a Memphis native-turned-rap star comes home for July 4 and chills out with his posse at a local club. Clutching a demo tape of his rap tunes, D-Jay gets a meet-and-greet session with the established star, and I dare not reveal more. A movie that easily could have failed succeeds because of the strength, and honesty, of its fine cast. And, the years have been good to Isaac Hayes, whose theme from the original "Shaft" was ground breaking in its day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me first start off by saying that I don't think I know everything, but I try my best to be the most opinionated a-hole on the planet when something really gets to me. With that said... lets talk.A few days ago, myself along with several of my fellow Loews Theatre co-workers went to see what most critics acclaimed as the best film in years. Huslte &amp; Flow. Even though I am not into that particular genre of music, I kept an open-mind on the entire subject. This is how I feel...Why would anyone want to pay good money to first off see a second rate actor like Terrance Howard in a movie where he just doesn't fit the in at all. I understand that a lot of Hip-Hop people feel as if its an expression of there daily life and live songs day by day, so why have someone like Terrance Howard try and act in a spot where I feel an artist can give true meaning to the character. That casting choice right there destroyed the credibility of this movie.This movie was created with producers and executives into marketing for the Hip-Hop general audience. Just to make money, it may be an independent movie, but that just means that a production company like Paramount didn't ORIGINALLY pick the idea. After the success of this film from an off-shot producer, It was picked up and was edited to serve a purpose, make people fall in love with a foney artist.There isn't going to be a DJay album coming out in the next month. He wont be touring with Jay-Z and Linkin Park on some god-awful tour. You also wont see DJay and 50 Cent on BET together. The entire movie is falsified.So what the F--k Hollywood, the story lacked interest to begin with. After 20 minutes into the movie, I got sick and tired of hearing the word "trick." In the stripper seen, with third grade strippers by the way, I would have rather had my head in a vise with my nuts hooked up to some jumper cables.Don't pay to see this MOVIE!!! PS. We understand that skinny white boys cannot rap. Its no longer funny, its sad and downgrading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formulaic but completely entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard out there for a pimp, y'all. Hustlin' up tricks in the Memphis heat is no picnic, and then you always have to worry about ho's getting pregnant, getting an attitude, or holding out on you. On top of all that there's the crushing overhead. For Djay (Terrence Howard), a low-rent Memphis pimp with a stable of 3 girls, one of whom is pregnant, the pleasures of being a small-businessman have run thin. A run-in with an old friend from his junior-high rapping days gets him thinking about music as a way to improve his situation. Before long, Key (Anthony Anderson) and the obligatory white boy (DJ Qualls, the skinny guy from "Road Trip") are laying down crunky rhythms while Djay flows (raps) on life as a Memphis pimp.When you break it down, "Hustle &amp; Flow" is a formulaic Cinderella story that doesn't really show us anything we haven't seen before. We saw most of it back in 2002 when it was called "8 Mile." What sets this film apart and makes it rock are the actors and the music. Naturalistic performances by Terrance Howard and Taraji Henson (as the pregnant one) lend a surprising emotional depth. Howard, in particular, dominates the screen in this potentially star-making performance. DJ Qualls and his Adam's apple are there primarily as comic relief, but he does give a heartfelt monologue about bringing rap back to the South. As it happens, southern rap is on the upswing, popularized by the style known as "crunk." "Hustle &amp; Flow" will likely feed off of and feed into the southern rap phenomenon. The film sold for about 9 million bucks, the biggest deal ever at the Sundance Film Festival. For that money, there's a good chance it will show up at a cinema near you. If you like rap music at all, then I think you will find "Hustle &amp; Flow" to be thoroughly entertaining, and I guarantee you'll be singing the songs afterwards. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

The movie seemed to be low budget, and had plenty of room for improvement. I hope that the Ludicrous, and Terrence can do another movie together.

		<fullReview>This little gem was one of the few surprises of the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, and was certainly the best film in American Dramatic Competition (along with "Brick" and "Thumbsucker").Yes, the plot is riddled with clichés - but the film manages to transcend these shortcomings due to the slick camera-work of cinematographer Amy Vincent (who won the cinematography award at Sundance), the powerful and poignant performances by Terrence Dashon Howard in the title role (Djay), Taraji P. Henson (Shug), and, of all people, Anthony Anderson (Key).The film follows a down-and-out Memphis pimp/hustler named Djay (Howard), who, along with his "primary investor" ho Nola (Taryn Manning), run tricks out of his beat-up Caddie in a back alley.Djay is then swept up in the crunk-rap game, with the emerging success of hometown Memphis product Skinny Black (Ludacris). Djay was once a DJ/freestyle MC during his formative years, and, in his opinion, was on a par with Skinny. So Djay, frustrated by life as a pimp/hustler/dirt-weed dealer, decides to break into the rap game. He's aided by an old friend Key (Anderson), who's still kept his rap-dream alive by recording gospel music at the local church, and his sidekick Shelby (DJ Qualls), who's got some ill crunk beats.Djay's pregnant "first lady" Shug (Henson) provides the hook to their second single ("You know it's hard out here for a pimp / when you trying to get the money for the rent / all the Cadillac and gas money spent / will have a whole lot of b*tches jumpin ship"), as well as some much-needed tenderness that helps ground Djay's rough, pimp-slappin character.This film won the Audience Award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival and rightfully so - it's very engaging and a lot of fun. Even when the sparks fly in the 3rd Act, and filmmaker Craig Brewer throws a left-hook featuring delicate material, the film is redeemed by its close.I enjoyed this film much more than Curtis Hanson's "8 Mile", and must thus crown "Hustle and Flow" as the greatest rap film ever made.(The title of this post is a reference to Djay's first, catchy single)</fullReview>

Pulling from great movies like Pulp Fiction, and others. It's not a documentary, though it could have been, especially with today's reality show craze. For a pimp movie, there was almost NO nudity, nor were there any sexual scenes, which could have made it even better.This movie was more about the music, and it DID have a great soundtrack, in fact, I think I'm going to get it.

		<fullReview>Hustle &amp; Flow (2005) **** (/4) Starring Terrence Howard &amp; DJ Qualls Sublime cult drama focusing on the relationship between two rent boys in Memphis, Tenn, USA. Howard (in career-best form) plays DJay, a narcoleptic, quiet homosexual searching for his mother and for some kind of meaning. Qualls (inevitably overshadowed by his outrageously talented co-star) is Shelby, the son of the Mayor, slumming it as a hustler.Despite its flaws: a few lines that miss the mark, the ill-advised, poorly executed diversion into Henry IV territory, and the distracting appearance of Richert which accompanies it, it remains one of the key films of the 21st century.Well-acted and scripted and brilliantly directed (with fine use of color, recurring motifs and bold credits), Hustle possesses a rare, dream-like quality. The music too is excellent, particularly in the perfect first and final scenes: you'll never listen to The Pogues' 'The Old Main Drag' without thinking of this movie and of its central figure: of Howard appearing from the left of the frame with only a black bag and a stopwatch... of the fireside scene, and of the final line: "This road will never end. It probably goes all... around... the world..." Added to that, it's funnier than most comedies (Terrence's simple "Thanks" when his pleading with a fat naked man named Walt finally gets him 10 more dollars, the sight of him hurdling fences as Reeves tells a policeman: "I guess he doesn't like cops", and the superb dialogue by the fire: "So, you didn't have a normal dog?"), and exists as one of the most honest and moving depictions of love ever seen on the screen. Having said that, of course, it remains a film that polarizes audiences: it will either go straight into your Top 10 or your dustbin after you've finished it; and most reviewers acknowledged this, giving it middling reviews: "**1/2: Many potent scenes... Howard is excellent. Cult status is assured". Even so, you simply must see it, to decide where you stand. Whether you love it or despise it, you will never, EVER forget it.Needless to say I stand in the former camp: I've seen about 800 movies from the '20s to the present day and this is my favorite: tremendously haunting and affecting and endlessly quotable (though few great films are): it simply works on ever level.One final note: Some people criticize this movie for being very similar to Gus Van Zant's my own private Idaho. I personally don't see that as a bad thing. It is like criticizing a man for being "handsome."</fullReview>

That's the truth. "Boyz N Da Hood" and "Menace II Society" were much better movies. The performances were decent, but nowhere near worthy of the praise and hype that people have given it.

Does anyone else see the sick irony of this?? Oh, he's a pimp, but he's really a good guy deep down inside. Give me a break! Why should we glorify the lifestyle of a pimp? A lifestyle that leads to other terrible afflictions on society, drug abuse, abuse against women, and adultery. Have we really stooped so low that a story of a PIMP- a man who whores women out- becoming a rap star is supposed to be uplifting and a feel good story?? This is the same as the movies about serial killers that attempt to make the audience feel sympathy for the cold blooded killers on the screen. I can just hear the arguments now, 'well if you just understood where these people came from you would know how they fall into these terrible lifestyles.' I don't buy it, if he is so passionate about making music why didn't he from the beginning? I'll tell you why, pimping was an easier way to make money and a quick fix is always the road many people take when faced with hardship. Pimps and gangsters are just artists waiting to bloom? I guess all of the hard working people in school and at their jobs are just not interesting enough. I'm glad that kids get the message that pimps and gangsters have such cool lives and that no matter what if you just follow your heart you can redeem yourself blah blah blah.

I felt the movie to be far from realism and that there were plenty of parts that maybe should have been edited. Parts of the movie were outdated for the true-to-life Memphis scene. While I was not impressed with the movie and am wondering why it has become one of the most talked about summer flicks, I do recommend viewing. Although unrealistic and lacking intelligence, it is entertaining if you are looking for something that doesn't require thinking.
