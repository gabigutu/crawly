		<fullReview>Austin Powers is one of those movies that has become MORE popular as time wears on. Austin's slang has worked its way into the lexicon and everything from the redhot video to the Austin Powers Penis Enlarger is on sale and raking in meeeeeelions. When news of a sequel hit the streets, fans freaked. It's safe to say that AP2 is rivaled only by The Phantom Menace as 1999's must see.The wait is over.The second-most anticipated movie of 1999 finally comes to theaters. We're ecstatic to report that AP is a friggin' laugh riot, as Myers and crew have strung together another brilliant collection of one-liners and over the top, sometimes horribly disgusting, sight gags. The follow-up to 1997's video hit has Austin heading back to the 60s to track down his mojo, stolen by one of Dr. Evil's comically evil hapless henchmen. What's mojo? A multi-colored, stringy looking mess that makes Austin irresistible to the ladies. But the plot isn't so important. This is the Austin you know and love, only this time he's even more raw and hardcore.It's clear that Myers was given a much larger budget to bring his vision to the screen after the runaway success of Austin Powers on video. The sets in Spy are much more vibrant and huge, the effects (yes, effects) are top-notch, and the pacing is completely nonstop. I had a perma-grin stuck on my face through the whole thing and will need to see it again just because the audience drowned out some lines with laughter.Here Kitty Kitty Kitty Spy picks up with Austin taking a trip in a time machine back to the smashing 60s where, as we all know, he is a sexual dynamo. The time travel bits can get confusing, but as Basil Exposition of British Intelligence says, "Just sit back and enjoy yourself." Back in the 60s, Austin quickly draws the attention of his nemesis Dr. Evil. The hilarity begins as a patchwork parade of moronic henchmen attempt to wipe out Austin.Still, the best reason to shell out your cash is that AP2 is clearly Dr. Evil's movie. If he's your favorite, you're in luck. Most important, we see him get some.The film does lean a bit too heavily on gags from the first flick and some of the "Yeah, baby" schtick grows old fast. (When your Mammy starts saying "Yeah, baby," it's clearly tired, right?) Still, fans of the original will feel right at home with the budget destructo devices, the horrid teeth, and the clumsy bumblings of Austin himself. In a summer full of high concepts and big budget, AP2 is just the ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly better than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that the general consensus is that the first Austin Powers movie is the best of the bunch. I happen to disagree (as you can probably tell from my one-line-summary). I feel that the second film actually improves on the first film by adding a few new characters and generally cutting loose on the humor making it even more bizarre and funny than in the first film. I don't expect people to agree but at least hear me out as to why I think the second film is better.As I said a few new characters have been added to the roster and we get to see some older characters in new and exiting ways. The best addition to the character rooster is Mini-Me, Doctor Evil's clone, played brilliantly by Verne Troyer. Not only is he hilariously funny but he also brings out a different side to Doctor Evil which I found to be extremely funny. On a related note I found Doctor Evil to be much more interesting as a character in the second film than in the first. Probably because the Austin character had to be established in the first film. Second there is the addition of Fat Bastard, played by Myers himself. A lot of people have responded negatively to Fat Bastard but I found him quite funny in a very weird way. Mike Myers definitely took a step up the weird ladder when he came up with him. Elizabeth Hurley is written out of the script very early in the film and instead Heather Graham is introduced as Felicity Shagwell. Heather Graham is not as strong as Hurley was as Austin's love interest but she remains nice as eye-candy and what can you expect more than that. Seth Green pretty much reprises his role from the first film. Nothing much to come after there. The supporting cast is pretty much the same as in the first film except this time we get to see Number Two in a young version played by Rob Lowe who does an uncanny imitation of Robert Wagner. Mindy Sterling and Michael York returns in their respective parts as well. There are also quite a few cameos in the film. Including Tim Robbins, Woody Harrelson, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and many more.The film still spoofs Bond obviously and the title in itself is of course a reference to The Spy Who Loved Me and once again I find that no-one does it better than Myers. After the success of the first I think they gave Myers free reigns because a lot of the stuff in this film is pretty far out. An example could be the hilarious fight between Austin and Mini-Me and an equally funny scene in a tent. I won't reveal any more than that. Another thing is that the overall effects seem much more polished this time around which is probably also caused by the success of the previous film.The story is pretty much non-existent which I found to be an improvement over the previous film which actually attempted to incorporate a story rather than just be all out fun.All in all I think it is a matter of taste. Either you prefer the first or you prefer the second but you should definitely give this film a try just for the heck of it.All in all 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yeah, Baby!!! This is one of the funniest friggin' movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know it sounds silly, but I just think this is one of the funniest movies I had ever seen. Maybe I was just in a good mood or something, but I was a little surprised by the rating of just 6.5 because I knew a lot of people who enjoyed the movie as well as I did.We have Austin Powers and he's back and funnier and nakeder than ever! Despite some recycled jokes, they still get a laugh when he's walking through the hotel butt naked and only certain objects cover him. When Dr. Evil escapes the giant dummy in space and heads back to Earth, Austin alone must go on his mission alone since we find out Venessa was a fembot. We have a new addition to the family with a miniature replica that is 1/8 the size of Dr. Evil he calls "Mini Me". Mini Me is just so cute and he wants to kill Scott. Scott and Mini Me just steal the movie from this point on. Dr.Evil decides to go back into the 60's and take over the world by aiming a "lazer" at the moon.Austin must now go back in time back to the 60's and finds his sexy assistant, Felicity played by a very beautiful but pretty bad actress Heather Grahm. Together they must find and fight Dr. Evil before he makes over a trillion... oops! I mean a billion dollars! There is another addition of a villain, Fat Bastard, despite most of his gross jokes, you except him into the Austin family.Like I said, there are recycled jokes, but that doesn't keep you from laughing and having a good time. Just let go and learn to have fun with the movie. Come on, you have got to admit that #2's death was just great and so funny! Let's get the rating up, it deserves better than a 6.5! I think Austin fans will enjoy this shagadelic movie! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recycles old humor, but still fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Spy who Shagged Me - not a title you'd expect to garner much respect, but this movie does okay. With Austin Powers 2 we see the arrival of such characters as Mini-Me and Fat Bastard, who inevitably help steer the sequel way from completely recycling every joke used in the first film. However, there is still that overlap, so a lot of the humor comes off a bit stale and tacky. There is virtually no end to the plot holes, inconsistencies, and various irregularities, but that is often a big part of the humor of the Austin Powers movies - making direct fun of the spy genre, as well as themselves.And, on a personal note, Heather Graham is by far more attractive than Liz Hurley, and she flaunts it with great respect for us, the juvenile minded male audience. Overall, I'd consider this sequel about on par with the original, not in any specific details, but in all-around entertainment value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More inevitable cheekiness from Myers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The follow-up to 1997's Austin Powers:International Man of Mystery was probably not a certainty form the get-go:if I recall correctly,the first Austin Powers was NOT the smashing success of a box-office film that many involved initially imagined,and had it not been for a strong reaction from video and DVD renters,the franchise may've stopped at one. Since I happened to enjoy the first one(saw it on video BTW),I can honestly say that while the sequels seemed to have depreciating value,I'm still glad that Myers and company went ahead with the follow-ups.Now acclimated to the '90s,Austin(Myers,who else?)is about to settle into wedded bliss when he's attacked in his honeymoon suite by a legion of Fembots,given marching orders by a refugeed Dr.Evil(Myers,see previous ref). It seems that Evil's back trying to destroy the free world,this time with the aid of a time machine of his own making. Of course,the British secret service ALSO has a time machine(of course),and Austin races through time to stop Evil's plans,this time with the help of one Felicity Shagwell(Heather Graham,beautiful,sexy,game,and yet somehow out of her element here),an American NOC agent from the year 1969. A whole series,moving almost in waves,of sight-gags,verbal plays and yet more homages to Bond and Bond-type movies of the '60s,basically keeps the continuity of the original going seamlessly. Much of the cast from the last movie-- particularly Robert Wagner as the chief Hench,Seth Green as sullen son Scott Evil,Mindy Sterling as Frau FArbissima,Michael York as Basil Exposition and Will Ferrell as Mustafa the Assassin(who must be asked the same question THREE times in order to get information. One of my favorite gags from the movie)--are back,supplemented by Rob Lowe as the younger Number Two,Verne Troyer as Evil's identical clone,one-tenth his size and Myers again as Fat Bastard,a Scotish assassin with a violent temper who weighs a metric ton(I think I'm paraphrasing there),among others. Cameos by(among others) Burt Bacharach(as from the previous film)and Elvis Costello are added to give the film it's small slice of romanticism. Jay Roach returns to direct this one,and he,as usual,is near transparent in allowing Myers(not only star and co-producer but also screenwriter)to pretty much take this film as high,low,far,close,loud,soft and whatever as he fancies. While the original's flavor seems to be getting steadily diluted by the "franchise effect" of sequels(in other words,the effect that kind of makes a movie more of a "product" than a piece of entertainment),it still has the same sass,cheeky humor and fun to keep it quite enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hilarious return to the international man of mystery with this non stop laugh ride of a film with Myers doing it again as Austin, Dr. Evil and a new character named Fat Bastard. There are many funny moments in the film especially the Scott/Dr. Evil episode of Jerry Springer and the emergence of Mini-Me, perfectly played by Verne Troyer. The laughs are constant. You'll laugh so hard, you'll have a headache when you leave the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inferior sequel, more successful, but lacking the dry wit of its predecessor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe Spy Who Shagged Me is a muchly overrated and over-hyped sequel. International Man of Mystery came straight out of the blue. It was a lone star that few people had heard of. But it was stunningly original, had sophisticated humour and ample humour, always kept in good taste, and had a brilliant cast. The Spy Who Shagged Me was a lot more commercially advertised and hyped about.OK I'll admit, the first time I saw this film I thought it was very funny, but it's only after watching it two or three times that you see all the flaws. The acting was OK, but Heather Graham cannot act. Her performance didn't seem very convincing and she wasn't near as good as Liz Hurley was in the first one. Those characters who bloomed in the first one, (Scott Evil, Number 2 etc.) are thrown into the background hear and don't get many stand-alone scenes. The film is simply overrun with cameos.In particular, I hated the way they totally disregarded some of the scenes in IMOM. When they killed off Vanessa at the start and had Basil sat that he knew she was a fembot all along. What was the point of that? They killed off Number 2 in the first one, and now they bring him back with no explanation whatsoever. This is supposed to be a spy-spoof, I don't think any of the characters even hold a gun in the film. It just goes on a trail, further and further away from the point.The new characters are very unwelcome. The whole Mini-Me `make fun of my size' joke gets old very quickly. Fat Bastard is just a lame excuse for gross-out humour. In total there's about two or three good jokes. The rest are either tasteless or rehashed from IMOM.If this were the first movie of the series then I'd probably be easier on it. But the series started on a note of dry wit and then plummeted down to a level of gross out humour. So I say, only watch this film if you haven't seen its predecessor, because The Spy Who Shagged Me is one ultimate disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Film Buffs Like This ? ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... Yeah baby yeah I didn't watch the original Austin Powers INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY down to the fact that there's been more than enough Bond spoofs made over the years like those movies in the 1980s that starred Roger Moore . What ? they were actually official Bond movies ! Oh dear , I honestly thought they were spoofs and how do you spoof a spoof ? CASINO ROYALE tried it and failed while those movies that featured THE MAN FROM UNCLE are so dated they're almost unwatchable and lets not forget those awful Matt Helm movies . Come to think of it a comedy like THE PARTY that pokes fun at 1960s youth counter culture also feel very dated a surrogate Bond figure transported from the 1960s doesn't hold much appeal to me baby However I was very surprised as to how much I enjoyed THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME down to the fact it's far more sophisticated than I expected . There's umpteen references to other TV shows and movies that IMDb die hards can enjoy . There's an edition of THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW ( Complete with bouncers Todd and Steve ) which could have easily have been a proper edition than a send up , there's a set stolen from crap 60s series THE TIME TUNNEL , a scene stolen from THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU , a fight scene very reminiscent of the dog attack from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY . I could go on listing all the movie and TV connections but I won't bother except to say that the plot of this movie is merged with the plots of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and MOONRAKER The aforementioned elements will certainly appeal to the film buffs while the bad taste jokes will appeal to the teenage market . I wasn't all that taken with the character of Fat Bastard or the fart jokes or the scene with " This coffee tastes like sh*t " but it's refreshing to see a movie comedy that does try to mix post modernist sophistication with gross out humour , JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK probably tried this but totally failed . Also naming characters with double entrede names like Felicity Shagwell and Robin Spitz Swallows might be crass but film fans will remember the Bond movies also had similarly named characters like Miss Goodthighs ( " So I can see " ) and Plenty O Toole ( " Of course you do " ) so I guess this is also an amalgamation between schoolboy humour and sophisticationTHE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is hardly Oscar material but is very entertaining</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one great movie. To me, to make a good comedy movie you need to make it very funny, and have a cast of lovable zany characters. If you have all that then you got a great comedic movie on your hands.A main thing you need is slapstick humor. In a scene from the movie Austin and his trusty sidekick Felicity Shagwell are in a tent being watched by Dr. Evil's guards. Austen is down on his hands and knees doing exercises while Felicity is checking their inventory. Since there is a light in the tent it sends their shadows to the outside of the tent where it looks to Dr. Evil's guards that Felicity is reaching in and taking things out of Austin's derriere. The funniest part is when accidently sets of a smoke bomb (if you understand what they were trying to show). Meanwhile, any scene with Fat B@#$%&amp;d is a laugh riot. Especially the scene where he explains that babies are the other other white meat.Another good aspect to a great comedy is a cast of crazy characters. Mike Meyers is great as the swingin' Austin Powers, The maniacal Dr. Evil, and as Fat B@#$%&amp;d the one metric ton Scotsman. Other great characters in the movie include the pint-sized maniacal Mini-Me Dr. Evil's 1/8 sized clone, and Scott Evil the punk son of Dr. Evil. They all are incredibly cartoonish players who are great when they interact with each other.From this Frickin' rotating chair that I sit in I can definatly approve of this movie. They have fantastically funny jokes that leave you rolling in the aisles. Along with side-splitting off-the-wall characters. This movie has everything you could ever ask for. It's sp funny that you will want to see it as many times as you probobly saw Titanic.by, A.J SRHigh</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" was mostly really funny - with Austin continuing his face-off with Dr. Evil - but the stool sample scene was unnecessary. Still, the rest of the movie was a hoot, especially all the slang names for the spaceship. Some of the things in these movies, I wonder how they're able to come up with, especially some of Mini-Me's gags. All in all, it's a movie that you're sure to love, particularly with the Jerry Springer scene and all the associations with world events.Fat Bastard. What a name! And of course, the character in the next movie had an even wackier name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks the sweetness of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's surprising to think that the first Austin Powers movie underwhelmed at the box office back in 1997, only picking up a cult following after its VHS release, and soon enough you couldn't escape the sound of someone yelling "yeah, baby!" every 5 minutes. By the time it's sequel hit the cinema screens, the character, along with the super-spy's arch-nemesis Dr. Evil, had garnered a huge mainstream following, and the movie was a big hit. Yet the film, subtitled The Spy Who Shagged Me, suffers from the same problems as most comedy sequels, which is basically to re-tread the same successful jokes from the first movie, and forgetting what made the original so fresh and charming.Powers (Mike Myers) is a randy, free-love type-of-guy from the 60's. When he was re-awoken from his cryogenic state in the 90's, his out- of-date attitudes put him at odds with a society that had grown more stiff-upper-lipped. Crowds of screaming girls would no longer chase him down the street a la A Hard Day's Night (1964) and sexy girls wouldn't be willing to bed him at the drop of a hat. When Dr. Evil (also Myers) arrives back to Earth with a plan to steal Powers' mojo, the characters find themselves time-travelling again back to the 60's, where gorgeous super-agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) is ready and willing, but Powers lack the mojo to do anything about it. Most of what made the first movie so successful was that Powers was a man out of time, so by placing him back into his natural surroundings, the opportunity to create funny set- piece's are few and far between.The dentally-challenged Brit is instead lumped with a dull romance with Shagwell, which is a carbon-copy of the relationship between Powers and Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), only with the roles reversed. In fact, Powers seems to play second-fiddle to Dr. Evil, whose ridiculously outlandish plots and newly-created sidekick Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) annoy his estranged son Scott Evil (Seth Green) and provide the majority of the film's laughs. An early scene where Evil appears on Jerry Springer with his son is hilarious, and the film is at its most inspired when the focus is on the bad guys. The Spy Who Shagged Me is also more gross-out than it's predecessor, continuing a trend set by There's Something About Mary (1998) and re-establishment of the teen sex comedy set by American Pie (1999), so Myers introduces a vile character called Fat Bastard who speaks with a Scottish accent and is permanently covered with chicken bits, whose scenes tend to induce more cringes than laughs. It's funny enough to justify its third instalment, but it lacks the satire, sweetness and freshness of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999): Dir: Jay Roach / Cast: Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Verne Troyer, Rob Lowe, Seth Green: Sequel is more of the same yet with some added vulgar bits. Its slang title is based on the 1977 Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me, and was controversial in some countries. It has a hilarious opening where Dr. Evil is a guest on The Jerry Springer Show. After an unsuccessful honeymoon Austin's mojo is stolen by Dr. Evil. With a suddenly available time machine Powers ventures back to 1969 to stop him. Director Jay Roach is skilled at comedy but the idea that Powers never needed his mojo makes the plot totally useless. Mike Myers effectively plays three roles. Asides from Powers and Dr. Evil he also plays evil agent Fat Bastard. Heather Graham plays Miss Shagwell whose name sums up her nature. She seems to have better chemistry with Myers than Elizabeth Hurley, whose role was too much of a romantic cliché. Rob Lowe is hilarious as agent #2 despite the fact that the role is somewhat reduced. Verne Troyer steals scenes as Mini-Mi who is a clone of Dr. Evil. He conducts whatever orders given until he is "flushed" into space. Seth Green also returns as Scott Evil whose status as Dr. Evil's son is pushed aside by Mini-Mi. Great colourful production and makeup effects highlight this sequel with a screenplay that was totally shagged. Score: 4 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly better than the first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin Powers' 2nd installment, hits the funny bone a lot harder than International Man of Mystery. The story is easy going; Dr. Evil (Myers) wants to destroy the world, Austin Powers (Myers) wishes to save it. That's it. This time though, he must do it without his mojo; the Doc went back in time to the 60's and stole it from Austin's cryogenic form. It reverses its role from the previous outing. IMOM saw the hero and villain hit the future with naivety, TSWSM has them bringing the 90's back with them. It makes little sense, has no new gags, but its execution is better. The poo and dick jokes outweighs the flops, which comes down to two things; new faces and old. Heather Graham surpasses Hurley in looks and sensuality. She's the girl that likes to 'hop on the good foot and do the bad thing'. Evil is Myer's more intricate character, the relationship with his son Scott (Green) is a constant barrel of laughs, from their family dispute on Jerry Springer to father &amp; son therapy. Myer's new addition Fat Bastard is a loose cannon who gets the worst (jokes) of the worst, but Verne Troyer's Mini Me adds discrimination to the fold. Same as before, fans of the first will love, but it's very unlikely that TSWSM will gain new ones.Check out my other film reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the best of the zany trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Meyer's three Austin Powers flicks parody James Bond and the swinging 60s-70s. They are as follows: "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" (1997), "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" (1999) and "Austin Powers in Goldmember" (2002). What's interesting about these films is that Austin Powers (the character) is not a full spoof of 007 as he's his own character, just with Bond-like qualities.Anyway, I wasn't sure I wanted to review any these flicks because, by doing so, I'm admitting that I actually watched them (lol)! I say this because they're so goofy, juvenile, silly, sometimes raunchy (more verbally than pictorially) and filled with toilet humor. So I was never a fan and didn't even watch any of them until 2009. What turned me off? Besides the toilet humor and raunch, Powers (the character) seemed to have a gayish quality despite being a renowned ladies man in the stories. A good example is when he says, "Oh, beHAAAve," which never struck me as funny, just gay.I've since seen all three twice and, despite my reservations about Powers and distaste for toilet humor, I do enjoy the zaniness and stoo-pid humor. If you can catch a grip with these films they're laugh-out-loud funny about a third of the time, sometimes more depending on the movie."The Spy Who Shagged Me" is my favorite of the three simply because it's the funniest IMHO, but the third one comes close to matching it. Meyers and his team were brimming with confidence and creativity after the box office success of the first film. Heather Graham replaces Elizabeth Hurley as Austin's babe while Rob Lowe appears as the young version of Number Two. Mini-Me and Fat Bastard are introduced.Best quote: "Riiiiiiigggghhhttt." The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in Southern California and Seattle, Washington.GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is trying to live happily-ever-after with Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) but she turns out to be a deadly fembot. At least, he's single again. The gang is back. Number Two (Robert Wagner) clones Dr. Evil to create Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). His son Scott Evil (Seth Green) is not quite evil enough. He and Mini-me travel in his time machine to 1969 to steal Austin Powers' mojo. Fat Bastard is the baby-eating disgruntled inside man who steals the mojo. Austin travels back in time in his VW convertible Bug to stop them with the help of CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham).It's almost as fun as the original. The addition of Mini-Me is genius. "Stop humping the laser." Heather Graham is hot in her booty shorts. Rob Lowe replacing Robert Wagner as the younger Number Two works. I can do without the gross Fat Bastard. The gross-out jokes don't really fit. Quite frankly, James Bond never had a Fat Bastard equivalent. He's the only one that sticks out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The groovy just got groovier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Austin Powers film kind of took a lot of people by surprise by its success. Therefore, a sequel proved too hard for studio bosses to resist. The first film lovingly lampooned the early James Bond films perfectly, always poking fun while never being cruel. Some may think that it would be hard to stretch this concept out into two movies. I myself was cynical, but I'm glad to say that I was wrong.'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me' is - amazingly - even funnier than the first film. It's even more daft, even more crude and just simply great fun to watch. You have to have a kind of silly sense of humour to really appreciate it, but I'm glad to say that, judging by the fact that it took lots more at the box office that its predecessor, I'm not the only one to think so.Its success is majorly down to the cast. There's never a bad performance and nearly every smutty joke is timed to perfection. Special credit to its writer/star Mike Myers who introduces yet another disgustingly wonderful character to his repartee - 'Fat B*****d' who, dare I sat the voice was a precursor to a famous green ogre he was later to voice.Dr Evil is again back to stop his ultra trendy nemesis Austin Powers from thwarting him by... well, who cares? The film-makers certainly don't let story get in the way of giving you a fun time. Ignore the plot holes in this film - the film itself even pokes fun at how not everything actually makes sense and just enjoy the ride (again).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit, the story is nearly identical to the first. I'm in no denial of that but that doesn't make it a bad movie. They introduce new characters, like Fat Bastard and Mini Me, and it's still really funny to watch. In my opinion, Heather Graham is much sexier than Elizabeth Hurley, which is a definite plus.Austin Powers is back and this time, he's lost his mojo! Yeah, his mojo is in the form of liquid in a metal container that Dr. Evil now possesses. He goes back in time to stop Dr. Evil from taking over his mojo and redeems himself as the memorable hero we've all grown to love. When I was little, I was frustrated at the series because I didn't understand the sexual innuendos. Now that I'm an adult, the jokes are a lot funnier and I'm glad that Myers maintains our affection for him as the hero. Sure, he's dim-witted and sometimes over the top but the character has a lot of heart, which is why I think the franchise has been so successful.Personally, I enjoyed "International Man of Mystery" the most and I put "Goldmember" second. At the same time, this second one is still a lot of fun and Roach is very skillful with his direction. If you're a fan of the series, I'd say give it a watch and enjoy it for what it is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers reprises his multiple roles as Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard, a sumo wrestler, in the second of the James Bond spoof. Myers saves the uneven script with his Peter Sellers like versatility. Added to the mix is a little clone of Dr. Evil named Mini-me, played by the funny Verne Troyer. On his honeymoon, Powers discovers that his wife, Vanessa(Elizabeth Hurley), is actually a fembot sent to kill him. The colorful cast is sent back to 1969 in a time machine, where Austin drives around in a VW. He winds up at a secret location for Dr. Evil's lab in a volcano, where he confronts Evil, Mini-me, Fat Bastard and Number 2(a surprisingly good Rob Lowe). Robert Wagner, Heather Graham, and Will Ferrell, round out an esoteric cast. There are also several cameos which are unexpected and made me laugh. Overall, Myers talent is undeniable, and if you've had a bad day Austin might be the right medicine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Canadian comedian Mike Myers such an unapologetic Anglophile, its not surprising that the humour in his Austin Powers films is a blend of two of Britain's most celebrated comedic styles: Pythonesque surrealism and Carry On crudity (toilet humour and double entendres). The Spy Who Shagged Me, the second in Myers' spoof spy series, provides 95 minutes of sheer lunacy for fans of such fare, delivering a constant stream of gags about poo, farts, bottoms, and willies, wacky homages to 60s spy movies, off-beat skits introducing such bizarre characters as an overweight, baby-eating Scotsman called Fat Bastard and Dr. Evil's dwarf clone Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), lots of fun star cameos (including Jerry Springer, Burt Bacharach, Will Ferrell, Tim Robbins and Woody Harrelson), some very silly time travel shenanigans, and the sexiest secret agent sidekick ever to grace the silver screen in the lovely form of Heather Graham as the aptly named Felicity Shagwell.It might not be all that sophisticated, but it ain't half funny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Michael York, Rob Lowe, Robert Wagner, Mindy Sterling, Seth Green and Verne Troyer star in this 1999 comedy sequel. This installment begins with spy, Austin Powers (Myers) on his honeymoon with Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley) and it turns out that she's a robot assassin working for Dr. Evil (Myers). After she fails to extinguish him, he learns of Dr. Evil's volcano hideout by Basil (York). Dr. Evil decides to travel back in time to 1969 to steal Austin's mojo and plans on destroying Washington, D.C. Austin learns of Dr. Evil's plan and also travels to 1969 where he meets agent, Felicity Shagwell (Graham) who helps him and they begin falling for each other. Wagner is back as Number 2 with Lowe playing his younger self in 1969, Sterling returns as Frau, Green returns as Scott and Troyer plays Dr. Evil's pint size clone, Mini-Me. This is a good sequel and Myers is great as usual. I recommend this.</fullReview>

Besides, with the new characters, Mini-Me and Fat Bastard, the moon, 1969, and Felicity Shagwell. With all this. I made me look forward to it in 1999. I love Austin Powers. It is one of the funniest movies in the world. Like this one. What is scary is that my 5 year old sister says, this is my favorite movie in the whole wide world. So i have to agree with her.

		<fullReview>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me The reason sex and espionage are so closely linked is because spies tend to use their country's nuclear launch code as their safeword.Striking that perfect balance between Intel and genitals is the British agent in this comedy. Years after he escaped the garish super-spy Austin Powers (Mike Myers), Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) returns to exact his revenge. Reunited with his cronies, Number Two (Robert Wagner), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), and a diminutive doppelganger of himself (Vern Troyer), Dr. Evil puts in place a plan to travel back in time to steal Powers' sexual prowess. In turn, Powers must team with a CIA agent (Heather Graham) from the 1960s, if he hopes to remain potent.Finding its comedic footing with this preliminary sequel, The Spy Who Shagged Me introduces some of the series' most memorable characters and gags. Incidentally, bi-sexual spies are the most likely candidates for becoming double agents. (Green Light)http://vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average Follow-Up That Cites the Original Far Too Frequently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second installment in Mike Myers's gentleman spy parody is something of an ugly duckling when compared to its siblings. Tossing away the more grounded themes and aspects of the first film, it dives headfirst into a sea of slapstick and never comes up for air. It's not a bad movie, nor is it unfunny; it merely dips into the well of recurring gags from the original too frequently and deals unfavorably with a tough set of growing pains. The reverse time traveling central plot is half-baked and doesn't work, a shortcoming which the movie itself acknowledges by literally telling the audience not to take things too seriously. That may make for a good standalone punchline, but it doesn't solve the problem and following in the footsteps of an excellently-written first film makes it tough not to expect more. New cast members Mini Me and Fat Bastard are brilliant additions who steal the spotlight every time they're on-screen, but Myers and flavor of the month Heather Graham never really connect as a duo. Simply going through the motions is good enough for a few laughs, but it's missing a lot of the invariables that made the series so successful to begin with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A better Austin Powers take off of James Bond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I was not too keen on seeing this movie considering that I was quite disappointed with the first movie, but after Kylie Rogers said that she saw it twice and loved it, I decided to give it a go: and I quite enjoyed it, though I am surprised that Kylie appreciated it, but then she is not your average, everyday woman. Basically, Dr Evil (Mike Myers) escaped in the last movie and returns to destroy Austin Powers (Mike Myers). He invents a time machine, goes back to 1969, and steals Austin's mojo. After learning this, Austin also goes back to stop him. Here he meets Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). After tracking down Fat Bastard, the guy who stole Austin's mojo, they find out where Dr Evil is and stop his diabolical plans, though he manages to escape. This is quite a funny movie and came off much better than the original. The main theme is that you are what you are, not what you have. Austin spends all of the movie trying to get his mojo back, believing that this is what makes him who he is, and when it is destroyed in front of him, Felicity says that he does not need his mojo because he never really lost it. I won't go much deeper into this movie because there isn't much depth to go into. It is basically a send up of James Bond movies with satire and toilet humor, as well as things that we simply do not expect. This movie is stupid and appeals to people who like stupid humour, which I do in some cases. My favourite character is Scott Evil, Dr Evil's son, who is far more intelligent than Dr Evil, and sensible, but as far as Dr Evil is concerned, he is not as evil. I think he is, but the thing is that Dr Evil is simply stupid, but then again so is Austin Powers. If Dr Evil was intelligent, then there is no way Austin powers would be able to defeat him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lame sequel to a not very amusing original. The first 'Austin Powers' spy spoof bombed at the box office ( crushed by 'The Lost World - Jurassic Park' ), but became a surprise hit on video. It ended with our hero marrying the lovely 'Vanessa' ( Liz Hurley ). But of course she had to be killed off to get him single again. So at what point in the first picture was Vanessa replaced by one of Dr.Evil's fem-bots? Never explained. Some might argue that this does not matter as it is only a comedy. Well, comedy does require stringent logic.Mike Myers clearly has no idea how to end a joke properly. Most other comics would be content to let the gags stand, but he milks them until you want to scream. The low point comes with the introduction of 'Fat Bastard', a flatulent, obese Scotsman. The character manages to be offensive without being funny. Myers is no Peter Sellers, and lacks the range to play different characters. 'Mini-Me', played by Verne Troyer, is just plain annoying.Most of the gags are recycled from the first film, and were not particularly amusing the first time. The desperation is never more evident than in the scene where Powers drinks excrement. In that foul concoction, he might have found a copy of the script of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite comedy films of all time. I like this film slightly better than the first. Mike Myers is just hilarious as both Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard. He always knows how to tickle your funny bone. One of my favourite scenes in this movie is the Johnson rocket scene where someone is about to say what it is and when before they are about to say what it is it switches instantly to the next person and that person says the word. I laughed so hard when I saw that scene. I also liked Heather Graham's performance in the film. This has to be the best movie in the Austin Powers Trilogy. This movie is definitely a must see. If you have not seen it, get off the couch and rent it or buy it. When you see it, you will laugh so hard that you will take a pee or take a dump in your pants. This is one of those you can watch over and over again and it will still make you laugh and you will never get tired of it. That is how funny it is. A lot of repeat value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin's Swinging Second Mission</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it amusing that the advertising campaign in 1999 for Austin Power's second adventure recommended seeing STAR WARS EPISODE I when, in my opinion (sure to irritate many) was that THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME was a more entertaining movie. The world's favorite swinging spy of the 60s is back and, since he's no fun unless he's single, his new wife Vanessa is dealt with before the opening credits ever roll. While Austin is wrapping up his marriage, Dr. Evil returns from the cold reaches of space with a new plan: he has developed a time machine and travels back in time to 1969, where Austin is still frozen, and steals his mojo. After weakening the super spy, Dr. Evil continues with his new plan for world domination. He has installed a massive laser on the moon (which he calls a "Death Star") and will hold the world hostage in 1969 for $100 billion dollars...or he will, if the President can stop laughing at the ludicrous ransom demand. Determined to regain his mojo and save the world, Austin teams up with an American CIA agent, the sexy Felicity Shagwell. With his time-traveling Volkswagen, Austin returns to his element for the best movie in Mike Myers' trilogy.Whereas the first movie came off as a solid spoof of the 60s spy genre, the new movie begins shifting into more outright zaniness. Some of the gags that got the biggest laughs in the first film return (e.g. the "shh/zip it" bit between Dr. Evil and Scott, Dr. Evil's love of "frickin" and finger quotes) and there are plenty of new ones to keep it fresh. The movie also introduces everyone's favorite gag characters: Fat Bastard and Mini-Me. More than ten years since this movie premiered, I'm still hearing people quote Fat Bastard and Vern Troyer will forever be known for his role as Dr. Evil's 1/8th size clone. It's not far enough in the series for the humor to get old, and the new elements make this my favorite AUSTIN POWERS. I saw it in theaters and never stopped laughing. There is the usual 007 spoof elements, with nods to YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and MOONRAKER and plenty more.Mike Myers ups the ante in this film, adding an extra character to his ensemble. Now, in addition to Powers and Evil, Myers is Fat Bastard. He hasn't lost his spark yet at this point and his characters are as fun as ever. Elizabeth Hurley returns for the film opening to tie up the loose ends as newly married Vanessa Powers, but the new blood here is Heather Graham as Agent Shagwell. We couldn't have an AUSTIN POWERS movie without Austin lusting after his fellow agent, so the marriage is overruled in a quick and easy deus ex machina moment. It's acceptable here for a fun pre-credits gag to keep the story moving, but Myers would go to ruin the end of GOLDMEMBER with the same method. The rest of the regular cast returns: Michael York, Mindy Sterling, and Seth Green. Seeing as how the film is set in 1969, Rob Lowe steps in to play a younger Number Two (great job, too...nailed a lot of Robert Wagner's mannerisms). If you were a fan of the first film, the second is even better. It takes all the best elements of the first movie and jazzes it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than it should be, but not as good as it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Myers (who is currently going through Eddie Murphy syndrome - massive talent that seems to have vanished somewhere in Hollywood) indulges himself but it just about works. The sheer originality of the first film is lost here because of the recycling - but, ironically, this tends to make many of the sequences much funnier as a result. Indeed it's all too evident in that the weakest parts of the film are the new characters - Mini-Me is just about tolerable, but Fat Bastard simply doesn't work - whereas the best bits - like the Jerry Springer sequences - are magnificent precisely because of the trouble taken to build on the characters we already knew. And some of the ideas are inspired - like casting Rob Lowe as Number 2,, figuring out how to use Liz Hurley, and the Time Machine gags - and that more than makes up for the misfires - most of the rest of the Moonbase stuff for instance. More than a decade later, it's still funny. But I doubt it will bear another viewing for me - at least not for another decade, anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers must be about the same age as me as I got so many of the references and in-jokes to popular culture from the late 60's to the early 80's. Most of them tickled my funny bone, although were a bit vulgar for my tastes.Like its predecessor, "The Spy Who Shagged Me" (great title!) is bright, brash, colourful and flings laughs at you nineteen to the dozen. I preferred the more esoteric of them - the muso references to the Alan Parsons Project, for example, and if most of them are no more subtle than Benny Hill, hey, he was big in the 60's, 70's and 80's too. As for the new characters, Rob Lowe does a better Robert Wagner than the man himself, Heather Graham is the likable and attractive "Powers Girl" this time around as the swingingly named Felicity (should have been Modesty!) Shagwell while the war between Dr Evil's two sons, Scott and Mini-Me is a source of fun throughout. And if you think Felicity's moniker is close to the bone, get a load of Russian agent Ivan Humpalot, which of course takes us back to Fleming's barely less un-PC Plenty O'Toole and Pussy Galore!I'm not sure why Myers is so obsessed with the Scottish accent (going back to "I Married An Axe-Murderer" and taken on into his Shrek characterisation and I should be raging at his gross distortion of my native Scottish people with the "Fat Bastard" creation but in truth it hit home, if a little and I'll even give his accent pass-marks too! The title of worst Scottish accent is still up for grabs, my gold medallist being Johnny ("I Really Tried..." in Depp in "Finding Neverland". Much less bloated than its successor "Goldmember", whilst perhaps trading too much on the template of the original, this sequel is very funny in places and never dull</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light-hearted spoof to watch with friends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite sceptical when it came to watching this, but I was pleasantly surprised with a decent James Bond spoof. The main thing was the fact that the makers used the main parts of what makes the James Bond movies ? the women, the sex, the indestructibility of the hero ? and successfully transferred them into the spoof. James Bond is all those things, but things such as his lack of respect for women are quite implicit, whilst Austin Powers makes them very obvious and brings out the true nature of Bond. I enjoyed seeing Mike Myers in a variety of different roles, and the rest of the cast do a nice job, but it is the costume department that impressed me most with the 60s style clothing. Some of the humour is quite shallow and simple, and at times stupid. It's not 'clever', it's jokes and gags used over and over again in many other films. I think it might be the fact that I don't find silly humour satisfying enough that didn't bring me to enjoy the film thoroughly, but I still quote some of Austin's lines to this day. Verdict? Fun, light-hearted watch, but the some of the silly jokes didn't cut it for me, making me raise an eyebrow. It's a fun film to watch with a group of friends instead of on your own, since you could end up over analysing the film, whilst with friends you are more likely to enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers has had some good movies, and some bad. I would like to say. This is one of the main good things I have seen from him. The first Austin Powers movie, remains one of my favorite 90s Comedies. This one was quickly added to the list as well. Though I'm getting a little tired of hearing "Shag me" or "Ya wanna shag?" in pop culture.This one picks up, almost directly were "International Man of Mystery" left off. We find out Powers' last sidekick, Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) was a fembot of Dr. Evil's after malfunctioning right in front of him. Now, Austin is single, and looking for a new sidekick.His life has turned, he is a photographer, and is hoping to get his life back on track after his encounter with Dr. Evil.Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) go back to 1969 were they meet Number Two (Rob Lowe), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), and an uncanning fat guy, named who else but Fat Bastard (Mike Myers).Austin arrives back at a party in his London with his new sidekick, Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) where he learns they both have to go to back to 1969 to foil Evil and Mini-Me's plan of launching a laser to the moon. Also to get Powers' "Mojo" back from Evil as well.A funny, yet bizarre sequel Myers continues to deliver his "Oh Behaaaaaaaave" style acting and his obsess with "Shagging a women." I have to love Seth Green's corny one-liners in the film. They keep going as he complains Evil (his father) doesn't love him. A very funny character, who in my opinions needs to have more scenes like his father.A funny, yet quite crude 90s Comedy, "The Spy Who Shagged Me" delivers, as well as the first.Starring: Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Verne Troyer, Rob Lowe, Mindy Sterling, and Seth Green. Cameos by Willie Nelson, David Koechner, and Willie Nelson. Directed by: Jay Roach.</fullReview>

Though the plots differ nominally, the three separate parts of the trilogy are essentially the same movie with the same jokes just put in different order. But they're good jokes, and it's just as funny watching Myers and company deliver the same punch line for the third time as it was the first.Grade: B for the whole series</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers has nearly gone over the top with "The Spy Who Shagged Me", part 2 of the Austin Powers series. Bringing in Mini-Me and Fat Bastard helped move the story along...they are interesting characters. I wish he had kept Vanessa on board as his wife...but I guess a married Austin Powers would have slowed things down a bit and turned a few folks off. The gags are just as corny, though a few of them are kind of gross. But, hey...this picture is not meant to be taken seriously...nor should anyone really expect it to make sense in any other milieu than screen logic. As Basil Exposition and Austin tell us--in a shameless breach of the fourth wall--we should just forget the plot and enjoy ourselves. And that is the key to the hilarity of the movies...the reckless comic abandon, the situations that don't work, the gags that bomb--but are funny anyway, partially because they do bomb--and the hilarity and frivolity of it all makes it a worthwhile watch. I am going to have to get this film on DVD-- I watch it fairly frequently on VHS, and it's bound to wear out at some future point due to repeated plays. But is is a fun movie...and the Austin Powers series is the best of its genre to come along in many years. If you are prudish, you might be offended at some of the gags and situations...but for just plain old entertainment and a lot of laughs I can recommend it...you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than Goldmember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to start off by saying I have not seen this movie completely. I have only seen parts of it on You Tube. But I've seen enough of it to be able to form an opinion about it. When I first saw it I thought it was weak and dull although I still thought it had some good stuff in it. I thought that some of the scenes were dull and slow and that there wasn't enough actionBUT!!!! after watching Goldmember I realized how good the Spy Who Shagged Me is. I'm not saying this is a great movie. But I think it is wonderful compared to Goldmember. There are some really exiting scenes in this movie. Examples of that include the part when Austin and Felicity are taken to the volcano lair and then Dr. Evil and Mini Me leave for the moon. that part of the movie is one of the best scenes in the whole Austin Powers series. The other memorable scenes were the scenes in Dr Evil's moon base. Those scenes were so good that it makes Moonraker look like Barney. And that puts Moonraker to shame. I also thought that Felicity was an excellent character in the story. She is way cooler than Vanessa or Foxy. The other character I really like is Mini Me. He is SO CUTE. I like how he fights Austin. There was one scene at the end which I did not like. That was the scene when Fat Bastard comes to kill Austin and Felicity and he ends up crying, whining, and complaining about himself. ("I'm a big fat slob" and I can't stop eating, I eat because I'm unhappy and I'm unhappy because I eat") That scene was unnecessary, unpleasant, and disgusting,and should have been excluded from the movie. I will now state my final comments which will conclude this review. The spy who shagged me isn't a great movie but it is so much better than Goldmember. It has a fair share of action and excitement and a fair share of bad stuff too. But I think the majority of the film is good, but it is NOT the best movie out there.I think that if you want to own an Austin Powers movie then this is the one to put into your collection. It is the best one of the series. I think that they should have ended the series with this one since Goldmember was so bad by comparison. I've wrote enough and I think the next thing for you to do is see the movie. Have Fun</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers: The Spy who shagged me was a success at the box office back in 1999. It was a sequel to the hit film Austin Powers, obviously. It has all of the key ingredients for a good sequel. But unfortunately, The Spy who shagged me falls flat compared to International man of mystery. I have one huge problem with Austin Powers: The Spy who shagged me. But before I state the problem, let me state the good things about it. The Spy who shagged me has a few big laughs. Heather Grahm isn't quite as attractive as Elizabveth Hurley but I still liked her. Soem of the original cast returns. Now, the problem that I had with The Spy who shagged me is too immature for me. Some of the characters are gross. Fat Bastard wasn't even in James Bond and for some reason he's in this. Just looking at him is gross. There are fart jokes and crotch jokes occasionally. I think the film has some big laughs, but not as much as I was hoping for. Some parts in it are really funny. But most of the film seems like an immature attempt to recapture our interest. I liked Austin Powers: The spy who shagged me. It is the worst in the trilogy. I give it a mild recommendation despite it's immaturity.The Plot:Austin Powers returns for the second time. This time around, his mojo has been stolen from Fat Bastard, an assassin working for Dr. Evil. So Austin travels back in time to get his mojo back and stop Dr. Evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Powers : contains little doses of senseless humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An honest opinion which can be voiced about "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" is that as a comedy film it is only occasionally able to make audiences laugh.This is because its jokes are rather childish and rely less on the actual outlandish plot of the film.So what is this film all about ? This film by Jay Roach is more of a futuristic space ride story than a shaggy dog tale.One of the reasons why this film has somewhat failed to deliver its shares of laughs is due to the fact that a futile attempt has been made to make a spoof out of James Bond films.This has created a dismal artistic porridge of low comic and mystical intensity where spies seem to rub shoulders with all and sundry.It can also be felt that beautiful actresses have absolutely been wasted.This is the reason why Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Graham appear as mere pretty dolls who have been offered almost nothing but minor roles.An important information for the viewers is that veteran actor Michael York is the one person who really acts in this rather confused film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the second of three Austin Powers movies that have been released. It's basically a parody of the James Bond and Our Man Flint movies. If you've seen either or both of the other Powers movies, you know the storyline to this one: Austin (Mike Myers) is a secret agent (!) working to rid the world of its megalomaniacal nemesis Dr. Evil (Myers), who has various bizarre world domination machinations and is aided by Bond-style gizmos, a round table of dopey assistants, and other evil-doing secret agents (also Myers). Just think of a simple-minded Bond storyline and throw in '60s slang, haute couture, and bad teeth, with a heaping helping of potty jokes and double entendres, and a cast with the looks of the United Nations of Circus Freaks (with the thankful exception of the sexy female secret agents Powers partners with). Without the babes (Heather Graham, here--is it me, or do those eyes make her look like a doll? She makes me randy, baby. Yeah!... Oh, and there's a way-too-brief cameo by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos in this one.) and Dr. Evil's ever-changing schemes, these movies would be totally repetitious. Basically, since there's so little variation in these movies, this review could apply to all. I recently purchased this and after watching it (and having seen it at the theatre) I noticed how many jokes have been recycled throughout this series. If you've only seen the latest, Goldmember, you've seen many of the same jokes as the first two. Which is not all bad, but it does become somewhat predictable and tedious. Although, each of the movies does have its share of original jokes, many of which are downright hilarious and make the movies worthwhile. Kudos has to be given to Myers for his effort. He's hilarious and has an under-appreciated talent in playing so many distinct characters in the series. The Dr. Evil character, especially, is the one in which the actor disappears. He created the characters and has made a fortune from it. If you liked the others, you'll like this one. If you haven't seen the others and you like dumb plots, silly costumes and makeup, silly dancing, silly humour, double entendres, and potty jokes, (or if you're a 12 year old boy) you'll like this. Otherwise, get your shags elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Shagging!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Austin Powers- The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999), Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) travels back in time to 1969 to steal Austin Powers (Mike Myers) mojo while he is cryogenically frozen. Powers' starts to notice that he is having trouble in the womanizing area, and decides to follow Dr. Evil and get his mojo back. Powers hooks up with the American spygirl, CIA Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), and together they go on a hunt for Powers' mojo. Powers also has to stop Dr. Evil from destroying the planet with his "Alan Parsons Project", a giant laser. Dr. Evil's clone, Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer), is an exact replica of Evil, only 1/8 of his size. Mini-Me soon replaces Evil's son, Scott Evil (Seth Green), to become the high-light of Evil's life. The pint sized Evil is a barrel of laughs. Added to this sequel is also Fat Bastard (suprise! also played by Myers). This name is very fitting to the grotesque character. If you enjoy disgusting body gestures, then Fat Bastard is a character you will like. Myers won the American Comedy Award in 2000 for funniest actor in a motion picture. This award was well deserved by Myers, because of his versatillity. This comedy, directed by Jay Roach is perfect for viewers who enjoy crude remarks, grotesque comedy, and too many references to phallicism. This color film has an awesome soundtrack. Dr. Evil singing "Just the Two of Us" to his new little buddy is hysterically funny! I rated this film a 3, because I am not a big fan of grotesque comedy. I feel that disgusting bodily habits should be left at home in private, and not displayed for the public. However; if you are a fan of such ridicule, this is unquestionably a movie you will appreciate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll Die Laughing at "Austin Powers 2!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anybody that enjoyed the first Austin Powers epic should love the sequel. The gags in "Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me" surpass the original not only in comic creativity but also in how much they make you cringe. The cosmic struggle between good and evil as embodied in Austin Powers' battle against Dr. Evil has never been funnier. Cheeky scatological humor permeates this derivative tale along with the usual bad puns, double-entendres, infantile innuendo, and farcical slapstick. Director Jay Roach and writer &amp; star Mike Myers have boned-up their flaky-flashy formula, introduced new characters, embellished on-going subplots, and pulled out all stops to top the original. Naturally, the Austin Powers movies celebrate as much as poke fun at those hip 1960's spy sagas where James Bond, Matt Helm, and Derek Flint used their wits and ways with women to vanquish the villains.Co-scripted by Mike Myers and Michael McCullers, "AP2" picks up where the original left off. Opening with a campy nod to "Star Wars," they recap the original adventure with their own prologue scrolling into deep space. Not only has Austin Powers (Mike Myers) defeated his arch enemy Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) and exiled him to the dark recesses of space, but Powers also gotten his ugly teeth fixed and has married Vanessa Keningston (Elizabeth Hurley in a cameo).While Austin and Vanessa shag away in the honeymoon suite, Dr. Evil's Big Boy rocket reappears on Norad Radar. An American astronaut working on the space shuttle looks up and finds the famous Shoney's Restaurant icon hovering ominously in an atmospheric "Armageddon' like rendezvous that sets the tone of hilarity in this facetious sequel. Whirling 180 degrees around the smiling Big Boy rocket, the camera focuses on the Big Boy's butt as a hinged compartment lowers, launching an egg which tumbles to the Earth. Indeed, the diabolical Dr. Evil is back! Meanwhile, Austin learns that Vanessa isn't really Vanessa. Instead, she is a fembot, a Terminator-like robot equipped with machine guns in her breasts which she deploys to gun down Austin. Predictably, he survives her barrage of bullets and rescue her Swedish, penis-enlarging machine while the deadly fembot obliterates everything in sight before she self-destructs.Later, Austin learns from Basil Exposition (Michael York), chief of British Intelligence, that they knew all along that Vanessa was a fembot. Rejoicing at his new found freedom, Austin cavorts throughout the motel in his birthday suit while psychedelic screen credits carefully obscure his genitals. When the credits don't cover up his crotch, different objects resembling his genitals show up in a series of inventive sight gags cover them up. Basically, director Jay Roach has recycled the same joke from the first "AP" movie but has tripled the objects standing in for Austin's genitalia.While the first "AP" movie gave its eponymous hero the lion's share of screen time, Dr. Evil dominates the sequel. Actually, between the two, Dr. Evil is far more interesting. Resembling Ernst Blofeld from "You Only Live Twice," Dr. Evil is the epitome of irony. Just as he did in "AP," Dr. Evil allows his vendetta to kill Powers overshadow his plans to enlarge his astronomically wealthy empire. The product placement here is clearly over-the-top as we find Dr. Evil in his high-rise headquarters in the Seattle space needle. Number Two (Robert Wagner in a cameo) reports that since they have acquired a minor coffee franchise, Starbucks, they have reaped a fortune. Acquiring a fortune takes a back seat to Dr. Evil's latest mad scheme. He intends to go back in time to 1969, two years before Austin Powers has been frozen cryogenically, to pinch our hero's mojo. Dr. Evil dispatches his most odious hoodlum, Fat Bastard (Myers in a third role), a baby-chomping, kilt-clad Scottish bagpipe blowing thug who weighs a ton.Meanwhile, back in the future, Austin learns to his chagrin that he has lost his mojo. Essentially, the swinging secret agent no longer has his virility, leaving him impotent. Basil Exposition confirms it, and British Intelligence plans to send him back to the past in a time machine to 1969. Appropriately enough, a new Volkswagen Beetle with psychedelic colors serves as the time machine. Austin returns to swinging London and hooks up with fox CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham of "Boogie Nights"). They set out to recover his mojo and thwart Dr. Evil's fiendish plan to destroy Washington with a moon-based laser.The Austin Powers movies synthesize the spy flicks of the 1960s along with the premise from the Sylvester Stallone thriller "Demolition Man." References to other movies creep into the action. When Dr. Evil's chair spins out of control, he invokes the chant from "The Exorcist." Incidentally, we learn in "AP2" that Austin's favorite movie is "In Like Flint." Nothing more than a loosely aligned jumble of "Saturday Night Live" skits like the original, "AP2" happily acknowledges its own absurdity in a couple of self-depreciating asides. Boldly, the filmmakers tell audiences in one scene to ignore the loopholes in the plot and enjoy the show. During a ride along a scenic stretch of road, Austin observes, "Amazing how England looks in no way like southern California." Director Jay Roach, who helmed the first "AP" movie, returns for the sequel. Clocking in at a trim 95 minutes, "AP2" rarely slows down, so if you watch it with a rowdy audience, you may miss some of the punch lines. The dancing interludes are flavorful and flashy, and the film's energy never wanes. Roach keeps the story rolling and the jokes flying as thick as bullets. One of the funniest scenes has Dr. Evil flying a spaceship shaped like erect male genitalia. Quick cuts from different people reacting to the object fuel the comedy."AP2" boasts beefed up production values that approximate the films that it sends up. Some of the funniest scenes involve Dr. Evil's relationship with his son Scott Evil (Seth Green). You'll die laughing at "AP2."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as groovy as the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Myers (Shrek) writes and stars in this spy spoof sequel as Dr Evil travels back to the 60's to steal Austin's mojo in a plan to take over the world.International man of mystery was excellent, goofy yet sophisticated with daft humour and interesting characters and a real comedy take on the spy genre. This critically acclaimed sequel follows the same route with the same weird and wonderful central protagonist Austin Powers who has a new sidekick, Felicity Shagwell, played with some charm by Heather Graham.Myers also throws in an array of new characters, all comically arranged for extra humour, such as Mini Me, Fat B*****d and Robin Spitz Swallows, all interesting and crude in their own way, a useful technique in the spoof genre.Though lacking the sophistication and humour of the first, this sequel does have many giggles and a fairly gripping plot to keep you hooked, though inconsistent there are twists and turns as well as many jokes for the more adult viewer.Myers must be praised for his writing and his acting as all different characters. Though humour isn't on top form, he has spread diversity throughout the characters and does well in achieving the predictability in a comic light, with different techniques used for variety.The character of fat B*****d is obviously a spoof, and a very horrible and crude one at that, so horrible I couldn't even look at the screen when he was on.Others, who include Graham, Rob Lowe and Michael York are all average in their roles, and all could have done with perhaps more airtime to cement their roles into the plot.The cinematography and graphics are well used, and one of the final scenes involving Dr Evil and his shuttle is very funny. The writing is good, not great by Myers and in conclusion, the film is a watchable spoof, portraying the genre well but inconsistent with average performances from the supporting cast and doesn't have the build that the first had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I have invented a "Time machine" and with my "Time machine" I intend to go back and steal Austin Powers' "MOJO". But what is his MOJO, well for layman unfamiliar with the spy genre, the MOJO is what allows Austin Powers to beat Doctor Evil, the thing that gives Austin his powers or as the French prefer to as "I don't know what"! Having travelled back in time and stolen his "MOJO" from when Austin was cryogenically frozen, Austin then has to travel back to the sixties in order to recover the missing MOJO.Travelling back Austin encounters the beautiful Penelope Shagwell and a younger number two, exquisitely played by Rob Lowe, who must have been Robert Wagner in a past life, what then occurs is one of the funniest films to hit the screens since "Airplane".In the first film we were treated to a gag-a-minute joke-fest that occasionally mis-fired, however for Austin Powers 2, the jokes are better, his character more likable and the extra character added of Mini-Me, is one of the greatest film creations of the past 20 years. Ask people who the terminator is they know, ask who Indiana Jones is, they know, ask who Mini-Me is, chances are they'll do the impersonation of Doctor Evil introducing him. Every scene with Mini-me is hilarious, from him being inserted into his chair and trying to eat his cat, to his scene on the piano which makes me cry with laughter every time I see it.Add to that an early brief appearance by Elizabeth Hurley and an excellent piece of work by Seth Green as Scott Evil and you have most definitely the best of the series. This sets the benchmark for any subsequent Mike Myers film, and I got to tell you, it's a pretty high benchmark.Nuff said Em.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outdoes the first film with more laughs and more stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Austin Powers flick called "International Man of Mystery" was a sleeper hit in 1997 where it became something of a classic in video rentals with a sequel being inevitable in the works.In "The Spy Who Shagged Me" Austin Powers (Mike Myers) finds out that his first love Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley) was a fem-bot (half female/half robot) while receiving an urgent message from Basil Exposition (Michael York) that Dr. Evil (Mike Myers in another role) is on the move from his spaceship and headed back to Earth.Dr. Evil has more plans of his own with his old gang where he invents a machine to make a duplicate of himself but 1/8 his size call Mini-Me along with having a time portal to go back to 1969 and hoping to kill Austin Powers while being frozen. Instead he takes away his mojo that makes him sexual arouse with the help of a vile Scottish soldier by the name of Fat Bastard (or Fat B. to the offended). In the real world (1999) Austin Powers feels less of a man until realizing that he can go back in time to save his mojo and meet up with super hot agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) to find Dr. Evil and save the world again.Austin Powers 2 provides more laughs that aren't subtle like the original where audience members will get the hint faster along with seeing Mike Myers doing more than two roles (he plays Fat B. in the film as well) where he takes his comedy level to a whole new game besides playing Wayne in Wayne's World or before doing the voice of Shrek. While his character of Austin Powers is very childish at some times, it's mostly about Dr. Evil where his screen presences makes you laugh the hardest and want you leaving for more. Heather Graham is the perfect choice to play the sex-kitten where after seeing her role in Boogie Nights, she's a qualified sex symbol.This one is the best from the Austin Powers films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Take: Just as funny, if not funnier, than the first.More financially successful than the first film, AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, the sequel to the successful and cleverly hilarious AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY, continues the silly, spy-spoofing escapades of that horny 60's spy with bad teeth Austin Powers (Mike Myers), who once again comes across the ineptly sinister Dr. Evil (also by Myers), who is once again holding the world for ransom with a giant "laser" (he can't resist saying it without those quotation marks). Upon going back to the 60's after stealing Austin Powers' Mojo, with help from incredibly obese minion Fat Bastard (a third character played Myers), we are also introduced to a subplot concerning Evil's relationship with his son Scott (Seth Green) and a miniature clone he prefers to call his Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). After following Evil to the 60's to retrieve his Mojo, he is also involved with fellow agent Felicity Shaggwell (Heather Graham). While the first film is with an abundance of jokes that hit the right timing, this sequel specializes in providing abundance. One joke is quickly followed by another, and at least one is better than the last. Myers once again makes the best of his characters, making them funny, but his character as Fat Bastard is often unnecessary. Although that character is funny to the least, some are awfully too gross, perhaps giving only the chance to make the film more gross than the first.But the very few flaws this film has, it's a comedy and as a comedy, it works immensely. The jokes are in abundance and are all terrifically hilarious. There is are a number of jokes that exceed the PG-13 rating, but the film can find its right audience. Teenagers and above are bound to laugh like a fool in this very effective comedy.Rating: **** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair Spoof of James Bond, but Not as Good as the First</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is best known for introducing Mini-Me, Dr. Evil's pint-sized clone, to the world, and afterword launched a thousand pop culture references, which also included an incessant barrage of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil impersonations of wildly varying quality both on television and in everyday conversation with one's friends and acquaintances. After the mediocre "Goldmember" installment had left the theaters, Austinmania thankfully died down, and hopefully we've heard our last "Groovy, baby!" for a long time. It was a catchphrase more annoying than "show me the money!" Anyway, with all that said, is "Austin Powers II" really worth all of the extreme amount of hype and imitation it produced? Mike Myers has an unenviable job of playing three important roles at the same time. He proved he is a master of performing bizarre and hilarious characters during his tenure on the skit comedy show "Saturday Night Live". The problem is his wacky, off-the-wall characters do not hold up well for a feature-length movie. Asutin Powers, the character, is a rather odd parody of James Bond, a hybrid of Bond, a "Swingin' Sixties" Mod hipster, and Maxwell Smart (in his goofy ineptness). Powers' catchphrases and jokes wear out their welcome very quickly, as does the sexual humor and sight gags involving Powers (which also proliferated the first movie). These gags and catchphrases, as well as Power's playboy persona, bore rather than entertain. The writers run the gags into the ground, and insult the audience's intelligence with the assumption that a crude sex gag done millions of times will always be funny. They are trite and unoriginal, and are the movie's greatest hindrance. The Austin character, in spite of his fiery, lustful mannerisms, is the blandest of the three characters Myers performs. He just rams this trite stock character into the ground.Dr. Evil, on the other hand, is eccentric, silly, and over-the-top evil enough never to wear out his welcome. Like any comic character, bizarre, childlike and surreal characterizations are always more fun to watch than trite parodies of stock characters who rely on shock humor and boring catchphrases. Rather than do a straight parody of a maniacal supervillain, Myers makes Dr. Evil a very original and odd villain by making him as goofy and strange as possible. Evil's idiosyncrasies are what make him the star of the movie. The Dr. Evil moments are the funniest. Of the three characters, Evil is Myers's best.Dr. Evil's fat Scottish henchman (whose name cannot be mentioned because it is an obscenity) is simply a framework on which to tack on crude shock humor and fat jokes, which grow boring really quickly and insult the viewer's intelligence. Amplified grossness does not equal amplified humor, which is a lesson the filmmakers of the Austin Powers series do not take in stride. The Scotsman does have his humorous moments, such as his hilarious "Sexy Man" song to Felicity during an awkward scene, but mostly his goofy charm is lost in a scene of pre-programmed flatulence recordings and pastel-colored pig slop. He is the least interesting of Myers's characters.Some will apparently compare Mike Myers's triple performance to Peter Sellers's roles in "Dr. Strangelove." There is no comparison. Sellers was a master actor who brilliantly channeled his oddball characters in a dark, subdued and intelligent dark comedy with little, if any, toilet humor. Myers's strengths are performing goofy characters in ten minute skits; beyond that, he pushes his talents to their utmost limits. He performs wildly off-the-wall weirdos in a flashy, expensive, glossy parody filled to the brim with toilet humor. His efforts are uneven at best.And what of Mini-Me, the unsung, unknown legendary Verne Troyer? He does well as the mute, yet ravenous Dr. Evil clone, but chose to make Mini-Me a diabolical, sadistic henchman rather than a smaller version of Dr. Evil. He is very funny in this role, and is, after Myers, the star of this movie. He holds his own in this role, but I think the fame of the Mini-Me character far outshines anything in this otherwise fair comedy. It's not a classic of the genre, but it is an excellent example of hype and publicity gone amok to the point where pop culture icon status is given to something that doesn't really deserve it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man With The Golden Pun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Austin Powers movie was a shot-in-the-dark comedy Michael Myers pretty much made for himself and a few friends, little imagining the fuss it would spawn. This time, Myers and his alter egos set out to build a middle-brow entertainment franchise. At least they got the money part right.After spending the first movie adjusting to life in the 1990s, superspy Austin Powers (Myers) is pulled back into his native 1960s to save his mojo from the evil Dr. Evil (Myers), who has stolen it with the help of traitorous Scot Fat Bastard (Myers). Will Austin save his mojo, and not incidentally, the world?While not as satisfying or clever as the first Powers film, "Spy Who Shagged Me" does make you laugh, especially the first time you see it. Fat Bastard is a terrific new addition to the Powers tribe, a nasty self-worshipping slob who wears a metric ton and has an appetite that is boundless, morally as well as physically."Listen up, Sonny Jim, I ate a baby!" FB declares. "Baby: The other, other white meat!"Also great is Verne Troyer as Dr. Evil's stunted replicant, Mini-Me. Troyer's tiny stature makes for a good initial guilty laugh, but Troyer throws himself into the role with the same kind of abandon and hidden talent Myers employed in the first film. Mini-Me's confrontations with Dr. Evil's biological son Scott (Seth Green) is an entertaining subplot throughout.Myers himself is a bit of a mix. As Fat Bastard, he is about as funny as he's ever been on screen. As Austin and Dr. Evil, he's a little too much too often. Dr. Evil seems to be after laughs from the MTV Music Awards crowd, mocking rap videos and repeating old gags like telling Scott to be quiet (this time with the catch phrase "Zip it" rather than "Shh...") Austin is a grab bag of catch phrases, interspersed with the occasional double entendre, like when his latest lady, Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), notices he activates his apartment lights by clapping his hands."When did you get the clapper?" she asks."November, 1964, Dutch East Indies, shore leave," he replies.Graham is beautiful to look at but a bit of a damp noodle otherwise, which goes for much of "The Spy Who Shagged Me." Sure, you have the clever set design, costumes, and music that the original "Austin Powers" had in spades, but the heart of the enterprise is missing here. Austin throws off one after another of his merchandise-ready puns, and it's hard not to enjoy it in fitful bursts. But it doesn't linger like the first film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another funny entry in the series, actually my favorite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I am sure most people probably prefer the first one over this one, but I thought this was the most funny one of the series. To me, this time both Dr. Evil and Austin are equally funny, unlike part one where Dr. Evil to me was clearly the more funny. The jokes run the gambit from clever to just disgusting bathroom humor...but for the most part they are hits. In this installment Austin is on his honeymoon and his new wife is explained away in rather humorous fashion, though that is a bit of a shame seeing how Elizabeth Hurley was the best Austin girl in the series. Well Austin does a dance number and then during a trist with a Russian spy loses his mojo. Well actually it is stolen by a minion of Dr. Evil named fat bastard. Well you know the drill, Dr. Evil along with his army of villains including the new mini me are going to hold the world ransom for a very high price. Well, Austin is off with a new female agent a very attractive, but not as good actress Heather Graham. Well you have more elaborate death traps, a death ray to destroy the world, Austin battling the all powerful Mini me, and a part of the movie Independence Day. So prepare to laugh as you get to see various jokes on Bond too, the most prominent being the coming out of water scene from Dr. No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know the character's name of Mindy Sterling but she is the German ally to Dr. Evil. There is a bit of chemistry between them too. Austin's back and single again and I won't tell you how. The gang includes Michael York who should be knighted as Basil Exposition. Dr. Evil is back along with his son, Scott played brilliantly by Seth Green. This time, they go on the Jerry Springer Show entitled "My Evil Dad wants to take over the world." I have to say that is a brilliant moment. My favorite moments are not with Austin but with Dr. Evil and his son, Scott. I love Mini-Me who is Dr. Evil's clone. He's more his son than Scott Evil ever was. Anyway we learn of Scott's mother's identity but I knew all along and won't spoil the surprise. Robert Wagner is back and it's another spoof of the Bond films but I still love watching Dr. Evil and Scott bond best of all or at least try too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is one of those few films that break the sequel curse - that is, the sequel always being worse than the original. In this case, this sequel surpasses the original with flying colors. Unlike the first time, the script, dialogue, and jokes, are very strong and spot-on. And again, Mike Myers is properly cast, developing his Austin Powers and Dr. Evil characters, while adding another funny character - Fat Bastard! And kudos to Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissina (you'll have to see the movie to see why I love her performance!) and especially Verne Troyer as the newcomer Mini-Me! A solid 8 out of 10.

		<fullReview>Mike Myers returns in Austin Powers the Spy Who Shagged Me. Heather Graham successfully replaces Elizabeth Hurley as his sexy love interest. Dr. Evil returns. The film introduces two new characters, a little bastard named Mini Me a dwarf clone of Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard a disgustingly obese Scotsman in kilts. Go figure.It's a sure bet Mike Myers has made some enemies in Scotland for the Fat Bastard character. Makes you wonder how the movie played in Edinburgh.This film has more of the lunacy shown in the original with about the same result. The fight between Powers and the dwarf Mini Me is completely politically incorrect and funny, thank you Mr. Myers.</fullReview>

So when his mojo is taken by Fat Bastard(Mchael Myers) he is determined to get it back only to find out that Dr.Evil(Michael Myers) is the head of the organization that has made things loopy again. Teaming up with Felicity Shagwell(Heather Graham)he finds Dr.Evil, his clone Mini Me(Verne Troyer) and the rest of the cohoots in contact with the crimes that they have begun to make.Setting off at first in the 1990's we shoot to about the 1969's to where we see Dr.Evil his cohoots and his son Scott.

		<shortDescription>Austin Returns.... To the 60s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One rule about Hollywood is that if one movie is successful, why not make another? The original Austin Powers movie, International Man of Mystery, was a surprise hit and spawned this sequel, The Spy Who Shagged Me. This movie is funny, but feels tired, which is difficult to understand as it is only the second movie of the franchise. I think the problem with this movie is that it takes Austin Powers back to the 1960s, where he is from. Time travel movies are fun, when the characters are taken to a new time period, not the one they are originally from. The funniest jokes in the first movie came from the fact Powers, and Dr. Evil, were fish-out-of-water, and those are taken away from the audience in this movie. The Bond jokes are funny, but by the end of the movie, it just seems like we've been there, done that. It's a funny movie, but it could have just been a lot more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (notice any similarities to the James Bond fiml, The Spy Who Loved Me??) is hilarious, and unforgettable! Austin Powers (Mike Myers) discovers that his wive Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley) is a fembot, and soon becomes single again. It turns out that Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) has hired an obese Scotsman named Fat Bastard to go back in time and steal Austin's "mojo" and has left him "shagless." Austin must travel back to the swinging 60s, and stop Dr. Evil from blowing up the moon, while he meets agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) to help him. Meanwhile, Dr. Evil continues to argue with his son (Seth Green) after finding out who the mother is, and falls in love with his evil clone, who is one-eighth his size, Mini-Me (Vern Troyer). The second Austin Powers film is even funnier than the first, and is one of the best spy spoof comedies!Grade: 8/10MPAA Rating: PG-13My Rating: Ages 12 and up (sexual innuendo, nudity, language, crude humor, violence)</fullReview>

But now there are two of him: but one in miniature.Number Two reverses the formula from the first, and adds an amusing climactical Star Wars take off at the end. The Starbucks tower is also lots of fun.Nowhere near as fun as the first. I very quickly got sick of Austin Powers.Still, Heather Graham in those little panties in the scene where Austin asks her "how do you get into those pants, baby?" is worth the price of entry alone.

		<fullReview>It's a second outing for Mike Myers' spoof spy Austen Powers, and the formula hasn't changed a bit: which means a lot of silliness, crudity and fun. Many of the jokes are weak but there are just so many of them you never have to wait too long for one to make you laugh; and the sketch where Powers' nemesis, Dr. Evil, appears on the Jerry Springer show is inspired. Nonetheless, for me 'The Spy Who Shagged Me' was the weakest of the trilogy, there are two new villains, the excellent Mini-Me but also the awful Fat Bastard, who brings with him a lot of toilet humour that even in a film that exists, in part, to send up the awfulness of its own jokes, is more gross than funny. Overall, it's far from awful, but in my opinion the series gained a new lease of life in part three with the hilarious casting of Michael Caine as Austin's dad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Can't Believe There Was A Sequel To Austin Powers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first one was only a marginal success, but this one prove to be incredibly successful. Mike Myers returns as Dr. Evil, and Austin Powers, the megalomaniac, and evil genius who sets to take over the world, and the man out to stop him, Austin Powers, who works for Great Britain. This movie is so filled with jokes, some of them very sick, some of them very corny, some of them very silly, and some of them very funny. Notice I said the verb ?very' many times to describe the movie. The reason is this movie is not too little of anything. The movie can't be accused of not doing anything enough. The movie goes to all extremes to try and make you laugh. While the movie is worth seeing, maybe even in the theaters I think the movie is not great. This movie was entertaining, but it could have been a lot better. I can't help but think the movie, like many movies today had cute women in it for the sake of trying to broaden it's appeal some how or another, but really don?t make the movie any funnier. I think Mike Myers has proven he can be very funny. (alas in Wayne's World)But here the movie doesn't appear to try to be funny in places. Sometimes the movie just trying to be cool by being so retro, instead of just trying to be funny. This movie shows a problem with a lo of comedies today. Comedies are not trying to be funny today, they are trying more to be fashionable. This is true of a lot of Hollywood films, but it affects comedy the most because in order for comedy to be as funny as it can be generally speaking it should not be overly concerned with being fashionable. I won't deny though some of this movie is very funny. The best parts of the movie involve Dr. Evil and his evil entourage, they are hilarious. Mike Myers in his part as Dr. Evil shows his true comedy genius, and the parts that involve him are very funny. I think this movie is funnier than the first one because there are a number of scenes that are hilarious, but this movie lacks the consistency of the first one, the first was funny throughout, this one is hilarious in parts, but other parts are just silly. Oddly enough most of the scenes involving the title character are not very funny, except for the silly opening. Overall this is a hit and miss movie, good in parts, but overall proceed at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me was a funny film with yes, a lot of laughs and new characters but one I couldn't really stand. Mini Me was the one I couldn't stand. He wasn't very funny and I liked it better when Dr. Evil was just with Scott. He was kind of funny when he was singing with Dr. Evil and when he kept yelling EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Oh and also of course, his height but for all that it doesn't really make him a funny character after all. Once again Dr. Evil was hilarious and Felicity Shagwell who was played by Heather Gragham was very hott, yes indeed. If I was Austin, I wouldn't care if I didn't have my mojo, I'd still so her. I had some negatives but that doesn't mean I didn't like it. It sure the hell was funny but in a way could've been better but overall funny film and recommended for anyone. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Instead of being original the movie recycles too many jokes from the previous Austin Powers movie. Not that that takes away the fun of it of course.Once again the movie is full with the most craziest characters and jokes. A positive addition to the movie are the characters Mini-me and Fat Bastard. All of the other main characters from the first movie are also back again in this one and once again more than enough cameo's with a fun part for Tim Robbins as the president of the United States.The movie tries nowhere to surpass its predecessor mainly because it plays at safe, meaning that it doesn't try out anything new or something that hasn't been done before in the previous Austin Powers movie, with as a result a not so original but still fun movie.Of course the quality of the movie and story isn't always very high and some of the jokes are simply lame but on the other hand there are more than enough other jokes that are hilarious. It is a movie that is so dumb that it is actually funny.If you liked the first one you'll also like this one and will be worth your time watching, otherwise just skip it.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly one of the funniest movies of all time. I would go into the plot but it would be pointless, the script has been written to serve the jokes, and nothing silly (like continuity) is going to get in the way of a laugh, which is the way it should be. Mike Myers got the ball rolling in International man of Mystery, but that film now seems like a dress rehersal for this perfect gag laden script. Myers takes on three roles (Austin Powers, Fat Bastard, and Dr Evil) a la Peter Sellers in Dr Strangelove, and each performance is fantastic. The laughs per minute ratio must be off the scale but it's Dr Evil who gets all the best material (his Jerry Springer show monologue on his upbringing is pant wettingly funny).8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main problem with this sequel is all the recycled jokes. Apart from that, a few of the jokes are taken too far, are too extreme to really be funny, in my opinion. The plot is very much like the first, and still a spoof of one or several Bond movies. The acting is, like in the first, good. The new characters are not as entertaining as the ones from the first, but fortunately, most of the more important characters return here, even those who had small parts in the first one. While I liked this, I didn't think it was as funny as the first. Something was missing. It isn't entirely bad though, some of the new gags and jokes are well worth seeing the movie for. If you liked the first one, you'll most likely, at the very least, enjoy this. Some of it is bad, but most of it is pretty good. I loved the cameos, and several of the crude gags were hilarious. If you liked the first, or you're into crude, sexual humor you'll probably enjoy this; it's good to see if you want more of Austin Powers after having seen the first, but just don't expect it to be as funny as the first. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I keep hearing people say how much this movie sucked. That the timing of the jokes was off and they were predictable. The movie is not about making the perfect joke at the perfect moment, it's about Austin Powers (along with some other characters) trying to be cool, but failing miserably.I'm not trying to be mean, but I think someone who understood the genious of Austin Powers should have written the review. For instance he/she says "Punchlines fall like drops of water from a barely leaking tap. I could detect neither spirit nor charm, and I was looking". Well first of all if you cant detect spirit in this movie, than you need your head examined. As for the part about the punchlines, well they do exactly what they are supposed to. Did you watch this movie with your eyes closed? It's not so much what is being said that is funny, it is more the acting of Mike Myers.All three of the Austin Powers movies are some of the best comedies out there. If you cant understand why I think they are funny than I truly feel sorry for you.P.S. Try watching this movie to enjoy it, not anylize it. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers returns as Austin Powers in this sequel to the first hit. This time there is one more character for Myers to play, Fat Bastard who's only purpose is for Myers to make fun of fat people and to try to show that he is very talented. The result is like a Doctor Strangelove type of performance, though nothing of that quality. He does well in all three roles, but I just found the Fat Bastard character to get annoying and disgusting after a while. Even though there is still fresh humor, it gets old and gross which is a bad sign. Things also get worse in the third movie. Heather Graham fills the shoes as Austin's partner, and she does a good job of her comedy and her appeal. Michael York has a smaller role then he did in the first movie, but he manages to keep it together as well. Jay Roach's direction is more energetic then the first one as he tries to put in more parodys and has a slower pace. He also adds in some very sixties tones, which all works out well. The final confrontation on the moon is quite funny and of course there's always the clip from Independence Day. Sometimes the characters try to be funny when they're just stupid, but most of the movie keeps it together well to recommend it. It's too bad that Austin Powers in Goldmember turned out to be a failure. 8.5/10</fullReview>

As in the first movie, his private parts are hidden creatively, this time mostly by the opening credits.Meanwhile, the military discovers that Dr. Evil is not cryogenically frozen and orbiting the Earth as they had believed; this discovery is made on 'The Jerry Springer Show,' where Dr. Evil's son Scott is shocked to learn the truth (the program's topic is sons of evil fathers). Dr. Evil, of course, gets into a fight with a hooded Klansman, complete with numerous bleeps. As Austin has numerous relationships with girls whose names I would just as soon not mention, Dr. Evil returns to his headquarters in the Seattle Space Needle (which has the word 'Starbucks' on it; Dr. Evil's organization owns that company). The organization has cloned Dr. Evil, and the clone is like him in every way except ... well, he's very tiny. But Dr. Evil loves the little man like the son he never had (his real son gets jealous). Dr. Evil has also developed something: a time machine, which he uses to go back to 1969 with 'Mini-Me', when Powers was frozen, to steal the quality that makes women like him. This is accomplished by a Scottish guard said to weigh a ton (Mike Myers in yet another role, wearing a fat suit). With Powers out of the way (or so he thinks), Dr. Evil is back at his headquarters in a volcano resembling Mt. Rushmore (except with Dr. Evil's face only) ready for the major plot of this movie: to point a laser based on the moon (at a base with two divisions, Moon Unit Alpha and Moon Unit Zappa) at Washington, D. C. and other cities. While threatening the United States over via television, Dr. Evil confuses the American officials at the White House by quoting from movies that haven't been made, and terrifies them by showing footage from 'Independence Day' (How did THAT get there? Well, Scott did come back, but he wouldn't have brought it). In fact, Dr. Evil spends a lot of time making pop culture references that no one else can understand, and he performs a popular song which he takes credit for writing, and he raps along with a recording that couldn't have been made yet, inserting his own words.Powers has his own time machine, and he goes back as well. He joins up with a girl named Felicity to do battle with Dr. Evil, and with them we see just one of the many crude scenes in this movie. While they are in a tent getting ready to fight Dr. Evil, people outside can see shadows suggesting something unspeakably obscene, and eventually physically impossible. Crude jokes, puns and double entendres abound, along with beautiful women in skimpy outfits, and psychedelic patterns with bright colors. At two times, naughty sentences are formed by having one person 'finish' what another has said through editing, with numerous off-color remarks over the course of maybe a minute. A country singer named Nelson appears one of the times, and an actor named Harrelson in another case. We are advised more than once not to worry about things that don't make sense; Powers remarks about how Southern California does NOT look like England. Mike Myers was wonderful in all his roles, and Verne Troyer was quite funny without saying an intelligible word (though he did sing when Dr. Evil rapped). At one point, I was laughing so hard I thought there would be serious medical consequences; I will only say this involved the search for the Scottish guard after he had been equipped with a tracking device. Possible Spoiler: Mike Myers actually plays four roles. Anyone who remembers 'Back to the Future II' will understand how.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin lost his mojo, and never got it back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first Austin Powers movie. I have always been a Mike Myers fan, and AP1 was an instant classic. A great satire, with clever writing, and memorable characters. Then came it's sequel, which I eagerly anticipated back in 1999. AP2 had it's moments, and yes I did laugh several times throughout the film. However, I left the theatre a bit dissapointed, and perhaps a bit disgusted.I have several problems with this movie: 1) writing off Venessa Kensington as a fembot was completely ridiculous! I was so angry when I saw that first scene, that I couldn't let it go for the rest of the film. Venessa had a mother, who was Austin Power's partner back in the 1960's! Was she a fembot since birth? They could have come up with a better way to get rid of her character. 2) Venessa's replacement, Heather Graham, is a horrible actress. Her chracter Felicity Shagwell was uninspiring. Austin also got over Venessa way to easily. It's as if he didn't care at all. 3) Way too many continuity errors! Where shall I begin? If Austin's mojo had been stolen in 1969, he would not have it when he was thawed out in 1997, but he doesn't realize it's gone until 1999. How did Dr. Evil plant a time portal in 1969, and how did his henchmen all know he was coming back to use it? Frau was on the moon with Dr. Evil at the end of the movie, but she watched him take off for the moon (and made the countdown) earlier in the movie. To make matters worst, Dr. Evil blows up the moon base with Frau in it! She never escaped with him on the rocket. How did she get back to earth? Finally, Dr. Evil was left stranded in space in 1969. How did he make it back to 2002 to appear in AP3?? Okay, enough of that. 4) Austin drinking Fat B*stard's waste is completely disgusting.I love a good comedy, especially silly ones. But AP2 fell apart somehow, and what Jay Roach and Mike Myers gave us was a sloppy, hacked up movie that only went for laughs. It had no substance. The first movie had clever writing and heart. These aspects wer missing in AP2. Fortunately, things got a little better in AP3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great But A Bit Repetitive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We last saw sexy spy Austin Powers (Mike Myers) with his beautiful wife Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley) two years ago when the original ended. It's now 1999 and Austin discovers that his sexy wife is a fembot! After this, he then finds out that Dr. Evil (Mike Myers again) has returned to Earth and has built a time machine and even has a clone. One Difference: The clone is one eight his size. Dr. Evil names him Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). With the help of Number 2 (Robert Wagner, back from the dead after his horrible burning in the first film), Dr. Evil and Mini-Me travel back in time to 1969 where they steal Austin's mojo with the help of Fat Bastard (Mike Myers' newest role), a huge disgruntled Scottish guard who loves to eat babies. Powerless without his mojo, Austin travels back in time to 1969 to get it back from Dr. Evil and make him the sexy beast he once was. The only problem is that he falls desperately in love with beautiful Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) but because of the lack of mojo, he is not able to do anything with her. It's now essential that Austin retrieves his mojo stuck in the hands of the 1969 Dr. Evil gang which includes a young Number 2 (Rob Lowe, in a great performance). This film would be great if it wasn't for the amount of copying from the first films. The infamous 'Shh!' scene from the first one is now the 'Zip it!' scene. One of the biggest talks when this film was released was about how many jokes were taken from the first film. This is not really a bad thing but we were expecting something really original (Watch 2002's Goldmember to see what it should have been) sadly this film is more or less a remake. Still, it's good for some laughs: The chess scene, Mini-Me's introduction, any scene with Mindy Sterling as Frau and, of course, the ever so sexy Heather Graham as karate chopping 1969 agent Felicity Shagwell. Shagwell by name Shag-very-Well by reputation. A lot of the crew from the first film has returned here. Most prominent is Jay Roach who once again directs and does a fine job at it. While Mike Myers wrote solo in the first one, here he is equipped with a partner in the form of Michael McCullers who does a pretty good job. I might also point out that Myers now plays a third role here as... Fat Bastard! A hit or miss character, I found him hysterically funny and was glad he returned in 'Goldmember'! Verne Troyer does a good job as Mini-Me but there's just something about him that isn't right. Luckily, that is gone in the next film. Well, 'The Spy Who Shagged Me' is certainly a funny film but if you've seen the first film then you've seen all these jokes. Skip it and go straight to 'Goldmember'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, before people start bombarding me on how this movie is racist, sexist, horrible and crude, let me tell you something.You cannot complain this isn't original. Spoofs are never really original. They throw a twist or two, but you can't expect a spoof to have an original plot. It's about the biggest oxy moron there is(something that cancels itself out as you say it, such as a spoof with an original plot). You can't say this was cashing in on a franchise for no good reason. It flopped big time in the theatres, and in a rare event only started growing popularity on video. Mike Myers has said countless times that he wrote this for himself, just playing around with an idea. He got the idea for the original listening to "The Look of Love" on the radio, not by actually watching the James Bond movies in a bad mood. He came out of hiding after several years to do something for himself.Anyway, this movie marks the wall in the Austin Powers series, dividing International Man of Mystery(1997) and itself and Goldmember(2002). Austin Powers was a spoof of James Bond and a couple of low-budget yet famous English spy movies, with a couple of jokes in there that the James Bond series implied but had never shown. The deleted scenes contained a lot of stuff that may have made that movie nothing but a spoof, with no originality whatsoever. Spy Who Shagged Me and Goldmember left alone the James Bond series and focused more on what the most part of the audience focused on: The jokes. It still hasn't gotten to the point of making fun of pop culture fads like Goldmember, but Spy Who Shagged Me introduced never before seen jokes and gags that Goldmember uses nothing but. To understand all this, you've got to rent the DVDs of all 3.Highlights of this hilarious if controversal(and isn't that always a good thing, in the end?) movie include the "bag" in the tent, which is about the grossest thing in the movie. But great too is all the Jerry Springer stuff, the time machine, and the woman who -WOULD-NOT-DIE! You have to watch the deleted scenes, mostly deleted because of timing and pacing of the movie and continuality but contained some of the funniest things I have ever watched, and don't really matter once they're put together in 20 minute form.I love this movie, and if people would give it a chance, they'd love it too. Of course you might be shunned by your friends if they don't approve of it, but why are they your friends, then? In fact, kinda like reality TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, this film was something of a letdown for me, having seen International Man of Mystery a week ago. The Spy who shagged me just copies too many of the jokes that were in International man of mystery. They are not precise replications, but the type of joke is just too similar. The only things (being shallow) that seem to have changed are the music (which is better), the story (not really) and the eye candy (which is younger, but does not portray her given character as well as Miss Hurley did / no offense Miss Graham). If I were you I'd not watch both films shortly after one another, for you might not enjoy it. Wait some time. Wait as long as it took to make the second Austin Powers movie (two years) and maybe you'll like them both.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen all 3 Austin Powers movies. Out of them all, The Spy Who Shagged Me is still hands down the best! Mike Myers is an advanced comic genius of his time. In this one he plays three roles, our hero Austin, Dr. Evil, and a portly Scotsman named Fat Bastard! All of Dr. Evil's hapless henchmen and punk son are back and this time he has a midget clone Mini-Me.In this one, Dr. Evil invents a time machine that goes back to 1969 to steal Austin's mojo. Austin gets a new girlfriend, Felicity Shagwell, and they both go on the trail to stop Dr. Evil's laser beam he has pointed at the earth! There's never a dull moment in The Spy Who Shagged Me, the dialogue, plot, humor, characters, and soundtrack are enough for anyone to enjoy! I saw this movie when it first hit the theaters, it was so packed that I had to sit in the balcony! But I had fun anyway!My favorite is Dr. Evil! He's a silly villain and I've always liked silly villains. And he isn't overly evil or too exaggerated like some movie and cartoon villains are. The funniest part was when Dr. Evil was singing "Just the Two of Us". I nearly fell out of my seat I was laughing so hard! So, if you like spy spoofs, Get Smart, Monty Python, or even James Bond movies, the Austin Powers trilogy will never let you down! One thing's for sure, I'll take Austin Powers and Dr. Evil over Wayne and Garth anyday! I give The Spy Who Shagged Me, 5 stars! I give Goldmember 4 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ever-scheming Dr. Evil builds a time machine that allows him to travel back to the 1960s where nemesis Austin Powers is still artificially frozen. He carries out a dastardly scheme in which he steals Austin's beloved mojo, the key component to his groovy lifestyle. Despite his loss, Powers is determined to try and thwart Dr. Evil's plans for world domination and teams with a sexy secret agent (Graham) in order to get the job done. Respectable sequel has a lot of good ideas, and Myers is a comic powerhouse especially as the new villain Fat Bastard, but it's brought down by too many moments of silly, needlessly crude humor. The cast does seem to be having fun though. **?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-so, overly crude piece of garbage **spoilers? I haven't decided yet!**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get this out of the way: I haven't seen the original "Austin Powers". That said, let's get on with the comment.I was quite tempted to putting this into my "6/10 club". What I mean is, movies that are pretty damn bad, but still have a modicum of enjoyablity. Movies like "The Mummy Returns", "Star Wars: Episode II", and "Pearl Harbor" leap to mind immediately. Each of those has at least some redeeming value that keeps from labeling it as outright bad. That said, there are numerous reasons why, in the end, I didn't give this the six:1) Crude humor. Okay, I'll admit that a well-written or even well-timed fart gag may make me laugh ("The Lion King", "The Simpsons", and MST3K - and let's not forget "Oops, I Crapped My Pants" from "Saturday Night Live"), though I'm not a huge fan of scataology. Here, it's everywhere. The scene with Austin (Myers) and Felicity (Graham) in the tent with the latter apparently feeling Austin's butt is stupid. And when they are forced to surrender and the turds fall out of Austin's butt - stupid, gross, etc. The p*nus gags go on to long, and only the very last one ("I've seen bigger; that's just" - "A little prick!") made me laugh. Fat B@stard wasn't the least bit funny; I love a good fat joke, but the screenwriters failed spectacularly.2) Poor writing. For the most part, I didn't find any of their one-liners funny.3) The plot. Okay, in a film like this, there needn't be a spectacularly compelling plot. But I couldn't follow this film at all. It's all just a bunch of gross set pieces with a scene or two of cartoon violence and a LOT of sexual inneudo.Now, there are a few good things: the d*ck-shaped spacecraft of Dr. Evil was pretty funny to look at - not so much, however, when the characters keep mentioning it over and over. Seth Green, as Dr. Evil's son (damn, forget his name), was very cool, and Myers was good as Dr. Evil (as Austin he was so-so and the less said about Fat B@stard the better). The numerous times when Dr. Evil keeps using the quote marks when talking about "the laser!" and his conversation with the President of the US circa 1969 using modern-day movie references (esp. the clip from "Independence Day") are pretty funny. However, I didn't find Austin, Felicity, Fat B@stard, or anyone else very humorous at all.Cheap and gross. This could've been at least camp, along the lines of "Wishmaster" (one of my fav camp flicks), and "Child's Play 3" (bad overall, but fun to make fun of), but instead, it's mostly childish humor that only a mentally-deficient six year old (and no offense to mentally-deficient six year olds) would think was funny. Despite occasional flashes of brilliance, it never adds up; even as a Bond parody (which obviously are pretty old by now) it's pretty sad.Four stars for "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me".</fullReview>

He then decides to threaten then world with a giant laser on the moon. Austin must go back in time and thwart Dr. Evil once again. I must tell you, I haven't heard an audience laugh so hard at jokes that one guy fell out of his chair in hysteria. My favorite was the Jerry Springer episode, (the audience seemed to just love the zip-it, penis word chain, and Fat Bastard.) Fat Bastard is a great new addition to the series. This one is definitely the best in the series. The only problem with this was the amount of very noticable errors and flaws in the movie. Very highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank you! After experiencing a relatively dull first installment, Mike Myers delivered with a great performance as Austin Powers. The jokes were mostly accessible, and the addition of Mini-Me and Fat Bastard created some great film icons which will forever be etched into the minds of the average film goer. I especially loved the little exchange between Dr. Evil and Young Number 2 (Rob Lowe), making for some great comedy. Sure, some might say this is mindless trash, but it was still a fun film to watch. The only thing I didn't like was Heather Graham, who acted like she won a contest for a walk-on role, but managed to stick around the rest of the movie. Oh well, perfection can't always be achieved in most areas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that the original Austin Powers movie was pretty great, so I figured like most sequels, "The Spy Who Shagged Me" would end up being worse then the original, but I was wrong. It was by far, funnier then "International Man of Mystery."The cast was great. In the original, the actors and actresses seemed a bit uptight about their roles and by this movie they really loosened up and we got to see the characters as they were meant to be seen. There were a few good cameos in it. Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) was fantastic. She was almost like a female Austin Powers whereas Vanessa Kensington (Austin's girlfriend/wife from "International Man of Mystery") was so uptight. I also loved the opening where it turns out that Vanessa had been a fembot the whole time. It was great. "Machine gun jubblies? How did I miss those baby?"Also, just recently I saw the newest Austin Powers sequel, "Goldmember" and I still think that this one was the best movie of the three. "Goldmember" was close to being as good as this though. I would recommend anyone see this movie. It might seem better if you see the first one though to get an idea of the characters. If the first one seems a bit dull, I would still recommend someone see the second one anyway just because it is a lot better then the original. If you enjoy this one and the second one, I would also recommend seeing "Goldmember" in theatres. Or if you'd prefer, just rent itwhen it comes to video.I rate this movie, 9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is unique as it is the only one that has ever had me demand my money back at the video store! I rented it one night when I was bored and it is simply dire, puerile and unfunny. Whatever Myers is, he is not a comedian and I suppose I should have expected what I got having suffered 'Wayne's World' on TV a few weeks before. I went and demanded a refund and guess what, I got it! And if you want a lesson in how to do 60s pastiche, rent 'The Rutles - All You Need Is Cash.' Now that is funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening 5 minutes gave me hope. Then Meyers proved he only had one good idea for the rest of the movie. Absolute lowest common denominator humor. Painful viewing. A complete chore. Written no doubt in less than a week, just like the first one. Give Meyers the hook and lock him in a cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And don't let him out until he's developed a decent script for something, anything. He has it in him. These Austin Powers things are just embarrassing. Let Goldmember sink without trace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good slapstick comedy that continues on the first Austin Powers movie with better cinematography this time around and with a better budget production but the effort lacks originality.Many jokes here are simply re-cycled from the first one.Although there are some new goodies added here and there.The focus this time is more towards Dr.Evil and what really saved this film from failing was the new character Mini-me.Still a classic for those slapstick fans who do not mind some very gross toilet humor.There is a very disgusting scene where Powers mistakenly drinks stool so beware!I am big slapstick comedy fan but even I really dis-aprove of those kind of un-necessary scenes.I merely erase/edit those kind of scenes out.The movie stlll survives without it.Only for slapstick comedy fans who understands 1960's culture......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It really grew on me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok I saw this in the theater and didn't really think it was all that funny, but that was because I was already laughed out from South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut. But after buying it on DVD (it was on sale) I watched it again and this time thought it was really funny.My only two gripes with the film are Felicity Shagwell and Fat Bastard. Well Fat Bastard just had really stupid dialouge, I thought Mike looked really funny in the fat suit and his Scottish accent was always funny...it's just his dialouge sucked, that's all. And Heather Grahamn isn't funny at all....and she shouldn't try to be, she's not a comedian. What made Elizabeth Hurley so funny in the first one is that she wasn't trying to be humorous, she was the serious one and was funny in her reactions to the "I think I am a sex god" Austin. Heather should have played a more serious character.And I dunno what these people are talking about when they gab about all the "gross-out" humor. I could only think of two scenes that I would call gross out.So what I am saying is if you are a fan of the first one, definately check this one out and fall in love with listening to Dr. Evil talk about frozen foods."You want a Hot-Pocket? They are really quite breathtaking!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS]The horny, idiotic super-spy is back in his first adventure since his last. It has been two years since he last foiled Dr. Evil and he was now in the lap of luxury with his new wife, Vanessa. Only, Austin soon finds out she's a fembot. She nearly kills him, then self-destructs. Austin feels forlorn, for about a second, then realizes he's single again, so he strolls through the hotel lobby buck naked.Meanwhile, Dr. Evil had also returned. He went on the Jerry Springer Show with his son Scott. Dr. Evil also had a clone made. He was exactly 1/8 his size. Dr. Evil names him Mini-Me. He has also concocted a brilliant plan for getting rid of Austin Powers. He developed a time machine and plans to go back to 1969 and steal Austin Power's mojo. So he travels back and arrives in his hollowed-out volcano lair. His henchmen, Number 2 and Frau Farbissina are there too, in younger form. Another henchman of Evil's was currently stealing the frozen Austin Powers' mojo: a portly Scotsman that weighs one metric ton. His name: Fat Bastard.Austin realizes his mojo is gone, so he too travels back to 1969, where he meets Felicity Shagwell and the two go off to fight Dr. Evil together; Dr. Evil has turned the moon into a "death star". He planned to go there and use a giant "laser" to destroy major cities. Austin and Felicity tail Dr. Evil to the moon and foil his evil plans. He escapes into space with Mini-Me and vows to catch Austin Powers someday, somehow. Back in 1999, Austin and Felicity have a run-in with Fat Bastard, who claims he isn't a very happy man. Scott Evil also finds out who his real mother is.This one's better than the first! I like the addition of Fat Bastard and Mini-Me. The story was much better than the first I suppose. There's a third installment of Austin Powers out there, called Austin Powers in Goldmember. I'm sure it's as good as Spy Who Shagged Me. Mike Myers plays Austin, Dr. Evil AND Fat Bastard. I guess that's why he's called a versatile actor. But anyway, I recommend this movie! See it whenever you can!!--</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for the politically correct or ideologically high-falutin'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I admit it, Austin Powers II is by no means high-brow comedy. You want high brow, look to Brit comedies like Keeping Up Appearances. This film is, in turn, slightly gross, entirely over the top, and amazingly funny. Myers returns as three characters, AP, Dr. Evil (who owns this movie, really), and the comical yet gross Fat Bastard. For those who think the fat character is insulting, just let me say this, lighten the hell up. In these incredibly boring, politically correct days, a comedy like this that makes you all at once snort your coke through your nose and say "ewww gross" all at once reminds you that you are alive. In my humble opinion, this is a most worthy sequel to the original, bigger and better, and even with the retreads of some gimmicks in AP I, I do think it's because they wanted to pay homage to the original, not rip it off. Myers is funny enough that he doesn't need to blatantly rip himself off, he wanted to do those jokes again because the audience (and probably himself) loved those jokes. While at the same time he forged ahead, focusing more on Dr. Evil and adding the character of Fat Bastard to the fold. No, it's not idological or even intelligent, it's unapologetic, good, clean, dirty fun. Mike Myers isn't taking it seriously, why are the critics? Take it in the spirit it's intended and you'll laugh your butt off. Well done, Mr. Myers, well done.</fullReview>

Mike Myers is a funny guy, I would be tempted to use the term "comic genius", though it's a term that's used far too often these days. Why he thought he would need to resort to toilet humour(sic, I'm Canadian) of this sort is beyond me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>that the "Fat Bastard" character nearly ruined this movie? Can someone explain to me how a person in a fat suit talking about "eating babies" is funny? How is seeing a 400 pound man naked in bed covered with chicken grease amusing? It's not, and these things were inserted to make everyone say (in unison) "gross". And you know what, that's ok in small doses, but it has to be funny, and this isn not. Sure, the first time you see the character you say to yourself, "hey look gang, the fat guy is really Mike Myers - wow!", but however monumental an achievement in make-up effects this may be, the gag quickly wears thin and each time this character entered a scene I cringed (not only that, but his Scottish accent was an inescapable and unfunny annoyance as well) Hey, I'm no prude, but this simply is not funny, and what's worse is, you know it is Mike Myers in a fat suit, so the illusion of the Fat Bastard character is broken very quickly. There's nothing wrong with a little shock value in a comedy, but come on, make it funny for chrissakes. I was looking forward to the upcoming AP3 sequel, but after seeing Fat Bastard in the trailer my hopes for a return to the halcyon days of Austin Powers 1 were greatly diminished.Still, while not on par with the refreshing original, the movie does have more than it's share of funny moments, and if you enjoyed the first you're likely to find this one amusing at the very least. There's a high degree of toilet humor evident throughout the film, and one can only wonder if these elements were added to accommodate the public demand for this brand of humor circa 1998-99 (what with movies like "There's Something About Mary" and "American Pie", et al generating tons of dough at the box office) While many of the jokes are flat out retreads of bits in the first film, many still work well and one gets the sense that they were simply lampooning the first film (what is refreshing are the Jerry Springer segments and while truly gimmicky, the addition of Mini-Me is a gas and adds another funny dimension to Dr. Evil)Overall, the movie is not bad...However, in this guy's opinion, Austin Powers 2 gives more credence to the old adage that with respect to film, most often the original is the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers's original _Austin Powers_ was not a great movie, but a good rental with some funny scenes. But even there, Myers often couldn't resist the temptation either to play his jokes out far longer than they needed (e. g. the "Sh!" scene between Dr. Evil and his son) or to telegraph them as if to make doubly sure that we got the (usually very obvious) point (e. g. when he has Dr. Evil _say_ something like "I'm going to place them in an easily escapable situation and submit them to an overly elaborate and exotic death." Gee, Mike, thanks for telling me, I might have missed it otherwise!) These faults mar the original movie a bit, but do not spoil it; but they damn well near sink _The Spy who Shagged Me_.Myers's technique for the sequel seems to be this: take every scene or gag that was even a bit funny in the first movie, and do them _again_, in exactly the same way, only draw them out twice as long. So we get a repetition of the "Sh!" scene, only it's "Zip it!" this time, and it lasts three minutes going on three years; we get a carbon copy of the "losing his head" bit, only with different gags; Mustafa takes even longer to die, in a scene which rapidly becomes more painful than funny; and so on, and on, and on. Fans of "The Simpsons" have a term for scenes like these, "rake scenes", based on a bit from an old episode where Sideshow Bob steps on about a dozen rakes in a row and gets thwacked on the head each time. Half the scenes in _The Spy who Shagged Me_ are "rake scenes".Worse, Myers's attempts at coming up with new comic characters for the most part fail. Fat Bastard (ooh, clever name!) is a one-joke character; he's there to be, well, fat and disgusting, and not to realize it, until the predictable scene where he starts berating himself for his obesity (hey, Mike--leave the fat jokes to Weird Al Yankovic, he's better at them.) Mini Me is a no-joke character; I suppose we're supposed to think a midget dressed up like Dr. Evil is _ipso facto_ funny, but he's not. (And, by the way, it doesn't even make any sense for Number Two, whose approach to world domination is always practical and eminently sensible, to fund the creation of Mini Me.) What I remember most about Mini Me is another "rake scene" (where he's beating up on Austin Powers and decks him in exactly the same way about ten times in a row) and the excruciating "You Complete Me" song of Dr. Evil, which I didn't think was the least bit amusing even with a few beers in me.Finally, Myers really missed an opportunity for some good jokes when Dr. Evil steals Austin's mojo. It would have been funny, for example, if Felicity, who is in bed with Austin at the moment of the theft, suddenly shrank away in disgust because she immediately realized what an ugly, charmless lout she was sleeping with. After all, isn't it the "mojo" that makes the otherwise graceless Austin Powers irresistible to women? But the loss of his mojo really doesn't affect Austin that much, and I think I know why. Myers forgot that the whole joke behind the original movie was that Powers was a babe magnet in his own mind but (at first impression anyway) intolerable to any perceptive woman in the 90's. I guess that Myers was so entranced by the success of the first movie, and intoxicated by the chance to cast his rather diminutive self as an unstoppable ladies' man, that he lost sight of this.About the only really good bits in the sequel are the credits sequence, where Austin dances through the hotel naked (and even this is merely a retread of a scene from the first movie), and the extended sequence where everyone is staring up at the sky and gawking at the "enormous--Willie! Willie Nelson!" That last sequence is long, but inventive, with an inspired use of cameos and an excellent punch line, and it's the only really new and original joke in _The Spy who Shagged Me_.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The outlandish, comic-book atmosphere that was just perfect in the first movie, just seems to be, well, old here. This movie should never have been made. That's all there is to it. The whole Austin Powers concept just should not be made into sequels. The initial shock value that we got from watching that rediculous world simply cannot be maintained by seeing it recreated on the screen over and over again.I felt the original was one of the most brilliant comedies of all time. It had a completely original concept, with its own style and even its own language at times. But I don't want to start growing used to that concept ! It inevitably will become dull after a while because the shock value will be gone.This movie has its own fun moments. But let's admit it folks, they could have come out with a sequel that had an even funnier script than the original, and we still would not have laughed as hard.The fact that the third one is coming out this summer is even more sad. They should have just left it alone and the name "Austin Powers" would be legendary today.</fullReview>

The jokes were almost always just repackaged ones from the first film, and if they werent that then they were just pathetic fart or crap jokes, which just arent funny. This film relies purely on immature humour which is designed only to humour small children so that it will make the production company money.

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: annoying repeat of 1st film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For every sequel movie, a decision has to be made. How close do we keep it to the original? Too distant is quite a creative risk which might result in a financial failure. Too close will lack the spark of originality that drew people to the first film to begin with. For example, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" was good but a little more gory and added dumb characters (the kid and the singer) who didn't do much. They then fixed those elements for the 3rd film and added the interesting father relationship, a risk but it made the 3rd film an equal of the first.Austin Powers 2 is perhaps the most risk-averse sequel I have ever seen. The film is so close to the original that each scene can be fitted to a gag in the first movie. I started to count the exact matches and gave up somewhere around 20. And -- in a fine tradition of Saturday Night Live -- typically the repeated jokes are not worth telling twice. Frankly I was shocked and disappointed given how original and compelling the 1st film was that they didn't take any risks with the 2nd. The failure is even worse than the failure of "Wayne's World 2" to live up to "Wayne's World", another Mike Myers film.To go from worse to worst, the cast did not seem to really be trying, especially "Seth Green" (Dr. Evil's son) whom I have recently forgiven due his role in the new movie "Rat Race". A parody can't get buy simply by chaotic lampooning -- there needs to be an underlying story and tension to the parody film.Who should see this film:-- nobody, but do go see the original if you haven'tI am forced to give "Austin Powers 2" a 4 out of 10. Skip it even if you feel obligated by the coolness of the first one.</fullReview>

This movie can nicely be summarized as "Mike Myers showing how to be completely UNfunny".

		<fullReview>Although it may be an almost carbon copy of the original Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, the Spy who shagged me is still, in some ways the better film. Whereas the first film was a spoof of the seventies super spy, James Bond and cheesy American TV, The Spy who shagged me sets out to spoof the original appeal of Powers, this means that most of the jokes are pretty much a re-hash of the first film, adding a certain gross-out effect to appeal to modern audiences, this being released in the same summer as American Pie ('99) and all, how could they resist the odd fat joke, or sh*t drinking gag. Most of the characters from the first movie appear here, with the exception of Elizabeth Hurley who passes on the powers-girl reigns to Heather Graham, as Felicity Shagwell (Oh Behave!). All though it was nice to see Ms Hurley fighting it out in skin-tight leather, Heather Graham is by far the more attractive actress, and the writers really allow her to get into her character and have some fun with it, taking more pot-shots at the role of the Bond-girl to the next step with the riff on Dr No's famous bikini scene. As with Myers' other sequel, Wayne's World 2, the joy of the film comes from the familiarity we all ready have with the characters, but taking the proceedings just a little bit further.One of the highlights of the first film that carries through to this one, is it's sanitised depiction of sixties London, I wasn't alive at the time but I'm sure there was usually more than six people on the street at one time, and most people would have gasped at seeing an anachronistic appearance from Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello at a road side bistro. But the film is so much fun that the repetition doesn't hamper the enjoyment one bit. From Austin dancing naked through a posh hotel, his "tackle" hilariously covered by the films titles, and props for some very funny sight gags, to the double-entendre of the huge rocket at the end, the spy who shagged me (or The Spy who `bleeped' me, as it was known in the UK) delivers laughs from start to finish.Myers' may be trying a little too hard to nab the "next Peter Sellers" tag, but he does well with both writing and performances, even if most audience members have trouble with his character Fat B*stard, a brutish, over-weight Scotsman who's catchphrase "I ate a Baby" is perhaps one of the funnies gross-out gags of the last five years. It may be more of the same, but the bespectacled super-sleuth Austin Powers is such an endearing character, what with his Connery chest hair and Jason King teeth, you can't help but warm to his sex-capades. And any film where Dr Evil talks "street" and does a rendition of Will Smith's "Just the two of us" with a two-foot version of himself has to be worth seeing. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boy, this movie stinks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That was my reaction as I left the theater that Saturday night. My view of the first one is that it was good, not as great as everybody said it was, but an enjoyable flick. So when I heard a second Austin Powers was coming, I thought that it would be as good as the first.I remember it well, sitting in that theater watching it and not hearing a single laugh except from someone who sounded like a five year old. The only part of the movie that got more than his laughs was the Springer bit. The rest of us just stared at it in disbelief. Bad jokes littered the screen and after the Austin has a drink scene, you know what I mean, I was ready to get up and leave. The only reason I stayed was because I thought that it couldn't get any worse, true, but it didn't get any better either.This was just one of those times where I understood the jokes and knew the jokes were supposed to be funny, but I'm just not laughing. Now a third movie is scheduled to come out soon, to that I say I don't care how good people say it is, I'll wait till the video comes out. However, I can't see how it can get worse that Austin Powers 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Improvement from the First</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AUSTIN POWERS 2: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED MESTARRING: MIKE MYERS, HEATHER GRAHAM, MICHAEL YORK, ROB LOWE, AND SETH GREENAfter I saw the first film, I said it was to probably be the stupidest film of that year. Then Austin Powers 2 came out and i saw it, and was impressed of the big improvement of the film since the first one. The only time I really laughed in the 1st film was when Mr. Powers said that he was Richie Cunnigham and that Vanessa was Oprah. In Austin Powers 2, though, there was 20 times more of the laughs.In Austin Powers 2, Austin has to travel back to the 60s and visit his frozen self because he has to stop Dr. Evil from taking over the world again. This film introduces you Felicity Shagwell, Fat B**tard, and Mini Me. I think that this film didn't get a lot of good reviews from Critics, but I guess I can't see what they see. All I can see is a funny film that succeded has a sequel.My Rating: *** stars out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin is back. Still not fit for a less then 10 year old but pretty good. Austin has flown back to the 60's because Dr. Evil has done the same. Even more sexual inuendo than the first, but not as good. This one had a worse plot than the first but was even more funnier.Austin traveled back to the 60's and learns that Dr. Evil is hiding. He steels his mojo, from his frozen body. Austin takes pictures of himself, and while admiring himself he realized that he's lost his mojo. Sexually hurt, he gets help from Filicity Shagwell.You have to love Mini-Me, Dr. Evil's clone. Austin's only fault is that you don't care about him during the movie.

		<shortDescription>Horrid. Unfunny. Embarrassing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those are three good words to describe the absolute travesty that is "The Spy Who Shagged Me". As I read the insane comments on this site claiming it was somehow BETTER than the original I have to ask--are you people nuts?If anything can be said about this train wreck of a movie, it is that you can't go wrong by appealing to the lowest common denominator. The original Austin Powers was by no means a smash-hit--it was more of a cult classic. When I saw the original, the theatre was empty except for myself and my friends. We laughed ourselves hoarse that afternoon. When I found out a sequel was in the works, I couldn't wait! Man, was I disappointed.Unlike the original, the theatre for AP2 was -packed-. Looking back, I now understand why. The creators of AP2 apparantly looked back at AP and decided to 'recreate' it with all of the intelligence, wittiness, and comic timing drained from it. Mix in some poo-poo humour at every instance and bingo! A questionable "hit" that appeals to the bottom of the barrel--no more worrying about making an excellent 'cult' movie.In AP2, they literally took the script from AP1, rewrote it slightly, and shoved it back down our throats. The gags are essentially EXACTLY the SAME, minus good timing, good taste, and intelligence. They removed the anachronism of having a 60's super-spy awaken in the 90's...hey, lets throw out our best premise! The fish-out-of-water bit is obviously too cerebral for the mass market...let's put Austin back in the 60's where everyone is reminded "HEY, IT'S THE 60'S, HOW CUTE! GET THE GAG?" at every step.Also gone is the intelligent female sidekick. Liz Hurley was likeable, intelligent and sexy. Her replacement? A dead-eyed blonde who stunk up the screen.Also, following in the footsteps of Scooby Do sequels, the writers committed another cardinal sin--they introduced a "new" character to spice things up. Actually, they introduced two. First, we have "mini-me", who was the most pointless character in this whole flick. He didn't do anything funny, he had no lines (and hence delivered no gags), and he was just an annoying gimmick. But what the heck...again, let's appeal to the bottom-drawer by throwing in midgets! Everyone likes midgets, right?And then there was the worst character in this whole movie...FAT BA***RD. WHY oh WHY was this character even made? Don't get me wrong--Scotsmen can be the funniest people on the planet (without even knowing it, often). Myers has shown on SNL that he can play the funny Scotsman to a tee...but that does not explain nor forgive Fat Ba***rd, the disgusting, obese, and howlingly un-funny bad guy on Dr. Evil's team. There wasn't a single thing funny about this character. I ground my teeth every time he hauled his bloated carcass up on the screen. The crowning moment was in the last 5 minutes of the movie, when Fatso gives an appalling speech about his self image. The writers should be ashamed of themselves for this little speech alone.To sum up, Austin Powers 2 is a train wreck. Gone is the funny tribute to James Bond; gone is the intelligent humour. Instead we have a grade-C script that is better suited to late-night FOX TV specials (right after COPS). I don't know how they managed to turn a charming, funny, original idea like Austin Powers in to this trailer-trash, but they succeeded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good, 7 out of 10 Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very good, 7 of 10 movie. Mike Myers is funny as Austin Powers (a parody of James Bond), an agent of the British government. He is even better as the evil villain, Dr. Evil. The funniest parts are, in fact, Dr. Evil's relationship with his son "Zip it!" and his appearance on the Jerry Springer show. Myers is at his worst with the gross character, Fat Bastard, who is disgusting and not that funny. There are too many jokes about feces and stuff like that which detract from the movie. The movie is a bit slow towards the end. But, it is quite funny and merits at least a 7. Heather Graham, a native Milwaukean, is a beautiful and excellent "Bond-like" girl in this movie and is brimming with optimism and charm. Mini-me and Dr. Evil singing "What if God Were One of Us?" were also highlights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good moments, but could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've noticed from the user comments that this is a movie people love or they loathe. I don't hate this movie, but I do think Mike Myers wasted what could have been a wonderful chance for satire on bathroom jokes. The good news is that the enlarged budget shows, giving the movie an even more surreal look that enhances the 60's. Mike Myers does pull off three characters very well. Dr.Evil and Scott Evil are great characters who are given more time to shine on screen than the first Austin Powers. I actually didn't mind the reused jokes. When ever there is a sequel it's always pretty much a rehash of the first. But two things about this movie really got on my nerves. First was all the gross jokes. I didn't drink coffee for three months after watching this movie in the theater. Even my nine year brother who loves gross out humor thought the movie went overboard with the bodily fluid jokes. Two I thought Heather Graham gave a bland performance. She's a good actress in supporting roles, but in this movie she just seemed to there for her beauty. There is little chemistry between her and Myers. I think if that is the spy who shagged me came out after the world is not enough her performance could have been looked at as a spoof of Denise Richards terrible performance. Myers and Liz Hurley were far better in the first movie. But the sad thing is that I'm actually looking forward to the third Austin Powers next summer. I just hope Mike Myers learns from the mistakes of this movie.</fullReview>

Mike Myers plays Austin with more confidence but Dr Evil and Mini-Me are hilarious. Fat Bastard is a disappointment, not very funny.The film does have problems when there is no joke and any serious moment is played rather dull.The film pokes fun at You Only Live Twice and Diamonds are Forever plus a myriad of other movies.The wide-screen frame is used very well, the photography isn't bad, nice colour rendition. The Special Effects rely too much on fake CGI.

You could probably cut out the stupid parts, and have maybe ten minutes of actual comedy, which mainly consists of Dr. Evil battling with his son Scott.

		<fullReview>This sequel is much better than the original. Why? Oh, because now we have the pleasure of watching characters like Mini-Me, Fat Bastard, and more (yes!) much more Dr. Evil. This time Dr. Evil steals the show completely. The bald man rules. His scenes with the minuscule Mini-Me are already classics. I've never laughed so much in my life. Thank you Mr. Myers. Belonging the golden generation of SNL(people like David Spade, Adam Sandler, Chris Farley), that made all of us roll a lot on the floor on saturdays of the mid-nineties, Mike Myers with this film definitely proved to everybody that he is the best comedian alive. His talent is unquestionable. There are so many hilarious moments in this movie. Let me see some of them: Jerry Springer Show("My Dad is evil and wants to take over the world"), The tent scene, The fight of the century: Austin Vs. Mini-Me("Poor little"), Scott Evil's complaints("Why don't you just kill them?"), Will Mustafa Ferrel, etc, etc, etc, ... )The fantastic soundtrack(Lenny Kravitz, Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharad, R.E.M., Quincy Soul Bossa Nova Jones, Green Day, Mrs. Madonna and many others) really transports us from the agitate nineties to the delicious sixties. And how wonderful are Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Kristen Johnston and Gia Carides! Talking about woman I prefer the goddess Liz Hurley but Heather Graham is perfect as Powers-Girl.For those guys who didn't like this masterpiece of enjoyment I'm going to say only one thing: "YOU DON'T HAVE SENSE OF HUMOR I THINK YOU'VE LOST YOUR MOJOS!".For the guys who loved AP2: "LET'S WAIT FOR THE NEXT AUSTIN POWERS' SHAGADELIC ADVENTURE!"For the babes: "OHH BEHAVE!!!!!!!"10/10 ***** Best of genre</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although most sequels are known for not being as good as the original, this would be one a select group of sequels that are actually better than the original. Austin Powers 2 is a hilarious film, that relies on in-yer-face slapstick, rather than 'very clever witt' - but that's all it needs to become a huge film!Although, a lot of the jokes from Austin Powers 2, were pre-used in the first Austin movie (Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery) - it doesn't matter - there's no denying that this film is *VERY* funny! Mike Myers ('Wayne's World') is hugely funny as Austin, Dr. Evil and especially Fat Bastard, and Heather Graham ('Boogie Nights') is also laugh-a-licious!Seth Green ('Buffy The Vampire Slayer') returns to Austin Powers 2 as Dr. Evil's estranged son Scott Evil, and Elizabeth Hurley ('EdTV') returns in a small role as Vanessa Kensington (from the first film).While the plot and script aren't exactly mature, and anyone (and I do mean *anyone*!) can follow it, it is, like I said, good for a few laughs - and it's subtle charm make it an unsuspecting film favorite.Austin is a great character, but the 2 characters I thought stole the limelight in this particular Austin Powers, is cute Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) and Fat Bastard (also played by Myers) - they added a certain, extra element that was missing from the first one.So if you liked the first one, you'll love the sequel!! It's great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than the first one! (SPOILER ALERT)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the spy who shagged me is so much better than "international man of mystery" i wasnt even going to watch it because the first one was so boring, but a friend of mine told me it was a lot better and funnier. he was right! i laugh my butt off every time i watch this movie! Seth Greens charachter Scott Evil is my favorite! i love the parts where Scott and Dr. Evil are fighting! i escpecially love it when Scott ridicules him, and says things like "ripoff!" and "you're a dope." my favorite part though is when Mini-Me gets tossed out of his chair and Dr. Evil is like, "MINI-ME? would somebody put a fricken bell on him or somthing?" Austin, on the other hand is as, if not more boring and stupid as in the first one. his saving grace is Felicity,who is smart and funny,as well as being pretty. I love this movie and i give it a 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT! i liked this movie even better than the first one! especially since Seth Green had more screen time. i loved Verne Troyer as Mini-Me, and Mike Myers is as always hysterical as Austin and Dr.Evil, as well as Fat Bastard. my favorite parts have to be when Scott and Dr. Evil are fighting with each other and Scott says such things as "ripoff!" and "You're a dope" and things like that. i also loved the scene in the tent!!!!!!!! that was so funny! my favorite line is when mini-me gets tossed out of his chair and Dr. Evil is like"MINI-ME?!? Would somebody put a frickin' bell on him or somthing!" i was laughing so hard i almost was drooling! So grab some knapkins and get ready for some serious laughs</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just like the first one, except it's not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked "Austin Powers: International man of mystery". It had silly, juvenile jokes, but they were cleverly executed, and the movie felt spirited and just plain fun. I had heard bad things about the sequel, but figured it couldn't be THAT bad... well, it is. It's that bad, and then some.The jokes are in several cases EXACTLY the same as in the first movie. It was funny then, it's not funnny to see the same thing again. Plus, the old jokes, and the few new ones, go on way too long, just to fill the running time with something, I guess. I couldn't tell you what the story is, I don't think anyone involved even cared. The new characters, Mini-Me and Fat Bastard, aren't funny. They don't do anything funny, they are not in funny situations, and they say nothing funny. I guess we're suppoed to be amused by the sheer sight of a really short guy and a really fat one. Yeah, that lasts for about 2 seconds.I hated this movie, it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Rent the first one again, it's the same movie only better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far superior to the original in every respect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I admit that I enjoyed the first Austin Powers, it certainly had it's fair share of problems. About 65% of the jokes hit the mark, but the rest seemed somewhat forced or poorly written and executed. Plus, I'm not that huge of an Elizabeth Hurley fan, so she didn't come across as sexy or assured as she have.Well, it's apparent that for the sequel the filmmakers/writers sat down and made a list of what worked and what didn't. I say this because Austin Powers 2 is hilarious and well executed every step of the way.Here's a quick list of what is great about the sequel:1) Much more Dr. Evil! I would estimate that he probably is on screen about twice as much as Austin. Not that this is a bad thing since he was easily the funniest in the first film.2)Mini-Me. in an inspired bit of casting, Dr. Evil gets a clone that's 1/8 his size and the interplay between him, his clone and his son Scott is priceless and hysterical.3)Rob Lowe as the young Number-2. I really think his dead-on and hilarious impersonation of a young Robert Wagner was really overlooked.4)Heather Graham! What a woman, perfect in every way. Plus she pulls the role off very well without coming across as a ditz. She gets plenty of room to show off her.....ahem, assets.5)Scott. almost as much a scene stealer as Mini-Me.6)The penis joke sequences. comic timing at it's best and most hilarious.The only things I thought were slightly weak was Fat Bastard and a couple of sequence involving Felicity and Austin, but overall the movie is great from beginning to end.and the best part is that it's gets even funnier with each viewing.Rating:9</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first, laughs a-plenty!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't seen this film since the Montreal premiere, so I borrowed it from a friend and prepared to wonder why I ever found it funny...I was pleasantly surprised. It was as hilarious the second time 'round as it was the first. Few films make me laugh out loud, especially more than once, but this one did. Yes, much of the humour is juvenile, did anyone expect otherwise? This film shows that it's possible to be crass and hilarious all at the same time, without going too far overboard (though someone should shoot Mike Myers for some of those purposely horrid puns!).The cameos were great (Will Ferrell was fab), the Jerry Springer scenes are awesome, Seth Green is great as usual...and Heather Graham? Well she's Heather Graham, 'nuff said. All in all, a great cheeze-filled film to just kick back and relax to, one that numbs your mind but perks up your laughing genes;) 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was something quite refreshing about "International Man of Mystery" - sure the jokes where on the whole dreadful and the story ridiculous, but it had a charm. This sequel is the same film with over-laboured jokes and none of the charm of the first film, it comes across as nothing more than a bunch of badly constructed and generally unfunny sketches. Frankly disappointing.If the best part of a film involves a silhouetted character seemingly inserting and removing objects from/into the bottom of another you have to accept that you have not witnessed a great film. To be honest it is not even good.Four and that's probably being kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Austin Powers was funny, but the second installment is even better! Myers shows just how versatile he is with the roles of Austin, Fat Bastard, and, perhaps the funniest character in the movie, Dr. Evil. This movie is a riot because Myers has a great sense of humor, but some of the scenes are a little below the belt (ie Felicity's sex scene with Fat Bastard). All in all, this is one of the funniest movies I've seen. From 1-10, I'd give it an 8.</fullReview>

There should be a sign saying, "Check in your brain here, will return to you after the movie." This movie is one non stop laugh after another. I will admit it does push and I think go over the limits of its PG-13 rating. The one thing bad about this is the fact it gets to vulgar at some points. If you can overlook the some of the vulgar jokes then you might like this. Warning: Do not watch with little kids. Overall a very funny satire. I give it a 8 out of 10. Austin Powers is a spoof classic.</fullReview>

The writers came up with some good stuff in that movie. I feel the writers should have spent more time on the story in the sequel instead of worrying about pumping out a sequel as soon as possible before the hype died down. If they couldn't come up with new ideas, then don't make another one! Also (spoilers ahead), I hated the way they got rid of Elizabeth Hurley's character. That practically made the entire first movie obsolete. I'm sure they are planning a third movie, and if it is as disappointing as the second, the series is, in my mind, finished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Comedy in Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a movie to top the outrageously bad "Me, Myself and Irene." Like the Jim Carrey film, A.P--the Spy who Shagged Me piles on the jokes, one unfunny joke after another. Who cares if the joke isn't funny the first time?! I thought the original A.P. was charming enough, but that movie was basically an extended Saturday Night Live skit. I only saw the sequel because friends told me it was better than the original. They must have seen a different movie. This is easily the worst comedy sequel since Nat'l Lampoon's European Vacation, and for many of the same reasons: Overdone, infantile gags; unfunny leading actor, who is normally funny; and (its worse offense), it is BORING. I am shocked at how well this movie did--then again, I think people just saw it because of its relentless hype. Clearly we will be seeing part III. I think I'll just watch the overlooked and underappreciated "So I Married an Axe Murdered" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can i say that hasn't already been said by the uneasily pleased? Austin Powers 2, in the predominance, is commercialism at it most insultive. Good taste AND good quality have clearly been overlooked, and it's a mish-mash of mainly bad jokes and intelligence insulting scenes. No fluidity at all.But what was hilarious was just about every scene involving Dr Evil and his gaggle of incompetent sidekicks. The Jerry Springer scene was hilarity itself, and the peculiarities of Evil himself could quite easily filled the entire ninety-one minutes of the movie. The movie itself should basically have been Dr Evil orientated, its as simple as that. He saved the first movie, and in a sense, he saved this one also, from being a complete disaster that is.All in all, worth watching just for the Dr Evil scenes, though the undeniable brilliance of Evil doesn't detract from the film's overall shabby feeling, which Myers himself should never have allowed to occur.5/10 (without Dr Evil, 2/10.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rarely is a sequel as good as its predecessor; in this case, it's better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Diehard movie critics are apt to believe that a sequel can never be quite as good as its predecessor. This is a particular stereotype with comedy films; the energy expended on making the first movie humorous becomes dried-up and dull by the time the creators get around to scripting the second. There are, however, exceptions to this generalization, and it is these rarities that keep moviegoers coming back for more. The film, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, complete with a motley crew of characters and upbeat music, proves to be a fresh twist on the overly-used 'superhero saves the world' genre of movie.The continuation from the first film reveals that Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, the very same who had been frozen in 1967 after a decisive battle with his nemesis, Dr. Evil, was unthawed in the nineties. The year is 1999, and the sixties spy leads quite the fulfilled lifestyle, married to his former partner-in-crime, Vanessa.Alas, Austin's happiness is shattered by the return of the aforementioned Dr. Evil. The villainous foe, thought to also be cryogenically frozen, has recently escaped, and, with the help of equally evil sidekicks, aspires to rule the earth. Between Frau Forbissina, Evil's German girlfriend-on-the-side, Number Two, his curiously-unnamed, groveling henchman, Scott, his too-cool-to-be-evil teenage son, played by Seth Green, and Mini-Me, his 1/8-sized clone, it would seem Austin has bitten off more than he can chew.Mike Myers does a splendid job in his role as the shagging spy, as well as Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard, the one-ton wonder who steals Austin's "mojo." Without what Dr. Evil refers to as "the libido, the lifeforce, the essence, the right stuff, what the French call a certain, 'I don't know what?'" the super-swinging Austin loses his touch. He sets out on a journey through time, and with the assistance of CIA super-sleuth, Felicity Shagwell, brilliantly executed by the beautiful Heather Graham, returns to his pad in 1969 to once again decide the fate of the world.Arguably, The Spy Who Shagged Me is fresh, new, and funnier than the first of the Powers flicks. The addition of Fat Bastard and Mini-Me, as well as shocking secrets revealed about our favorite first-movie characters, (including the truth about Scott's mother) takes the overall quality of this piece head-and-shoulders above its predecessor. Complete with new music from Madonna, "Beautiful Stranger," and the cover version of "American Woman" by Lenny Kravitz, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is, to put it in clearest terms, "groovy, baby!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong. This was a good movie. However, it doesn't even hold ground to the first one. I've heard people say "Better than the first!", and I think, "What??"The biggest problem that this film suffers is the commerciality of it. The fun of "International Man Of Mystery" was that it was quirky, non-mainstream, and a little weird (in a very good way). However, Mike Myers apparently decided to abandon the cleverness of the first film and write a bland commercial movie instead. An example is the recycling of jokes. Now, Mike Myers is a very funny man, and I KNOW that he could have easily come up with new pieces of humor. Unfortunately, most of the bits in this movie are recycled from the first ("Zip it!", "You're one groovy baby...baby" and the opening sequence come to mind, among countless others). I think the reason he did this is because it a) takes less effort, and b) takes less risks. While this is good for a mainstream audience, people like myself, who were fans of Austin waaaay before it got popular, feel cheated. I know many people will kill me for this, but Mini-Me might possibly be the worst part of this movie. I admit, I do get a kick out of seeing a small fellow like him, but stretching that gag throughout the movie is tiresome. There's no wit involved, just physical comedy. I'm not saying I hated this movie. There are two very funny bits: The tent scene (I was laughing my a** off during that) and the brilliant scene with the rocket in the air...you know what I'm talking about. But these original bits of humor were too few and far. I hope that for the third "Powers", Myers resorts back to his fresh and original writing, instead of just trying to please the general audience.</fullReview>

I like the Star Wars spoof, and the Rocket scene where the scene is cut before they can say what the rocket resembles, especially sence it almost always opened up with a substitute name, although in one scene they flat out said it. I'm surprised this Movie wasn't rated R what with all the toilet humour and Docter Evil Having Ex-Say with his co-worker. and Felicity Shagwell was More Austin's Match then Vanessa, in My opinion.

		<shortDescription>Funny in parts, but far too much re-hashing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A number of people said this one was better than the first one. It certainly struck me as more action-packed, but, like many sequels, had some serious flaws that were very irritating while watching it.They obviously needed a way to make Austin single again, but the way they did it was totally unbelieveable. Vanessa a fembot? She was definitely all human in the first one. Goodness sake, she was a 'bright young agent' who flared up when she heard Austin shagged Alotta, and she even had a mother! This bit was nonsense.The worst part I noticed was this: in Austin Powers 1, they had a number of jokes, most of which were quite funny. In this one, Myers has unfortunately adopted the policy of doing at least three versions of every joke from the original. Seeing them again ONCE was bad enough (particularly Dr Evil firing expressions at Scott such as 'zip'). Why was he unable to come up with some new laughs? I can only remember one, comments being made on the launch of Dr Evil's rocket, and it was very funny.Dr Evil actually does a good job in this one, and is probably the best part of the film, but I felt that liaising with Frau Farbissina was too far out of character. His son Scott was just a headache. Worst of all, two new bad-guys - Mini-me and Fat Bastard - are brought in, and they completely detract from the film. Mini-me just stands there looking obnoxious for most of the film, when he isn't harassing poor old Scott. Fat Bastard is a sickening creation who should have been shot the moment he stepped on stage. However, I must congratulate Myers again, for I would never have guessed it was he who played that part.Austin's role seems rather boring by comparison, particularly his relationship with Felicity Shagwell. True, she is considerably prettier than Vanessa Kensington (or could she just be a better manufactured fembot?), but otherwise lacks distinguishing characteristics and it is clear from the word go that she and Austin are going to get along just fine.*** WARNING, POTENTENTIAL SPOILERS ***Austin's mission was to recover his mojo stolen by Dr Evil. He failed in this mission and what happened instead was poorly explained. Something of a waver in an otherwise reasonable plot.By introducing time travel, this movie added confusion. It seems that by moving around, Austin can be in two places at once, possibly more. This could ultimately lead to millions of Austin powers and utter chaos. It is a problem that crops up in most time travel movies and is something best left to the imagination.There were also good bits to this movie, indeed it was bright and entertaining, and more upbeat than the first, but it falls short for numerous reasons as discussed above. Having seen this movie through only once, I would probably be prepared to see it again, if only 1 time more.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only in America could a one-and-a-half joke premise be stretched out over two barely amusing movies. It's difficult to ponder how a rough draft-quality script like this could generate over $200 million in domestic ticket sales. It's also sad to think that the only two jokes I laughed at in the entire picture were probably made up on the spot. Considerably better-mounted than it's frugal predecessor, the second "Austin Powers" movie is still a pallid parody of 60's spy films, tolerable only for Mike Myers' irresistible characterizations of Powers and his arch-nemesis, Dr. Evil. Myers' talents as a performer are inestimable, to be sure, but one can live off the drippings of luck for only so long before people demand something substantive. In "Powers II" (and "I", as well), the scenario is barely held together by a string of frequently tasteless bathroom humor; you'd think with his Scottish ancestry, Mr. Myers could elect to take the high road once in a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never figured out what drew me to see the second after hating the first. I must have been expecting more, something that is actually "funny".I was very wrong.I am surprised that pretty well all the comments here are "Better than the first!", "Too hilarious!", "How can anyone not laugh?" etc.I'm beginning to wonder how old the people making this junk as box office smash are. 10? 11? 12? 13? Possibly 14? I know I'm in the right age group. To top it off, I myself am only 15, so what am I missing here? Something.At least I slightly (if even slightly) laughed a few times at the first, but for this one, I didn't even smile. This is just a repeat of the original, but worse. It even has the intelligence (or thus lack of) to insult overweight people this time, and also has the same old women as sex items deal from the original.Mike Myers is making an idiot of himself in this horse feces. Tell him to stick to Wayne's World and SNL.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've waited so long to see the sequel to one of the best comedies ever, and after seeing it, my first thought was: deja-vu all over again? I was surprised that many gags from part 1 were recycled or varied slightly. While this is actually the worst you can do in a sequel, it works here and makes, combined with fresh, new ideas, an extremely entertaining movie. Also thanks to the cast. Nearly everybody from the original is back, and they show that they had fun at filming. They're so funny, like Frau Farbissina or Scott Evil, they could have their own movie. While part 1 was Austin's show, this one is all Dr. Evil. Myers delivers such a hilarious performance that it's impossible to dislike him. He's like Ally McBeal in a Bond movie. The relationship between him and Scott is the funniest I've seen for years. So why isn't it better than the original? Well, many jokes are too dumb and vulgar, which is not necessary, because the basic idea is a clever spoof without humor like `American Pie'. And the german dubbed version is (once again) really bad, especially Austin's voice, part 1 was better.Anyway, both movies are definitely worth seeing, I enjoyed the heck out of it, and although the original is the better one, this one is also a must-see! Can't wait for part three! 8/10</fullReview>

Also, I believe that someone on the outside gave Mike Myers team orders to muddy the waters (literally in one scene that should have been left on the cutting room floor) in terms of content. All that's left is MM as Dr. Evil in some of the best lines with Tim Robbins as the President. To believe my 10 year old cousin liked this over the first.

		<fullReview>Okay, maybe I have no sense of humor. Maybe I'm a relatively young stick in the mud. Or maybe, just maybe, I'm just unlucky enough to live through the fin of this siecle when decadence and debauchery are mistaken for creativity. And maybe I just don't get why they keep giving Saturday Night Live people megabucks to do these movies, when Saturday Night Live has seriously sucked for the last decade.First off, Austin Powers breaks the first rule of comedy: a joke is only funny three times. After that, you're just laughing out of habit. The double entendre sequence about Doctor Evil's rocket is no more than an example of what a good thesaurus can accomplish. We don't need ten minutes of it the first time, and we don't need to hear it again (and again and again) later on.I'm glad that Mike Myers is comfortable enough with his body to do the scenes he does, but I could have lived a long and happy life without ever seeing his bare gut. Again, the sequence in which numerous cutesy ways are employed to hide his "naughty bits" went on longer than it needed to.I have now seen Heather Graham in two movies, this and "Bowfinger". The third time had better be the charm, but I can't imagine the word "charm" being applied to this graduate of the Alicia Silverstone School of Non-acting. She is nothing short of dreadful in every scene she's in.As a spoof of spy movies, it falls far short of others of various genres ("Scream"'s tweaking of horror movies is a good example). For gross-out humor, it lacks the wit and enjoyment of "There's Something About Mary." This is not a movie that's going to age well, and, ten years from now, don't be surprised if you look back at this and wonder, "What were we thinking??"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An embarrassment to the integrity of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lacking much of the sophisticated undercurrent of the original Austin Powers, The Spy Who Shagged Me's formula was obvious: take the first one's more intelligent gags out, put some crass and juvenile ones in to take their place, and put Austin back on the market to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Now maybe I'm overrating 1997's International Man of Mystery just a bit; but what people don't seem to realize is that underneath all the "yeah baby"s and the crude (but hilarious) sex/bathroom jokes, there was an appeal, a subtlety to the original Austin Powers that made it attractive to teenagers AND adults. Sadly, that quality is gone from the sequel, and The Spy Who Shagged Me finds the often brilliant Mike Myers sinking from parodying spy films and pop culture to parodying himself. And that's a real shame.Of course, Austin Powers 2 does have its moments; Dr. Evil is good as always (though a bit over-the-top this time around, and sometimes in a bad way); Fat I-don't-know-if-they-allow-the-next-word-on-IMDb is disgusting but hilarious; Will Ferrell is back for another scene-stealing turn as Mustafa that is quite possibly funnier than the first movie's similar scene; and there's always Heather Graham. I don't think the last one NEEDS an explanation. But no matter how many gags there are that WORK in this movie, and there are probably more good ones than bad, there's always a handful of glaringly unfunny scenes that make the whole movie look bad. A scene in which woman is shot numerous times, stabbed, blown up with a bazooka and thrown out of a window, then used by Powers to cushion his landing, comes to mind. And yes, you're supposed to laugh, although for me it seemed terribly out-of-place; both disturbingly violent considering this is a fun comedy movie and cartoonishly bizarre, not making any sense whatsoever in the context of the movie.The film also seems to rely on the older movie's jokes a lot, also, which is fine for continuity's sake. But the jokes all fall flat this time, particularly in one scene, a rehash of the original movie's parody of film spies' tendency to crack morbid jokes after a villian gruesomely dies. The first time a guy got his head bit off by a shark; the second time a guy falls into a pit full of burning coals. Despite the different circumstances, both scenes are more or less identical, but for some reason, this time around it just isn't funny. For one thing, Myers seems less "into" the character of Austin, and because of that, his jokes and quips are not funny. And that, more than anything else, is what makes this sequel pale in comparison to the original.Basically, Austin Powers 2 is a great night out, or, since it's on video now, a night in with friends. But as a movie, it just isn't up to snuff. And no matter how much stool Powers drinks, how many times Mini-Me flips someone off and how many balls appear to drop put of Austin's silhouetted butt, I can't help but think that Myers could have done better. The Spy Who Shagged Me could've been great. Instead, it went for cheap laughs and got them; too bad I can never remember them the next morning. Six out of ten, folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sequel is good but not as funny as the first. Where I was rolling in the aisles during the first one, the second one left me kind of empty. The only thing that kept me interested was Mike Myers as Dr. Evil and Mini- Me. The chemistry between those two are hilarious! Some of the jokes were funny but it seems liked the actors were stretching for things.PLOT: Austin Powers must go back to the 60's to rescue his mojo from Dr. Evil who has stolen it.VIEWS: Mike Myers is so funny as Dr. Evil. You could make a whole movie about him without Austin Powers. Some of the jokes were not needed, they are crude and just there for the shock value. But one of the best actors in the movie is Rob Lowe who stole all his scenes even with Mike Myers as Dr. Evil in it. Definitely watch for him and for Mike Myers as Dr. Evil. Heater Graham as Austin Powers love interest is not good as Elizabeth Hurley from the first one. But I would watch it again.SCENES TO WATCH FOR: The Jerry Springer show, "Two of Us" song with Dr. Evil and Mini Me let alone with any scene with the both of them together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how Myers does it, but this guy just goes from strength to strength.Seeing Man of Mystery before The Spy Who Shagged me is a must if you are to really benefit from some of the gags in this film.Austin Powers International Man of Mystery sets the scene with Austin being cryogenically frozen in the 60's in case his nemesis Dr Evil should return. Austin is Thawed out and Myers then has the oppurtunity to have fun with the 60's using a backdrop of the 90's. In the Spy Who Shagged me, the reverse happens and Austin must travel back in time, to the sixties to retrieve his "Mojo".Both films brilliantly parody 60's spy movies such as Dr No, You only live twice,In like Flint e.t.c.Since the first movie introduced the characters, Myers and Roach have been given more freedom to develop the relationships between the characters and this is where the film gets top marks. Some of the funniest parts of the film involve the sibling rivalry between Scott (Dr Evils real son) &amp; Mini-Me (Dr Evils 1/8 sized clone).The relationship between Dr Evil &amp; Frau Farbissener takes a new twist and a nice little parody of office relationships develops. I didn't even really appreciate that part, until I watched the film again on VHS. I just love it when Frau Farbissener says "No Dr Evil, I'm Laaaaaaaaate!"The lovely Heather Graham as Felicity Shagwell replaces the slightly wooden Elizabeth Hurley as the love interest, but once again the tables are turned, after all Austin is back in the sixties and Felicity ends up being more liberated than Austin.Dr Evil is easily Myers greatest comic creation to date, there is so much more that this character has to offer, that I sincerely hope there will an Austin Powers 3,4,5 e.t.c.Myers and Roach have combined to pack a nice balance of visual and non visual jokes with a big dollop of toilet humour and guarenteed that this video will not be collecting dust on my video shelf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Wayne's World I and II, I decided to rent this movie. Mike Myers was fantastic as Wayne, so I was expecting something close to (or even better than) Wayne's World. Looking the film up in this database added to my expectations, since I generally trust the ratings, and the film had received an average rating grater than the two Wayne's World films. After watching the film, I have to say this:Are you people out of your minds? HOW can this film be better that Wayne's World? It's been about three years since I saw Wayne's World I and II, and I can remember almost all of it (and still laugh). Only three hours have passed and my mind is trying to erase this painful experience. I haven't seen the first Austin Powers movie, but if it is in any way similar to this one, I honestly doubt I will risk exposing myself to such a torture again.For the record, I gave this film a 4, just because of the `behind the tent' scene (which was indeed hilarious, an oasis in a film where laughs are scarcer than water in the Sahara). Also for the record, I gave Wayne's World I and II a 9 and a 8 respectively.All Wayne's World fans, stay away from this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems like this is a backlash review site---most of the reviewers seem to hate this movie. Well, as popular as it was, there must be some people who loved it, and I'm one of them. I thought the first Austin Powers movie was OK, and there were definitely some very funny bits, but it seemed to be more geared around bathroom humor, and beating the same joke to death. However, it did establish the characters and situation, and these are developed further and very cleverly in The Spy Who Shagged Me. Contrary to some earlier posts, I thought the additions of Mini Me and Fat Bastard were classic for Mike Myers' style of humor, and good slapstick in general. The key to the movie, though, was Dr. Evil. Every single scene he is involved in is hilarious, because he initially appears to be an all-powerful evil leader (like most James Bond villains), but actually turns out to be just as frail, flawed, and human, as anyone else. The humor comes when he acts like a "regular guy" (or a troubled father), with dialogue, facial expressions, and body english like you might see in a local bowling league. Unfortunately, the character of Austin Powers seems to have been developed about as far as he can, and he exists now just as a vehicle for Dr. Evil scenes. I thought the movie was funny the first time I saw it, but I have watched it four more times on video since then, and as I continue to notice some of the subtle points, I actually appreciate it more. Oddly enough, the jokes haven't gotten old yet, and I've noticed that there really aren't too many slow points like the first one had (it's hard to keep a movie funny from start to finish). I think the people who dislike the movie either don't like gross/bathroom humor, which is understandable, or they are trying to overanalyze it instead of just sit back and laugh. Myers wasn't trying to make "The Godfather", just a good, funny film. I, for one, think he succeeded. By the way, I'm not 13; I'm 36.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Powers 1 or 2? I can't tell the difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, honestly, thinking about the first Austin Powers movie script, could we even imagine that there would be any originality in the sequel? Well, I didn't have much hope, but I was -- nevertheless -- quite disappointed when I realized that there would hardly be no new joke at all in "The Spy Who Shagged Me". Well, I *did* like the first film, so I guess you can say I liked the sequel as well -- as I said, they're basically the same film. I especially liked the scenes with Dr Evil and Scott Evil (Seth Green) -- hilarious is all I have to say about that. Heather Graham unfortunately lacked any feeling for her role as Felicity Shagwell -- she was a bad choice for the part even though she looks like she belongs in those sixties' outfits. And the use of Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On" was brilliant! That really made me laugh. (5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers, the Spy who Shagged me is a far better film than i was expecting. I had read a few reviews and they were not brilliant but i have to say i loved it and thought it was a lot better than the first movie.There are some really funny moments in this film were you cannot help but laugh out loud. I loved Mini me and Fat Bastard and Heather Graham is a sight for sore eyes. The story revolves around Dr evil who invents a time machine to go back to 1969 and steal Austin Powers " Mojo". Some of the scenes are extremely funny , especially the ones with Jerry Springer and Dr Evil and the Show stealer for me , Fat Bastard. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish this movie had been *all* about Dr. Evil. What a great characterization! The movie came alive for me when Evil and his "posse" were on the screen. Austin Powers, however, was a complete bore and while Heather Graham looked the part, her performance was lackluster and she and Powers lacked chemistry. And as for the bathroom humor...ick!If there is a Part 3, hopefully Austin Powers will be frozen again and the movie will focus on the family dynamics of Dr. Evil and son.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers again demonstrates the style he perfected in Wayne's World: cramming 10 minutes of humor into a feature-length movie. The tent-silhouette routine is creative, and the rapid-fire comments on Dr. Evil's rocket are hilarious. Aside from that, this is 95 minutes of tedious jokes, sendups aimed at 10-year-olds, and pointless characters -- the worst of whom is Mini-Me, whose only apparent function is to look small.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure the A.P. series is pretty funny... but in AP2 I would much rather see Dr.Evil throughout the whole movie then Austin Powers at all. AP is funny, but hes annoying, esp. with the girls climbing all over him... Dr. Evil on the other hand is hilarius. Every Scene with him in it is funny... I think Mike Myers should drop the AP bit and exclusivly do Dr. Evil in a new Dr. Evil movie... now that would def. be funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS ONE IS VERY SHAGADELIC BUT LOSES ITS MOJO AT TIMES</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were times when "The Spy Who Shagged Me" was very groovy, enormously psychedelic, definitely switched on, for sure my kind of bag baby. However, at other times it was like this cat just got too much into the slapstick silly humor that ruins many films; which is definitely not my sort of bag baby. I do have to acknowledge Mr. Mike Myers for the immense diversity he brings in both the Austin and Dr. Evil characters. Speaking of our favorite evil medical school graduate, let me just say that Dr. Evil was hilarious. He was actually more switched on than Austin in this film. Also the characters of Scott Evil, Fra Faubrisima, and Number Two continue to bring this series a very shagadelic supporting cast. The biggest or should I say smallest powerful debut was that of the crowd favorite Mini-me. Mini-me defintely provides big laughs. The one bastard they should have gotten rid of was the Fat Bastard character. Nevertheless, "Austin Powers:The Spy Who Shagged Me" is one you should swing over and check out! Yea baby! **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't until the end credits that I realized why the Academy had nominated the film for Make-Up. Until then I hadn't realized that Mike Myers played a third character - Fat Bastard. I assumed they had found some poor grossly overweight actor willing to be shamed and humiliated because of his bulk. Clever Meyers plays the man - totally unrecognizable - in a body suit that is incredibly realistic and incredibly gross. Fooled me - but really, Academy, a nom for this achievement sinks your own taste to a new low. I still think Myers very clever - both his creations of Austin and Dr. Evil are marvelously rich, though I much prefer Dr. Evil as his funniest creation yet. Certainly not a great film, but there are some very funny bits in it. (Be warned, lots of scat humor).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers and the gang are back in a sequel to the ultra-popular Austin Powers replaying the same old sight gags with only a few new twists. In Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin is still battling Dr. Evil in a story line that, once again, plays second fiddle to the laughs.The film opens up where the last one left off, in the honeymoon suite of Austin and Vanessa. A problem with the remote control reveals that Vanessa is actually a dreaded Fembot, planted by Dr. Evil; a convenient twist to say the least as Austin is back to being a swinging single. Dr. Evil, meanwhile, cannot comprehend the financial empire that has grown around him, as he is still caught up in trying to capture his enemy, Austin and in taking over the world. He concocts a scheme to rob Austin of his mojo (that's his drive, baby) by traveling back in time to when Austin was still frozen. The scheme works and Austin is left in a helpless rut.Most of the old cast is back for this round. Robert Wagner continues his role as Number Two, this time revealing his characters dismay over his boss, who is not interested in the billion-dollar corporation that Two has created. Michael York is back playing Basil Exposition, the gadget guru who charges Austin with his mission. And Frau Farbisinna (Mindy Sterling) is still fawning for Dr. Evil, this time revealing her love for their rebellious love child, Scott (Seth Green).To make things seem fresh, a new group of characters are brought in. Kristen Johnston plays Ivana Humpalot, a icy model working for Dr. Evil. Heather Graham is Felicity Shagwell, a 1960's secret agent with a passion for Austin. And Verne Troyer is Mini-Me, the biggest laugh in the entire film, artificially cloned son to Dr. Evil. The Spy Who Shagged Me is like a blue print for all sequels. It stays true to the original, for the most part simply building on the bits delivered in the first film. While it might lose marks for lacking an original premise, I rather enjoyed the over-the-wall silliness. Also, like the original, there is nothing complicated about this film, nor should there be. The Spy Who Shagged Me is a 'leave your brains at the door' kind of laugh-fest.</fullReview>

Fat Bastard must surely win unfunniest supporting artist for 1999. Dr Evil dominates the film to the detriment of Austin himself. Did Mike try to much and tire himself out? The charm of AP is that the swinging sixties were really fun, sexy and innocent. This all gets squeezed out in AP2. Sorry Mike a money-making disaster, go take a long holiday and then return to your roots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sequel has better production values, a boatload of hype and the cast works, but I couldn't shake the feeling sitting in the theater I'd seen a lot of it before. The original established the flow and this sequel pretty much follows the same path. Naturally making it seem a whole lot less fresh the second time out. Well, at least to me. 'The Spy Who Shagged Me' definitely has some memorable bits, but it's nemesis is that overhanging feeling of sameness.If you've seen the first AP movie, you can rightfully assume what to expect in this sequel. Which is good or bad depending on your taste for this whimsical in-the-here-and-now style of comedy. People who love it will cheer and those that don't will groan.Crack a smile, whip a instantly recognizable Austin Powers quote. There is no denying the movie has it's own charm, Myers has found a memorable character to latch onto and these flicks will forever be a part of pop culture lexicon. Just how well they date is another topic altogether. When the original came out, the attraction was it's originality, it's timing, and Mike Myers wacky new role. Here in the sequel, the Austin Powers character isn't boring, but he doesn't present that same energy you can only get the first time around. They surround him (again) with an entourage of zany characters and madcap moments, but it's beginning to feel played out already.Mike Myers, front and center, gets the laughing crown. No surprise there. Isn't hard to do when you're playing three characters. Meanwhile Heather Graham provides a foil and delicious eye candy to Powers and Will Ferrell (of Saturday Night Live fame) has a memorable return as one of Dr. Evil's assassins. It's a movie, sequel, meant to be enjoyed with little in the way of real expectations. It's not great. It's not timeless. In no way, shape, or form does it reinvent the wheel, but it does entertain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people don't think AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY was worthy of a sequel. Some think there should be a large series of AUSTIN POWERS movies, like the infamous Bond movies. Trust me, I'm kinda sick of everyone doing impressions of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, (and I do one fine Dr. Evil if I do say so myself, even though both are easy to impersonate), but I thought AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME was even better than the first one. So if you asked me if there should be a series of AUSTIN POWERS movies, and I wasn't so sick of all those impersonations, I might say "Yeah baby!"Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is sent back to 1969 by Basil Exposition (Michael York) to stop Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) who has stolen Austin Powers' "mojo" and plans to build a giant laser on the movie and destroy all major cities on Earth. In the sixties, Austin Powers meets Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), who is just as sexy and hip as Austin is. Scott Evil (Seth Green) is still trying to work out things with his father, even though Dr. Evil has turned his attention to his clone in 1/10 size, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). Number Two (Robert Wagner, then Rob Lowe), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling) and Mustafa (Will Ferrell) all return to help Dr. Evil, in addition to Fat Bastard (Mike Myers), the disgusting, overweight, Scottish henchman.Let's face is, Austin Powers has never been about plot. Considering that this movie is basically a spoof of OUR MAN FLINT and the JAMES BOND movies, the plot is pretty entertaining and funny. The giant laser on the moon was great, obviously spoofing MOONRAKER, in addition to many other movies of its type.The acting in this movie is all very good. Mike Myers does a great job playing three very different characters. Heather Graham beats the crap out of Elizabeth Hurley (not literally in this movie, but how cool would that be) and is way sexier in my book. Seth Green and Mindy Sterling are great, especially when together. Will Ferrell was one of my favorite performers and characters in this movie. Robert Wagner is good, but his role is taken over by Rob Lowe after they go back in time. Lowe does an unbelievable job and is almost exactly like Wagner was as the character. Michael York does a fairly good job too. There are some great cameos by names like Clint Howard, Tim Robbins, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Kristen Johnston and Jerry Springer.Unlike in AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY, there is great character development. This first AUSTIN POWERS movie did a good job laying a foundation for these characters, but this movie really set them off. Dr. Evil stole the show, which is great because he is obviously the best character. Austin Powers, Number Two and Basil are about the same as in the first one. Felicity is way more interesting and sexier than Hurley was. Frau is much more interesting in this movie, as is Scott who is still saying "Why don't you just kill them?" to his father. Mustafa, who you might not even remember from the first one, is hilarious in this movie. Mini-Me was fun, but in the next AUSTIN POWERS movie, it shouldn't revolve around him as much. Fat Bastard is my least favorite character and I hope he isn't in the next AUSTIN POWERS movie.Go see this one, you won't regret it. It sure won't win any Oscars, but it's one of the funniest movies of the year. Turn your brain off and enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers' follow-up to his first Austin Powers movie is a big disappointment. The energy and originality of the first film are gone, and what we have left is a litany of base scatological humor we've all seen before. Mike does hit some high notes with his two new characters, Mini-Me and Fat Bastard, but these two guys are not strong enough to save the movie.What happened to Mike? We won't ever know, but since The Spy Who Shagged Me made tons of money you can bet there'll be a third Austin Powers someday soon. Let's just hope Mike can re-capture the magic of the first.</fullReview>

I was Not amused by the whole 'Austin glugging crap' bit, maybe we are meant to laugh the same way we did when Bill Murray munched the floatie Mars Bar in the pool back in '80's Caddyshack, but...this was overdone and a little outta place.Memo to Mike Myers-deep6 the fat Scottish character. Not funny, sick and outta place. One scene was okay. Three or four...gimme a break. 'Jaws' in the Spy who Loved Me(Richard Kiel) in '77-that one worked. Fat Bastard-didn't.Heather Graham is cute but could use a little real food in her diet once in a while. Bones. She does the Goldie Hawn bit alright for what it is worth.Always nice to see Micheal York in a big film, though, he has done some fine work in his time and am glad he got this.I think Myers has a good hearted sense of fun and all that, but here he keeps mis-firing. The movie'd be funnier if they spent more time on satirizing Bond type inventions, car chases, etc. We know they've got the Villain and overkill base down right, now for the rest....If they make a third, I will treat it the same as the first-wait 'til its out on VCR. Neither of these are classics, good time-fillers in the evening on your VCR, about it.**1/2 outta ****, not terribly memorable either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well "westgate," I'm sorry to hear that you had your sense of humor surgically removed at birth.Even my highly-religious, staunchly serious, 82-year old father found this movie funny...perhaps not as funny as did the kid "picking his nose" in front of you, but perhaps many people find humor other than the falsely-highbrow likes of "Frasier" entertaining.At times, the "if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all" philosophy IS justified in movie criticism. If you find everyone around you laughing hysterically, and yet you don't find it funny, you are truly being immature if you take that as your cue to sabotage the movie's good name.Overall, "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" is a typical comedic sequel: more hilarious one-liners than the first, but not as good of a movie overall....see "The Naked Gun," "Major League," and "Ghostbusters" (and their sequels) to see more examples of this.But, to be honest, I never laughed harder at a movie...not even "There's Something About Mary."</fullReview>

It's not as sharp, it's not as funny, it's a lot sloppier and lazier in its effort to get laughs, and spends a lot of the goodwill extended from fans of the first. The character of Austin is rarely funny in this effort, so thank God for Dr. Evil, who is still humorous, and for his new "son" Mini-Me, who has a few good scenes. Scott Evil is wasted and the new fat slob character Fat Bastard is not all that amusing. Still, it moves pretty fast, Heather Graham looks fantastic, and the movie all-in-all coasts by on its cheerful good nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable and Annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like good films, but I also enjoy stupid comedies. However, comedy sequels rushed just to make money usually suck. This was the case with "Ace Ventura 2: When Nature Calls." When I went to see "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" I expected the same disappointment and I got it.There is very little plot in this film. Dr. Evil goes back in time in order to steal the hero's mojo and rob him of his flawless and charming abilities. Austin Powers decides to follow him in order to steal his mojo back. Along the way he meets Felicity Shagwell, an American spy played by the hot Heather Graham. Together they try to defeat Dr. Evil and his henchmen.Let's take a look at what is wrong with this film. First of all, the nature of "Austin Powers 2" is flawed. While the first Austin Powers movie mostly satirized James Bond, this one either makes fun of itself or nothing at all. Second, the characters in the sequel are very annoying. It seems that Dr. Evil has become the hero now. He is supposed to be cute, lovable, funny, and tough. He is everything and he probably has more screen time than Austin Powers himself. In reality, he is simply annoying. Mini-Me does not steal the show, Frau Farbissina screams every few minutes, and the jokes revolve around these annoying figures. Finally, the main thing that is wrong with this movie is the repetition of jokes from the previous Austin Powers. I counted about 20 jokes or joke sequences in "Austin Powers 2" that were first in the original. In addition, they were often used more than once in the sequel. I didn't like it when Dr. Evil did the ol' "zip it" routine to Scott Evil (twice), because I've seen it before. I didn't like it when Dr. Evil quoted common things from the 90s as if no one knew what he was talking about, because I've seen that before as well. I didn't like it when Mustafa (Will Ferrell) fell down the cliff and complained about being hurt, but not dead, because I have seen that before. And how many times will Dr. Evil make mistakes with monetary values before it stops being funny. I think doing this twice in the original was enough. C'mon Mike Myers, you're a funny guy, let's get some new jokes.Now it's time to briefly talk about the good things in this movie. Between the annoying and repetitious jokes and the constant shameless product placements, there were a few decent moments. Although most of his dialogue is the same as before, Austin Powers has a some new funny lines. Heather Graham's acting is weak as she just can't seem to take that smirk off her face for a longer period. But on the good side, she is fun to look at. Fat Bastard is probably the funniest character, but he is just another costume Mike Myers got into. Finally, there are a few good jokes in the film. A montage of penis jokes stands out the most, even though it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot.This film is simply an expected disappointment. An annoying repetition of the elements that made the first Austin Powers film so good. This time they are not clever, surprising, or funny. I thought about giving this film a 6 out of 10 after I saw it in the movies because it had me laughing at times, but then I watched it again on tape and I don't think I laughed once. Watch the original one instead which does everything so much better and has you laughing each time you watch it. It is one of the best comedies of the 90s. "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" ruins everything. Overall, a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one was kind of a letdown for me. The first Austin Powers was a brilliant movie. This, as many sequels, seems to forget what made the original so funny. In the first, Austin is shown in the '60s as a swinger who has women falling all over him. As stated by Mrs. Kensington, "Women want him, and men want to be him." When he's shown in the 90's, he's the same, but people don't react to his lines and body language the way they're supposed to. That's what made his character so funny. Now, in this movie, he spends most of his time in the 60's, where everyone reacts the right way. Plus, even in the opening in the 90's, everyone reacts to him the right way, like he fits in. Honestly, Austin had about 2 scenes that were really funny. Those were the Mini Me vs. Austin and the tent scenes.The movie does, however, have a huge redeeming quality. That is Dr. Evil and his gang. They were hilarious in the first and also great in the second. Dr. Evil on Jerry Springer, in bed with Frau, and taking off into space (almost p***ed myself with this chain of jokes) were classics. Dr. Evil definitely steals the show.Another downside, however, is Fat Bastard. I don't know what Mike was thinking with this one, but I hardly ever laughed at anything he did except for singing the Chili's Baby Back Ribs song. Overall, he was pretty sick. I gave this one a 7. Although Austin's character was kind of wasted, Dr. Evil more than makes up for it. Recommendable, but see the first one first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than the first, but what was up with fat bastard?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i found the first austin powers to be kind of a mixed bag. there would be huge laughs followed by moments of uncertainty. I've seen this complaint leveled against this film, but from my angle this one hangs together a whole lot better than the first movie and all the actors involved seemed to have a better feel for the material. i also like the fact that it was set in the '60s rather than the tired plotline of the first having austin transplanted into the '90s. the only thing i found iffy about the whole movie was the fat bastard character. i found him neither funny or repulsive, just annoying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realize that a lot of people reviewing this movie didn't like it as well as the first Austin Powers movie. However, not having seen the first before I saw the second, I have no frame of reference to go by.While I agree that "The Spy Who Shagged Me" may have gone too far when it came to bathroom humor, I don't feel that's any reason to write off the entire movie as a failure. The scene with Dr. Evil singing "What If God Was One of Us" was hilarious. Seth Green was marvelous as the insolent Scott Evil and his scenes with Mike Myers were hilarious. Rob Lowe did a good job in his role of the 1999 version of Number Two. And, of course, Myers was his usual brilliant self. However, I didn't think Verne Troyer added much in the role of Mini-Me. The movie could probably have proceeded just as well without him.Besides Troyer, I do have another minor complaint about the casting in this one. I have nothing against Robert Wagner, and I think he did well in his brief appearance as the 1999 version of Number Two. However, something about the character just screamed "Adam West" to me.Besides the cameo appearance by Rebecca Romijin-Stamos, perhaps the best reason to watch this movie is the presence of the breathtakingly beautiful Heather Graham in the role of breathtakingly beautiful CIA agent Felicity Shagwell. I know others have criticized Graham for sleepwalking through this one but let's be realistic, shall we? Graham was hired for this role strictly for eye candy effect, at that, she was uncommonly successful. The scene with Austin and Felicity at Austin's 1969 pad was pulse accelerating--at least for me it was!!! Shagadelic, baby!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as sequels go, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is well done and pulled off nicely. Mike Myers shows off his talent as an actor and writer here. The story is pure James Bond parody, much like the first one, but of course that's not a bad thing. What is bad? The character Fat Bastard was annoying rather than funny and he wasn't really needed at all. Mini-Me was just strange. Not funny, of course it's hard to be very funny when you don't really talk, and not scary. Just strange. Felicity Shagwell was like a female version of Austin and that just didn't appeal to me for some reason. Other than that, Austin Powers 2 is a hysterical film and one of the best films of 1999.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does going off on a tangent mean anything to you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was stunned by this film. I honestly did not believe that Mike Myers could stoop so low as to use such crude, primal bathroom humor. The film lacked the spontaneous gags and spunk of "International Man of Mystery." Where were the 60s spy movie in-jokes (aside from the bad puns and Mini-Me in the baby carriage)? Where were the clever double entendres? Where was the magic? "The Spy Who Shagged Me" could have been much more entertaining if a few amendments had been made.First, the writers should have cashed in on the "Star Wars" cow. The film opened with golden credits flying through space and made mention of a Death Star, but it missed the train. Even Austin's mojo could have been portrayed as more mystical and drug-like instead of a pink potion. Second, Fat Bastard should never have existed. His comments belong in a men's locker room, NOT in a motion picture. I literally felt nauseous as he described his bathroom practices. Third, what happened to the 60s Dr. Evil? Was he frozen too? Wouldn't his staff have questioned a 90s Dr. Evil returning to the 60s and taking over? And why did Evil have to sleep with Frau what's her bucket? He always complained about Scott's lack of evil tendencies, calling him the "Diet Coke" of evil. Why couldn't he just not sleep with her and fail to produce Scott at all? Then he would only have Mini Me and be content.Aside from the those amendments, the film was not entirely awful. I enjoyed the irony of Scott being more evil than his father. Scott is the one who lampoons the idiocy of throwing Austin and Felicity in a jail cell with one guard. Scott is the one who recommends killing Austin in the past, and his father replies that Scott does not truly understand the nature of evil. I think that if Scott were Dr. Evil, things would be happening in a more practical manner. I enjoyed the random nature of "One of Us" as performed by Dr. Evil. The whole rap number with Mini Me was hilarious as well. Yet I think that the film seemed to go off on an enormous tangent once Austin lost his mojo. The whole sequence with the phallic-shaped ship was incredibly bizarre. It had the flavor of an SNL episode. All in all, this film needed some clarification and some non-bathroom related humor. If the third installment in the trilogy returns to the flavor of "International Man of Mystery," it will be a good film. I'll keep my fingers crossed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A god-awful mess from a brilliant comic on auto-pilot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying I love Mike Myers. I've followed him from his Second City days, through his brilliant work on "SNL," his triumph in "Wayne's World," and up to his classic "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery." Sure, he's had some missteps ("So I Married An Axe Murderer" and "Wayne's World II" were pretty disappointing), but this is thew first time he's fallen flat on his face. This film stinks. And it's not the toilet humor that sinks it. The main problem is that nearly every joke in the film is a tired retread of a gag from the first one (i.e., "SNL"-er Will Ferrell's Mustafa character's difficulty in dying and Powers' nudity being obscured by well-placed inanimate objects). Plus, once the character of Powers has been put back into his proper context/era of the Swingin' '60s, there is no point for him to exist... I mean, the whole idea of the first film was a "fish out of water" tale of a '60s swinger's ideals being horribly out of place in the '90s. As a result, the comic burden rests on Dr. Evil's shoulders and, though a brilliant character, it's too big a job for him to carry the movie. Heather Graham, though unarguably erection-inspiring, has absolutely zero flair for comedy, unlike Elizabeth Hurley. Graham isn't an especially good actress, but she does have great, big doleful eyes which, when she's given little dialogue and placed in a drama, can convince audiences there is a lot going on in her head, though little actually is. So, she's reduced to being an incredible, blonde piece of window dressing. Fat Bastard is an excuse for Myers to trot out his Scot character he's been doing for years, but obesity and an eccentric accent alone do not make comedy - jokes and situation help (see "Monty Python's the Meaning of Life" for pointers). Myers' biggest charm has been his eagerness for audiences to like him. Here, he appears as if he thinks he can do just about anything and extend no effort in doing it, and the folks will just eat it up. It's a huge turn off... almost as big a turn off as the fact that, when the Box Office receipts were tallied, he was right. If you like Myers and halfway decent comedy, avoid this like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll give "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" credit - it at least foregoes the story for the gags.Most people will tell you the story is the most important thing in a comedy. WRONG - the most important thing in a comedy is if you LAUGH. And, here, I laughed.Meyers is not only back as our man Austin and his own nemesis Dr. Evil, but as evil henchman Fat Bastard (another Scot! Who knew?). And he knows how to milk the laughs. There are still a few cliches of the spy genre that get a good rolling here (evading a barrage of death attempts, the introduction of "the babe", questioning the assassin, etc.) But there are a few jabs you may not notice if you don't catch a lot of other movies. For instance, this is without a doubt the only spy movie where you'll see visual and verbal references to "Star Wars", "The Great Santini", the Marlon Brando remake of "The Island of Dr. Moreau" and rap videos. Maybe they could have exploited the time travel scenes for a few more laughs but they'll do.Graham plays Shagwell pretty blandly, Wagner is only here briefly, York returns only intermittently as Basil Exposition, Lowe does a decent enough imitation of Robert Wagner, Udenio manages to get a few more laughs this time around but the real treat is Troyer as Mini-Me. Even if he does give off an "Oompa-Loompa vibe", he makes several scenes of the movie enjoyable (his and Meyers' fight scene is the stuff of legend.In fact, there are many choice comedy scenes here. The "stool sample scene" (let's just call it that), could be seen coming down Main Street but for gross-out laughs, it does the trick ("Tastes kind of...nutty!"), and so do Fat Bastard's scenes - all of them reveling in the fact that he's fat and a... well, you know what I mean. And that tent scene on Dr. Evil's Island has to be seen to be appreciated. Mere words just can't do it justice.It's no secret that the movie ends with the possibility of a sequel. Will there be one? That's the deal, you know - no less than two sequels for every hit movie in Hollywood nowadays. And if they happen to be good sequels, all the better."Shagged" is about as good as can be expected. Meyers knows what buttons to push and finds various ways of describing male sexual organs (you'll see what I mean) but as far as laughs go, they're groovy, baby!TIDBIT - I didn't know Woody Harrelson was around in 1969.Seven stars and a crushed velvet leisure suit for "The Spy Who Shagged Me".</fullReview>

I enjoy toilet humor as much as the next guy, but it gets a little old after a while.This movie does deliver some big laughs, however. The title sequence where Austin dances through a Hotel naked is pure genius. Dr. Evil steals the show once again with the biggest laughs, but even he wears thin after a while. And I guess that's the biggest problem with the movie. After a hilarious beginning it just slowly loses steam until there is little left.Still, The Spy Who Shagged Me is not a bad movie by any means, but I hope if another sequel is ever made, the filmmakers will try to capture the humor of the original rather than relying on what Kevin Smith calls "dick and fart jokes."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once I got past the bathroom humor (which I don't care for in any film), this film is another example of Mike Meyers's truly brilliant comic style; Dr. Evil is a classic comic character, and it's that role that really made the first film what it was, and its impact understandably earned it more scenes in this one. True comedy is such an impoverished art lately that any film that has a genuine touch of genius to it, even if it's only an occasional glimmer, should be appreciated like crazy. Try creating comedy; it's the hardest thing in the world. This and the first film really have a handle on hilarity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spy Who Shagged Me is a great movie on its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very funny movie. Those who think it is a copy of the first one are dead wrong. The first movie was a parody while this one is strictly situational humor. Is a lot of it toilet humor? Yes, indeed. And the problem with that is...? Mike Myers is a genius at sight gags, and this movie shows of that talent. He also has a great team working with him: Mindy Sterling is a superior comedienne in her own right, Rob Lowe's Robert Wagner is uncanny, and the talented Seth Green is perfect as Dr. Evil's rebellious son. When you see this movie don't expect it to be just like the first one. Mike Myers has given us something different and just as funny.</fullReview>

Unlike the last film there weren't any good Austinisms like the classic "Yeah Baby" to be found. A step back, but the series should continue anyways. 6 out of 10 stars ******</fullReview>

Some few different actors and that's it (Graham instead of Hurley), but the movie is just the same. Maybe this movie is more about Dr Evil than Austin Powers. Some new parts are good (Jerry Springer's scene), but it's basically a copy of the first.It is a funny movie though,... but only if you haven't seen the first one. Maybe I expected more of it, but than again, it's still just a copy of the first movie.Rating if you have seen the first one: 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Powers 2 is inferior to the original(IMOM will go down as a Komedy Klassic,this will not)it still is very funny. While its almost like admitting to be an immature juvenile to laugh out loud at it,Myers is so charming that after a while you just dont care.Dr Evil is one of the most inspired(literally)characters ever,and face-achingly funny.His scenes with Mini-me(in an underwritten role)are near-perfect,and the scene in which Myers serenades his miniature replica is just one of those moments. While Austin is brilliantly played,(with as much subtlety as a slegehammer)it is Evil who steals the film(remember his post-coital scene with Frau Farbissina ?)and Myers overshadows the hero with the villain. Heather Graham manages to be both wood-inducingly sexy,and while not as overt as her co-stars,is pleasingly funny. Seth Green reprises his role as Scott,Evils wonderfully dysfunctional son,and while the scenes with his dad lack some of the bite they did in the original,Green(and his hair)is still very good. In short,Powers 2 is a guilty pleasure.Excessive use of the word "shag",jokes surrounding Powers drinking from a cup of,well s**t,and a midget being thrown into a metal pole all combine to form a brilliant mother-disgusting movie.</fullReview>

Instead of tasteless and fun :-), most of the jokes were just silly, in my opinion. There were a lot of references to movies and a couple of musical pieces that I didn't find funny at all. And the commercials for Coke, Heineken and Starbuck's were a bit annoying.The 'user ratings' show that women like this film more than men. It has got a strong female character and some romance, which probably explains it. I (male) found the romantic bits a bit on the cheesy side, though. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a doubt, this is not a movie for anyone. It´s clearly not suitable for young children and for prudes. There IS a lot of sexual innuendos, toilet humor and crude jokes about obese people. This I agree on with the movie´s critics.But it is these things that makes it the perfect satire of the James Bond-genre, that I´m personally not very fond of. "Austin Powers" is a liberating mile away from everything cute and arranged to fit the taste of the conservative America. It is these kinds of movies that teach us to laugh, and laugh also at the things considered taboo.It is the middle-aged man´s adolescent daydream, a shaggalicious little movie in its own genre: fast cars, evil doctors and boombastic blondes running after the ugly hero. Pure genius by Mr. Mike Myers. Yeah, Baby, yeah, gimme more of the good stuff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start off by saying, Austin Powers II wasn't the worst movie I ever wasted my time on. I found that there were very few original jokes in this sequel. With the exception of the introduction of a few new characters it was the just about the same movie. To top it all off the plugging of numerous different products really bothered me. I understand that movies are very costly to create and it doesn't bother me that they promote products in movies. However when it is so grossly apparent that they are filling the movie up with camera shots and dialogue for this, that, or the next thing I am disgusted with what I am watching. In Austin Powers II there were several instances in which they basically stopped the movie to tell us about beer, waffles, coffee, cars, and pizza wraps. It is really to bad when a great first film is ruined by a poorly done sequel because todays society always needs to see something more.</fullReview>

I consider myself a connoisseur of toilet humor and am completely impervious to offense. However, that being said, I found that the penis-jokes were just plain overdone. The bright spots of the movie occurred when Mick Myers as Austin Powers was off-screen and Mike Myers as Dr. Evil was on. The interaction of Dr. Evil and his son, like the first movie, was priceless. How about we devote the entire next sequel (does anyone doubt that there will be one?) to the Evils, Mini-Me, and Fat Bastard?My Rating - 5</fullReview>

Myers once again does a fine job as both hero and villain,and even manages to pull off a third role,the Fat Bastard,but Heather Graham leaves much to be desired. Verne Troyer is hysterical as Mini-Me,and the Jerry Springer scenes were to die for. Not as good as the first,though. Many elements that made the first one great are thrown in here. This film also holds the dubious distinction of having the single most disgusting scene in all of cinema history(those who have seen it know what I mean!) Nevertheless,it's harmless fun,and I look forward to another of Mr.Powers' escapades....hopefully without the 'nutty' coffee....2 1/2 out of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain spoilers.The year of 1999 was very good for cinema. Many great films were released this year: "Eyes Wide Shut", "Cruel Intentions", "Go", "Notting Hill" and others that weren't released in Brazil yet ("American Beauty", "The Sixth Sense" -opening October 22 here-, etc). But if you want a break, just a break, watch "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me".The first film was also very funny and humorous, even with a small budget. But I think this one was someway better.The sound track is just great (specially the songs "Beautiful Stranger" and "American Woman"). The jokes and the satires are hilarious, and so are the characters. Austin is ugly and funny as always. Felicity Shagwell, played by Heather Graham -gorgeous-, is much better than Elizabeth Hurley's Vanessa Kensington. Dr. Evil is simply hilarious. Here he has a clone (well... almost a clone), called Mini-Me (also great). There is also Fat Bastard, disgusting and unusual.Mike Myers proves that he's much better than Jim Carrey. He plays three characters in this film - Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard.There are really funny scenes, as the opening one, with Mike and Elizabeth Hurley, and the one with Mike and Heather in tent (the best in my opinion).So turn your brain off and enjoy "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me". Yeah baby, yeah!Rating: 7/10Oh! Watch the credits!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was, next to Star Wars: Episode I, the film I really wanted to see this year. I liked the first Austin Powers film but after having seen this sequel I was a bit disappointed. Let me first sum up the positive things about the movie:1) Dr. Evil was very funny! 2) Fat Bastard was great (what a filthy person)! 3) Some jokes were really good (about 20 different words for the word penis, the scenes in the tent with Austin and Felicity, the opening with Austin running through the hotel naked etc.) 4) The Jerry Springer show 5) The special effects and how the film looked were excellent! 6) A ridiculous story!The negative things about the film:1) The film went on too fast! A lot of times I had the feeling that there were just too many ideas for jokes put in a 1h 35m during film. 2) Some jokes weren't well done or weren't funny at all! 3) Mini-Me should have spoken! But than again, he was a bit annoying! 4) Felicity Shagwell's (Heather Graham) character wasn't as well developed as Vanessa Kensington's in the first film (in just a flash Felicity was Austin Powers' girlfriend). 5) If there's going to be a next film, more No. 2, Basil Exposition, Scot Evil and Frau Farbissima and Ivana Humpalot. 6) Robin Swallows' role wasn't necessary and very weird. 7) The scene with Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach wasn't well executed (suddenly they were there on the streets in London). 8) Austin Powers wasn't that funny as in the first film (except the scene with Ivana Humpalot, that was a great oneliner)Overall, the film is despite these negative points very watchable and entertaining but it doesn't deserve more than a 6,5 / 7 out of 10, it was too chaotic.</fullReview>

The sex jokes are great and some scenes, like the shadow one (the one when Felicity, the blond chick takes some stuff from a bag and it looks like she's taking them from Austin's a**) are very funny either.The satires are also great: the one with that show when Dr. Evil's son says that "My father wants to take over the world" and everybody say "Ohhhh!" is hilarious, and "-Austin, I have to tell you something. -What is it? -I... am... your father.-No! this can not be!... For real? -No, not sure." took all my breathe.But this movie is not perfect. Here are my main gripes:-The Mini Me is a discusting actor. "It" really makes me sad.-This movie has a kind of humor that older people may not find funny. I seriously recommend it to kids (13+, I mean. Younger people may not understand it and parents may not let them see all those sex jokes), teenagers that like this kind of stuff, like myself.-A lot of stupid jokes that aren't funny for probably anyone in Earth.-A lot of unoriginal jokes.That's why I give it a 7.

And for good measure, bring a date who is in an equally goofy, cheap-humor kind of mood.

		<shortDescription>High School student says hilarious film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the movie "Austin Powers, The Spy Who Shagged me," because of its comedy and its originality. These are two great factors that led me to believe that Austin Powers was a great movie.In the movie Austin Powers, comedy was used through out the movie. There was the time where Scott Evil mimicked his father, Dr. Evil. He would also make fun of his father for trying to fit into the 90's. Although, Dr.evil was still stuck back in the 60's. I think that this was a comical point in the movie because it was making fun of the so called "up tight squares." The other reason that I believe that Austin Powers was comical because of Dr.Evil and his finger movement to his bottom lip. Through out the movie, Dr.Evil puts his pinkie on the right part of his lip. When Dr.Evil says "right," it makes a comical heaven. It is because of these two facts that this movie is comical.Also, the movie is original because of the characters and the plot. The characters of the movie are hilarious. Take Austin Powers, the 60's swinger who was cryogenicly frozen until his return in the 90's. Take the other antagonist, Fat Bastard, his name says it all. He is an overweight Scotsmen guard and assistant to Dr. Evil. The other character is the mini 1/8 size clone of Dr.Evil. These are original characters that were well thought out. The plot of the story is like the original British spy movie. Austin Powers defeats the antagonist and gets the girl. Now that is very original.In conclusion, Austin Powers is a great film to see because of the comedy and originality. It is comical because of the way Scott mocks his father and Dr.Evils finger movements. It is original because of the plot and characters. So if you have some spare dollars, go see Austin Powers.Nick, San Ramon High student</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sensational! A well done comedy. Mike Myers "Puts the Gerrr in swinger." The 60's spy movie is hilarious starring Mike Myers, International Man of Mystery. This cleaver movie is even better that the first one, made in 1997. Austin Powers becomes single again and falls into another escapade involving Dr. Evil and his men who want to take over the world. Along with doing that, they also want to get rid of Austin Powers, by taking away his "mojo," so he won't happen to spoil their plans. This movie has all the belly laughs and sexual and cunning humor as the first one if not more. This movie helps explain the first one much better with the same kind of kicks. Between a man weighing "One metric ton," and an exact duplicate of Dr. Evil, yet only 1/6th of his size this movie is meant for everyone.  As Austin strolls back in time to sexy girls, go-go boots and belted mini skirts, he is right at home with his swinger crowd. Crude bathroom humor was never funnier. Politically incorrect and silly humor has won again and this movie is definitely worth buying a night ticket to see. The lines are funnier and the writers were more daring. "It's groovy baby, yeah!"

		<fullReview>This summer I'd have to say one of the hottest flicks had to have been, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. From the opening lines to the end credits this movie had me rolling with laughter, and on my toes just waiting to see what was going to happen next. This movie was definitly the "funny" movie of the summer. From the characters names (Ivana Hupmalot) to the witty and humorous lines they speak, you never stop laughing. When Mini Me and Dr. Evil break into their litle song and dance their is no avoiding laughing. They are just so cut and humorous you can't help but chuckle a bit. from sceen to sceen you are constantly waiting for the excitement you know will be there. When Austin and Mini Me battle it out on the aircaft you are hooked till the end. And when Felicity and Austin battle with Dr. Evils henchman you are costantly waiting to see what clever moves they'll come up with next. Through its witty comedy and unpredictable excitement, this movie keeps you guessing. As one of the summers funniest films it definitly deserves two thumbs up. All in all a hilariously exciting flick worth the wait.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This summer I watched a movie called Austin Powers the Spy who Shagged Me. This was a very good movie, full of humor and Mike Myers own brand of action. It was as funny (or funnyer) than the origonal.Austin Powers was a very funny movie. Minime was very cool. He added alot off humor to the movie. there is one scene where he is fighting with Austin Powers and even though it lookes realy fake it is realy funny. Dr. Evil is also very funny, like when he sing a recreation of Will Smith's "just the two of us," very funny! the character "Fat Bastered" (also played by Mike Myers) is a fat, scottish guy that is in leage with Dr. Evil and eats every thing, and i mean every thing, in one scene he even proclames he has "ate a baby."The movie is also very action packed with a little comedy worked in to every fight scene. When Austin Powers is trying to save the world and the girl he need a little help so he goes back and gets the Austin Powers from the past for a little help. There is also a killer fight scene between Austin Powers and Minime but I'm not going to tell you that one because i want you to laught when you see it for your self.Minime and Dr. Evil make the movie very funny. Austin Powers makes the movie action packed. If you ask me this is a great movie, and I'd recommend it to any one who wants to laugh.by SRVHS student, Bronson</fullReview>

The humor is very good but i don't think it is as good as the original. this is probably because it had a lot to live up to and the original was just a low budget film that wasn't expected to do anything. i think that the most funny part was when scott goes onto Jerry Springer at the beginning of the film called "my dad wants to rule the world" and Dr. Evil beats everybody up including Jerry Springer himself. This is a superb film and it is suitable for over 12 and upwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good films with gross-out elements have been around since the Three Stooges, and the first Austin Powers was good/bad in that tradition. But as sequels go, this is no From Russia With Love (the second, and BEST Bond flick), it maintains the usual mantra that sequels are rarely as good as the originals. At it's worst, the movie is just plain boring. Add gross to boring (can you say "Fat B------") and it all becomes very painful. The second half is even worse than the first. Just showing Mini-Me over and over is not enought to get a laugh. Heather Graham, gorgeous as usual, looks like she's been caught laughing at teenage boy jokes and maintains that reaction throughout the film (she can do comedy, just see Bowfinger). The real star: George S. Clinton's deft parodying of John Barry throughout (especially his nods to You Only Live Twice, which the "Shag" mimics both in plot and the fact that You Only Live Twice was the first 007 which was actually BAD). Another warm spot: Rob Lowe's amazing imitation of Robert Wagner (I never thought Wagner had a distinctive enough voice to be mimicked, but I was wrong).</fullReview>

Mike Myers is a comic genius, and in my opinion has taken over from actors such as Robin Williams, Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler as Hollywood's funniest person. Although Austin was the main character, Dr Evil and Mini Me really made the movie so great. Heather Graham is a babe and was great as Felicity Shagwell. Fat Bastard was not my favourite character, but he showcased Mike Myers' comic ability more than anyone. I went to the cinema to see this movie three times, and I would go three more times.

Don't get me wrong, a good potty joke can be a really good thing but ninety minutes of them, well, maybe not. Heather Graham is the highlight of the film. She can act, aside from being drop dead gorgeous, and is the sole reason to see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen both AP films and I believe this one was as good as, if not better than, the original. The plot was not senseless or non-existent as some have said, but moves along quickly and is easy to follow if you care to. Mike Myers was enjoyable playing three different characters, and demonstrated some real acting ability in places(Fat Bastard, explaining his eating problems). The woman who played Felicity Shagwell(don't remember her name) was nice to look at, wasn't the best actress I've ever seen, but was adequate for the role. I think MiniMe was one of the best things in the movie, especially his fight with AP on the moon late in the movie. I didn't find anything in this movie that was particularly offensive, and didn't feel there were a lot of recycled jokes, as some have complained of. All in all, this was a fun movie to watch, if you are just looking for a mindless good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare sequel that surpasses the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes - not always - but sometimes, a sequel can surpass the original. Let's take, for instance, "Aliens," "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and "Die Hard 2." You can also add "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" to that list. Don't get me wrong, "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" is a comic treasure. "The Spy Who Shagged Me" barely exceeded the original on the basis of more moments of hilarity. The laughs are more frequent and the film gives more depth to Dr. Evil than Austin Powers and that is its strongest points because Dr. Evil is a more intriguing character. Mike Myers has, very well, created two of the best comic personalities of the 90's. On a bit of the downside, Heather Graham is no Elizabeth Hurley. Her acting is, sometimes, forced and ridiculous, much do to some bad dialogue given to her. Although she is GREAT to look at, she just doesn't project enough sexuality that her character needs. Is it all her fault? I dunno. Needless to say, it didn't bother me THAT much to knock it down. However, the timing and execution, on many scenes, is absolutely flawless. The "tent" scene and the "Penile Nickname" sequence are two of the major highlights. See it because of its great comic moments and Heather Graham's body and you'll leave one very happy camper.</fullReview>

I was interested in seeing it after seeing the trailers for it which I thought were hilarious. I have to say, I loved this film. Mike Myers is obviously a very talented guy, having written, produced and starred in it. I found it an extremley funny film. I've always liked that kind of humour, (other fave films include the Naked Gun series, Liar Liar and Month Pythons Holy Grail) so if you don't like that kind of humour, you won't like Austin Powers. A lot of reviews have said things which imply only teenagers will like it, but thats not true. If you like that kind of humour, you'll love Austin Powers. I'm nearly 20, and I know that I'll still love films like this when I'm 90! As Austin Powers might say "Groovy baby!"</fullReview>

After the first half an hour and a crap joke being told for the hundredth time, I wanted to get up and walk out. I am truly sorry that I didn't.This juvenile trash was mainly based on finding something that the film-makers deemed funny and then running it into the ground, and then later doing it again.I thought the first one was OK but this one was utter trash and designed much more for children and those that are impressed by someone saying "bum" and walking into a closed door. It's attempts to shock (e.g. Fat Bastard) were just offensive, and not even in a funny way.There is so much wrong with this film that I haven't got time to sit here typing it in. From beginning to end (except the beginning with Liz Hurley, which I enjoyed) this was a painful reminder that Hollywood is going down the toilet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know how a film is sometimes "savaged by the critics?" Well, I am about savage this one: It was awful.Maybe my problem is that I went in with high hopes. I really liked the first movie, "Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery." Being a James Bond fan, I fully appreciated all of the references. While by no means a masterpiece of the cinema, the first Austin Powers was witty, clever, and overall very funny.They should have stopped there.I suppose if you have not seen "International Man of Mystery," "The Spy Who Shagged Me" might not be so bad. After all, most of the jokes are taken straight out of the first movie, and the first movie is pretty good. The second movie would still be funny to people who have never seen the first one. There is some new material, however, and most of that material is wretched. It is not clever or funny. It does not even have the potentially saving grace of being controversial or truly obscene. It is just disgusting. My friends and I literally found a couple sections of this movie unwatchable. (We actually looked away.) When it was over, we left feeling somewhat sick to our stomachs. There are a couple of new things that are funny, but they were so few and far between it does not help.On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 2. See the first movie, a 7 in my book. Skip the second. If you must see it, wait till you have a lot of people, and split the cost of a rental as many ways as you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me - **1/2The bottom line is this: If you enjoyed the first film, you will enjoy this one. If you disliked the first film, you will probably dislike the sequel. In other words, it is simply more of the same.The plot... such as it is... goes a little something like this: Dr. Evil (Mike Myers,) banished to space in the first Austin Powers adventure, returns to earth and creates a time machine. He then travels back to 1969 in an attempt to steal Austin's mojo. Meanwhile, in 1999, Austin (Mike Myers) learns that his new bride Vanessa Kensington ( Elizabeth Hurley) is really a FemmeBot. Austin reluctantly dispatches the evil machine before traveling back to the swinging 60s himself to foil Dr. Evil's nefarious plot. Dr. Evil and his son Scott (Seth Green) still do not get along. Even an appearance on the Jerry Springer show fails to bring them together. So Dr. Evil creates a clone that is identical to himself, only 1/8 the size. This character (Verne Troyer) is dubbed "Mini-Me" by his creator. Once he arrives in 1969, Austin joins forces with CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham.) Together they travel to the volcanic island which serves as Dr. Evil's stronghold and attempt to foil his scheme: destroying the earth by firing a giant laser cannon located on the moon.Who are we kidding, here? The plot of this film could not be less important. What is important is the yuk-yuks. Are they fast and frequent? Yes and no. The film certainly features moments of hilarity, as when Dr. Evil and Mini-Me engage in a performance of "Just the Two of Us," when Dr. Evil begins quoting The Exorcist after his electronic chair begins to malfunction, or when Scott Evil argues with his father about he proper way to capture and kill Austin. But all too often the gags run on and on, wearing out their welcome. Prime examples are the tent scene, where Dr. Evil's henchmen believe they see Felicity removing all manner of strange objects from Austin's... uh, private regions. And then there are the two (not one, but two!) scenes in which various passers-by note Dr. Evil's spacecraft in the sky and comment upon its unique appearance, which resembles... uh, more private parts.That brings us to another flaw in the film. It is obsessed with pre-pubescent toilet humor. Don't get me wrong. I love low-brow comedy as much as the next male. But this film reveled inordinately in it. Aside from the scenes noted above, consider the following: (a) The character of Fat Bastard (Mike Myers,) whose sole purpose is to disgust the audience, (b) Austin's accidental drinking of a substance he THOUGHT was coffee, and (c) The opening sequence in which Austin prances nude around a hotel, cleverly (so we are supposed to think) obscured by mirrors, babies, titles, etc. (Never mind that this exact gag appeared in the first film!) The comedic element which works best is Dr. Evil. His relationships with Scott and Mini-Me are both funny in their own way (and neither one involves jokes with bodily fluids.) Finally, Rob Lowe is fantastic as the young Number Two, essentially delivering a perfect imitation of Robert Wagner.In some ways this film is funnier than the original. The inclusion of Mini-Me is a particularly good addition. But the film suffers because it repeats many of the jokes from the prequel, which causes them to seem old and tired. When you add to this the film's practice of dragging out every joke to the point of annoyance, one can see why this film is a moderately funny comedy of two hours, instead of the hilarious comedy of ninety minutes which it should have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again Hollywood money has bludgeoned the subtlety out of a promising idea. The first film was excellent due to the precision, and abundance, of comic insights obtained from the comparison of this decade and its trends and those of the late 60's. In highlighting the respective views of modernity and cool, Myers showed himself to be keenly observant of the futility and superficiality of much of Western culture. The greatest source of comedy, however, arose from Dr. Evil - a man gainfully trampling on the ideas of threat, fear, expense, fatherhood and emotional complexity prevalent in the movies of the earlier decade. Once again in this sequel, Dr. Evil was the funniest character, producing situations similar to those of the first film. With the addition of 'Minnie-Me' (did I spell that correctly?), real comedy was achieved upon the performance of some of this decades' most popular songs. This appeared to be another swipe at cultural trends - with the insincerity and over-simplification of human issues inherent in these songs at once apparent in this context.However, the use of the 'Minnie-Me' character is also symptomatic of this film's faults. The dwarf is a very old supposedly comedic idea, and has not aged well. Smaller people doing all things that others do, but smaller! The character has got a small suit, a small piano, he walks in a small way. You must be laughing by now. At least a little bit? Do I detect the bile of political correctness in my throat, a wiff of pungent modernity. Possibly. Regardless, I did not find that someone's smallness (and correspondingly childlike behaviour), in itself had the possibility of humour, let alone displayed it in this film.I cite this as symptomatic of the film because it was an example of the repetition of a single simplistic idea. Another example would be the repeated use of "Yeah, Baby, Yeah". The humour at hearing this and other like comments in the first film arose from the surprise at its application - i.e. sex, disco. However by repeating the phrase over and over, the contextual surprise was lost. The application was unsparing and indiscriminate. One was meant to find find it funny, in itself. Another example would be Fat Bastard being fat, and Scottish. Oh, and also being called 'Fat Bastard'.The only example of repetition which I found truly funny was Dr. Evil's use of 'LASER' - an apt comment on how new scientific language becomes accepted, after being initially cumbersome and misunderstood. I only realised how truly cumbersome the word was and how language has progressed after its abundant use.This film has aimed for big money: which habitually means small ideas, small social comment, big repetition, low aspirations (or should that be libido). A shame, but Myers' talent will not be dimmed for long.</fullReview>

Mike Myers is a great actor; although he only became 'famous' really, when he started the Austin Powers series.He played three characters: Fat Bastard, the man himself (Austin Powers), and Dr Evil; I thought he played all parts very well, and to act in a film as well as co-write it takes quite a lot of time and patience, especially with the latex suit that he had to wear to play fat Bastard!Heather Graham, who played the gorgeous Felicity Shagwell was very good in the film, if not also a good actor!Austin Powers is the first series of it's kind (as far as I can remember) and its worth seeing. It's brilliant from beginning to end, and i will see it again! I think it's true that if a film has too many sequels, they get worse as they go along, but I think that in this case it gets better!

So if its comparably funny then it also must be a comedy classic. Follow?Any who has sat down and laughed about the millions of funny sketches in the film will never understand how anyone cannot like the film. Maybe it is a sad serious world after all.Anyway back to Myers geekdom. Bye bye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers(the character, not the film) is so boring it is unbelievable. Those dances inbetween scenes are tiring. Those terrible lines like "Its not my bag, baby" only work once. But, the writers got something right that impressed me a lot. In both films I found Dr.Evil and Scott Evil absolutely hilarious. Its worth watching the films just for them. Mike Myers as Dr.Evil is so funny-"I'm hip, I'm cool" he says before performing what looks like Whigfield for his son Scott(Seth Green-Enemy Of The State) who stands in disbelief.Now they're back! This time, Dr.Evil turns up on The Jerry Springer Show to get back with his unforgiving son, but actually ends up kicking the crap out of Jerry(ha!). With the added humour of Mini Me and a younger Number 2, Dr.Evil hopes to travel back in time to steal Austin's 'mojo', thus making Austin sexually useless.The Spy Who Shagged Me is an incredible movie. The funniest parts are the s**t coffee with Austin and the Mini Me attack. Heather Grahem is also in on the show. She has few funny lines, and is only there to look sexy-which she does one hundred and one percent.I highly recommend this film. If you saw the first one and weren't impressed(like me), then go and see the second one anyway. Rating=5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers 1: Original, funny, clever spoof on the James Bond films.Austin Powers 2: Where do I start? This is not a spoof on anything. It is an annoying man pulling faces and being a prat for two hours. Okay, penis jokes are funny, admittedly, but even they can wear thin. And what else is there? Straight-laced megalomaniac Dr Evil trying to be trendy? That sort of humour is children's TV material. A funny little dwarf man? A big fat disgusting man? And not even imaginatively disgusting. This is all so not funny. The script feels like it was knocked up over a couple of hours in conference with a primary school class. Hey, kids, what would be a funny thing to happen now? Kids: The man drinks some poo! Ha ha ha! And no, it's not self-parody, or ironic, or tongue-in-cheek. It's just rubbish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the first Austin Powers, so I do not know much about the Austin Powers character or his previous "engagement" with Doctor Evil. Fortunately, I didn't have to know a lot in order to enjoy this movie, since the jokes were pretty self-explanatory. Of course, there will be some people who finds that potty-humour jokes obscene and vulgar, but then that's what should be expected from this movie. Plus, this movie was a great spoof of reality, as it incorporate many stuff of popular culture (the Jerry Springer bit, "Show me the Money!!", and all those James Bond tie-ins, for example). So on the face this movie might seem to be just another crude ride loaded with offensive, off the wall behaviour, but this movie is actually very smart with all the subtle comedy which one might not see. I found it to be very hilarious.</fullReview>

Heather Grahm was fantastic as well. Seth Green (Oz from Buffy) As usual made a great performance I'm so happy they gave him more lines this time. Although this is kinda different for him becasue he usually plays quiet characters (take Oz for example). This is a really funny movie.

		<fullReview>I can safely say that I DETESTED the first Austin Powers movie. However, I was made to watch the sequel (very reluctantly) and overall, it was a vast improvement.Firstly, there was more Dr. Evil, who was the only funny character in the first movie - I liked how they brought back Scott Evil and I can't stop saying the word "ri - goddam - diculous"! Secondly, there were fewer "Yeah baby!" or "Shagadelic" - style catchphrases. The ones that remained didn't work as the movie was, to an extent, more intelligent. However, I agree with one comment which said that this does NOT typify British humour. (Not even Benny Hill.) Oh, and Fat B******'s accent was really good for a Canadian - I should know, as I'm Scottish.The film still had flaws, though. The humour was overall pretty puerile - something which I don't really appreciate - and some scenes should have been cut as they weren't needed and were pretty disgusting. I'm talking to you, Faeces Sample Scene! Also, (and I know I'll be burned at the stake for this) I preferred Vanessa Kensington to Felicity Shagwell. Heather Graham seemed more like an insipid side - kick than a partner in crime, so to speak - I just didn't feel the chemistry between she and Austin. Liz Hurley was more sultry, which was better.Overall, I didn't really rate the movie - it was pretty bad. But if you saw the first one and didn't really like it, don't automatically assume that you'll hate this. It deserves a chance.My final words of advice - DO NOT watch this movie with three adolescent boys, as I did, or you'll get nothing but nudge - nudge - wink - wink comments whenever Heather Graham appears!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" is pretty funny, but the Austin Powers character is getting a little played out. The first was really funny though.This one's plot is Dr. Evil (who steals the show w/ Seth Green) goes back to the 60's and steals Austin's mojo. It sounds much funnier than it is. The only really LoL parts are when Dr. Evil gets shagadelic with Frau, when a beautiful Heather Graham is supposedly pulling stuff out of Austin's behind, and the lingering DICK joke!Many good laughs, but sometimes Austin seems pretty stupid, and the plot stalls.

		<fullReview>Ultra-minor spoilers included, nothing plot-orientated. Besides, this is NOT a plot movie.It was funny, definitely. But throughout the film I sat there wanting to laugh a lot more than it let me. It got the audience in the mood with the very amusing opening credits, and then seemed to rely too much on its 60's cool atmosphere and not enough on fresh jokes- exactly how many were exhumed from the last movie I don't know; it wasn't worth trying to count. Some of these re-used jokes were funnier 2nd time round (Zip it..) but most fell flat; Mustafa's cries for help when we think he's dead were nowhere near as amusing as they were when they were fresh and unexpected in the first movie.So it's tempting to accuse Myers of over-confidence in his product, and trying to get away with too little, but somehow that's not how it came across; if I was writing this film's school report I'd come up with something along the lines of 'tried very hard, but must try harder', which would probably be a first, but hey, that's what happens when you write report cards for movies, I guess.See this film by all means, but expect only a B(+).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Phantom Menace was hyped up beyond any sane person's realistic expectations. Consequently, anybody who didn't get swept away by the ridiculous merchandising and press hysteria got to see a rather fun and very well-made film.Austin Powers 2 has also been hyped up a lot, with reviews shouting how it's as good, IF NOT BETTER!, than the original. With these seemingly sensible opinions of the film, I had high hopes for the sequel, seeing as the original Austin Powers is one of my favourite comedies (along with Myers' other creation, Wayne's World).However, AP2 was rather disappointing. The vast majority of the film's jokes were simply lifted straight out of the original, with no variation. The rest relied entirely on the viewer's knowledge of pop culture. Depending on how clued in your are to Myers' take on the latter half of the 20th century dictates how much you will get out of the film. The original included parodies and sly references in a subtle and very clever way; The Spy Who Shagged Me shoves them in your face.More worrying is the fact that Myers seems to have forgotten how to play Austin. Whereas before he came across as a slightly off- centre semi-hippy, stuck in the '90s which he couldn't quite figure out, this time round he just seems like a boring old fart who is trying desperately to hold on to memories of the '60s.His portrayal of Dr Evil was very good, although we got to see perhaps a little too much of him. His new creation, Fat Bastard, was amusing for a while but soon became boring. Mini-Me was irritating from the start.Still a funny, entertaining film, but not a classic comedy like the original.</fullReview>

Mike Myers was worse than the last one and even worse than he was in So I married an axe murderer. Heather Graham should stick to films like Boogie Nights and License to Drive, but keep away from the comedies and Sci-Fi's. She was as nearly as bad in this as Lost in Space.

The new female role is played by a terribly flat and dull acting model who should not have been even considered for the role.

Not only did i find myself not laughing but i wanted to leave the cinema. If this is supposed to be a homage to British humor then it is a huge misfire. Two hours of toilet humour does not always make for quality British comedy. I was hoping that Dr. Evil would be the funniest character of all but he delivered only mildly amusing gags. Which brings me neatly to Powers himself. His gags aren't funny and yet they are repeated sometimes two or three times in the same scene. If i ever see this film again it will be too soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is often said of films which attempt to parody the James Bond ethos (eg Casino Royale) that it is impossible to spoof a spoof. Bunkum. Bond films are not spoofs. They are deadly serious about their hero and the values he represents. Neither he nor his antics are ever made risible. He may be wry and humorous, but these are qualities of the macho power the films endorse, like his virility. Bond films are brilliantly entertaining (except Roger Moore, obviously), but they are also reactionary, imperialist celebrations of a repressive code that deserves spoofing.AP2 - despite the seemingly freeform Airplane-style barrage of gags - is a rich example of the spoof genre, and immeasurably better than the happy accident of the original. Appropriately for a sequel, it is concerned with image, pastiche, reproduction (Dr Evil/Mini-me/Scott; Evil/Austin/Fat Scots person (we're not allowed cuss, are we?)/Mike Myers; Austin/Austin ten minutes ago, etc.), and the consequences of this. A knowing post-modern artefact, the present of the film eerily mirrors at the end the 1960s of its inspiration.Austin, as a photographer in the David Bailey mode (right down to the foul teeth) should be an observer, yet is the main participant in the action - the boundaries between subject and object have broken down, there is no room for critical distance, and, hence, opposition. Despite the bright kitsch fun (and it is supremely enjoyable), the characters are trapped in a tragic loop of conformity. In this way, the movie owes much to that other 1960s photographer-in-peril classic, Blowup.This is fugured most prominently in Austin as the James Bond figure. Unlike 007 (except Lazenby), Austin is a tragic character, he cannot master time and space, he is caught in a vortex where the rules of time and space are exploded. The result of this is a crucial loss of virility and identity, the essence of the superspy.Dr Evil is the mirror image of this: unlike the typical, sterile Bond villain, Evil is a family man, and it is his confusions over his progeny which fatally handicap his effectiveness, which, in Blofeld, depended on clear-cut certainty and aloof, unreproducable power. The impossibility of one man taking over the world, when there are replica midgets and whiney teenage sons to undermine his authority, is here shown in tragic, domestic detail, truly a subject worthy of Jerry Springer.This all makes the film sound deadly serious. It's a hoot riot - persistantly laugh-out-loud, fall-off-seat, even-the-longueurs-are-amusing, inventive stuff. It seems remarkable that characters in a spoof on 60s relics should prove more sympathetic, likeable and moving than the cardboard cutouts in an epic like The Phantom Menace. Mike Myers, like all the great comedians he plunders, balances ingenious comedy with unexpected pathos - his gift is wayward and breathtaking. Heather Graham is a worthy sidekick, giving herself generously to a thankless stock role, and transcending it with her astonishing talent (and, um, yeah, she's quite pretty too). It'll be fascinating to see how Myers tops this.</fullReview>

There were some genuinely laugh out loud moments in the film but I felt these were rather disjointed and at times it was like watching a sketch show rather than a story. The humour was innovative and hugely entertaining in the first film. In this film the humour was not as fresh but still welcome.

		<fullReview>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me does for badly-made sequels what the original Austin Powers did for spoofs on James Bond. The jokes in Austin Powers 2 are merely rehashed creations of the original - the movie is littered with the same old gags of Dr. Evil's "zip it," lines such as, "Yeah baby, yeah!" and a newer, updated version of Dr Evil's Big Boy space hideout, now in the shape of a phallic penis. There were, of course, some hilarious scenes, mostly involving the new characters of Scottish henchman Fat Bastard and his stool. This movie made $54m in its first week of US release, as audiences quickly snapped up tickets in the mistaken belief that it would be even funnier than the original, but as soon as they realised that in fact, this movie was less funny than, to quote Powers, "Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day," it soon bombed out of the charts. Still, the film will go down in history as a roaring success, and though it does have more appeal to Americans than to me, a Brit, I still don't see how any person would pay to see funny one-only jokes retold to them over and over again. Anyway, Myers should be happy - the money generated from commercial plugs from the movie (Starbucks Coffee &amp; Virgin Atlantic) should alone tide him over for years to come. And I fear that that was the whole point in this movie - unlike the first, it was made to make money, not to make people laugh. I will have one fond memory of this movie though - the sight of an Austin-sponsored Virgin "Shagatlantic" billboard on a recent trip to New York. It read, "London to New York. Five times a day baby, yeah!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A damned disappointment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a big fan of the first Austin Powers film, mainly because it had a spontaneous anarchic quality that is rare in the typical Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Mike Myers came out of that movie looking like a comic genius, but after seeing AP2, I'm beginning to wonder if he's just a Gen-X Dan Aykroyd.For starters, it is important for any movie, even a spoof, to have some kind of plot. Yes, AP1 had a underdeveloped skeleton of a plot, but it did propel the story. AP2 constantly fizzles out because there's never any place to go after the latest gag. In AP1, the "fish-out-of-water" gag propelled the story. In AP2, gags were carried on until they just couldn't go any further, and then the story needed to be restarted again.Secondly, Heather Graham was given absolutely nothing to work with in AP2. Elizabeth Hurley was one of the best things about AP1, because it was her straight-man act that propelled so much of the comedy and the conflict in the story. The audience could easily relate to her. Heather Graham, on the other hand, serves as backdrop. She is given absolutely nothing funny to work with. Sure, she's sexy... but she's never given a chance to serve as a foil to Austin's hijinks.Another thing, several of the best characters in AP1 were woefully underused in AP2. Seth Green is the first name who comes to mind. His Jerry Springer appearance was amusing, but after that, he practically disappears. Mindy Sterling did well with what she was given, but once again, her character has very little to do in the final third of the film. Finally, pop culture references are great, but some of the ones used in this one weren't up to par. The Will Smith parody sticks out as something that will not age well with repeated viewings. It's a real challenge to find things that relate to audiences of 1999 but won't be lost on audiences of 2009. I will admit that the Starbucks and Jerry Springer gags will probably age well in the future.I'm just disappointed that AP2 has become the more recognized film in this series, because it contains little of the manic energy that the first one had. Sadly, I think this franchise has already run its course. Here's hoping that Mike Myers can put together another great character without strip-mining it after just 2 movies. I still think Dieter from 'Sprockets' could be interesting...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge Mike Myers fan! Wayne's World is genius and the original Austin Powers was great! Myers totally reinvented the word 'shag' and has created a cult classic. The second installment of austin powers is just as good as the original. My vote still goes with the original because it was the first... but dr. evil is even funnnier in the second movie and with the addition of fat bastard...this movie is great fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Spy Who Shagged Me is a movie that is actually better than the original. The only thing that I didnt like about this movie is why wasnt it Rated R, I wanted to see more of Heather Graham after all of those sexy outfits she wore or they were barely outfits. Dr.Evil is the funniest thing of the whole movie, his dorky attitude and when he tries to be all hip. Mini-me is my favorite character. Fat Bastard was the most disguisting thing I had ever seen.

		<fullReview>I liked the first movie and was excited to see this one. What a letdown. I think I laughed 2 or three times the whole movie. A large part of what made the first one funny was that Austin thought he was cool but everyone else thought he was passe. Now, they have thrown that away and Austin is cool...which deletes most of the humor potential except for the kind of humor you can see 10 miles away coming at you. I will admit that the string of people staring into the sky going " it looks like a giant..." was funny as was the tent scene! But aside from that I was counting dots on the wall for 2 hours. I wanted to like this movie but could not as hard as I tried. A lot of points where the movie was just painfully looking for tired laughs ANYWHERE but it didn't work. Mike Myers is a heck of a talent but for some reason in this one he alone could not keep it afloat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the genres and sub-genres, I think that the comedy spoofs are the most difficult to make. When they're bad, they're spat upon and forgotten ("Silence of the Hams," "Plump Fiction"). When they're good, they don't get much thanks; can anyone give me a good reason why the first "Hot Shots!" movie wasn't up for Best Picture at the Oscars? It was as a better comedy than "The Prince of Tides" was a drama.The bar is raised for spoof comedies, because not only do they have to borrow from other pop culture icons (easy), but they have to make a good joke about them (not easy). Then they have to move it by fast enough to get to the next joke; the audience has to be constantly caught off guard for up to ninety minutes. The actors get no break, either -- they can't reveal that they know the material is funny, lest they ruin it. The finest specimens of spoof comedy, "Hot Shots!", "Airplane!", and "The Naked Gun!" were far from perfect. They provided the best success to failure ratio for their jokes, though, and they rose to the top.The success to failure ratio for "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" is pretty darn good, I'm surprised to report. When the gags fall flat, which is often, you're still smiling from the ones that didn't.As usual Dr. Evil has all the good lines, but the funniest performance of all is a small one: Tim Robbins as the President (which one is anybody's guess) from 1969. Austin himself is also pretty funny, and I still chuckle as I recall some of the really high points of this movie.Unfortunately Heather Graham, who is one of our great rediscoveries of the decade, doesn't fit the material very well. Then again, having a sidekick for Austin who's just as randy as he is sort of deflates the tension between them, kind of like having both Murtaugh and Riggs from "Lethal Weapon" be young, handsome and suicidal. What'd be the fun in that? Also, the third Mike Myers incarnation, Fat Bastard, isn't funny at all.For all intents and purposes, the spoof genre is redeemed somewhat with "Austin 2." There's plenty of laughs, and... well, what more do you want?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the summary line pretty much says it all.This movie has received a great deal of praise, but generally more from viewers than from critics. There is a quite good reason for this.It isn't that good.Austin Powers 2 pales in comparison to its predecessor. Where the first Powers was fresh and clever, both in its now famous catch-lines and its satirical humor, the second one profoundly disappoints. In general, "The Spy Who Shagged Me" represents a low-brow pandering to a mass audience, which can be only expected from a movie whose main character shamelessly hawks everything from online services to beer. Many of the once-spontaneous and original catch lines injected into the pop culture mainstream by the first installment come off here as both hackneyed and forced. Also, in place of the fish-out-of-water humor of that made the original great are attempts at belly laughter in the There's Something About Mary style that unfortunately fall far short of the 1998 smash-hit comedy's example. And, despite her attractiveness, Heather Graham is no Elizabeth Hurley; Graham's acting is plastic, and as a result, the love relationship between her and Myers comes off as unbelievable and irrelevant.For all of these reasons, AP2 is unworthy of its namesake -- it shamelessly runs into the ground the one-liners of the first, and at the same time makes a departure from the type of humor that made the first one so great. The price of admission would be much better spent at the video store, renting Austin Powers 1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers repeats his role as the 60's spy, Austin Powers. This time they send him back to the 60's to defeat the evil Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) and the disgusting Fat Bastard (Mike Myers). Mike is quite good, but enough is enough. Each joke, visual or verbal, is beaten to death. Get your laugh and move on. How many names for the male sex organ can you think of? Just about every one of them is here. It just goes on and on. Heather Graham is lovely as his love interest this time around. However, her line readings are sometimes wooden and amateurish. The music is the best part of the film. A super rendition of "I'll Never Fall in Love Again" sung by Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello is wasted with a sparsely choreographed dance by Austin and Felicity (Graham). The title sequence just repeats the scenes from the first film where Austin's pubic area is creatively covered as he prances nudely through a hotel. Humorous the first time, less so the second time around. One plus, it was nice to see a comedy photographed in Panavision. The widescreen process and vivid colors definitely brighten up the proceedings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply put, this film is a load of crap; a studio rush job, more interested in getting those Virgin Shaglantic/Heinekin product placements set up than in getting an actual script written. The original "Austin Powers" was a sleeper hit because it was actually funny, snuck in small and hit big on video. This film is an overly calcuated mess -- a typical example of "let's do market studies to figure out why the last one worked, then get out the cookie cutters..." and then botch it all, anyway.I won't even go into describing the plot, because it all makes no sense. (Even "AP I" gave a nod to having a coherent story.) Suffice it to say that the filmmakers set up a time travel device, then ignore era from that point on; parts of this film could take place in 1999 or 1969, but it makes no difference. This is a shame, because they could have really mined the differences between the Swingin' 60s and the Stuckup 90s in two directions (as "AP I" did so wonderfully in one direction); instead, any semblance of character, reality, consistency or the like is sacrificed for a really bad one-liner.The only high points of the film: there's an extended "They almost said a naughty word but not really" bit near the end that's hilarious -- but it's repeated, and therefore diluted. Beyond that, Verne Troyer is amazing as Mini-Me, turning in a compelling performance without a word (when oh when will Hollywood cast a little person in a "real" role?); Rob Lowe does an amazing Robert Wagner impersonation; Mindy Sterling, as always, is a true gem as Frau Farbissina (and she should be working more in film, dammit) and Seth Green is just, well... yumm-i-luscious (although whoever decided to cover up his great natural red hair with black dye was an idiot). But, if you want to see most of these people giving their best, just rent "AP I."Anyway, none of the above really matters, because it feels like the film was shot from a bad, rushed first draft, and the principals just didn't give a damn during shooting. They saw a cash cow in the making, but didn't bother to recapture what it was that made the first film so good. Just more proof that there's no secret formula to "formula." It works when you're not trying, but falls apart as soon as everything you do is just another excuse for a bit of product placement...</fullReview>

Mike handles Fat Bastard and Mini Me and Dr. Evil make a dynamic duo. The entering of Jerry Springer is hilarious and Tim Robins is a believable president.The first dancing act is not as good as the one in the previous movie.

I rated the first 60% as a 5.5 and the last 40% as a 7.5. The math on that is a 6.3. Still I fudged upward again - this time to a 7 (my cutoff point for acceptability or for adding to my 1,200 movie collection).It was pleasant enough to view and there were some good hearty laughs in the second half. Certainly seeing Fat Bastard naked in bed was a classic moment and not one I will soon forget.

		<fullReview>This new installment of Austin Powers was all right. You will laugh a few times if you go to see it, but you will probably get a sense of deja vu as you watch... Austin Powers 2 would have been a more appropriate title, as this movie is just a rehash of the first Austin Powers. At least if it were AP2, Myers could have made the movie a spoof of sequels in general rather than making just another franchise-extending movie.There were some good additions, Mini-Me being the best. As in the first, I found him and the rest of the evil characters far more interesting than the good guys... The evil in this movie really keeps you laughing while the Austin Powers parts get a little tiresome. For example, your attention will probably wander during Austin's opening sequence.I didn't think much of the Fat Bastard bits. They may make you laugh slightly as you go "Eeewww," but that's the extent of it. Myers has said how much he enjoyed the character, though, so I suspect he'll pop up in the next movie, too.Lastly, since I watched this movie shortly after the "Best of Mike Myers" episode of Saturday Night Live, I realized something: Mike Myers hasn't come up with a new joke in years. From "a certain 'I don't know what'" to controlling the volume of his voice, Myers has consistently recycled his old material, and I wonder how long he can keep it up. I certainly hope he comes up with something new before Austin Powers 3 starts shooting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While many people were hyped for Phantom Menace, I was gunning for "AP2". Ironically enough, I saw Star Wars before AP2 (albeit, two hours before). Anyway, people had been spewing out of the cinemas saying that it was better than the first (I saw it the second night it opened here and half the people I knew saw it on the opening night) and I was quite bewildered because nothing could've been as good as the first - I mean, I have the damn movie on VCD and I watch it all the time. So I went into the cinema not quite sure what to expect because we'd lined up for nearly an hour only to have our session sold out so we hung around for another 2hrs for the next session and then we had to line up to get IN to the theatre... the point of this story is - it was fantastic! It really was better than the first. The humour was more daring (quite a few movie allusions in there), the grossness more than hairy chests and snaggle teeth... to this day, coffee and homing devices make me cringe.Dr. Evil, by far the best character, is more developed, as is his 'clan' of evil-doers. All of the hilarious moments involved Dr Evil - like the Jerry Springer appearance, mini-me, 'Just the Two of Us' and the page to the White House, his obscene shaped rocket, his seduction of Frau Farbissina etc. Austin was still Austin but Felicity Shagwell wasn't as good a 'sidekick' (shag?) as Agent Kensington. Too bad about the gunpowder jubblies. Thing about Ms Shagwell was that she had eyes like golf balls and strange hair - NB: Liz Hurley, much better.All the innuendoes were still there, as was the cool car (the Shaguar) and the VW of a time machine, the clever nudity scenes (how's the opening credits for a dance scene to match AP1?) and that shadow thing in the tent. Fat Bastard was cringeworthy - "get in my belly!" but they played with him quite well in the end. This is the first movie I've had to line up for and the first where everyone clapped when it ended. Smashing stuff. Incredibly smashing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why? Cause I was constantly laughing in the cinema while watching this movie.I didn't catch AP1 so I can't determine whether this is a good sequel. But as a stand alone movie, AP:TSWSM is a good movie that did not confuse those who haven't catch the original. The story is adequate.Myers is a pure genius in this movie by playing 3 different characters. Austin Powers was cool, but Dr. Evil was more interesting and hilarious. Every scene involving him is great. A definite candidate for the best villain ever (among Darth Vader and the Joker)!! While as that disgusting Scottish thug that literally weighs a tonne he is very good, although he will be remembered for his disgusting behaviour only.Liz Hurley's cameo appearance at the start was great, and she made a superb Powers girl. Felicity Shagwell was so beautiful that I noticed some people drooled on her. But to me she's a so-so character, otherwise forgettable if not for her sexy outfits.Many of the gags were hilarious, while others were silly or too long that some audience don't get it at all.All in all, it was fun to watch this movie. I have to admit that watching AP:TSWSM is one of the best cinematic experience I've had this year along with 'SW1:Phantom Menace' and 'The Matrix'. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hit or miss. As I suspected, the kooky premise cannot bear much more weight, which is why this pretty much collapses. It was inevitable that, as a sequel, it would have a self-conscious, contrived feeling, in contrast to the freshness of the first. Some hilarious bits interspersed with dead spots and among the most disgusting toilet humor imaginable. This, on the whole, detracts from the movie. Mini-Me was a good new character, though I would have made even more of his rivalry with Scott. And Frau Farbissina's girlfriend, Unibrow, ("I met her on the LPGA tour") had a lot of potential. There will be a third, as Myers and the studio will ride this one till it is beyond dead. This premise can't support another outing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why? Cause I was constantly laughing in the cinema while watching this movie.I didn't catch AP1 so I can't determine whether this is a good sequel. But as a stand alone movie, AP:TSWSM is a good movie that did not confuse those who haven't catch the original. The story is adequate.Myers is a pure genius in this movie by playing 3 different characters. Austin Powers was cool, but Dr. Evil was more interesting and hilarious. Every scene involving him is great. A definite candidate for the best villain ever (among Darth Vader and the Joker)!! While as that disgusting Scottish thug that literally weighs a tonne he is very good, although he will be remembered for his disgusting behaviour only.Liz Hurley's cameo appearance at the start was great, and she made a superb Powers girl. Felicity Shagwell was so beautiful that I noticed some people drooled on her. But to me she's a so-so character, otherwise forgettable if not for her sexy outfits.Many of the gags were hilarious, while others were silly or too long that some audience don't get it at all.All in all, it was fun to watch this movie. I have to admit that watching AP:TSWSM is one of the best cinematic experience I've had this year along with 'SW1:Phantom Menace' and 'The Matrix'. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bigger crowd=more excitement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie can easily give two drastically different impressions depending on the crowd you watch it with. i saw it for the first time late opening night. thought it dragged at times, but overall i found it much more over-the-top than the first one. thus i enjoyed it. second time i saw it late sunday night in a practically empty theatre with some friends, and boy what a difference. i realized that the wool was pulled over my eyes. there were bits of big laughter, but they were few and far between, and deservedly so. a lot of the jokes are recycled from the first one and twisted in different ways. plus they're constantly repeated over and over, like skits from SNL. myers may idolize sellers, but he lacks the ironic twist of wit that sellers brought to his style esp. dr. strangelove. not too long ago, myers wasn't even sure if they were gonna do a second one. the movie's lack of fresh jokes and useless new characters justifies the truth that new line was looking to profit from the movie, rather than put out another goofy satire of bond like the first one. and a third one is coming. 0h behave, new line!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I called the original Austin Powers the best comedy film I saw this decade, and I'm sticking by it. The sequel doesn't do the original much justice, and I really wanted to like this film. I even brought along a dozen people.I don't mind repeating jokes - after all, this is part of the Austin Powers culture (or even the Wayne's World culture!). And who cares about the illogical plot? You don't see Austin Powers to learn about "lasers". But joke for joke, reference for reference, there are far fewer in the sequel. I laughed continuously last time. This time, there were plenty of areas which didn't even make it to funny. If you're doing a parody of spy flicks with a dose of pop culture thrown in, then I can't imagine it being tough to fill the movie up with decent gags - as Myers did in 1997.This is essentially the Austin Powers reinterpretation of the Roald Dahl screenplay of You Only Live Twice (its prequel being a mixture of the movie versions of Thunderball and Casino Royale): Dr Evil in a volcano hideout, surrounded by hot liquid mag-ma; with a bit of Matt Helm and Derek Flint thrown in. But not enough, for my liking. And for those who loved the 1960s pop culture, there are far fewer references to those great songs - only I'll Never Fall in Love Again and I'm a Believer. Austin Powers: the Spy Who Shagged Me is very 1990s and in some places, commercialism and an attempt to capture the teen market were evident.Good points? There are many: George Clinton's fabulous parody score, which repeats some cues from the original plus a lovely spoof of John Barry's Space March/Capsule in Space and You Only Live Twice themes, the latter used when Felicity and Austin arrive on the island with a volcano, both dressed like Honey Ryder in Dr No... The opening sequences are brilliant, as is Heather Graham's very natural and almost na?ve manner, which I rate higher than Elizabeth Hurley's effort in the original. Most of us men, no doubt, had our eyes out on stalks when Miss Graham appeared... Myers' penchant for accents is shown once again. Rob Lowe is magnificent in his impersonation of Robert Wagner, down to his mannerisms and accent, although Wagner's own appearance is sadly limited. Finally: Starbucks, Springer and Seth: top marks.Bad points: aside from those mentioned, toilet humour ain't my sort of thing. Great if you like the thought of Austin accidentally drinking f?ces instead of coffee. The sequences involving Fat Bastard were disgusting in parts - and I'm not exactly your most PC of people. Fat Bastard himself was not a good henchman - something stolen from Bond or Helm would have been better. The movie still felt incredibly low-budget.Finally, Mini-Me. You either love him or hate him. I think his presence in the film helped - but I was disappointed to see Mr Bigglesworth making what we call a "guest appearance" as a result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to make the sequel unlike the original... well for starters, let's avoid using a coherent plot. This movie was a huge disappointment for me. The character of Dr Evil is fuzzy and 2 dimensional(flat X Boring) the cuteness of mini-me wore off in about 5 min austin, himself, went boldly over the line to annoying the fat bastard character was just distatefully gross. The only island in this sea of mediocrity was seth green (as scott evil) pointing out " Nobody knows what you're talking about!....Ass!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Mike Meyers had a long term cash cow here- a potential string of spy spoof movies (like Flint and Matt Helm only better/ funnier and updated for the 90's) with varied situations and most importantly, villains. Had high hopes for the sequel, but the emphasis on Dr. Evil was a let down... I felt it was the weakest part of the first film, and could not believe that most of this movie was devoted to this one joke character. Why not Fat Bastard as the villain?? or develop some other baddie with more comedic potential. As for Felicity Shagwell, I remain doubtful on both counts.. Of course she's pretty, but the poor girl can't handle this simple assignment- plays it too eager and without any thought (not that she has much to work with)...I pray that Mike has enough depth to move on to more diverse gags and different characters for the follow up to this sad affair... 3 out of 10 at best... sorry Mike....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The guys behind us were in stitches through most of the movie, but I was bored most of the time.Don't get me wrong, I love Mike Myers. AP1 wasn't (in my view) his best, but it was a great unshackled mix of typical Myers sly references to other cultures, dry take-offs, and general ham humour. AP2 was more of the same...but less. It obviously didn't have the benefit of novelty that the AP1 had. And if anything, wasted more effort on the unsuccessful aspects of the first.For those of us Brits living in London in the 60's and 70's, this movie could have been hilarious--the set recreations of London in '69' were fabulous. Myers as Austin Powers maintained enough crazed energy to keep the movie perking along, and Heather Graham's physical attributes alone are enough to keep one's interest alive (to be fairer, she's much better than that).But the character of Dr. Evil and those of his henchmen, and the humour associated with them was beyond me. I yawned all the way through AP1 when DE was up there, and was dismayed to find that in AP2, we see even more of him. I was also uncomfortable seeing both dwarfs and fat people playing central roles as humourous targets. OK so "mini-me" kept on this side of that brink for most of the movie but haven't we moved a little bit beyond laughing at fat people?Myers has claimed that he was not going to do a second movie unless he could make it funnier than the first. For some of us, he took a long step backwards with this one, not forwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you liked Austin Powers before he became a household video rental, you won't find AP2 funny enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok. It's funny. But was it worth $7?Not likely. Austin Powers I one was a play on British spy movies from the 60s-80s (predominately James Bond). It was the parody that made it truly funny, particulary for those who love British culture or spy movies.The second turns Austin Powers away from a parody and into a cartoon character. I don't blame Myers, since it was unlikely that he was going to be able to make Austin Powers dolls of the first one. The new Austin Powers is more marketable, MTV-able, and catch-phrase-ian.This doesn't make the Spy Who Shagged Me a failure. Undoubtably it will do what it was created to do: make money. And, I'm sure that the majority of moviegoers will associate more with AP2 than one.The first movie had the feel of a sliced together, cheaply made, swiftly-edited spy movie. Myer's new creation is too sharp, glossy, and cartoonish.My advice to those of you who loved Austin Powers before it was groovy to: stay away until the video release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embarrassingly Hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers is one of those movies in which you can't help but laugh out loud, even you know that you really shouldn't. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is just full of those kinds of gags, but they are definiely a lot more funny then any of the lame "jokes" of South Park. Mike Myer's has done a good job at coming up with original material for his sequel to Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery. I believe this one is funnier than the first. There are two really good characters added into the series here. The first is Mini-Me, a clone of Dr. Evil, 1/8th his size. He is the same evilness as his father, but it's packed in tightly, which makes Mini-Me even more crazy and vicious than Dr. Evil. This leads to a hilarious fight scene with Austin which has to be seen to be believed. The 2nd new character is Fat Bastard. Played by Myers, (I don't think anyone else would've done it) Fat Bastard is simply the fattest man you will see in the movies (Except for maybe, Jabba the Hut, who isn't really a man). Every line he says can't help but make you laugh out loud. There is also a new, Austin girl, Filicity Shagwell. Except for her looks, she really isn't that interesting, but she doesn't take anything away from the movie. In comparison to the first Austin Powers flick, there is a lot more satire in this film, particularly of the James Bond kind. You have to see the movie a few times just to get all the spoofs. I certainly caught a few more in my second viewing. I also noticed that a lot of the spoofs are simply of movies in general, such as bad guys utter inability to hit their target, and bombs constant tendancy to take longer than their expected time to blow up. At no point in the film did I find myself bored and I instead found myself laughing hard many times. I recommend this film to anyone who doesn't mind sick humour. I give this film 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

Something about Mike Myers has always struck me as being funny and poignant. Ordinary-looking guy with great sense of humor makes good. I guess I'm a fan. I really enjoyed watching him get into his characters.Mini-me is a classic conception; I could watch the interaction of Dr. Evil and Mini-Me forever.The best parts of the movie were the reaction shots after Austin said a laugh-line. I love the drawn-out pause that followed each of those lines, as Austin and his listeners are embarrassed--Austin knowing that he's said something naughty and that no one laughed, and his listeners trying to decide on a reaction.I also enjoyed the Frau's countdown.I really enjoyed watching this flick--I just don't remember laughing a whole lot out loud.</fullReview>

I applaud to Verne Troyer, Minime, for giving a spectacular performance. Even though he didn't have any lines in the movie and didn't do much, he was really funny and I'm glad he's getting all this fame because he deserves it.

		<fullReview>The main thing I have to say is that The Spy Who Shagged Me is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I can't wait to go see it for the third time. It's more than worth the ticket price. Many people criticize it for its use of gags from the first movie, but what they don't seem to get is the fact that that is what makes it so funny. The jokes are reused word for word on purpose. It's not trying to be inventive, it's just trying to be funny. The film makes fun of itself. They could have used new jokes and made the movie funny, but by incorporating the jokes from the original, it ignites that spark of recognition in anyone who has seen the movie and makes it hilarious. You need to just enjoy this movie and not try to analyze it as some great piece of art. I think we've lost sight of what movies are supposed to be about. They are designed to be entertaining. They are supposed to be fun. Austin Powers more than fulfills this requirement and earns a perfect ten from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering how wide open both the first and second movies in the Austin Powers series are for sequels, you'd better be able to back it up. Myers delivers the goods. Unlike most SNL alums from the 90s, Myers has actual comedic talent, and Austin Powers 2 shows it off.The plot? Full of holes, but at least Myers's characters acknowledge this and even PLAY with it. Speaking of which, Myers is everywhere - from the laugh-out-loud Dr. Evil to the only real misstep, Fat Bastard.Speaking of which, here's why he's a misstep: he takes every single stereotype of fat people and puts them up for people to laugh at. It's backward thinking that really doesn't belong in our present year, to be honest. One scene in particular involving Fat Bastard and Shagwell (Graham) together in bed is played strictly for disgust. Then, of course, Fat Bastard ends up feeling bad about himself at the end because he's fat. Sigh.That's why I dock the movie a half star.The rest of it is really enjoyable, laugh out loud type material. Just about worth full price. Can "Shagfinger" be far behind? 4.5/5.0 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A visually entertaining comedy for most scenes. Especially Heather Graham. Mike Myers is very versatile and not afraid to use any material or take on any character but he went too far in some scenes. I would not want my kids to see this movie due to the probable influence for imitation of dialogue and behavior. I think they could have kept it funny without the disgusting and crude stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's start by saying that the movies is great for all kids from 9 to ???. I saw this movie with an audience of kids 9 to 10, and they howled throughout, catching all double entendres, loving the naughty words, etc. And certainly much of the humor was on this level. Yes, lots of humor involving bodily parts and functions, and non too subtle either.On the other hand, there's lots of stuff for the over 12 audience too. Witty lines and references are scattered throughout. I wish I had seen various Bond movies (there came a point where I couldn't watch them) just to catch all the references. Dr. Evil was magnificently idiotic and evil, and the only sane person in the movie was his son, who, while giving an honest appraisal of the good Doctor's plans, makes it all the more hilarious.Don't even look for a plot. If you do, you've missed the point. Go for a cleverly written fab picture. Lots of pretty girls, lots of bizarre situations, Jerry Springer, Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello cameos, and a wonderful performance by Mike (Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard) Meyers. Yeah!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the movie and reading an interview with Mike Meyers, I got the impression that he approached this film with a "go to work and have fun" kind of attitude. That's not to say that he didn't have fun in the first movie, it just seems as if the energy was a bit more focused the first time around. I found this movie utterly hilarious at times, revolting at others (drinking diahorrea), but consistently lighthearted and fun for the duration. If you liked the first Austin Powers, chances are pretty good that you'll enjoy this one. I've read a few negative and convoluted comments on this film, and the only thing I have to say is this: Any attempt to analyze this movie on a level other than a unique brand of comedic fun is futile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was definitely not disappointed with Austin 2 as I thought I would be. Even though I had seen a lot of the funny parts in the millions of commercials that they had (Master card spoof was brilliant by the way) I still loved the movie enough to go back again opening night and then a third time a week later. I will admit that the Austin segments were a little under developed and used quite a few of the old jokes with a twist but no one can convince me that the Dr. Evil segments more than made up for Austin's short comings. The Jerry Springer appearance was amazing, Mimi Me was much more entertaining than I had thought and all of the movie references were hilarious! Felicity never quite found her niche however and that also disappointed me a little. Unfortunately we don't have a Chili's in Canada so I was the only one laughing at Fat Bastard's song. All in all an excellent movie and Mike Myers (a Canadian) is a genius!</fullReview>

The funny bits, and there are a lot of them, are even funnier this time around. The silly, scatological bits are sillier and more grotesque as well. Dr. Evil is absolutely hilarious, and Mini-me was genius. Fat Bastard, except for his predilection for baby flesh, was just awful and something I could have done without. Unfortunately, many of the gags are re-treads from the first film. The whole film is just more over the top than the first one, sometimes too much over the top. If you liked the first film, you will like this one as well. If you thought the first film was bad, you will think this one is worse.</fullReview>

I have never been more disappointed sitting in a movie theater. At first, I thought it was de ja vu - the strategic placement of fruit and other objects in front of various private parts, the over-exaggerated laughter of Dr. Evil and his cronies at the end of a scene, and the constant attempts of Dr. Evil himself to shut Scott up w/ shh, double shh... - whatever, you get my point. I recall two or three original jokes in this movie, and 'fat bastard' doesn't count - he was just disgusting! After almost two years, I would expect some new jokes and catch phrases from Austin. I know the English have more slang than just 'shagedelic', Mike. Lastly, I'm happy that Myers was able to rake in all the advertising dough before the premier, but please, please, please, keep it out of the movie! Ugh, I feel sick. The original was perhaps the funniest movie I have ever seen. And the movie I most definitely have seen the most times. But, this was just terrible...I should have given it a '1.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pale Reflection of the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface these comments by saying that I absolutely loved the first Austin Powers film. The blend of satire, slapstick, parody, and innovativeness worked brilliantly in the original. However, innovation and originality were obviously missing in this poor sequel.This is not to say that the movie was a total loss. There were a couple scenes that had me rolling in the aisles. But on the whole, the film just did not work. Much of the humor was rehash from the original and executed poorly this time around. In addition, a large amount of the original material was simply disgusting.Now, as for the characters, this was a mixed bag. Dr. Evil was still humorous for the most part, and Mini-me was a riot. Their rap was one of the funniest parts of the whole movie. Fat Bastard was a terrible character who seemed to have been created solely to shock and disgust the viewer. Felicity Shagwell was a poor substitute for Vanessa Kensingtion. Although Heather Graham is very hot, her acting ability leaves much to be desired. At times, she seemed to be reading her lines off a teleprompter. Of course, her poor acting is no surprise to anyone who saw Lost In Space. As for Number 2, where the hell did he come from! Last we saw he was being baked alive! Now he has a small scar to go with the eyepatch, but I'll let this one go. Rob Lowe performed well enough as the Young #2, but was nothing special. Scott Evil (Seth Green) was quite good, but was not in enough scenes. Its a shame that one of the few characters who worked in this film got so little screen time. And the worst for last, Austin Powers. He certainly was not the great character we saw in the original. The interactions with other characters were forced and not particularly humorous. All in all, the characters were disappointing.I won't even waste time with the plot, other than to say it did not work.On the whole, this was just an awful movie with far too few truly funny bits scattered throughout the film. Its a shame Mike Myers felt the need to rehash so much humor from the first. After all, he's spoofing spy flicks and there is a ton of material to use. Mike, go back to the original and try to recapture that magic, but don't cut and paste the script!Worth the price of admission: for a matinee...maybe</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with three friends of mine, and we laughed just about the whole way through. The first "Austin Powers" and its new sequel are two totally different movies. The second related to the first with it's catchy phrases and concepts, but took on a whole new level by having Austin travel back in time to locate his "mojo." Different charactors were introduced whom added several twists to the humorous plot. Mike Myers did a wonderful job of taking on the roles of "Austin Powers", "Dr. Evil", and the grotesque "Fat Bastard." "Scott Evil," played by Seth Green, was as hot and hilarious as ever. The character's antagonist in this movie was still his father, but mostly the little mini evil himself, "MiniMe." The clone of Dr. Evil was a great addition to this movie. "Felicity Shagwell," Austin's love interest this time around, was pretty good but I don't think that she was better than "Vanessa Kensington," played by Elizabeth Hurley, of the first movie. I can't give away too much so you'll just have to go and see this movie yourself. Out of ten, I give this movie a nine!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall I loved this film about as much as the first one. When the trailer for AP1 came out it looked hilarious and I thought the concept was amazingly hip and creative. Usually SNL actors do their best work on SNL but then go down hill from there. But actors like Adam Sandler and Mike Myers are the exception to the rule. Myers' Austin Powers and Dr. Evil characterizations are so much funnier that even his Wayne's World character it baffles me. He was always great with English accents on SNL but with his Austin 'Danger' Powers character he's out done himself! I found Dr. Evil the funniest character in this film (and Austin the funniest character in the first one.) The humor is raunchy but very funny. My favorite line was Austin at the go-go: "This is my happening baby and it freaks me out! Yeah!" It was just so wacky and off the wall. I was a little shocked and grossed out, however, at the bathroom jokes surrounding Fat Bastard. I was a little disappointed with the writers' artistic decision there but aside from that I was very impressed. I also found Heather Graham gorgeous and very shagable indeed, baby. The 60's was America's and England's grooviest, hippest, most creative and psychedelic decade and Austin brings that and more into the 90's. Party on Wayne! Er, I mean...Austin!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to the return of Austin Powers for a while now. I thought the first one was very inventive and original. Mike Meyers spoof of 60's style and James Bond movies were right on the mark. It was a great premise bringing the swingin Powers and Dr. Evil into the 90's world. The sequel, while funny, has lost some of its original punch and flavor. What made Austin truly funny in the original, was the fact that he was this freak from the 60's set loose in the 90's. In the sequel this is lost. And it is almost as if Meyers and company said to hell with James Bond, we'll tell toilet jokes. No scene in this new Austin Powers comes close to equaling the humor of Austin Powers set loose in a modern day Las Vegas casino (both poking fun at the James Bond mythology and making fun of Austin's retro feel). If anything Austin should be out and about in exotic 90's locales like club med, a Carnival cruise ship or a snowboard park battling bad guys but instead they choose to keep him in London. BORING!! Hopefully next time, Meyers will get back to poking fun at the Bond movies (exotic locales, shaggin' girls). Don't get me wrong there were many things I liked Dr. Evil, mini me, Scott... But with a bigger budget, Meyers missed the mark. I hope he gets it right next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One huge groovy mess..."baby"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a scene in "The Spy Who Shagged Me" where Austin jumps into a psychedelically-enhanced VW New Bug, guns up the engine and commences to careen all over the screen, smashing into everything in sight. It's an apt metaphor for this flick: a big, groovy psychedelic opus completely and totally out of control. The plot, gleefully aware of its own inconsistencies, careens between genuinely funny characterizations and set pieces, sick-o bathroom humor, dumb puns, psychedelic musical sequences, pointless cameos, groovy costumes, rapid-fire verbal witticisms (the "zip it" exchange between Dr. Evil and Scott) and limp movie parodies, punctuated all the while by Austin's trademark "yeah, baby!" What the hell is going on here? Is this a James Bond parody? A satire of '60s cinematic excesses? A Peter Sellers homage? A '90s grossout comedy? Who knows? Mike Myers is great in all three of his roles, but Heather Graham doesn't seem to be in on the joke. There are a few redeeming nods to the '60s (the whole mojo idea is great and I'm glad Myers' didn't try to explain what didn't need explaining), but this thing is really a mess. A BIG mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>recital of old themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've enjoyed watching the film, but let's face it, it's nothing more than recycling themes from the original success. Austin Powers, as we all know, are the swinging spy who cannot relinquish his 60's lifestyle. In the first movie, he shakes his bum, in the second movie, he still shakes his bum. The audience wanted to see that, nonetheless; that's the reason why they pay the tickets in the first place. However, this movie lacks the freshness and creativity as the first has, so to say, this movie is only the extension of the first--the two movies should be pasted together as a whole.We learn no more of Powers than we have already known him from the first movie. Dr. Evil has been given more depth, which is good. The leading female character, Felicity Shagwell, however, portraits a pretty and hollow shell with no personality; Graham, though a great actress, speaks only the lines she is obliged to and shakes her beautiful body as most men wanted. Sad.I begged to be enlightened by some new gaglines, but there are none, no more than I've already heard from the original. The humor in the movie recite from the first film; they lost their freshness and bore me already. I was particularly disappointed by the excessive use of penis jokes and bathroom humor. They made me laugh, alright, but they are low; solicitors of laughter.Well, if you've never seen it, go see it. Not that it'll shine you any more lights on the original, but just that it'll crack you up a bit, in the same fashion as the original AP did.</fullReview>

Mini Me was better, Dr Evils take on Wil Smith's just the two of us was hilarious, and Scott Evil was absolutely fantastic. The problem was that a lot of the jokes were very similar in nature, and so after a while I just got bored. The references to other films and music from the 80s and 90s was very hit and miss. The Jerry Maguire take was a bit monotonous,but then so was the film. The first one was heaps better, hire it instead of seeing the sequel which is the same thing done with about half the humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Stuff, But Commercialism Evident....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read somewhere recently that Mike Myers has signed up to do 5 AP movies. That's good, but by AP5 will audiences be tired of the jokes?. It's hard to say, in AP2 : TSWSM, the theme is similar, some jokes are repeated, but in subtly refreshing way. Mike Myers has to be Woody Allen of toilet humour, yet to pigeon-hole him to something as seemingly narrow as that would be unfair. The guy is a comic genious, full stop (or "period" depending where you come from). AP2, I enjoyed a lot, but there was too much of the "bubble gum" entertainment element, possibly...There's something about the first film that's rawer - it makes more of an indelible impression on you. Like 'El Mariachi', to a certain extent, the fact that it was made on a shoestring budget made it even more appealing. AP2 is just overloaded with jokes &amp; you're actively encouraged to not think about the story or the characters really. The jokes are extremely funny &amp; clever &amp; have the effect of making you not think or care about the story, however AP1 has that something...Some might call it MOJO, others in France, for example might call it "I don't know what". I just like to call it "something".In summary, I have a gut feeling that NewLine (the film company behind this venture) are pushing this AP series too hard into the mainstream. The amount of hype &amp; advertising surrounding AP2 was too much to bare. It spoiled it for me &amp; many others I know. I'd heard of all the characters &amp; script outline well before the film came out. Commercialism within the Hollywood movie industry is parasitic. Philistines rule what goes &amp; what doesn't - it makes me sick &amp; even though they don't have smell accompanying movies yet, I can detect a faint stench of film company commercialism off this flick. It's an excellent sequel, but?.....The title of the next in the series should be "AP3 - Make or Break Me Baby".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>However, some good lines. For one, Heather Graham is a much better actress than Liz Hurley, and she has better material, instead of the lame straight lines that Liz had to put up with. But it's not a movie I'll rent over and over.Honestly, does anyone think "crikey" is going to be as great a catch-phrase as "shagadelic" or "oh, behave" ?? And the product placements were too obvious and too straight - they just got obnoxious, given the advertising blitz that preceded the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a billion times funnier than the first. The first one relied more on the concept of a "shagadelic" 60's guy in the future for its comedy. Now, don't get me wrong, I loved the first one. But, this one had more "toilet humor." That is what I like best. Just the thought of a 700 pound Scot made me laugh. When I saw it, I was practically rolling in the aisles. It is worth going to see in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening scene, I have to say that i was very disappointed with this movie. It had all the right ingredients, but there was something lacking. The movie didn't flow like the first one.The film featured more of Dr.Evil, and also Fat Bastard, both played brilliantly by Myers (you may remember Fat Bastard's accent from "So I Married an Axe Murderer")which was great, and Mini-Me was just perfect. Yes, most of the movie featuring Austin, fell flat. Recycling too many jokes from the first film, and lacking the same bounce of the first.I know you can't judge a sequal on it's predecessor, but i think this one could have been so much more.It has been left open for a sequel, so let's hope this will go on forever, just like 007 before him.Having said that, this is still a really good film, and a lot better than most of the what is out there.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect Austin Powers II to be as good as the original, but I was still hoping for more than this. Most of the good jokes from the first film are here again, but they're funny this time as well, so that isn't a fault. But apart from the "rocket shape" jokes and the Jerry Springer bits, there wasn't anything new that should have been there. What was new and shouldn't have been there were the Fat Bastard character and the fecal stuff. Once you get into nauseatingly gross, you fall out of humor. When a comedy has me looking away from the screen, it is doing something wrong. The greatest flaw in the film was the elimination of the two elements that made the characters in Austin Powers I people we cared about. In the first, Austin constantly had to cope with the problems of a man out of his own time. This gave him a lost aura that audiences could feel for themselves. Elizabeth Hurley gave a charming performance as Vanessa, playing an opposite character and foil for Austin. Her replacement in the sequel was played competently, but was one-dimensional and had none of the conflicts with Austin that made the Austin-Vanessa relationship compelling. The other relationship element that was lost was the humorously pathetic attempts by Dr. Evil to bond with his son. This time we got nothing but mutual derision between the two. Mini-me was supposed to be a replacement for this, but again there was no conflict between the two, so again, little interest. In sum--good humor, excessively gross, and no depth. Go to a bargain show or wait for video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit, some parts of this film were hilarious (i.e. the Jerry Springer sequence, and...uh...hmmm). Beyond Evil's mauling of guests on the Jerry Springer show; however, the film became more annoying than anything else. Does Mike Meyers really believe that he can buy our laughter with tired gags reminiscent of the first film? Let's see...Dr. Evil's "shhhh" skit was changed into a "zip it" sequence, which was just plain depressing; instead of falling into Dr. Evil's fire trap and screaming for help, Mustafa falls off a cliff and screams for help; Ivana Humpalot sequence=Alotta Fagina sequence; Burt Bacharach sequence=Burt Bacharach sequence; Austin makes bad puns after a guard dies=Austin makes bad puns after a guard dies; and on and on and on. Even more regurgitation from the first film: Okay, we get it--Frau likes to yell, enough already. Did anyone really find Dr. Evil's outburst of ghetto speak in front of the president funny? And of course let's not forget the lame, already tired catch phrases like "yeah, baby" and "shagadelic." Not even Mini-Me or Fat Bastard (the only non-recycled goods in this film) could save the movie. Yes, Austin Powers, who originally was intended to be a parody of 60's spies and "Casino Royale" culture, has sadly become a parody of even himself. A big disappointment. Save your money. 1.5 stars</fullReview>

I think they could've focused more on certain characters too; like Scott Evil and Mr. Bigglesworth (sorry, but I think Scott and the cat added humor to the first movie).

The addition of Felicity Shagwell doesn't really work as well as Vanessa in the first film, but this is offset by the introduction of characters Fat Bastard and Mini-Me. Fat Bastard is done so well that I didn't even realize it was Mike Meyers until I accessed IMDB! Meyers does a good job of mixing old routines from the first film, and introducing new ones, such as the cameo-laden "Phallus in the sky" segments. An outstanding film, which I give a definite 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AP2 is not a great movie, but it sure made me laugh a lot. It probably helped that I was in a theater of about 200 other people, who were all having a good time. A responsive audience sure adds to the experience. For those of you who want to overanalyze -- it's a silly movie that knows it's silly, and doesn't need to apologize. Just the put brain in low gear, and enjoy the ride.Scenes that stand out -- any scene with Mini-Me. VERY politically incorrect, but honestly...incredibly funny. The music-video parody was OUTRAGEOUSLY hilarious. The "tent" scene was a riot. Dr. Evil intoxicated with Austin's Mojo, leading to a wickedly funny love sequence -- yikes! Austin drinking "coffee." The list goes on and on...I didn't even know until reading comments up here that Mike Meyers was Fat Bastard, I thought they really had a fat guy doing the acting! I'm pretty impressed.Is this the "best comedy" of all time? In terms of sheer pratfalls, silliness, sight-gags, and laughs-per-minute, the award still goes to Leslie Nielsen in "Wrongfully Accused" (an "Airplane" style comedy based on "The Fugitive") and Leslie Nielsen in any of the "Naked Gun" movies.But check out "The Spy who shagged me" (on video if you have to.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of (uneven) laughs... but I still liked the 1st one better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be sure, this sequel to Austin Powers had heaps of laughs, perhaps more than the first one. There were lots of humorous scenes with Dr. Evil in particular. But I nevertheless liked the original better. I appreciate its brand of humor a whole lot more. It was fun, original satire. It didn't seem to go out of it's way to offend anyone. And the jokes may have not come as fast and furious, but the humor kept a consistent tone throughout.By contrast, AP:TSWSM was uneven. It ranges from witty to uproarious to flat to extremely raunchy. Speaking of raunchy, there's enough bawdy and scatalogical humor here to make There's Something jealous and Dumb &amp; Dumber jealous.Also, the pop culture references are heaped on a little too liberally. Admittedly, I found most (or at least some) of them funny, hilarious even, but I miss the subtlety of the first film. There wasn't an obvious attempt to endear itself to the pop-culture reference fans.TSWSM relies on mimicking its predecessor in several moments for plot support or filler; perhaps too many. The "quotation mark" gesture made by Dr. Evil (and his Mini-Me), in particular, started to get real old, real fast. The first film, did it a few times and that was it; it didn't bash the poor thing into the ground.Hurley is sultrier, sexier and just plain better looking (imo) than Heather Graham. Hurley is a goddess, where Graham is a mere nymph. Furthermore, Hurley (whose performance in the sequel was as delightful as in the original; all 6 minutes of it) knew she was in a goofy parody, and her acting was purposefully cheesy to suit the film; it made her all the more charming. By comparison, and I could be wrong here but, in retrospect, I think maybe sometimes Graham was acting as if she was taking it all more seriously than she should have - especially in those silly maudlin scenes with her and Austin expressing their love for each other (*retch*). Frankly, I found parts of her Boogie Nights performance more ironic. And her timing was off.Like I said, I thought much of TSPWSM funny, but other aspects I found tiresome and I don't think I'll be interested in a second Austin sequel; the franchise has just about already burnt itself out for me.</fullReview>

Despite that, in my opinion, Mike Myers is still one of the more talented comedians around and this film is merely a showcase for his talents. (*** out of *****)</fullReview>

Then there is the take off which I enjoy. All this takes about 30 minutes until you are simply cruising at a fixed altitude and becoming pretty bored. There are perks, a couple drinks and maybe a package of pretzels from the flight attendants ("Bring on the sexy stews, baby, yeah") but really I'm looking forward to the landing. The landing was smooth and just as cool as the take off, but by then I'd been sitting for an hour listening to conversations that I wish I could have blocked out.Like that, Austin starts out really hilariously and has a great deal of quick jokes. But after the initial get-go (a go go) I felt it didn't have the speed it needed to keep the energy level high. The main problem was the new characters. Before I say the bad characters, though, I'd like to say that Rob Lowe did a fantastic job of acting like a young Number 2. The other positive new character was "mini-me" which had his moments, small as they were.But then there was "Fat Bastard" which nobody seemed to think was very funny at all. This character was added solely for "gross-out" humor, but it wasn't very funny. Even Fat Bastard's last scene was flat and not all that interesting. In my opinion, though, the worst new character was Falicity Shagwell whom had no character at all. The character was poorly written and equally poorly acted by Heather Graham. Perhaps Mike was making fun of all those hallow women in the James Bond films?The strongest points of the new film were those that were in the original. I loved the continuation of Scott (Dr. Evil's Son) and his relationship with his father. This took them to the Jerry Springer show and through time. Sadly, even this relationship was not as interesting as it was in the first movie.The joke style was still the same. Several shots which would normally cut away which instead show us the real person behind Austin Powers or Dr. Evil. Several jokes were taken as far as they could go (and some even further into the credits). My favorite character from the original that made a return in Will Farrell's Mustafa (he's not even on screen for most of his role).In the end, I did laugh at the picture but was disappointed that it could not live up to the original. I give it 2 1/2 stars out of 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a really hard time deciding if I liked this movie or not. I mean it was funny and I found myself laughing at quite a few scenes but it was also sort of a let-down. It would've helped if it had a few more scenes of original material. Most of the jokes were just rehashes of what was in the first one, except of course for a few funny bits involving Jerry Springer and Mini-Me. Anyway, I enjoyed it, I just expected a little bit more. Kind of reminds me of another popular series installment. Hmmmmm</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Spy Who Shagged Me" will please Austin Powers fans despite the script's freefall in both wit and charm compared to the original. Instead of mining the 60s and the 90's for new jokes, those of the first movie are machine gunned back at us (the XKE 'Shaguar' is about the only funny one). If Austin drank a beaker of pipi in the first one, it's caca this time.There is less digging of the 60s than before. Terrific opportunities are missed, for instance Tim Robbin's generic US President is another dud -- has Myers ever heard of Nixon or Johnson? The journey is obligatory and farce-fed, endurable only by the shock antics of Myers as Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard.While the devices are painfully lame -- the "English countryside" quip would've been better served with a witty roadsign -- the other actors veer wildly off the mark and float by in cameos like miscast fish ("Ivana Humpalot" isn't even primary-school funny). Heather Graham is delicious, but has only 2 expressions, sexy smirk or unconscious; Rob Lowe's younger N. 2 is simply wooden as a plank, leaving his best scenes deleted in the first movie.What saves it is the focus on Dr. Evil, his white dwarf MiniMe, the Fat Bastard character and blast of StarWars space-junk to fill the enormous plot holes. This merciless pickpocketing of of pop culture proves that Mike Myers missed the sixties, and is only at home in the 70's-80's.Should Austin return hopefully he will return to his roots and the writers will get more sleep, bring back some wit, setup, delivery, charm, forgo the gimmicks and toilet jokes, perhaps follow "Casino Royale" instead of trying to spoof every movie ever made in 90 minutes. Can't they behave?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess the best advice for this movie is what the character Exposition tells Austin when he asks him about certain logical incontinuities in the movie:"I suggest you don't think about that Austin. And we suggest you do the same" (big smiles to the audience from both).Mike Myers is funny as hell and if you're on this web page you probably already know it. He is enjoyable. Certain shameless promotions (Starbucks, Heineken etc.) are done tongue and cheek and at the beginning of the movie, so the producers can get out of the obligation quick. Heather Graham is very shagadelic, but she still needs to learn how to act. Liz Hurley runs rings around her in that department (and is comparable in the other ones).I'm looking forward to the third one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, an excellent movie. Dr. Evil, Scott, and mini me were absolutely hilarious, and F.B. (Fat you-know-who) had some good moments, although he wore a little thin by the end. Jerry Springer fans (like me) will be rolling in the aisles during the opening scene.It was also somewhat uneven. Some of the one-liners and oblique references fell very flat, and they re-used too many of the same jokes from the original. In particular, the puns after killing the inept guard, were OK in the 1st movie, but really should have been left out of the sequel.In all, I would have to say Mike Myers should be happy that he has another huge success. Be careful, though, Mike, and don't go to the well too often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like dumb, grossed out movies then Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is for you!Mike Myers isn't strong on subtlety in his films, Wayne's World 1 and 2, So I Married An Axe Murderer and 54 aren't intellectually stimulating, but hey, they wouldn't be too shagadellic if they were anyway.In Shag 2, it turns out that Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) was a fembot. So, enter Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham of Boogie Nights fame). "Shagwell by name, Shagwell by reputation" is her motto. All in memory of those marvelous Bond Girls who went by names such as Pussy Gallore.Anyway off Felicity and Austin go, back to the 1960's to get back Austin's mojo which Dr Evil has stolen. There they encounter two new adversaries. There's Mini Me who's a weird nasty dwarf in the image of Dr Evil, with a touch of that bad, bad boy in The Tin Drum.And then there's Fat Bastard, a blubbery Scot who sounds a lot like Billy Connolly but probably isn't. He's memorable; flatulent and fatulent!The plot matters not at all, and Austin isn't slow to tell you as much, but there's a lot that recalls Shag 1. Dr Evil again blackmails the American government with a humungous lazer but there are also many references to other films, especially to the Star Wars series, some of which are very funny.And there's a gross but hilarious scene involving an anus and a tent as well as the trademark bouncy flips to fab dance and song segments, including a pretty good rap from Dr Evil. But perhaps the street dance scene between Austin and Felicity Shagwell would be better forgotten. It fails miserably.But above all of this, like a neon beacon, shines Mike Myers who's characters are imbeciles with terrific self images.These ugly idiots believe they are super handsome. These fools somehow rule their worlds. They are amazing advertisements for the power of positive thinking! Why would the girls chase an ugly coot like Austin Powers unless he's convinced that's he's handsome. When Austin teases the girls with "Come on baby" he's funny and likeable. He IS shagadellic!And Dr Evil is a nincompoop who is somehow ruling his evil empire just because he believes he's worth it. There are plenty of reality checks, most notably from his son Scott Evil (Seth Green), but Dr Evil takes no notice. Evil is his thing! He's great at evil! On the other hand Fat Bastard is just that, and is proud of it!This is Dr Who mixed with The Goodies. Austin is naked beneath his costumes and you might see the lot in an extended sequence. There's a phallic rocket ship which is the butt of plenty of jokes. Unlike Shag 1 we haven't got Austin transposed into the nineties very often but there are plenty of other set ups to balance the humour.Heather Graham, the roller girl in Jackie Brown, is fairly flat as Shagwell but Rob Lowe as the young Robert Wagner is good fun. Elvis Costello singing with a strange grim, grin "What Do You Get When You Fall In Love," accompanied by Burt Bacharach was inspired and I don't know about you but I love toilet humour, when Mike Myers is telling the jokes anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr. Evil creates a time machine to go back and steal Austin Powers' mojo. This makes Austin go back to retrieve it at which time he meets Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) who helps him with his task.I thought this movie was just an attempt to redo everything in the first movie. Same old jokes and gags, only overdone in this one. Mini-Me, Dr. Evil's miniature clone, was a good addition and added some humor, but Dr. Evil's interaction with him got old before long. The only things that kept me in the seat were Heather Graham and the knowledge that I had payed my hard earned money to get in and watch this movie. I give this movie a 5 out of 10 only because of Graham, Seth Green, and Verne Troyer (Mini-Me).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a big disappointment, especially since the first one was so entertaining. For this movie, it seemed that Mike Myers ran out of jokes so he tried to be as disgusting as possible in an effort to make the audience laugh. Some of those scenes were funny, but most of them were just disgusting.What really gets my goat about this film though is its' no-holds barred attitude about commercialism. The film seems to say: "Thanks for paying $9 to see this movie...here's a bunch of commercials for you to see!" I mean, if I wanted to watch commercials, I'd have stayed home and watch TV for free. Don't get me wrong, a commercial here or there in a film is fine but this was just too much.On the other hand, I really liked the actor who played "Mini-me" in the film. He did a great job and was, in my opinion the most entertaining character in the film. Heather Graham looks pretty hot as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie rarity......A Swingin' Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been a crazy Mike Myers fan since his days on SNL, I was very happy to see him come out with another movie besides Wayne's World, which in my mind was an SNL skit and lost its flare long ago. The only other movie to his credit before AP: IMOM, was "So I Married An Axe Murderer," and if you haven't seen that one, I highly recommend it, if you like Mike Myers.Back to the business at hand, AP2 was about as good a sequel as sequels get. It's one of the few movies that goes completely overboard without losing its way. I'm not here to give a summary of the film so I'll just tell you my favorite parts. Mini-me: the crew member who came up with this character should be commended for his genius. I thought Dr. Evil was funny, but a mini Dr. Evil??? I'm laughing myself silly right now as I type.Fat Bastard: If you haven't seen "Axe Murderer" see it, because there is a similar character in that movie in which every scene he is in, is practically an attention getter. Fat Bastard's best scene (no, not the stool sample/coffee scene), but the scene where he walks into Austin's Pad disguised as a UPS man. The sight of him in a UPS uniform makes you howl so loud you destroy the hearing of the person sitting next to you.Mike Myers: Probably the most underrated and talented actor/entertainer in the industry today. His days as a restricted skit performer are over. With AP2 he has arrived.On a scale of 1-10, AP2 gets a 10 (if I could go higher, I would), because it was made for no other reason than to entertain, and oh my how it accomplishes that feat with flying colors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is less like a movie and more like a series of comedy skits. The Spy Who Shagged Me is just an excuse for Mike Myers to extend jokes that existed in the first movie. Almost all of the jokes are just rewritten versions the original jokes like the whole "zip it" bit or the guy who won't die. Most of the new jokes center around Fat Bastard and Mini-Me. Austin Powers could have been edited out of the movie for all I care. He adds nothing to it. Felicity Shagwell basically just looks really hot (and I do mean REALLY). She doesn't even need to be seduced. The plot, of course, is none existent.Despite all of this, there are some bright spots that make it worth seeing. All of the scenes with Dr. Evil , Scott, and Mini-Me are great. These three characters are funny as can be. They make the movie. The fact that the jokes are repeated of course means that if you liked them the first time around, you'll like them this time around. If you liked the first, this one is worth a view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen the first "Austin Powers" countless times, and it grows funnier with every viewing. It's also a great party movie. It has great lines, sight gags, and a simple comic premise that works.Alas, the same cannot be said of Austin Powers' bloated sequel, which, like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch, takes what was once fresh and funny and runs it into the ground - and how! Aside from the general unfunniness of the film (aside from a few sparks of brilliance - notably "Mini-me"), what struck me particularily was how crude and mean-spirited it was. I mean, toilet humour is funny to a point (as illustrated by "There's Something About Mary"), but once you pass that point... oh, god, it's sickening. As well, Mike Myers' once-funny characters began to irritate me and became tiresome. "Yeah, baby, yeah" seems to have been over-used in recent pop cultural references, and it's sadly fitting that even Mike Myers can not rise to his former glory.Anyways, as the crowded theatre displayed, I am probably in the minority here. Austin Powers 2 seems to be a crowd pleaser, and it'll go on to make a load of cash. But it just didn't cut it for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen the first "Austin Powers" countless times, and it grows funnier with every viewing. It's also a great party movie. It has great lines, sight gags, and a simple comic premise that works.Alas, the same cannot be said of Austin Powers' bloated sequel, which, like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch, takes what was once fresh and funny and runs it into the ground - and how! Aside from the general unfunniness of the film (aside from a few sparks of brilliance - notably "Mini-me"), what struck me particularily was how crude and mean-spirited it was. I mean, toilet humour is funny to a point (as illustrated by "There's Something About Mary"), but once you pass that point... oh, god, it's sickening. As well, Mike Myers' once-funny characters began to irritate me and became tiresome. "Yeah, baby, yeah" seems to have been over-used in recent pop cultural references, and it's sadly fitting that even Mike Myers can not rise to his former glory.Anyways, as the crowded theatre displayed, I am probably in the minority here. Austin Powers 2 seems to be a crowd pleaser, and it'll go on to make a load of cash. But it just didn't cut it for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie, fantastic sequel!! Except for a few parts that were really disgusting and distasteful, and the fact that heather graham did not impress me as an actress (though i don't think that was the intent with her character). This is a great movie, dr. evil is even eviler and scott is hysterical, oh yeah and Austin was great too :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ONE new joke. This movie has ONE new joke. Granted, the same old jokes are taken to new levels, but still. I liked it. A lot. But unless there is some SERIOUS creativity put into the humor, any third Austin Powers would suck. It's spent (don't kill me!). They've taken the material as far as it can go without it looking as tired as it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so the first one wasn't best picture material either, but at least it was competently directed and edited. Technical problems like that usually don't detract from this type of movie, but this time they're so bad as to make the experience less enjoyable. With the huge budget they obviously had, I would think they could have hired better technical help.That said, AP:TSWSM is funny as crap. Myers turns in several brilliant performances as three major characters (shades of Peter Sellers in Dr. Strangelove). The movie has all of the sexual humor of the first movie with a great deal more potty humor to make everyone happy. The cultural references wear a little thin, especially since many of them are quite obscure (only me and one or two other people in the theater laughed at the Moon Unit Zappa joke) but they are rewarding for those of us who actually get them.The biggest complaint I have would probably be casting Heather Graham as Austin's romantic interest. While she's at least as shagadelic as Elizabeth Hurley, her unemotional performance makes Hurley look like Meryl Streep. At times I wasn't sure if she was really there or if they had just cut out a centerfold, blown it up, and proped it up beside Myers.The end leaves the story open to more sequels, and that would probably be a good thing. While this particular movie is not one I'll remember the rest of my life, the thought of more doesn't scare me. Hopefully they'll get it right next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect much after hearing some advance reviews and I was not disappointed. I think I laughed out loud about 5 or 6 times, the rest of the movie didn't even get a chuckle out of me. The movie suffers most from no plot and poorly-recycled gags from the first movie. The bath and sex humor is expected but the gross-out mode (promoted by 'Something About Mary' success) is handled clumsily either through poor judgement or poor editing. I got the feeling that Myers added some of this stuff in at the producers/studio's request rather than through his own comedic judgement. The actors (especially Seth Green) appear to be embarrassed as well. Scott Evil seems to comment about the movie's idiocy rather than his father's in the final moonbase scenes. The awkward silences and mismatched tone of performances is really apparent there. See this one free on cable or after it moves to the dollar shows where it belongs. On the plus side, Elvis Costello's performance of 'I'll never fall in love again' is too short and sweet. The penis pun sequences were the only slightly original gags in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, Despite Gross Scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is indeed better than the first film. It's funniest moments come in the beginning. I especially enjoyed the scenes involving the Jerry Springer show. This material is the best parody to some of the original James Bond films -- such as "You Only Live Twice" and "Thunderball".On the critical side I think this film took the potty humor thing a little too far (referring to the coffee pot scene). You don't have to be that gross to be funny. This scene reminded me of the beer drinking scene from "Dumb and Dumber". In my opinion, the former was barely passable and the latter went too far.

The same general storyline is used, but there is alot of creativity to liven it up. The new characters are wonderful and all of them gets at least a few laughs all through the film. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me are the most memorable and my favorites, Felicity Shagwell is a nice alternative to Vanessa Kensington and Austin is still the same Austin, played wonderfully, but in a way, overshadowed by Dr, Evil and his associated characters, but all of them are portrayed the way they are meant to be and there is a kind of humor for everyone.

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to the new Austin Powers movie, and I found what I was looking for.... Sort of. The first Austin Powers seem to be driven by a more coherent script, where as this film tended to indulge its silliness a little too often. I was really disappointed with how the character of Vanessa Kensington was handled. It voided out the whole romantic element of the first movie, and made Austin seem really shallow in how he handles that situation. There were way too many loopholes in the whole time-travel idea, that was simply dismissed in the movie as "sit back and enjoy yourself". While that's a "convenient" way to cover up that story element, it doesn't make everything easily dismissable in the long run. My biggest problem with the film was its using almost every single joke from the first film repeatedly. What was hilarious in the first film, gave me a feeling of "I've seen this before" this time around. However, the film did have its shining moments. The original comedy bits were more often than not hysterical, with heavy parodies of "Star Wars" and even "The Island of Dr. Moreau". Mini-Me was definitely the most entertaining of the new characters, stealing more than a fair share of the scenes. His little dance halfway through the film pushed the bizarre comedy element into overdrive. Heather Graham as Felicity Shagwell was simply drop-dead sexy in the film, as she spent more time trying to rev Austin Power's mojo than subdue it. It should also be noted that Rob Lowe's impersonation of Robert Wagner's "Number Two" character was so incredibly dead on, it was almost eerie. Overall, it was a fun movie, but the plot loopholes and numerous jokes from the first film kept it from being what it truly should have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After anticipating the release of this film with as much eagerness as my husband awaited "The Phantom Menace," words cannot describe how disappointed my friends and I were at this latest offering from comedic genius Mike Myers. As funny as the first installment was, "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" is unfunny. The gags are the same as in the original yet they lack any kind of comedic spark. There were a few bits that worked, but Fat Bastard and Mini Me are right up there with Jar Jar Binks and should never be seen in any future sequels that may pop up. The first film worked so well because Austin Powers was such a fish out of water as a swinging hipster in the 1990s, and Elizabeth Hurley was the perfect "straight man" to Austin's lunacy. But putting Austin back in his own element paired with a female companion who's just as randy as he is -- who cares? If Mike Myers and New Line decide to give this another go, I can only hope that they return to the formula that made the original film so brilliant. Get rid of the multitude of pop references by Dr. Evil, let's see more of his son Scott, and put Austin back in the '90s where he doesn't belong!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not as funny as the original, this movie delivers quite a few laughs. Unlike the first movie, Austin Powers is on the screen for about 10 minutes total. Dr. Evil takes up most of the screen time, since he proved to be more popular than Austin after the first film was produced.This movie reminded me more of the TV Show "Family Guy" than the first movie. One random pop culture reference after another are strung throughout the movie. For example, Fat Bastard sings the "Chili's Baby Back Ribs" song.</fullReview>

I hope I don't see this months from now and not laugh because I can't wait to see it again. But the big questions remain: how did the Frau get to the moon? and why did 1999 Austin get his old teeth back in 1969, but 1969 Austin didn't get new teeth in 1999? (And Heather Graham is so hot, I might have missed a gag or two from looking at her....)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin goes where Austin has been before.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sequel to Austin Powers has a few good laughs in it, but I found most jokes to be a repeating of part I. Some jokes were actually the very same jokes. Come to think of it, most jokes were exactly the same ones as in part one, and some even in the same section of the movie as in part I.This I found a bit disappointing, and combining that with a story that doesn't lift off makes it a bit dull. Dr Evil (Who is by far the most entertaining character)'s sidekick, mini-me quickly becomes very predictable, and the final battlescene between Austin and Mini-me isn't that much of a show.The scenes with the oddly shaped rocket isn't all that bad, but even that joke gets repeated, within the film itself! Sure, throw another minute of the same thing at the viewer.If you haven't seen part one, I suppose it's a very amusing film, but if you have, the nice jokes and gags are spare.But, one thing remains to said, the appearance of Dr Evil and his son, Seth, on Jerry Springer Show is hilarious.Because I liked part I so much: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first one was better! "The Spy Who Shagged Me" had its moments... but there were also times when it fell short of expectations. Many of the jokes are centered around the toilet, and just seem childish. However, there are also lines for thoes of us who are over the age of 8. Don't get me wrong, I didn't think it was wreched, but I was disappointed. The biggest downfall was the removal of 'Vanessa' for 'Felicity'. Graham came of as being flaky, and didn't seem to really get into her part. If you're looking for a good movie with Myers check out the first Austin Powers movie! It was WAY better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and dumbed down, with rare cases of true laughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Spy Who Shagged Me", was a huge disappointment. Don't get me wrong there were a few scenes that were hilarious, but overall those scenes are few. Most of the movie is spent trying to survive the re-hashed, ripped-off, and gross-out humor to get to the good scenes. It seemed that Mike Myers wasn't really sure of what he wanted to do with this movie, he had a few good ideas that were funny, and then thought well, nobody went and saw "So I Married an Axe Murderer", I'll just steal some material from there, and thow in the classic bits from the first movie, OK now we have the new script. I really wanted to like this movie. I love all of Mike's other films. But, when Fat Bastard came out all I could think was he ripped-off his own movie. (He lifted the father from "So I Married an Axe Murderer" and added 700 pounds to him, A much better movie by the way) This film also tries to get into the gross out comedy category, and cater to this currently popular movie type. Why? WHy? WHY???? This is a 007 spoof... I don't want you to think I hated the whole movie, I did like some scenes. The theme song brilliant parody of the "Goldfinger" theme song. The Dr. Evil rocket scenes were very funny. The Jerry Springer scenes also funny. All the Scott Evil scenes were very funny. The Mini-Me scenes had they're moments, but other than that the movie seemed unfocused and catered to try and please everyone. The original Austin Powers was well thought out, Mike knew what he wanted when he made the first movie and put a hilariously funny movie on the screen. However this episode misses the mark. If he would have written the movie to appeal to the audience that embraced the original film , and not have tried to please everyone, this would have been a much better movie. I can only give this a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't get suckered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy did I get suckered into seeing this one. The occasional funny moments in Austin Powers 2 are completely over shadowed by tasteless, out of date jokes about obesity, and absolutely inappropriate jokes about blacks. Making matters even worse there were parents who thought this movie would be ok to bring their 8 year old to...no way. When is Hollywood going to realize that jokes about fat people are no longer funny or in good taste? And if that wasn't enough, Myers thought it would be funny for a movie without one black actor to repeatedly make fun of black musical artists, particularly "gangsta" rap artists. Heather Grahams character was pathetic, Rob Lowe's talent was completely wasted. There were funny parts in this film, but I left with a lingering bad taste in my mouth thinking about AP drinking feces. Do yourself and favor and don't waste the money on this one. I give it a 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A haiku for you all... Mike Myers is great. Austin Powers is so cool. May there be 8 more. Austin Powers II is one of the best movies I've ever seen I think, with the off-color humor and the sense of zanyness. Austin Powers has to go back to the 60s to retrieve his mojo (kinda like "the Force") from Dr. Evil, who becomes "weird" when he drinks it. Anyway, this movie is wonderful, with funny music (that little pipe tune), characters (Mustafa is back, yay Will Ferrel!), and of course, Dr. Evil. I found this movie better than the first, and I hope we can look forward to many more Austin Powers titles.</fullReview>

"So what" you say. Well, what made the original so good was that it was funny at the same time as making fun of James Bond movies by use of clever little moments in the plot. This one is not clever and the sophisticated humour of the original is sacrificed for obvious, often gross, adolescent humour. Don't get me wrong, I haven't laughed so much for a long time. But I left the theatre with a bad feeling. Oh, and Fat Bastard is a terrible addition to the group. Whereas Random Task was a great spoof of Bond movies, Fat Bastard is completely out of left field. The music was great, Austin himself was great, some of the jokes were classic, but the film was poor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the original, but this film just didn't cut it. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of funny parts to it, but with Dr. Evil having just as much (if not more) screen time as Austin Powers, it seems as though Mike Myers and Jay Roach forgot something. Sometimes I wondered whether they knew if they were making a comedy or not. The satire is gone, but at least the characters are all still here in their familiar form. Heather Graham is amazing, but kudos to Rob Lowe for doing a great Robert Wagner impression. I'd recommend it... for a cheap night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Losing its mojo?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what if the Austin Powers follow up is not the best movie ever? After all, they never expected you to take this film seriously. From the very beginning, when you see classic Star Wars introduction (praising their summer of 1999 competitor at the box office), they're telling you: This is a silly film. And they're proud of it.Yeah it's true: It's not as funny as the original, and the Austin Powers routines start to get quite old, but ironically, the villain saves the day in this film. While the first movie was about Powers, this one is about his nemesis: Dr. Evil. This character (also performed by Myers) delivers the best lines of the movie. I could even dare to say that is worth watching just because of Dr. Evil. That good was he.On the other hand, the plot is not as fresh as the first. If you were a fan of the original's bathroom humor you won't be disappointed Overall, a good time at the movies, some good laughs and some very disgusting moments (almost to the point of getting disturbing). Can be a slight disappointment if your expectations are high, but not as disappointing as the competitor they're praising. Shagadelic, but thanks to Dr. Evil.</fullReview>

Turns out Vanessa was a fembot.Basil: Oh, yes, we knew that.(no further explanation) ......Austin: (after a good 2-3 seconds of grief) Now I'm single again!!!In my opinion, the dialogue between Dr Evil and Scott is so hilarious that the movie would have been much better off concentrating on their relationship, and dumping Mini-Me as anything more than a throwaway gag.I did laugh a lot, but the younger members of the audience liked it much more than I did. I think it will play very well with the 11 and 12 year olds, so it is fortunate that it got a PG-13 rating despite its excretory obsessions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I never saw International Man of Mystery in the theater, it's hard to compare the two without the same experience. Heather Graham was brilliant as felicity Shagwell; she did a far better job than "Vanessa" from the original. Myers was hilarious as usual, and the movie did a great job reproducing scenes from Bond's "Doctor No". The parts I found the most amusing were Dr. Evil's attempts to take credit for things from the future (Alan Parsons project). They may have gone overboard with the lowbrow Fat Bastard humor, and I didn't think Mini-Me was as funny as the pre-movie hype. For me, the high points were Graham's preformance as the (beautiful) CIA agent Shagwell and Ethan Embry's role as estranged son Scott. I'd give it an enthusiastic 9 of 10.</fullReview>

Fat Bastard, Felicity Shagwell, and many more. The humor may be sick at times but it's funny. Examples:Dr. Evil's volcanic lair that has his face on the side.And Felicity pulling things out of a bag while onlooking guards think she's pulling it out of Austin's A...

		<fullReview>The new Austin Powers is the most hilarious movie since...well, the original. Mike Meyers again demonstrates his unequaled talent by playing THREE roles - Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard.The film's sequences with Dr. Evil (who seems to be onscreen more than Austin himself) are, like the first, the funniest. Rob Lowe gave a performance rivaling Ewan McGregor's imitation of Alec Guiness in The Phantom Menace through his imitation of Robert Wagner. He'll probably receive no accloades for his performance, but he deserves it. Once again, Mindy Sterling is awesome as Frau Farbissina. And Will Ferell is back as Mustafa!Unfortunately, the much-talked about Mini-Me grew very, very annoying and overplayed after a while. I want more of Mr. Bigglesworth! Some of the jokes were also WAY too re-hashed from the first one (the "shhhh" scene just isn't as funny anymore), and the product placement was nauseating. A shame that Elizabeth Hurley wasn't kept for more than her two-minute-appearance, though Heather Graham is good as Felicity Shagwell, Hurley had a real chemistry with Meyers (and is "shaggadelically" beautiful as well....)All in all, this film was INCREDIBLY funny, but I still suggest re-watching the first to see how truly original it was.</fullReview>

The Spy Who Shagged Me is better than the original, and worth a second viewing. Keep the groovy flicks coming, Mike. And, a brief note that you'll need to know if you see this, synchronized swimmers are not allowed to touch the bottom of the pool.B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie beyond your wildest Imojonation...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Spy Who Shagged Me was a great film retaliating the events of Austin Powers. The jokes work really well on this film and the acting wasn't that bad. Dr. Evil is more hipper than ever, Mini-Me is annoying yet funny, and Austin Powers is still Hip and groovy as we know it. But there's still the certain number of newbies that I also loved... Fat Bastard, Felicity Shagwell, and many more. The humor may be sick at times but it's funny. Examples:Dr. Evil's volcanic lair that has his face on the side.And Felicity pulling things out of a bag while onlooking guards think she's pulling it out of Austin's A... You'll have wait and see...A great movie for still the person who has the spunk, the mojo, and the humor.***1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, let me tell ya something right here and right now. If you go to watch Austin Powers 2 then you better get ready to laugh your butt off because that is all you will be doing, laughing. I loved the movie. I want to go back and see it again. The best additions were "mini-me" and "Fat Bastard" they were great. The minature Dr. Evil OR "mini-me" was one of the best things and the fight with him and Austin Powers will just make you wet your pants because it is sooooooo funny. Mike Myers also is Fat Bastard and he plays a good role in this. This is a movie that you should not miss if you like the "Stupidly Funny Movies"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cannot be compared to the first Austin Power. Very weak.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that this sequel fell in with all the others that have played on the success of the first move. I thought it did have its funny parts, but few and far between. I thought the addition of Fat Bastard was a real stretch. No reason to have the character. Most of the content was not appropriate for the rating. This is the first of Michael's movies I have not been pleased with. I get the feeling that he sold out just to get it to market fast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new Austin Powers is the most hilarious movie since...well, the original. Mike Meyers again demonstrates his unequaled talent by playing THREE roles - Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard.The film's sequences with Dr. Evil (who seems to be onscreen more than Austin himself) are, like the first, the funniest. Rob Lowe gave a performance rivaling Ewan McGregor's imitation of Alec Guiness in The Phantom Menace through his imitation of Robert Wagner. He'll probably receive no accloades for his performance, but he deserves it. Once again, Mindy Sterling is awesome as Frau Farbissina. And Will Ferell is back as Mustafa!Unfortunately, the much-talked about Mini-Me grew very, very annoying and overplayed after a while. I want more of Mr. Bigglesworth! Some of the jokes were also WAY too re-hashed from the first one (the "shhhh" scene just isn't as funny anymore), and the product placement was nauseating. A shame that Elizabeth Hurley wasn't kept for more than her two-minute-appearance, though Heather Graham is good as Felicity Shagwell, Hurley had a real chemistry with Meyers (and is "shaggadelically" beautiful as well....)All in all, this film was INCREDIBLY funny, but I still suggest re-watching the first to see how truly original it was.</fullReview>

Myers was hilarious as usual, and the movie did a great job reproducing scenes from Bond's "Doctor No". The parts I found the most amusing were Dr. Evil's attempts to take credit for things from the future (Alan Parsons project). They may have gone overboard with the lowbrow Fat Bastard humor, and I didn't think Mini-Me was as funny as the pre-movie hype. For me, the high points were Graham's preformance as the (beautiful) CIA agent Shagwell and Ethan Embry's role as estranged son Scott. I'd give it an enthusiastic 9 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never had the opportunity to see the original Austin Powers in the theater, but bought it based on recommendation when it hit DVD. I must say, the original is one of my favorite movies, and I have been anticipating the release of the sequel for a while. I must say, I am a bit let down, as this film is more of a spoof of the original than a continuation of the story. There are some scenes in the sequel which are far funnier than anything in the original, but as a whole...something is majorly lacking. It seems that Myers and company tried to determine what made the original funny, and stuffed this one full of nothing but rip-offs and re-hashes of those aspects. Whereas we got some great lines to quote from the original, ("Yeah, Baby!", or "Throw me a friggin' bone here") nothing really stands out in this one, because all that we get is an endless string of such lines. Austin lacks the humanity that he had in the original, and simply stands as a caricature of the character we grew to love in the first film. Although this movie picks up minutes after the first one, Austin has somehow fully adjusted to 90's life, and seems to be an entirely different person. He was kinda like your uncle's bad impression of Austin Powers...running around yelling "Yeah, Baby,"and "Randy," and, "Do I make you horny?" constantly, instead of every once in a while.Overall, a funny film...but nowhere NEAR the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit, the expectation for this movie, on my part, were very high. I remember the first time I viewed the original AP in '97. The experience was full of belly-aching laughter and near suffocation. Thus it was my fault from the beginning to expect something of the similar relation. Yet the movie had its moments...quite a few and Mike Myers portrayal of everyone's favourtie spy hit the dot. I do have one warning though; comedy sequels are never meant to be any good. They live off quirks and little humorous bits from the original; a basic spin-off if you will. Drama is easier to sequelize, yet AP II had its own magic in its way with its unrestrained attitude. I suggest all those who haven't seen the first one, to see it before viewing AP II. But I give it an overall 7 and a very strong "yeah baby".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have worshipped Austin Powers since the movie came out two years ago, but man, has it gotten better! I had to wait in line 30 minutes to get into the movie, that's how jam-packed the theater was, but boy, was it worth the wait! The movie was SO HILARIOUS! The new characters were very well thought out before putting them into the movie (e.g. Fat Bastard) and Dr. Evil was funnier than ever (a whole new thing with "ZIP IT!", his references to nineties movies when he was back in 1969, and, of course, the "Just the Two of Us" rap). Dr. Evil's rocket was funnier than ever (just see the movie to find out!). But the thing I didn't get were the references to many things between 1970 and the late 80s (I wasn't born until the mid-1980s), for example "Moon Unit Zappa" was a reference to some girl's name, and the reference to The Exorcist when Dr. Evil was spinning around in his chair in the movie. I didn't get them until my older sister told me about them. Younger audiences: Make sure you look them up before seeing this movie!Anyway, the plotline is fairly simple. Austin loses his mojo and has to find it. Dr. Evil wants it because it is "the essence, the libido, the 'Right Stuff'," and when he tastes the mojo, he goes shagadelic over Frau Farbissina! Did I lose you right there? Sorry. Heather Graham was great as Felicity Shagwell! "Shagwell by name, shag-VERY-well by reputation!" I have to say, though, the movie is funny right from the beginning credits, all of the way to the VERY VERY end (you'll be glad you stayed until the VERY VERY end!). Hint Hint: The credit scenes reveal an interesting fact about Scott Evil!All I have to say about this movie is that:1. It's better than Star Wars: Episode 12. It's NOT A BIG LETDOWN like some people have said (what squares!)3. You can't miss a minute of it4. Dr. Evil's rap is unforgettable5. LAUGH YOUR HEINIE OFF, BABY!This movie will be all the rage this coming summer! Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

The movie assumes its own hilarity. The first movie was a classic because it didn't come with any pretensions. Obviously, this film thinks its the greatest thing in the world before it even starts.

The whole concept of the female counterpart spy is supposed to be a woman who keeps the lead at arms lengths for a time and sexual tension develops. Felecity wants to shag Austin from the first time their eyes meet.3. The scenes involving Fat Bastard aren't funny, they are repulsive. And since when is being fat funny, or being a midget for that matter?4. The film is rife with unfunny and strained moments.5. The film has too many arcane references. Most of the target teen to early 20s audience is not going to get the Alan Parsons Project and Great Santini references.6. The shameless and UNFUNNY corporate spots. (Heineken, Chilis, etc.)The first film was a classic because it had first rate comedic material and didn't make assumptions of greatness. With Part 2 I came into the theater psyched and ready to bust my side laughing. In truth I had a hard time staying awake. Total laugh out loud count: 5.

		<fullReview>All I can say is that this film is just not funny. I loved the first, but the sequel does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as International Man of Mystery. It is ridiculously repetitive, and the jokes that are used constantly throughout the movie aren't even funny to begin with. Looking back on it, I can't think of one moment of the film that I found even remotely amusing. Most of the time, I found myself cringing at the horribly inept attempts at humor. Worst of all are the numerous sequences which meander on for minutes with no direction whatsoever, as if the actors are making it all up as they go along (I think they probably did). Elvis Costello should sue someone for being associated with such an embarrassment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw Austin Powers I didn't think it was very funny. But then a friend insisted that I watch it again and upon the second viewing I found it much funnier. The 3rd and 4th times I watched it I found it even funnier still. So I looked foward to the release of this film and it didn't let me down. While it failed to capture much of the humor of the orignal it still had me laughing out loud at times. Granted Austin Powers isn't much more than a series of interconnected sketches, but some of the scenes in this film are absolutly classic. While I don't see any lines becoming part of pop culture like "shh", some lines are still extremely funny. Such as the line Austin delivers when supposedly driving in the English country side, "Funny how the English Country side looks nothing at all like Southern California." or their handling of the time travel issues. The music is the strongest point of the film. The sight of Dr. Evil singing "Just the 2 of Us" is worth the price of admission alone. I eagerly look foward to seeing Austin Powers 3.</fullReview>

They could have come up with a better/funnier idea &gt; Anyway, the best thing about the movie was Mini-Me. He is an example of movie perfection. He's funny, cute, and incredibly evil.

		<fullReview>This movie was extremely funny!!! I was laughing so hard, I cried. Mike Myers is one of the most talented comedian/actors in the business today. I must say I enjoyed Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard the most, plus the running gags were hilarious. The only problem I had was the way the wrote off Vanessa (Elizebeth Hurley). It was the only disappointment I had, but the rest of the movie, more than made up for it. Hopefully they will bring her back for the third movie, if there is one (Please) :).Overall I give it a 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedies have never been my favorite movie theater excursion. I remember going to the film Liar Liar and not even cracking a smile. I saw it again on video and enjoyed it very much. The same was true of Austin Powers. I didn't laugh very much during it, even though the rest of the audience was losing it the entire time. However, knowing my disposition towards comedies, I rented it on DVD when it arrived, and I liked it very much. So, I expected to go into Austin 2 last night and laugh only a little. That's not what happened. Sometimes I laughed, sometimes I lost it, and sometimes I didn't smile{among that being a cup of coffee scene which I think is probably the most disgusting and unneccesary piece of humor I have ever scene}. I loved Mini-me, mostly all of Dr.Evil's stuff, Heather Graham, and much of Austin's stuff. Rob Lowe, Jerry Springer, Seth Green, and all of Mini-me and Evil's interaction. Also, the fight between Austin and Mini. I liked Fat-Bastard and such. I didn't like some of the more potent toilet humor, and the dance sequences have begun to wither. Like much of the film's humor, they are overdone. It's true. Like most comedy sequels, the humor that worked well in the first one is just capitalized. Whether it be good{The "shush" stuff was even funnier this time, and Number #2's crying, among others}. Bad {the Bunny ears "laser stuff" got old fast, and Austin's joke about killing guards, or Fran Farbissanau's screaming}, or disguisting {the mustafa "very badly hurt" stuff, the teeth}. However, there is some very inspiring stuff here. The Jerry Springer scene{a retrend of a Earlier Simpson's episode}, the penis-Woody Harrelson stuff, Fat Bastard are all examples of Myers great humor. Hey, was that Tim Robbins as the president? overall, a 3 out of 4, with the original as 3.25</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comparing "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" to the first movie is like comparing the two Ace Ventura Movies. Both the originals and sequels were funny, but the second installments of the two series had something lacking. Don't get me wrong, I laughed out loud several times and it is almost worth the ticket price to see Jerry Springer's Cameo, but most of the humor was either not funny, the same jokes as in the first story, or ripped off from another movie. While the first 15 minutes were utterly hilarious, it pained me to watch the rest of the movie. Austin was his same horny self, but Dr. Evil, mini-me, and number 2 were lame. On the other hand Scott Evil and Felicity Shagwell made the movie somewhat bareable. Overall, the story sucked and unless you are a die-hard Austin Powers fan or looking for a good make out movie, go rent the original again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw Austin Powers I didn't think it was very funny. But then a friend insisted that I watch it again and upon the second viewing I found it much funnier. The 3rd and 4th times I watched it I found it even funnier still. So I looked foward to the release of this film and it didn't let me down. While it failed to capture much of the humor of the orignal it still had me laughing out loud at times. Granted Austin Powers isn't much more than a series of interconnected sketches, but some of the scenes in this film are absolutly classic. While I don't see any lines becoming part of pop culture like "shh", some lines are still extremely funny. Such as the line Austin delivers when supposedly driving in the English country side, "Funny how the English Country side looks nothing at all like Southern California." or their handling of the time travel issues. The music is the strongest point of the film. The sight of Dr. Evil singing "Just the 2 of Us" is worth the price of admission alone. I eagerly look foward to seeing Austin Powers 3.</fullReview>

Looking back on it, I can't think of one moment of the film that I found even remotely amusing. Most of the time, I found myself cringing at the horribly inept attempts at humor. Worst of all are the numerous sequences which meander on for minutes with no direction whatsoever, as if the actors are making it all up as they go along (I think they probably did).

		<fullReview>I was extremely fearful before going to see this movie. I had visions of Wayne's World 2 running through my head, and was almost tempted not to go see it. However, my faith in the International Man of Mystery, couple with my desire to see Heather Graham in a variety of short skirts, won out in the end.And I'm glad it did. While there are no laughs as pants peeing hard as those in the first movie ("Who does Number Two work for?"), the humour of the first movie that has lasted through repeated viewings is present here as well. I loved the further exploration of the relationship between Dr. Evil and Scott Evil, and Fat Bastard's tag line ("I'm dead sexy!") is likely to be the big phrase from this show. Also, of course, Heather Graham has her own mojo.The only things that detract from this movie (besides the bathroom humour, which I frankly enjoyed) are a few pieces that were carried over from AP1 that don't quite fit here. You'll know them when you see them, and they can certainly be excused, given the overwhelming success of the lines in the first outing.Overall, if you liked the first one, you'll like this one. If you DIDN'T like the first one, you might like this one anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually, "AP:TSWSM" is only slightly less amusing than its predecessor for pretty much the same reason: it's hilarious, but only sporadically. And while very few sequels outrank their originals, the main reason this one does not is money: too much! Granted, the product placement running gag is terrific (I half expected to see Howard Schultz himself behind Dr. Evil's Starbucks counter!), it indicates just how much Myers and crew had to work with, while the main charm of "AP:IMOM" was its limited budget, which worked in great tandem with its originality to make it the camp-classic it is.Myers is our most talented screen comic both in front of the camera and in front of his P.C. (the pop culture allusions are amusing again; how perfect that Dr. Evil's globe demonstration echoes Chaplin's "Great Dictator," no less!). Yet it's clear New Line (i.e., Time Warner) knew they had a demographic smash on their hands. If you are: a) a 12-year-old boy; b) were a 12-year-old boy between the years 1974 and 1979; c) are "b" AND are the father of a 12-year-old boy, "AP:TSWSM" is YOUR HAPPENING, BABY, and IT WILL FREAK YOU OUT!!! If not -- or if you don't have a relationship with either a, b and/or c -- go rent the first flick again, which is what "AP:TSWSM" makes me want to do most. Your movie 'mojo' will be back in no time, baby!</fullReview>

Mini-Me is one of the funniest secondary characters to ever hit the silver screen. My only problem with this movie was missing some of the dialogue due to the excessive laughter from the audience. I'll probably enjoy it even more when it comes out on videotape and I can watch in the quiet of my home.</fullReview>

Great physical humor scenes; this movie spoofs itself. Very similar plot to the first (but you could say the same about James Bond). A bit too much "potty" humor for me.

		<shortDescription>Great, but not as good as the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers 2 is a classic. It's the funniest movie since Austin Powers 1 (Funnier than Something About Mary)but does not exceed the humor, characters, or story of Myers' original. There are hardly any new swingin' lines from Austin, instead they're all again. Characters from the first such as Number 2, and Vanessa Kensington are given cameos, and don't exactly explain themselves. I thought number 2 was dead, and in this one he is alive and well, and his survival is not even mentioned. I know I'm sounding as though I'm disappointed with this film, but believe me, it is really good. Mini-Me is classic. Felicity Shagwell is so hot. The story and humor also plays out well. Go see it again and again!</fullReview>

They have taken what was best and just tried to redo it. The Star Wars references were amusing.

		<shortDescription>Juggling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Juggling is the word that helps me describe this film. I feel that writer/star Mike Myers, and director Jay Roach were juggling the jokes in this film that would appeal to both adults and teens. Some of the jokes are hilarious, others are redundant (we've seen it before), and the rest are horrible. The jokes are just downright silly, that would make a ten year old boy laugh his head off. If you've been in a coma, or like this film, a time-warp, Austin Powers is the cleverest spoof of the wonderful James Bond series. In this sequal, Austin Powers returns to do battle again with Dr. Evil (also played by Myers), except he has to go back into 1969 to save his "mojo." Austin meets up and teams with Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham, who's in almost every New Line film) to help him recover his missing "mojo."Like I said before, some of the jokes work, others don't. And this is a film that relies on it's comedy. I think a joke is funny the first time you hear it, but the third or fifth time it gets silly. Like in both the original and this film, Austin makes cruel and dark jokes after killing someone. Heather Graham isn't as fun or sexy as Elizabeth Hurly. And from time to time, Dr. Evil gets annoying. The bit where Dr. Evil sings "Just the Two of Us" is a horrible mistake that is really a major minus to the film. There are still some good scenes and bits. The new characters are the ones who help the film. First there's Mini-Me (Dr. Evil's miniture clone) who doesn't say anything, but steals almost every scene that he's in. I'm sure by the end of the summer that more people will remember Mini-Me than Darth Maul. The other character that helps the movie is played by Myers and it's Fat Bastard(Myers). He is disgusting, but he is fresh, new, and very funny.Overall this is an o.k. film, if you enjoyed the original, you might like this. If you didn't, then you won't like this at all. But as for a comedy, it's only so-so. Is it the funniest movie of the year? No, that title still goes to "ANALYZE THIS." Is it worth watching, "yes, at least once." This is a movie that will sure to please the men ages 8-35, others will just shake their head. This film will bring in the crowd that made THE WATERBOY make over +$100 million, the rowdy teenage boys. ***1/2 (out of *****)</fullReview>

Some original stuff would have made the movie a lot better. Also, the stupid Star Wars jokes throughout the movie got tiresome. All in all, It was okay.

		<fullReview>"Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged Me" Back in 1997, "Austin Powers" debuted on a quiet early May weekend. With little competition and the most ingenious collection of jokes that year, the film became a sleeper hit of the summer, later grossing more on video than theatrically. Two years later, we now have presumably the most highly anticipated sequel of the 90' s. Dr. Evil returns from deep space(where we left him in the 1997 original) with an appropriately evil plan: go back in time to 1969, steal Austin's "mojo" and take over the world. Powers, now a swinging agent in the 1990's, must go back as well to retrieve his treasured allure, this time with the help of a CIA operative who desperately wants to shag the mojo-free Austin. With his passive son, his standby Number Two, and a penchant for frickin' lasers, Dr. Evil travels to the moon to, once again, try destroy the world. Writer-star Mike Myers returns with his usual bag of tricks. Once again playing both swinging superspy Powers and his arch nemesis Dr. Evil, Myers expands his palette a bit by playing the evil Scottish agent who weighs a metric ton, Fat Bastard. Of course, Myers is such a gifted comic. He has the unique ability to make any joke work. In the first "Austin", Myers was unsure of audience reaction and perception. That film's rowdy level was played very low. In "Austin 2" Myers is armed with the first film's huge success and impact on the nation's pop culture. He seems more aggressive in his performances in the new film, constantly forcing the phrases and mannerisms that made Austin Powers such an icon. Believe me, it's all still very funny, but deep within the cockles of my heart I wished Myers could have toned it down a bit. Back in the cast are Michael York as Basil Exposition, Seth Green as Scott Evil, and the awesome Mindy Sterling as the Frau. It's exquisite to see all these actors back. Their contributions to the material are more important that many seem to think. New cast member Heather Graham makes the appropriate imprint in the film. She's absolutely stunning here, the best she's ever looked. As Austin's CIA partner Felicity Shagwell ("Shags very well"), Graham makes for nice eye candy but seems a bit unprepared for what she's surrounded with. While a comparison is unfair, I did prefer Elizabeth Hurley's more active role as the "babe" of the first film. But stealing every frame is tiny Verne Troyer as Dr. Evil's clone Mini Me. While dialog free for most of the picture, Mr. Troyer makes a strong impression in every scene he's in. It's a marvelous performance and he nearly steals the film from Mr. Myers. Director Jay Roach also knows what sells and he fills the frame with very recognized material along with rousing new comedy bits. A bigger budget affords complex effects and more time for silliness, what a godsend. "Austin 2" is funnier, faster, and infinitely more clever that the first one. That said, the film doesn't make the deep impression the original did. That film scored with the fresh concept and the unexpected silliness. The sequel cannot recreate that, try as they might. Jokes involving Dr. Evil's relationship with his son and the new Mini Me, Austin's latest romp through swinging London, and the tasteless situations Fat Bastard gets himself into are just some of the examples of the delicious comedy that awaits. Many need to be seen to be believed. I hope we see many more Austin adventures. This film series is easily the funniest in some time, grandly outpacing other summer entertainment. Myers is literally a reservoir of comic ability and material. Only further films will show just how far Myers can take us. Oh Behave! (sorry, I couldn't resist) ---------------- 9</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could not have laughed any more. I nearly stopped breathing it was so funny. This movie is packed with sight gags and great jokes, parodies of old movies and sort of a knowing look at movies like this and Airplane! I was excited about this film and have worried since last fall that this movie would not live up to expectations. Let me tell you this: this is twice the movie the original is and probably the only movie I have ever seen that I would recommend over Airplane! or Star Wars. I imagine I will be watching this film until my very last breath.There are a number of characters introduced in this film that improve on the series. The plot devices used are great, taking us through Austin Powers past and many of the jokes from the first movie are back like an old friend. If you can't stand slightly naughty jokes, you may want to miss this film. Otherwise, see this as soon as possible. Or, if you can't make it, cover your ears. This will be a summer of laughter like none you have ever heard!</fullReview>

There is a tasteless character by the name of "Fat Bastard," who exists only as a means for Mike Meyers to show off his Scotsman impression. The trailer reveals a few of the jokes, but not the funniest ones. Several of the gags from the first movie are reworked in the second, but they are still funny. Go and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bigger and better than the original. Myers knows what worked in the first installment, and satisfies your want to see it again. Happily, though, he also knows when to build on it with new stuff. This one was much more fun to watch, mainly because everyone knows what to expect. (I'll admit, the first time I saw the original, I didn't really get what Myers was going for. Neither did the other six people in the theatre.) Lots of cameos by people you know. Lots of 90s references and tie-ins. Lots of fun. Just make sure you stay for the credits... all of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although International Man of Mystery can never be replicated, The Spy Who Shagged Me was a decent attempt to crank out many laughs. Myers has the ability to make one laugh in any circumstance, which is pretty rare in Hollywood. The only thing I really didn't enjoy is the shameless promotion on MTV. What was that about? Enough people will see it, That is, if Lucas allows........It will still make a Ton on Screen and especially when it goes to VHS and DVD. 6 of 10 *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An amusing collection of sight gags and toilet humour, which I'm sure will have the Association for Fat Acceptance up in arms. Like the original, it could have been shorter. I can just see the producers screaming, "What do you mean it's only 75 minutes long? Sweep up the editing room floor and see what you can find to make it longer!" Hence, the jokes that might have been funnier as throw-aways get played and replayed to death. Dr. Evil's "Just the Two of Us" rap should have been left on the soundtrack, for example. Highlights: the ongoing dysfunctional relationship between Scotty and Dr. Evil; Heather Graham's wardrobe. Lowlights: toilet humour that goes too far; anytime Heather Graham opens her mouth to speak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sequel is absolutely no more than a tenth as amusing as the original. The lighthearted charm of spoofing the early Bond movies is not nearly as evident here. Instead, it is full of disgusting body 'humor', made up of showing and implying the ugliness of obesity and all matters concerning what goes in or may come out of the anus. Short visuals that might generate a laugh are on screen way too long. Even the 'mini-Me', a cute concept, just becomes a dreary, hyperactive ass joke at one point. All of which makes me wonder, who is the audience for this? The humor is slanted toward maybe 12 yr old boys, who would be way too young to care about the concept of a Bond James spoof in the first place. And imho, it's way too filthy and sexually oriented for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overstays its welcome and cannot shed the minor majesty of the first in its attempt to go bigger and better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why might a spoof require a sequel? Spoofs are, by their very definition, subversive and deliberately comic in their attitudes towards popular generic convention. A characteristic of popular generic convention includes that of "the sequel"; that of "the franchise"; that of "the series" ? when a spoof is produced, and it's as amusing as the first "Austin Powers" film was, it cannot be anything but both thoroughly shameful and wholly hypocritical to induce the continued adventures of its hero. Is it not wholly detrimental to the original notion and a complete anomaly? Was there a joke or a sight gag that was missed the first time round that the audience really ought to have seen? The answer is "No" - at least it is to the last of those three questions. For everything else, the response ought to come in the form of a mumbled agreement that Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is a bit of a waste of time and just not particularly funny.The 'spoof' in question in Austin Powers was that of the Bond franchise; something which was playfully mocked without ever really being thoroughly undermined anyway nastily. But hold on, for in spite of the evident references to Oddjob and the master villain stroking his white cat, what was it about the film that so evidently made it a Bond spoof? If it was at all, it was subtle; the references were dropped in around amusing scenes depicting Powers try to win at blackjack with a "5". The pastiche is here a hundred times more aggressive and, as a consequence, a hundred times less funny. True, one cannot help but chuckle at the opening ballad being belted out in the mould of a Shirley Bassey theme tune but a mere few of the references here go an awfully long way. You need not be anybody in particular to notice that "International Man of Mystery" was never intended to have a sequel. For our troubles of sitting through some of the less-bearable sequences in said 1997 feature, we get what is essentially a lazier; cruder and more infantile film than before which makes the golden error of thinking that because it's a comedy playing on something popular, and by definition things that are most popular in contemporary cinema are often crass and infantile, it thinks it has to provide us with a film that is as puerile and often as disgusting as The Spy Who Shagged Me is.Shamelessly defiling everything that made the first one the solid experience it was, we begin on the honeymoon of the titular Austin Powers (Myers) and his bride Vanessa Kensington and witness the film throw us a vicious curveball in revealing Hurley's character to have been a robotic imposter all along. I think we'd invested a certain amount of energy and time in these people, we witnessed them begin their relationship on contemptible grounds, as varied attitudes towards sex from different eras clashed, before seeing them come to quite like one another after a series of instances wherein Powers turns down the offer for sex from a drunk Kensington and they end up saving the world together.In spite of all that, how does Powers react to the revelation? Why, to celebrate. Myers' other creation, the hunched Dr. Evil whose appearance was always designed to call to mind the best of the Blofeld depictions in Donald Pleasance's is back. Where freezing oneself in time so as to be thawed in the future and wreak havoc in the era was the idea before, the notion of time travel is here ill-advisedly introduced into proceedings - one is reminded of that line from Michael Hanke's "Funny Games" when, upon observing a character in possession of a shotgun ideally used to quell the reign of terror being inflicted upon him, the primeval component of that film's antagonistic force merely grins and utters words along the lines of: "Oh, you've brought us a new toy..." What unfolds is essentially a reversing of the joke that was the whole point of "International Man of Mystery" in the first place; that is to say, removing people from the 1960's and placing them in the 90's for shock and amusement. The gag, of course, revolved around how sensible and chaste we all were in the modern world where, before, we couldn't keep out of one another's beds. The reality is actually the other way around, but the idea of this swinging 60's rouge from London being catapulted to modern Las Vegas worked to a basic degree. Here, Evil and Powers dart back to the 60's again; Evil to steal Powers' inherent sexual prowess while he's still frozen (prior to events from the first film) and Powers to ultimately stop him. Of course, the film realises how shallow all this is and by the end opts for a sub-narrative revolving around a giant laser Dr. Evil is to shoot from space to see it home.Where one was perhaps tempted to genuinely think Hurley's character might work for the government in the first film, and her resistance to Powers' initial advances saw her informed enough to batter each of them away, the female accomplice here is the opposite. Practically begging for sex from the off, Heather Graham's American agent Felicity Shagwell fulfils the role of what is essentially eye-candy to Hurley's (dare we say it?) actual characterisation. The dynamic of their relationship reads: where before, Kensington wouldn't take what Powers wanted to give he is now stuck not being able to receive what Shagwell is crying out to provide. For that to be your central joke, on top of everything else that's wrong with it, means that this is a messy entry indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Number Two One Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to say this, but watch Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me once and only once. I wish I had.The reason I say "I hate to say this" is because there are a lot of positives about this comedy-sequel. Such as the introduction to the now-iconic Mini-Me, Madonna's wonderful single: "Beautiful Stranger" and there are a lot of absolutely hilarious scenes in this movie. But, unfortunately, they are somewhat few and far between.In fact, speaking of which, like Myers's other series Wayne's World, part one is drop-dead hilarious while number two, is well, as a whole, number two.Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me takes place immediately after part one, showing where Austin left off with Vanessa and Dr. Evil frozen. Of course, the doctor's coming back, now in tow with Myers's other creation: Fat Bastard and his smaller-clone Mini-Me and the same gang from part one. Dr. Evil's new plan is to steal his "mojo" in order to cause harm. He must travel back in time, with Austin at his heels, to do so. It's not easy to describe the entire plot, but that's the gist. The fun in the movie is just to go along for the ride, but, again, just once.Unfortunately, the movie seems like a bunch of skits just spliced together (such as a "rap video") with no real direct plot and a lot of real stepped up crude/vulgar humor. It's a fun event movie, released in 1999 at the heels of Star Wars Episode I, a movie it sincerely mocks. At least Austin one had a direct plot. This one was just made for fans.It's worth watching, if only for Mini-Me, a young Ferrell, Lowe as a pitch-perfect young-Number Two, a scene involving definitions of male anatomy and a lot of time-travel-paradoxes that mock other time-travel movies. But for originality and solid humor, it's best just to stick with number one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having enjoyed Mike Myers previous work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live) my expectations of a 60s bond spoof were fairly high. It became plain after the first minute that this was an exercise in how to be as puerile and unfunny as possible. I swit ched off after ten minutes. I watched it the other day a second time to see whether I had been unfair the first time. I switched it off after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe how even a twelve year-old boy could find this funny. The dialogue is an e mbarrassment, Myers is painful to watch (as is Heather Graham) and the succession of characters including Fat Bastard makes matters even worse. Apart from the mildly amusing title and the psychedelic set design this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I personally recommend you avoid this like the plague, though several friends of mine enjoyed it (maybe they were blindfolded at the time).?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe it or not, I saw this film immediately after I saw the first one. I noticed a few improvements. Firstly, the jokes are better, but still crude. Next, the acting is a lot better with the additions of Verne Troyer(Mini-Me), Heather Graham, and more Mike Myers characters(Fat Bast...) I like the music of this film. My favorite song was when Dr. Evil sang "What if God was One of Us" on his piano. The script was just as good as the first one. I also like the chemistry between all the actors. I like the "battle" between Dr. Evil and his son. It gets more interesting as the movie wears on. If you liked the first film, you will like this film. I give this movie a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sequel is really off the hook. The first one was funny, this one is a little more expressed in a way. Here you have Austin Powers(Mike Myers) gets married to Vanessa(Elizebeth Hurley) who in return was a FemBot(Women robots) and he goes back to his swinger ways. On the other side, his nemesis Dr. Evil(also Mike Myers) is up to his tricks again. He develops a miniature clone of himself, hence Mini-Me(Verne Troyer) whom he loves dearly. His son Scott Evil(Seth Green), total feels resented by them. Dr. Evil always tells him to "Zip it!", whenever he tries to correct his not-so bright father. As for Austin, he feels so useless when Evil's foreign crony Fat Bastard(Myers) steals his "mojo". That tubby two-tone has the lowest self-esteem of all. He tries to eat Mini-Me, he gets kicked in the "goolies" by Felicity Shagwell(Heather Graham), and a loser in love. At least Austin help give him a bolster of confidence. Then too, Felicity helped Austin know he's still the man with or without his "mojo". And another thing, Austin moved on with his life, and quit living in his time. A great movie for any generation of people. 4 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

The whole "machine gun jubblies" thing was priceless on Hurley and the "foreplay" joke, but I still don't see why she wouldn't go all the way.

		<shortDescription>The Movie That Bored Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the type of sequel that does nothing for you except make you wish you were watching the original, and maybe also getting a refund. Not only -- to quote some IMDb heuristics -- is it no "Citizen Kane" or "not quite as good as the International Man Of Mystery episode", but rather it is very clearly inferior sequel in every aspect, as if they had used all the cutting-room-floor snippets from part one and strung them together with Jerry Springer and a Moon Base.Just for instance, in part one we had the father-son conflict between Dr. Evil and his disenfranchised offspring Scott, which was well acted and written, and which the viewer could generally relate to. In part two Dr. Evil acquires a midget clone and the two sing "Just The Two Of Us" together. Not only did I not find the whole skit funny, I simply had no idea what it was supposed to be about. It's a bit like someone starting a joke by saying "You know how those Nigerians? How they always cycle around on blue bikes wearing woolen balaclavas whilst reciting the Gettysburg Address?", and although you would dearly like to have a laugh at someone else's expense you have to break the spell by saying "I'm sorry, what are talking about?" (I later found out that it was supposed to be a reference to 'The Island Of Dr. Moreau', although I still don't understand what sense a parody of a bad film which hardly anyone has seen is supposed to make, or how it could possibly fit in with the whole Swinging Sixies-James Bond theme of Austin Powers). To make things worse, Mini-Me actor Verne Troyer can't act. Call me a stickler or even a new man, but just dressing a small person as Dr. Evil simply won't cut it with me in the humor department.But, saddest of all, Austin Powers' love interest. Here we are forced to witness Heather Graham being hopelessly outperformed by Elizabeth Hurley (Elizabeth Hurley, for Christ's sake!) who had that role in the first episode. Graham is, as many commentators in this forum have astutely noted, dishy and looks rather fetching in hot pants. But she comes across as so cold and bland that I, personally, would prefer to shack up with one of the fem-bots from part one. Or Frau Farbissina. Or that NORAD RADAR operator. Anyone.Ultimately "The Spy Who Shagged Me" was intended to cash in on the success of "International Man Of Mystery" and it did just that, taking in more on its opening weekend than the original during its entire run. While that is to be expected, I am a bit taken aback by the fact that so many viewers seem to more than happy for not being given an even break for their ticket money -- it simply doesn't bode well for future Hollywood sequels (on the other hand, it would account for the astonishing run of the "American Pie" series).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The popularity of the Austin Powers character is another example of our decaying culture. Hardly an original concept, incredibly stupid male spies have been played to far better effect, both on the big screen (Peter Sellers' Pink Panther) and the small screen (Don Adams in "Get Smart"). Mike Myers's character is derivative of one of Martin Short's old characters on the classic SCTV show (Jackie Rogers, Jr.), but audiences (and critics) don't seem to have noticed. These movies are geared towards adolescent audiences, with their unimaginative sexual references and fart jokes.If you are a sixteen year old out on a first date, an Austin Powers movie might be suitable for you. Mature audiences will find this completely forgettable movie to be annoying, and it is definitely not for children.</fullReview>

Secondly, these 'hilarious gags' that were supposedly abundant in this film WERE TAKEN FROM THE FIRST! Wake up people! Now, I'm not going to diss this film completely as there were a couple of scenes that made me laugh out loud - the silhouetted tent scene and the Powers / Mini me punch up. However, a certain other new creation, Fat B*****d, is probably the least funny character ever to appear on our cinema screens. Oh, and I know I'm in the minority here, but Liz Hurley was infinitely preferable to Heather Graham as Powers' sidekick. In summary, an awful follow up to a superb movie that just scrapes 4/10 for the two scenes mentioned herein.</fullReview>

I only watched about 20 minutes of it, so I can't comment on rumors that it does get kinda funny during the last ten minutes or so.It's amazing how something that could work so well the first time around, i.e. the parody of the sixties superspy genre, could fail so miserably the second time. Maybe it's because the first time around, you're reminded of the movie "Goldfinger", where the second time, you're reminded of the first Austin Powers movie. That is, the first A.P. movie was given creative inspiration by something external, where the second A.P. movie was nothing more than a self-absorbed tribute to the first movie, an inside joke reduced to the level of sickening cliche.An amazing amount of time is wasted on pseudo-scenes where our former hero simply mugs the camera and dances around, as if he's making the first appearance in the movie. I couldn't believe how self-indulgent it was. What are we supposed to do when all of a sudden in the middle of the movie, we hear that disco beat again, and there's the main character's face filling the screen in front of a psychedelic background, mugging for one snapshot after another as if to say "Here I am, baby!". Yes, Austin, we KNOW you're in the movie. Go "shag" yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So many areas of bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to preface this by saying that I loved the first. In fact, I own three versions of it on video. This, however, will not enjoy such esteem. When I first saw this movie, I thought of two outcomes: Either Meyers would do what he did in the first and produce another masterpiece or he would try to force success and fail miserably. Unfortunately, Meyers went the business route and failed miserably. In the first, the humor was subtle and witty. In the second, the humor revolved around the toilet. The first was about Austin. The second was about Dr. Evil. It even seemed that Dr. Evil was done differently in the second! Mini-me was a terrible, terrible addition (not really as a result of the acting choice, mind you) for more reasons than his being totally unrelated to the plot, and let's face it: Shagwell was just a pretty, ditzy, face. This movie was less a sequel than a horrid spoof of a decent movie. Instead of relying on the original humor of the movie and continuing to the next logical level, Meyers forced himself (and, to a degree, the other actors) to exactly play the part he did in the last movie so it comes off forced and stale. Not to mention the utterly disgusting Fat Bastard. I mean, he was so totally revolting that even the younger members of the audience were grossed-out. The central flaw with this movie was that it was obviously made to make money, not for fun. Meyers knew that he had a winning formula and rather than take it to the next level and risk losing audience (which wouldn't have happened--Meyers is too talented), he played it safe and went for business. This meant more gross-out humor (something totally lacking in the first, thankfully) and more, more, much much more product placement. Gee.... I wonder how much VW payed to have a Bug be the time machine, rather than a strange vortex like Dr. Evil's? The saddest part about that is how hypocritical it was of him to do that, especially after parodying it so well in Wayne's World. I guess my hope for any other sequels is that Meyers will return to being himself, talented, funny, and original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This summer I saw the movie Austin Powers the Spy Who Shagged Me. It was a good movie. It was really funny but very unrealistic. This had to have been one of my favorite movies. One of the reasons it was such a good movie is that it was funny throughout the whole thing. Two really funny parts were when first Dr.Evil is drinking coffee and he gets foam on his nose. Second is when Dr.Evil's chair starts to go really fast in all directions. These are only two of the many funny scenes of this movie. This movie is very unrealistic but it was still a good movie. Some examples of why it was unrealistic is that the characters are traveling through a time machine and that they are floating through space in some sort of rocket thing without needing to wear a space suit or helmets.These things would both probably never happen except maybe in the WAY future. All in all I would really recommend this movie because I laughed throughout the majority of the movie and it had a good plot/script even though it was not realistic I still thought it was an awesome movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sad truth up front: there is more of this crap to be seen on the silver screen in the next couple of years regarding the commercial success and the open ending of the movie! This film is an insult to all intelligent life on earth and even one day later I can hardly remember more than 1 or 2 scenes in the movie that could be called "funny". After "Naked gun 1 - 150" and "Something about Mary", which all saw me laughing even hours after leaving the cinema, I thought I was prepared for "The Spy who shagged me". I was terribly wrong. This movie lacks even what I would call a basic story, the actors´ performances are frightening and the gags are older than the movie industry.If you want to see ugly people go and see "Hair" or "Wayne´s world". If you want to hear funny British accents rent a British movie. For German accents see "Die hard" or "Top Secret". If you want to see the oldest gags in the world get a Charlie Chaplin or Jerry Lewis video. If you want to see all that cut down to a minimum in one movie then "Austin Powers 2" is a must. If you´re determined to spend $ 10 on 90 minutes of mind-numbness be prepared for the worst. Powers by name - Powerless by reputation!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the first Austin Powers but if it's twice as good as the second I've saved a bit of cash. But even this can't console the empty feeling that remains after seeing this disaster of a movie.The gags are so old that I could easily imagine Kenneth Williams or Charles Hawtrey singing half of the catch phrases (oh behave? Oh brother!). There's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen before. OK - so maybe I laughed once or twice at the beginning, but a film that relies on so few (weak) jokes, over and over, is an insult to those watching it.It's supposed to be a parody of the bond films - but this is perhaps the vital error. Bond films, by their very nature, never take themselves seriously - parodying a parody just doesn't work!I don't mind admitting that if it wasn't for Heather Graham's 'breathtaking performance' I could have comfortably slept through the whole thing. Please Mike Myers, change the record.</fullReview>

Total lack of any intelligent fun, infinitely repeating of same or very similar jokes. The movie is perfect for kids from 1 to 3 years old . A kid will laugh every time you show him/her a toy if you are already laughing. That is not a reaction because the toy is funny but because the kid doesn't have an opinion about the toy and accepts the opinion of the environment. That's exactly how this movie works.

		<fullReview>I had high hopes going into this one, I admit. I love the first one (though after the first 5 minutes of "Spy Who Shagged Me," that was dimmed significantly, too; you'll know why when you see the scene with Vanessa). Other than a couple of inspired bits by Dr. Evil (and the fact that Heather Graham approached goddess status as Felicity Shagwell), this film was a rehash of its far superior predecessor. There were no truly new gags or fun introduced, here, and the bathroom humor belonged more in a "Beavis &amp; Butthead" cartoon than in an Austin Powers film. Mike Myers and the rest of the cast seemed lost in a meandering plotline that went nowhere fast. As inspired as Myers was in the first "Austin Powers," he was uninspired in this one. The potential was there for this to be one of THE defining movies of the year, but instead it fails to live up to expectations and even significantly cheapens the original, a feat which I've never before seen a film do. Save your money and either buy or rent the original; it's infinitely superior to the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" is light-hearted entertainment which supplied me with a ton of laughs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin is back and more raunchy than ever in "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" is light-hearted entertainment which supplied me with a ton of laughs, no matter how crude they were.Mike Myers returns to his role of Austin Powers in this sequel, as well as playing Dr. Evil, and a new character, Fat Bastar#.Austin Powers has since settled down with new wife Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) since the first film, and is quite happy. Until he finds out his wife is a homicidal fembot of a bride bent on destroying him. After the Vanessa Fembot blows up, Austin immediately forgets about her and goes out for a photo shoot.But what Austin doesn't know is that Dr. Evil has a new plan - to steal Austin Powers' mojo! Evil (along with a clone 1/6 his size - played by Verne J. Troyer) has sent Fat Bastar# back to the sixties to steal Powers' mojo while he is cryogenically frozen. Without his mojo, Powers is nothing. So 90's Austin travels back to the 1960's to claim back his mojo - along with Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) - from a time-traveling Dr. Evil.This sequel is a lot different than the first film. The first seemed to be more of a spoof on the spy/James Bond genre. This movie, however, runs a bit more on Powers and his mojo - not a whole lot of Bond spoofs here. But that doesn't mean the jokes aren't any good.Dr. Evil has much more screen time in this sequel, and I'm happy for that. Dr. Evil is a character we didn't see a whole lot of in the original, and in this film, he has just as much - if not more - screen time than Powers himself (it sounds weird referring to them as different actors - they're both Myers!).Mike Myers is just as funny as he was in the first film. I recently viewed "So I Married an Axe Murderer" for the second and a half time, and I realized that Myers really isn't as funny when he's playing someone close to himself. His character in "So I..." isn't as shy as Myers is in real life, but he talks, looks, walks, smiles, and dresses like Myers. Myers as Powers is entirely different, however - he's about twenty times funnier. Not that Myers isn't funny, but you'll notice he is much more funny dressed up as someone else. Look at his "Saturday Night Live" skits and you'll see that Myers' best skits were those when he dressed up as different people (i.e. the Scottish Crap Store man).Heather Graham may not be the most talented actress, and I especially found her over--or under--acting in this film compared to her performances in "Boogie Nights" and "Bowfinger"--but I think she may have done that on purpose. As we all know, Bond girls usually aren't the best actresses, so perhaps she over/under-acted as a parody on Bond films. Maybe not.Either way she's much better than Hurley was.Robert Wagner returns to the role of Number 2, a spoof on...well...Number 2 from the James Bond film "Thunderball"--complete with the eye patch and all. He does just as well as he did in the first film, if not better. I think he was a bit apprehensive of enveloping his character in the original "Powers" film--but he seems more confident here.Mindy Sterling returns to her role of Frau, Dr. Evil's female henchman--and we find out here that the only man she has ever been with--or ever will be with--is Dr. Evil. Their offspring? Seth Green, reprising his role as Scott Evil--whom was thought to be Dr. Evil's test tube baby, when he is, in fact, the outcome of a one-night-stand with Evil and Frau. Of course the chance that Evil would have the exact same son (Green) with Frau as he did when Scott Evil was born by means of test tubes (even if Frau was the test tube mother) is around one in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 to the tenth power (if that whole theory is a little unclear, sorry--I can't think of any other way to put it without getting too...medical...), but that doesn't matter--it's a comedy!It's also worth mentioning that a younger version of Number 2 is played by Rob Lowe--who perfectly mimicks Robert Wagner.All in all, "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" is not exactly the greatest comedy, but it's just about as good as the first, if off by a little.3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not a huge fan of the first "Austin Powers" film, but I did enjoy it. I thought it was hilarious for the first hour or so, and then became rather boring towards the end. This film, however, was monotonous and un-exciting throughout. Even it's funniest scene (a Jerry Springer episode with Dr. Evil and his son) was uninspired and unoriginal.God help us if there are going to be two more sequels to this film. One might think there would have been some fresh jokes in here, but it was the usual "Yeah Baby," and "Do I make you horny?".I think the main problem with this movie is it's premise. Whereas the first film mocked Austin Powers and was a bit of a satire, "The Spy Who Shagged Me" embraces this wretched character and stops poking fun at him, which is what made the first film (or the first half anyway) work so well. With endless product placements and cringingly bad dialogue by Heather Graham's character, this movie is almost as big a disappointment as "The Thin Red Line" (which is, incidentally, the worst movie I have ever seen).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Shag Or Not To Shag, That Is The Question?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Fu Manchu back in the day, Dr. Evil is defeated, but not destroyed in the first Austin Powers film. He's back and he's got a plan to make things right. The way to do it is to defeat Austin Powers and the way to do that is to steal his Mojo. I mean what would James Bond be without his Mojo. A whole slew on Bond girls would go UnBondified.The operation is successful and the Powers Mojo is now in the hands of Dr. Evil. In the first film, Dr. Evil begat a son Scott Evil by artificial insemination, but now with the Powers Mojo he sees some hidden charms (well hidden) in Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling). He even gets cloned and from that procedure, we get Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). Of course filling the world with Evil is only part of the plan, he still has it mind to get some big bucks from the USA for not blowing up Washington, DC with a space laser.So Mike Myers as Powers has to both get his Mojo back from Powers as Dr. Evil and foil the Evil plans. As his Shagadelic sidekick he has Heather Graham as Felicity Shagwell from the American CIA. Without his Mojo, Powers is lost when dealing with her obvious charms.As for Graham she in the line of duty has to do some mercy Shagging on another of Mike Myers's comic creation, Fat Bastard the Scot's guardsman who's a double agent. I have to say I really enjoyed what Myers did with this character although the film does get a bit gross when dealing with this guy. However it was the makeup job on Myers for Fat Bastard that got Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me an Oscar nomination in that department.If possible the humor gets a little more low brow than the first film was, but still plenty funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still funny but a lot of recycled gags from the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Happily married to Felicity and with Dr Evil gone, Austin settles into the future. However when a fiendish plot to kill Powers fails it is clear that Dr Evil is back. In order to tackle Powers, Dr Evil has invented a time tunnel to go back in time to when Powers was frozen and steal his mojo. Powers must also join the time jumping to reclaim his mojo in order to beat Dr Evil.This second film sees the approach of `if it ain't broke then don't fix it'. Hence we have a rerun of the same sort of jokes from the first film. However it still manages to be funny and have enough new stuff to feel different. The plot is of course silly ? you won't forget it when you leave the cinema, you'll forget it while you're still watching the film! However the jokes are what matters and happily Myers has realised what the best part of the first film was and has given Dr Evil more screen time. He has also created Mini-Me, a tiny clone of Dr Evil who just adds to the laughs. The role of Powers is still funny but he now has less to do. The main addition is Myers in another role ? Fat B'stard. This character is pretty unfunny and gross, happily he has relatively little screen time (but he's in the next film too).Myers is good again as Dr Evil and Powers, however with Fat B'stard he shows that he can't be funny without the material and simply doing a Scottish accent and being fat does not a funny character make. Heather Graham is OK as the sexy girl and Seth Green, Robert Wagner, Rob Lowe etc all return in support roles. They are all OK simply because the material is funny if a little crude or silly.Overall this may recycle a lot of jokes from the first film, but it still manages to be funny despite having some weak moments. Whether or not the joke can stretch to another film or not remains to be seen but part 2 manages to be funny, mainly because Dr Evil is given a larger role, more screen time and more things to do. Crude, silly but funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers 2 was an insult to my intelligence, though I did shell out the five bucks without anyone forcing me to do so. The movie had all of the same jokes from the first film without any of the wit, and Mike Myers somehow managed to run(well, hammer) the already tired bits of AP1 even farther into the ground. He also managed to over-saturate the film with sub-juvenile bathroom humor--an extremely overweight character's bowel movement simply isn't funny.Though the first movie had its moments, the sequel came across like a joke that wasn't terribly funny the first time you heard it, only you've heard it 15 times since and this time it comes from someone who doesn't know how to tell it. Unfortunately, I fear we'll be given a third installment in which the same old gags don't work yet again.Give us a break, Mike. Write something creative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have finally reached middle age. I went to Austin Powers 2 with high hopes.

This is the very first time I have ever done this. The potty humor and sexual innuendoes did not strike me as funny.I have enjoyed other "dumb" comedies ("Dumb and Dumber" come to mind) but the endless sexual jokes got old in a hurry. How anyone could get a laugh at someone drinking feces is beyond me. I also could not believe this movie was rated PG-13. There is no way I would let my 12 to 14 year old see this movie. The scene in the tent was the last straw for me.I usually don't take the time to comment, but I had to. I have nothing against Mike Myers.

Don't waste your money.I was very disappointed because I loved the first movie (it was the first DVD I purchased). Mike Myers just blew it on this one. It looks like it was edited by some film student and the storyline was so full of holes I just thought to myself, "what the hell were they thinking".Dr. Evil gets Austin's "MoJo", but does nothing with it. They never even attempt to explain what "MoJo" is or what the heck that gizmo that Fat Bastard was. Dr. Evil goes off on all sorts of tangents, this is never explained. Vanessa was a fem-bot, Basil knew all along, but this is never explained.I'm just wholly offended that no one involved in this project even made an attempt to explain these things. It's so in your face, "we don't care, we don't have to explain anything, just shut up and buy our stuff!".It would have been so simple to spend a few screen minutes explaining that Dr. Evil was trying to enhance his MoJo by watching MTV, etc, (thus all the stupid little skits), but he decides just to steal Austin's instead. I would have bought that.Geez, even the title, "The Spy Who Shagged Me" just goes to show what little thought was put into this project. Austin shags who in this movie? No One!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the first Austin Powers was one of the funniest movies i have seen in ages. An intelligent satire of the whole James Bond motif, with several take-offs that were direct pot shots at the bond movies.But, when the sequel came out, I just had a nagging feeling that there was no way it could be half as good as the original. And, boy oh boy, did they really miss the mark on this one. My first feeling when watching this movie was that Mike Myers had a bunch of jokes in his head, and he wrote them down. Then, they tried to tie them together with a loosely knit storyline. The result is that most of the jokes are not funny, and the story seems to wander quite a bit. Also, all sense of james bond satire is gone, save for a few scenes at the end.Overall, i was very disappointed in this one. I sincerely doubt i'll shell out the money to see AP3 when it comes out, after this debacle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had merely 1/600th of the monstrous advertising budget of this film, I think even I could have made a better movie.Relentlessly annoying, badly written, unfunny movie stars Michael Myers (not the Halloween one) basically making an ass of himself the way he does best. There are a total of two funny moments in this film (one a lengthy reprisal of the Jerry Springer show, though overdone; and another involving a guard idiotically jumping into a pool of magma). Other than that, the humor is moronic, repetitive, and obnoxious. Many of the Myers's monologues seem as though he is coming up with his dialog on the spot, particularly in the case of fat bastard. It's mind-boggling how even Will Farrel's cameos wasn't even funny. Is this what cinematic entertainment is coming to? Had it the micro-budget the script deserved, this film would have been forgotten long ago.Of course this movie made a lot of money, even though it was directed with all the stylistic panache' of Ed Wood and Bruno Mattei, though far less humorous than any of their efforts.One more thing - what was Michael York doing in this movie? I felt sorry for such a great actor being reduced to such a minimal cameo, though Charles Napier was just as much a victim in this film. One can see in them the same embarrassment that Richard Harris felt as he "acted" in Tarzan The Ape Man, which was twice the film this is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film for the study of bad film making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of, I did enjoy the first AP film, so it's not like this didn't have the potential to entertain me. When this film was in the theaters, I was warned by a friend as to how bad it was and for that reason I waited until the video release to see the film. I'm soooo glad I did.Instead of getting a continuance of the whimsical original film (Like the Wayne's World Series), out dumped a sad display of bloated, poorly edited and tired adolescent humor. The original film only had a couple of gags that ran too long (like the evil laughing scene) but in this visit to the world of AP, almost EVERY gag goes on for too long and dips way too DEEP into the toilet to try and be funny.There were no genuine surprises of creativity in this film. Almost every joke is predictable and flogged to death. (read that they might have been improved with more aggressive editing) The only moment the movie produced a good laugh for me was when they did the cut to: sequence where various people are spotting Dr. Evil's rocket in the sky. (but even that was just a old joke dusted off, but done well) Of course, to stay true to form of beating a dead horse, they had to DO IT AGAIN at the end of the film. (sigh)One of the few good moments of the film are the few where Rob Lowe is doing his Robert Wagner impersonation, but that is hardly reason enough to view this film.If you want a reason to watch this film, consider it a good lesson in bad editing, comedy timing and over merchandising. The blatant product placement and plugs may have been a poke at the Bond films but it smelled more like the real thing than parody.I would ONLY suggest you watch this AP entry if you like to study bad films (like I do).-survivor.ps: It scares me to think of the box office this film did, only because it will no doubt inspire others to produce more crap like this. IF they do a sequel, we can only hope it will be more like the original film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AUSTIN POWERS: The Sequel that Gagged MeMike Myers isn't as funny as he would like to think he is. Sure, I liked the first Wayne's World movie, but after a second viewing I found the only two times I laughed were at Dana Carvey as Garth.The first Austin Powers was a comedic improvement, giving us a close enough funny send-up of British spy movies (not Bond exactly) of the 60s. He even made the 60s hip again! Sort of.But while that was clever (sort of), he takes all the jokes and puts them in this rehash sequel. He tries to add new things to "laugh" at but can only come up with the snore-causing joke of Fat Bastard (using his old SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER Scottish accent, slightly better than his English one) and Mini-Me, the best part of the whole movie. But Mini-Me is like the personification of one joke. He's a sight gag.Director Jay Roach takes too much advice from Myers and keeps on-and-on-going jokes in his movie that make you want to strangle somone (preferably Will Ferrel in a tedious skit that lasts longer and grows more stale than his burning-body bit in the first one). The jokes try to challenge SOUTH PARK and the Farrelley Bros. in grossing out, but it misses what the other two don't. Brains. Wit. And ultimately laughs. I'm sure some of the kiddies will enjoy this dreck, but they also enjoy ERNEST GOES TO CAMP, for God's sake. And hardcore fans will probably dismiss the whole thing as fun just to have the unneccessary franchise around.I dont even want to mention poor Heather Graham (who hasn't really acted since SWINGERS, TWO GUYS &amp; A GIRL and her breakthrough BOOGIE NIGHTS) wasting her time in the middle of this mess. She plays a bimbo blond, whose only interest is, apparently, to have sex with god-awful ugly men. Her IQ is right at the level with the rest of the movie. It's a shame too, because at least the first one had Elizabeth Hurley (who gets snubbed here) pointing out how sexist and dated that is in the 90s. Apparently the cliche is back in effect again. They might as well have evil Russians and dim-witted Chinese characters here also.The first one was at least a hit-and-miss, but this thing, whatever you want to call it, is a miss-and-miss, unless, of course, the target is its foot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All of The Above (with Filth !)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movie series are all about their original one; namely were better being unmade as series ! (Austin Powers) is one of them, since everybody knows that the first is the best, and the rest is whether a repetition (The first sequel), or a chain of bad sex jokes (the second sequel). Everything and everyone in (Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me ? 1999) are recycled from (Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery ? 1997). Even the gags. For instance (Heather Graham) redoes the same role that (Elizabeth Hurley) did in the original, the romantic montage with Burt Bacharach's music, a sequence where the lead walks sad in the streets, the lead's routine over a dead guard, etc etc. Bond movies have trademarks, but at least its action differs every time. Now that parody thinks its comedy / in place of Bond's action; trademarks must be all redone. Accordingly, this is not a decent spoof, it's just something that repeats itself ! Add to that a certain amount of filth, though I believe that filth and comedy don't work, rather filth kills comedy ! The intro with the lead naked, having endless visual metaphors for his penis is ugly. (Fat Bastard) is one of the most unfunny and repulsive characters ever appeared on screen. Naturally, drinking the feces is something to make some ones I don't want to know laugh for reasons I hardly stand. In simple words : hell on earth means moments like this !(Robert Wagner), as (Number 2), is shamefully used. Away from (Will Ferrell)'s cameo, I can't remember one smart scene. Yes, in this movie there is sincerity towards spoofing the 1960s, Bond, and the other Bonds, but in less freshness and abundance than its antecedent. In fact all the memorable moments of Austin Powers' world are from the antecedent. Good points : stealing the Mojo as a start, (Seth Green) as (Scott Evil), (Hurley)'s short appearance (and short nigh gown), the parody of (Will Smith)'s "Just the two of us", and the missile that all the people mistake its form for a genital member; which is something (Myers) would be so in love with to the extent of repeating it all over again in the next Austin. Generally; so little to distinguish a movie ! The cold hard truth is that (Mike Myers) made a nice parody in 1997 that nobody saw unless on VHS. Then the producers, late as usual, noticed the strong potentials. So they asked (Myers) for another one (or a remake), and he responded by writing the first again yet with bigger money. He said that this one in hand needed more time to write. That's due to the complications of the time travel; which didn't make a noticeable difference compared to the first or more fun than it either. At any case I believe the first was better, or just enough. The one of 1997 was sequelable. But clearly in some unfortunate franchises the mojo exists in part 1 only !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inferior sequel, as usual, but overall, still reasonably funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when I watched the three Austin Powers films as a teenager (after "Goldmember", the last one, had come into stores), I believe this one was my favourite. However, it's been six years since I first saw this Austin Powers sequel, and there are comedy films I found highly amusing at the time which I've found rather dull in recent years. Fortunately, this is not one of them. It has held up better than certain other silly comedies I saw around that time. My last couple viewings of this one certainly haven't lived up to my previous ones, as I have found it to be more of a hit-and-miss comedy than I did before, but at least I still found it funny enough for the most part.Dr. Evil has figured out how Austin Powers always succeeds in foiling his evil plans?the secret agent's mojo! So, the madman has created a time machine, which he uses to travel back to 1969, two years after Powers was frozen, to steal his mojo and continue his plans for world domination! While Austin Powers is still in 1999, unaware of his foe's time travel, his love-making session is cut short as he immediately knows what he has just lost! He is soon informed by Basil about what Dr. Evil has done, and sent back to 1969, where he is to try and retrieve his mojo and once again foil the evil doctor's plans to take over the world. After he arrives back in the 60's, he is soon joined by CIA agent Felicity Shagwell, who becomes his sidekick on this mission. Together, they must try and found out where Dr. Evil's hideout is, as the madman plans to blow up Washington D.C.! This sequel showed Mike Myers continuing in the roles of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, but he also introduced a new alter ego, Fat B%$#&amp;*%, Dr. Evil's stereotypical Scottish henchmen, who weighs one metric ton, and adds quite a bit of toilet humour to the film. I was a fan of this character when I was a teenager, but no longer care much for his gross-out antics. Heather Graham's performance as Austin Powers' sidekick also brings this movie down. The way she says her lines is sometimes almost embarrassing. Fortunately, this sequel did introduce at least one amusing new character, Dr. Evil's miniature clone, Mini-Me, played by Verne Troyer. Also, the original characters who returned in this film are still funny, if they were in the first place. We get more of the same antics from Myers' two previous alter egos, including more humorous conflict between Dr. Evil and his son. Like the original, this sequel has a number of comic highlights, such as Dr. Evil taunting Number Two while bouncing a big globe in his face, the crude shadow gag, Mini-Me's sudden attack on Austin Powers, and more.It seems "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" is generally considered inferior to its predecessor (like most sequels), and I guess I'm now with the majority, which wasn't the case a few years ago, though I've definitely never been as disappointed by it as certain other fans of the original "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" have been. Some gags from the original Austin Powers movie from 1997 were rehashed for this 1999 sequel, but they tend to still be funny, and the film also introduced some new elements to the franchise, some good and some bad, as I've pointed out. With this first sequel to Myers' James Bond spoof, the comedian brought us more crude and sometimes juvenile humour (like he did again with the second sequel, "Austin Powers in Goldmember", in 2002), which some like and some obviously hate with a passion. Despite the flaws I've mentioned, I still think this is another decent Bond spoof overall, like the original, and unlike several other Bond spoofs I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb, just plain dumb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the first Austin Powers film, I have no idea why I even thought of watching the second, but I did. I must be masochistic or something. The only redeeming quality of this entire film is the beauty of Heather Graham, who plays Felicity Shagwell. Mike Myers does a pretty good job in most of the other roles, and the acting isn't the fault of the film. The whole thing is so poorly written that it never had a chance to be good. Most of the humor is either sexual innuendo or scatological in nature; in other words, very sophomoric. The story itself is that of Dr. Evil (Myers) stealing super spy Austin Power's (also Myers) "mojo", which means he can't, er, well, do "it" anymore. Then, of course, Powers must get his mojo back...wouldn't you? For a little while, a whole lot of people were saying "Yeah, Baby", a la Powers. I'm glad that fad died pretty quickly. This film doesn't rate more than a 5 from me. It's too dumb to rate any higher.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never has a film bored me so much as this. I can cope with sitting there for 90 minutes, trying to give this film a chance whilst constantly letting my line of sight drift off the TV every three seconds because there's more entertainment looking out of the window, and I can even cope with the bad acting and the bad selection of actors, (well, just Mike Myers - Heather Graham played a good part in Boogie nights) OK, films with bad humour unfortunately do exist, and they can even sometimes be enjoyable; but I do end up not classing them as comedies. An example is the Monthy Python films. However, The Spy Who Shagged was somewhat different, and, to be honest, it was insulting. It seems the' hole of a director was only interested in making money and not a good film along with it. So what really annoyed me...where to begin.Boring, made the bond film 'The spy who loved me' (which I'm guessing is the film the spy who shagged me is trying to make a fool out of) look like it should have never been made, when the bond films as a whole are very good. Bad acting, and I mean bad. You know what I mean when someone cracks a joke, and no one laughs, the comedy is like that, but it continues on and on and on. Example?. we see Heather Graham in a bikini - the camera slowly moving further up from toe to head, and then the same to Mike Myers - where we see he has a ridiculous amount of body hair, (HILARIOUS ...I think not), and the "YEH baby YEH" and the "Shag pad" lines are even worse - I now feel like hitting Mike Myers. I had the similar scenario with the actor Jim Carrey, but he annoys me a lot less, and has actually demonstrated he can act, as seen in Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind - an excellent film, I must add.I have to say though, Gold member was a huge improvement, but again, made the bond film 'Gold finger' look bad, plus, as a whole, it was still terrible. Rating, honestly: 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME(1999)**1/2 Mike Myers, Heather Grahm.Dr. Evil is back...and has invented a new time machine that allows him to go back to the 60's and steal Austin Powers's mojo, inadvertently leaving him "shagless".The sickest entry yet, this sequel is even with the original... both which I thought were just above average. Everyone is raving saying this is the funniest movie and hilarious, but I disagree. There are a few funny bits, but the endless sexual material ruins most of the jokes, mainly because most of the jokes are sexual. I mean, the plot basically tells it all. Austin's mojo gets stolen. Seriously, spoofs don't need to be sexual to be funny.PG-13: frequent crude/sexual humor and language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (aka Austin Powers 2)Starring: Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Seth Green, Robert Wagner, Rob Lowe, Verne Troyer, Michael York, Will Ferrell (brief appearance) and Elizabeth Hurley (who appears for a short period)Genre: Action/Adventure/Comedy/CrimeRated PG-13As we enter the sequel to Austin Powers we continue where our hero Austin Powers (Mike Myers) has left off where he is settling down on his honeymoon with Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), where at that point Austin found out that his wife was a robot which was a wedding present from Austin's arch enemy, Dr. Evil (Mike Myers)! Austin couldn't believe that his wife Vanessa, was a robot all long and he didn't he know which is a sad loss for Austin. Until he realizes that he is single again and starts getting really excited. It is funny in the beginning where Austin Powers is running around the hotel naked and the credits are covering him up! Back in Seattle, Washington in the Space Needle Tower our hate-to-love character Dr. Evil is explaining to his associates about his evil plan while drinking some Starbucks coffee and plus we get to meet Dr. Evil's new clone, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) who is 1/8 of Dr. Evil's size. Dr. Evil uses a Time Machine to go back into 1969 to steal Austin Powers' mojo and that time Austin Powers is frozen then. Austin Powers goes back into 1969 as well to stop Dr. Evil along with the help of Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). Meanwhile, Dr. Evil's personal life runs amok as he discovers love, continues to shun his son, Scott Evil (Seth Green) and develops a close relationship with himself. The next part of Dr. Evil's plan was to plant a gigantic laser cannon on the moon and turning the device called either "The Dark Star" or "The Alan Parson's Project". My favorite part is where Dr. Evil is explaining the whole laser cannon plan and then he bounces the globe around like a basketball. Another part I like is where Austin goes back and saves Felicity and then there is two Austins and one of them saves the girl whole the other saves the world. Another part I liked was when Dr. Evil and Mini-Me are making their own version of the song "Just the two of us" by Will Smith. My other favorite part is where they make fun of Star Wars! This is one of my favorite hit movies of 1999 along with The Matrix, Blue Streak, Toy Story 2, Tarzan, Wild Wild West, The Sixth Sense, House on Haunted Hill, Big Daddy and Analyze This. Great sequel to one of the best comedy trilogies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies ever. Mike Myers returns in this sequel to his hit classic now as Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard(who thinks he's dead sexy). This movie introduces the character of Mini-Me, the 1/8 sized clone of Dr. Evil, who likes to give the middle finger to the people he hates, including Scott Evil. This classic includes another list of famous celebrities including Willie Nelson(singer), Woody Harrelson(Cheers), Jeff Garlin(Curb Your Enthusiasm), Jerry Springer(The Jerry Springer Show), and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos(model and wife to Full House star John Stamos). This movie, I think, is the best out of the trilogy of Austin Powers. Anyone who hasn't seen this, should watch this; it's hilarious!!!!!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The FUNNIEST of all Austin Powers films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...And I do choose my words carefully when I say "funny" , cause you can't really refer to the Austin Powers series by using the words "BEST" or even "GOOD". When you use these terms, there should be at least a storyline or a decent plot, which is obviously not the case here. But it's not Mike Meyers' intention to bring a great story (he even says that in the movie: " don't worry about those things and just enjoy it) so that's OK.Like I said, in my opinion this is the most funny one of all three. The first had some great moments and the 3rd one really stinks. ( I only laughed 2 or 3 times with that one ). I probably prefer this one because of the introduction of 2 very funny characters. The clone of Dr. Evil called "Mini-Me" is very hilarious as played by Verne Troyer. He's a nasty little brat, who only loves Dr. Evil. To all others ( even to Number Two ) he's aggressive. The second new character in the film is "Fat Bastard" , Also played by Mike Myers. He's pretty much what he's name is telling us. He's supposed to be from Scotland, he's accent is very cool and his habits of eating and farting are hilarious from time to time. Dr. Evil remains very funny...maybe that's my opinion because I'm from Belgium. Then there's the story. I can be very short on that. There where in the first film Austin goes from 1967 to 1999, he goes back to 1969 here because Dr. Evil stole his "Mojo" while being frozen...that's it. Then, finally there's the girl. Although Liz Hurley is one of the most beautiful woman in the world, Heather Graham comes very close here. You'll never see her so sexy and beautiful as in Austin Powers the spy who shagged me. If you ever have to make the decision of watching one of the three Austin Powers-films ... pick this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sequel that should never have been made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I am not saying that a sequel to Austin Powers should never have been made just because this movie was so awful, but more because the first one is not really the kind of comedy that should be followed with a sequel. What you have in the original Austin Powers is a brilliant spoof of the cheesiness of the James Bond movies (a spoof that NEEDED to be made) that does a tremendous job at what it sets out to do and leaves virtually nothing for a sequel to accomplish, and that's exactly what this movie does - nothing.Yes, there are some laughs in the movie, Fat Bastard had his moments and even MiniMe was funny (for about three seconds). Heather Graham delivers hopefully the most boring performance of her career (if it gets any worse than THIS.), Elizabeth Hurley is back for a brief and only slightly embarrassing cameo at the beginning of the film, and Seth Green is back and on auto-pilot doing exactly the same thing he did in 1997. Therein lies the downfall of The Spy Who Shagged Me, it is probably the most blatant and shameless cash-in on the success of the original film of any sequel ever made.Fat Bastard and MiniMe are the only two original ideas in this entire film, and neither of them are very funny. It is painfully obvious that this is third grade humor because of the way that it tries to make us laugh at people with physical malformations - that's just not very good taste and is completely uncreative filmmaking. The whole film plods through thinly-disguised rehashes of the exact same jokes that we saw in the original, and the problem is that they are so obvious and so desperate that we are more likely to be embarrassed than to laugh.The brilliant spoof of the James Bond films that we saw in the original Austin Powers is traded in for a lot of trashy jokes and gross-out scenes such as the bedroom scene with Felicity Shagwell and Fat Bastard, and the result is that we are both disappointed with the movie and feel cheated because we just paid to basically see a bad version of what we saw two years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theater about a year after I saw the first one on video. I laughed just as much in this one as I did the first one, maybe even a little bit more. Austin Powers is back and he is funny as hell. Dr. Evil returns and he is still hilarious. Number 2 and Frau are still very funny, for the little roles they have. Scott Evil is a little funny too. The new girl known as Felicity Shagwell is beautiful and funny. There are two more characters: Mini Me and Dr. Evil. Mini Me is Dr. Evils clone, except he is 1/8 his size. Mini Me is a riot in the movie. Fat Bastard is a new character played by Mike Myers, he is kind of grotesque but he is also hilarious and maybe the most memorable Austin Powers character to date. Overall, Just as funny as the first, maybe even a little better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very funny. Every time I watch this movie I love it. The story goes as Austin Powers mojo is stolen from Dr. Evil's accomplice, a very obese Fat B**tard. Now Austin goes back in time to get his mojo back. Austin gets a new friend, Felicity Shagwell. Dr. Evil also gets a new LITTLE friend, Minime. Minime is an exact replica of Dr. Evil, just 1/8 his size. The acting is once again well and the jokes are once again crude but a lot funnier this time. They've really improved. I've got some questions about this though. I thought Scott was made from a test tube. Is he or is he not? Since when has Chile's been in 1968? How old is Woody Harrellson in 1968? I'm sure not his age right now.Overall this movie is laugh out loud funny. My favorite part is of course the Jerry Springer. That was hilarious. Rating 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like in many comedy series the laughs increase in the second installment of the Austin Powers. The big difference in this case is that the story isn't becoming stale or contrived. Not only do we continue to enjoy the escapades and eccentricities of this crazed characters we still enjoy seeing them battle and it leaves us wanting more. Instead of stagnating the characters in this comedy become more fully developed and the story is that much more enjoyable for it. Watch Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me I guarantee you'll like it more than the first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i just saw this movie on my computer and it wasn't as good as International Man of Mystery. Many people said it was better than the original, but they're wrong. This movie was made for those who haven't seen the first one. That's why they re-hashed all the good jokes from the first movie. It's a pity they only brought back Elizabeth Hurley for a friggin' cameo. She was much better than Heather Graham!This movie thinks it can save itself with a load of cameos, including Jerry Springer and Woody Harrelson. The problem is that they aren't funny nor do they save this movie, which for the most part is actually boring. And that's very disappointing considering the first one was never boring and kept throwing the jokes and visual gags at you with enthusiasm. Mike Myers should've left with the first one. I hope he won't try and make another one, çause if he does it'll be a disaster.There's one scene that's really hilarious: the one where fat bastard is shown in bed with Felicity.

Good because there are some new characters, including Verne Troyer (who steals the show) as Dr. Evil's completence, Mini-Me, and Myers as a new villain (a metric ton villain) Fat Bastard. These characters add more humor, but this is also bad because the story feels recycled and not too original. The first had some originality and added to the hilarity. Still, I'm not complaining.

For all I know Austin Powers the first is as bad as its sequel. Still, I'm prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt.THIS Austin Powers movie was filled with what I call real-time jokes. You, dear reader, will be able to think up equally good or better jokes as the film progresses, sometimes coming up with improvements ahead of time, sometimes just a little too late. How obvious are the jokes? How obvious is a pratfall? (I think it would be funny if Dr. Evil had a pratfall about - now. No, I was wrong. It wasn't funny.) How many times in the past have you heard the `I've got more chins than a Chinese phone directory' gag? How many better one-liners about obesity can you think up in, say, the next minute?EVERYBODY'S comic timing is off. Punchlines fall like drops of water from a barely leaking tap. I could detect neither spirit nor charm, and I was looking - I really was. We are exhorted to ignore the holes in the plot, just sit back and enjoy. Enjoy WHAT?

		<shortDescription>hit-and-miss sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1997 "Austen Powers: International Man of Mystery" was something of a movie boxoffice phenomenon. Earning less than $60 million dollars domestically in its theatrical run, the film blossomed into a worldwide "cult" favorite via its release on home video. Its sequel will easily earn three or four times that amount in theatres and, when it hits video stores in the fall - well the sky's the limit. Like many others, I first encountered the original film on home video and found it to be a refreshingly wacky, high-spirited take off on 60's spy films that also managed to deftly satirize the mood and mores of that time as well as of the less-than-swinging '90's. Part of the comic genius driving the original film was the ludicrous juxtaposition of Powers' anything-goes mentality of the free-love decade with the more foulmouthed, but actually less liberated, lifestyle of the present. The new film, like most sequels, almost by definition, lacks the freshness and originality of the first film (which itself does not, I must admit, hold up that well upon repeated viewings). Myers' double personas - of Powers the irrepressibly horny, always blissfully invulnerable secret agent and Dr. Evil, the hopelessly anachronistic want-to-rule-the-world villain - still reflect this extraordinarily talented actor's comic genius. The now classic expressions, inflections and repeated catchphrases with which Myers imbues both characters cannot fail to provoke a chuckle and even an occasional guffaw from the audience. But "The Spy Who Shagged Me" suffers from the curse of all these scattershot, laugh-a-minute gagfests: for every joke or sightgag that works, there are an equal number that land with a resounding thud. Moreover, the frenetic pacing often leaves the audience more exhausted than exhilerated. This is not to say that this new film does not have its share of silly laughs - with this many comic attempts a goodly number are bound to succeed. The humor, in fact, runs the gamut from the satirically witty to the downright scatalogical. Prepare to be offended if endless jokes about male sexual organs and human waste products are not to your taste. As before, the colorful costume design, reflecting the psychedelic motifs of the 1960's fashion world, are brilliantly recreated - even more so in this film because the plot this time involves Powers' return to that time period to retrieve his "mojo" which Dr. Evil has had extracted from him in the past. One clever touch is having Rob Lowe portray Robert Wagner's 1990's character as he appeared in 1969, utilizing Wagner as a voice over. The series of jokes that are least successful are the exchanges between Dr. Evil and his son Scott which emerge as uninspired and grating. All in all, this "Austen Powers" is worth a few hearty chuckles and gives us a chance to watch Myers in action again. I wonder though if this concept may have already gone once too often to the well. The inevitable Part 3 will surely tell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here it is - flat out. The movie was really funny, I won't deny that. But if it is stuck up beside its original it pales by comparison. The opening scene was annoyingly corny. I think this movie was also corny, the other one wasn't - this one was definitely full or corn. Also I was overly annoyed by the use and talk of other movies - too too many references, let's find a plot somewhere. The two new bad guys: Mini-Me and Fat Bastard were outstanding. They added a lot to the film's comedy. The movie ended in a definite set-up up for a third film - I really do not want them to do a third film. Some of the really really really funny jokes from the first one were made overdone this time - the key rule to a sequel is breaking new ground. There was no ground broken here. The Sshh becoming Zip-it was the best carryover joke, and the best new joke was finding other words for the male genitalia. Go see the movie - it's a nice laugh, try not to expect to much because that will ruin it for you - just see it as a comedy. And if anyone from NEW LINE is here please promise me this... if you promise to continue the series - do it well, not just for money and empty laughs... do it for new grounds and good laughs.</fullReview>

It gave me a nasty flashback to the crushingly unfunny 'Pink Panther' films as I watched joke after joke after joke after joke fail miserably thanks to endless repetition and a complete lack of comedic timing.This time Austin has his mojo stolen by a time travelling Dr. Evil and so zips back in time to get it back and stop his plan to build a laser weapon on the moon. The point of the first movie was to poke fun at Bond films, but without that focus this one scrambles around in the dust looking for laughs that aren't there. It's unbelievable just how unfunny this is: gags from the original are reused mercilessly, and what's new to this film is run into the ground by being repeated, which is even more irritating than before because they aren't funny in the first place. And the pacing is just wrong, it's off.The only laugh in the whole thing is Verne Troyer's hilarious screaming ('Eeeeeeeee!'). That's literally the only funny part. Heather Graham seems disconnected from the material and has forgotten how to do comedy, while the rest of the cast embarrass themselves by reciting jokes that hit the floor with a deafening thud. Absolutely terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw that movie and it was Hilarius. Mike Myers as Austin Powers, Dr Evil, and Fat Bastard where hysterical. Heather Graham as Felicity Shagwell was cute. Michael York as Basil Exposition was brilliant. What the heck would Dr Evil Steal Austin Power's mojo because he wants to be evil. Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissina was excellent. Verne Troyer as Mini Me was funny. Seth Green as Scott Evil was really not nice. Robert Wagner as Number 2 was brilliant. Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello did perfect with this song called what do you get when you fall in love. Kristen Johnston as was stupid. This movie is Hilarius you will like this movie because it's Hilarius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AUSTIN POWERS THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is one of the best movies of all time. Very Entertaining, laugh-out-loud comedy and groovy baby!!! The Spy who shagged me is the best film out of the three Austin Powers films. This is a film, Mike Myers should be very proud of. In THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, Austin time-travels to the year 1969, where Dr. Evil has stolen Austin's body-fluid "Mojo" which makes Austin attract the opposite sex, without his Mojo, Austin is left powerless. Teaming up with a sexy CIA agent named Felicity Shagwell, Austin sets out to stop Dr. Evil who is holding Washington DC for ransom, and he plans to wipe out Washington DC with a laser gun on the moon, if the President does not pay the ransom. I laughed every minute throughout the movie. The moment where Dr. Evil is on THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW and gets into a fight with Jerry Springer made me wet myself with laughter and especially when Mini-Me beats the s*** out Austin. What makes THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME such a great film is all the hilarious moments, music and action. Heather Graham was extremely sexy as Felicity and i think Felicity Shagwell deserves to have her own spin-off feature film, Verne Troyer did a good supporting role as Mini-Me and he makes the character very lovable, The hilarious moments with Dr. Evil are comic classics, and the scene where Heather is in the bikini which is a tribute to Dr. No is a moment not to forget. THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is one of my all-time favorite movies. I think it deserves a score of 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It was very funny; funnier than the first and the third. Mike Myers is back as Austin, Dr. Evil, and now, Fat Bastard(a big fat slob who thinks he's dead sexy). These characters make the movie very funny. Other funny actors are Heather Graham as Felicity Shagwell, Mindy Sterling as Frau, Seth Green as Scott, and Verne Troyer as Mini-Me, Dr. Evil's 1/8 sized clone who gives the middle finger to people he hates, especially Scott. This movie also contains many famous celebrities such as Rebecca Romijn-Stamos(model and wife to Full House star John Stamos), Willie Nelson(singer), Woody Harrelson(Cheers), Jerry Springer(The Jerry Springer Show), Jeff Garlin(Curb Your Enthusiasm), a return appearence of Will Ferrell(Saturday Night Live), and Clint Howard(Austin Powers 1). This movie contains many very funny scenes including the beginning scene when Austin finds out Vanessa is a fem-bot, Dr. Evil on The Jerry Springer Show, and the two scenes with Clint Howard, where you see the rocket that looks like a huge penis(where you see people saying words associated with penis, look up into the sky, and say something about the rocket, when all of a sudden, you see someone calling people or shouting out stuff that are associated with the word).As I said, this movie is funny and anyone who hasn't seen it should see it, because they will laugh their ass off!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mike needs to learn to quit when he's ahead...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I came to Austin Powers II with a great sense of hope for the film and for Mike Myers. I argued long and hard that AP was one of the best comedies to come out of the 1990s, and I hoped that AP2 would be superior. The early word on the film was that it was enjoyable and even funnier than the first incarnation. The early word was wrong. Instead of a "real" caricature of the swinging sixties, we are subjected to a long series of bad jokes that don't know when to quit. Austin is wholly ridiculous, and any "conflict" that might exist between Felicity and Austin, Dr. Evil and Austin, Fat Bastard and Austin, or really any one character and another is ultimately irrelevant. The knowing look at the audience before Austin goes back in time as Basil and he discuss the confusion of time travel is almost a knowing joke on the audience: "Yeah, so what if it's asinine... but we talk about poop!" Har-har... the genius, the wit, and the humanity in the original are lost. Myers takes the good sequences from the original and ruins them, blundering blindly as he breaks continuity like it's going out of fashion as quickly as the rocket sight gag. The Austin in this film is completely unlike the Austin we came to care for in the first film. Austin is callous, uncaring, and unsophisticated. The cool outside that was used to hide an inner nervous boy in the first film is lost (compare the scene with Alotta versus the scene with Ivana)... Austin has no respect, no concern, and no idea of how uncool he has become in the hands of his deluded creator. The extended music videos might have been nice cut scenes for the DVD, but they really had no place in the film. One gets the feeling that one is watching a big budget SNL skit, complete with "guest appearances" and funnies that aren't, just like SNL. The movie ends up being a film that elicits only a few chuckles and an empty feeling at the end... The whole story was for naught, because Austin really didn't need to do anything... The fact that so many audience members LOVE this film is no proof of its merit... People loved The Waterboy. Thus, these two films stand as testaments to the dumbing-down of America. Mike Myers proves again that he can come up with a good idea and still find a way to ruin it with a sequel. To think there's going to be a third... let's hope Mike decides to go back to his roots and re-evaluate his bastardization of one of the more interesting comic characters in memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Follow-up to 1997's "Austin Powers International Man Of Mystery" has Dr. Evil back from space, using a time-machine to travel back to 1969 in hopes of finishing off super-spy Austin Powers for good. Colorful but extremely thin comedy spoofs everything '60s (from "Barbarella" to "The Thomas Crown Affair"); while these are endearing targets, the film has more dead space than hilarity, and the barest minimum of a plot. The first film was about the building up of a crazy leading character; he was fun and the slapstick surrounding him was affectionate and happy. This sequel is just an excuse for Mike Myers (in three roles) to cut up; the character of Austin is no longer explored as much as he is exploited (and exploits himself). As Fat Bastard, Myers is terrifically, grossly hilarious, but Dr. Evil is already starting to wear out his welcome. The movie is just a lightweight doodle, entertaining enough yet a big step down from its predecessor. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original sequel to "Austin Powers" is about like the first one. It relies on gross-out jokes and stupid situations to entertain the audience. This installment is just slightly better than the original, but overall it is another waste of time and film. Dr. Evil (Myers) returns again and has a miniature version of himself as well. Sophomoric, dumb, stupid and worthless cinematically speaking. Somehow a box office monster in 1999. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no question to the talent of Mike Myer. This time out he plays three characters in this self penned sequel. This is really not my type of comedy, but I did laugh a few times. The jokes that were not funny, were just plain sick. Most of the visual comedy was of the 'bathroom humor' variety.Dr. Evil creates a time machine; so he can go back to the sixties and steal Power's 'mojo', the elixir that makes groovy chicks crave him. The hip music and colorful sets were a plus for this aimless romp.The cast was made up of diverse talent: Heather Graham, Elizabeth Hurley, Robert Wagner, Rob Lowe and Michael York.Keep your eyes on this Austin Powers guy, with his 'mojo' working, he could 'shag' your cat. Groovy, Baby!</fullReview>

I gave it a solid "8" rating - "4" for the acting and story line, and "12" of "10" for witty silliness, for my average of "8".Heather Graham is wonderful.

		<shortDescription>Funny But Nasty 'R-Rated' Look At The Stupid '60s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I get a perverse kick out of the other deliberately-stupid humor of these "Austin Powers" movies. They are extremely bright and colorful - photography- wise, but full of dark comedy moments as well as light-hearted slapstick. Best of all, they poke fun at the ludicrous 1960s lifestyle, particularly in England. Many people may think they glorifying the hedonism of the period, and maybe that's the case, but find it more of a satire and see it that way.What I don't like, however, is the rating of this film and the others as PG-13. How typical of sick Hollywood, pandering these and the other Powers movies to the teen crowd. They are filled with nothing but sex, sex, and more sex. Even the term "shag," is British for "f--k." I mean, they don't even try to be subtle anymore. Rate it R, stick to it, and let the adults have fun with all the innuendos, puns, cleavage, penis jokes, and general pagan lifestyles of the 1960s.Mike Myers does a good job playing several over-the-top roles. Sometimes he's better off saying nothing, just opening up his mouth with that stupid grin and horrible teeth. That usually gets a laugh. The other two Powers were better because this was too mean-edged and too profane.I would imagine that Myers and the Austin Powers films in general were either loved or hated by whomever is viewing it. I get a lot of humor out of these because I don't take them seriously and look at it more as making fun of the moronic attitudes of the late '60s more than anything else. Great fun....for adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot once again is daft and while Heather Graham is really pretty she isn't quite in the same league as Elizabeth Hurley. That said, it is a fun, witty and sophisticated "shagadelic" sequel, that is literally like a lava-lamp lampoon that is stupid and as sophisticated as the first film. It isn't as good as a film to the first, but I think where it is improved from its predecessor is that it is more relaxed in style. Once again, the sets and costumes are gorgeous to look at, the soundtrack is funky and takes you back to the period and there are many moments of sparkling wit in the script. The film also moves quickly while being more relaxed at the same time. The performances from Mike Myers, Michael York and Rob Lowe are top notch too. Overall, a tad inferior, but a fun sequel nonetheless. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The spy spoof hero returns for a very good sequel. Mike Myers returns as Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and a new and very funny character called Fat Bastard. Dr. Evil has gone back in time to 1969 two years after Austin was frozen and sent Fat Bastard to steal his "Mojo". Without it, Austin is helpless in the future. So Austin goes back in time to catch Dr. Evil with the help of the gorgeous Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). A very funny sequel. One of the best bits is seeing Mini Me (Verne Troyer) for the first time. The other two funniest bits are the rocket that looks like a penis, and the shadows in the tent. Also starring Michael York as Basil Exposition, Robert Wagner as Number Two, Rob Lowe as Young Number Two, Seth Green as Scott Evil, Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissina and Elizabeth Hurley as a quick Vanessa. Look out for appearances by Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello, Jerry Springer, Tim Robbins and Woody Harrelson. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup, and the Golden Globe for Best Song for Madonna's "Beautiful Stranger". Mike Myers was number 46 on The Comedians' Comedian. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AUSITN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME (1999) **1/2 Starring: Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Seth Green, Elisabeth Hurly, Robert Wagner, Verne Troyer Director: M. Jay Roach 95 minutes 1999 Rated PG-13 (for comic sexual material and crude humor) By Blake French &amp; Tharyn Taylor: "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" is a little better than the original Austin Powers. Unfortunately, "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" was quite bad. And naturally, as with all sequels, if the first was bad, the second can't be a whole lot better. While the anticipation of this film was really big, and it does offer several hilarious sequences, the film just doesn't have enough to break though the handicap plot the original has set for it.  The film had some really big laughs during certain parts. One of them has Austin and Felicity inside a lit tent in the dark. Felicity pulls weird things from a duffel bag while Austin bends over for some reason. The scene turns into some very funny material. Another hilarious sequence happens as Austin Powers and Dr. Evil's side kick Mini-me have a combat in a spaceship. "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" is a mismatched comedy, one that could have been so much better if the filmmakers and director M. Jay Roach would have inserted less plot and fewer characters and added more slapstick/perverted humor. As it stands "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" is a little above average, but not quite enough to recommend. Brought to you by New Line Cinema</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found nothing funny or inventive about this juvenile collection of bathroom humor inspired nonsense. I enjoy a gross joke if it's clever and well told, but this movie left me feeling puzzled. Should I have laughed at the midget thrown into a steel pole, the unhappy fat man, the predictable sexual jokes, or Austin's stool sample drinking prowess?The kid in front me (the one picking his nose) seemed to think the entire movie was hilarious. I guess he's too young to have read much bathroom wall graffiti- or he would have recognized the tired old script showing on the big screen.</fullReview>
