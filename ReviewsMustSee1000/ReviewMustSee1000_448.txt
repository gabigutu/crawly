		<shortDescription>Severely underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Way ahead of it's time. If you can come up with a story based in a single room and make it as engaging and exciting as this one... you deserve to be frozen and preserved for future teaching of inspiring film makers. This is a fantastic film and I'm glad Jodie Foster was available for the lead when Nicole Kidman got knocked up and bailed. I loved the off-character casting of Jared Leto and the unbelievable casting of Dwight Yoakam... DWIGHT YOAKAM. Everything worked. Another great, and yet again... underrated film by David Fincher. How long is it going to take for an established directed like Fincher to take a chance and roll the dice on trying to make a script like this work again? ...No one has the guts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted action-thriller, weak conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher directs this cleverly conceived thriller about a mother and daughter trapped inside a panic room by three criminals. The film is well-paced and the camera work is slick. The film does well in exploring the confines of the house. Jodie Foster is effective and maintains a high intensity throughout. Kristen Stewart is decent as her daughter. Forest Whitaker plays a slightly sympathetic criminal and does well. Unfortunately, after an engrossing game of cat and mouse, the conclusion is weak. Staple clichés crop up and the film goes for a crowd-pleasing finale that doesn't quite feel right. Still watchable.Overall 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nothing makes sense in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I like the idea of the panic room, but the room itself has to be much better than the one in the movie. And too many things in the movie that do not make sense: (POSSIBLE SPOILERS, so do not read on if you dont' want to be spoiled, but the movie is SO predictable anyway)1. You call 911 and get placed on hold after you tell them your address and it's an emergency? 2. Cell phones don't work in the room? If it was a room designed for the purpose as described in the beginning of the movie, shouldn't cell phones be usable in it? 3. Isn't it obvious to just kill all the surveilance cameras all over the house so people in the room won't know what you're doing? 4. Can't Jodie Foster tell the cops something or signal something since she was in the room before and should know they can't hear her from inside the room? 5. How can someone get smashed in the head like that not only not die, but still has the power to wrestle someone down and try to kill her? etc.etc. please write a better script next time Fincher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly predictable and dumb... I cannot Believe Jodie is here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love Jodie. I heard that she had rejected Hannibal millions dollars job offer because its script was stupid. So what in the Earth made her accept working in this piece of garbage called Panic Room? Forest Whitaker is a great actor too. I cannot believe both of them appear here! I would give no stars to this movie, but these 2 great actors make me save their performance.Producers made a big mistake with the casting. Probably they spent all the money paying Jodie and Forest, so they put only garbage actors to complete the group. This is not unusual. The masked criminal does not look menacing without his mask at all. And the little girl is cute and a good actress but she seems a boy. In fact, when I watched the trailer I thought it was a boy! She not only seems a boy because of her haircut but because she has boys manners!***spoilers ahead***The storyline is stupid from the very first minute. Anyway the movie was good at first specially because the camera amazing movements and CGI. After the bad guys break into the house everything is very predictable, full of plot holes and it goes only to show the characters stupidity:1- Why do they get a house so big while they are only 2 small people? This house is for about 5 people! Without live-in help it is impossible to have that house clean!2- There are lots of noises when the guys first talk takes place, they even shout (in lower voice), Meg cannot sleep, she is wide awake but she does not hear ANYTHING.3- Why the guys do not leave the girls alone trapped inside the elevator if what they want is in the panic room?4- The 911 never put you on hold, and if so, I might think they are able to track your call and send an unit.5- The fire thing is no real. Gas does not remain in the ceiling and also the carafe outside should have exploited burning the 3 criminals and the explosion should be noisy enough to alert neighbors.6- It is incredible that both mom and daughter do not wonder what the criminals want from the room and try to negotiate.7- At first it is impossible to talk from outside to inside, but later it is! Sounds strange that the big guy who built the room does not know about the intercom and this new owner does.8- At the end, it is stupid that Burnham comes back to the house because he hears a shout, the police sirens were sounded nearby already. Also it is stupid that Burnham let the bank bonds go with the wind, because he could have raised his hands keeping the papers in his jacket.I will not continue with plot holes because it would be endless, but I have to say that I am tired of "Terminator skills" at the end of all thrillers. How can I guy survive while he has a hand damaged, he is hammered on the head and he fell one floor down? He still has a supernatural strength to fight 3 people! As I said all the movie is predictable from the start to the end. If you watch this movie with someone else I suggest a guessing game and probably you will guess everything! For example, what do you think a neighbor will do if someone in front is bothering him with flashing lights? I understand the Morse code idea, but face it... only a few among regular people get it.Another thing, the finale is tasteless... I felt saying "And where is the panic that appeared in the movie title?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Panic Room: High-octane excitement with many clever surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In her first suspense-thriller since her Academy-Award winning turn in "The Silence of the Lambs", Jodie Foster registers quite well as middle-aged New Yorker Meg Altman, who moves into an EXTREMELY spacious brownstone with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart), a diabetic tomboy. The building is equipped with a special shelter designed in the event of a break-in, known as a 'panic room'. Meg and Sarah waste no time in putting the claustrophobic area to use (on their first night, no less) when a trio of burglars (Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam) make their way into her building to retrieve a large sum of money. The catch is that the burglars' stash is in the very room in which Meg and her daughter are hiding! While 'Panic Room' is not exactly white-knuckle suspense, it definitely has its moments, especially the heart-pounding moment when Meg leaves the panic room to grab her cell phone, and the the tension-building scene when Whitaker and Yoakam enter the panic room when Foster leaves. The only main plot hole is clear in the very beginning: Why would a recently separated woman with one child want to purchase a four-story brownstone? What does she need all of that space for? Besides that, 'Panic Room' is an intelligently written and directed thriller from director David Fincher (Fight Club). The only characters that don't make sense are Meg's friend in the opening scenes and her husband (Ann Magnuson and Patrick Bauchau). They both seem hopelessly unnecessary; otherwise, 'Panic Room' is a first-rate thriller with similarities to several shockers of the early 1990s, 'Unlawful Entry' (1992) being one in particular. Whitaker has to be one of the nicest thieves in recent film history!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A one-trick plot, but amazing camera, intense acting, and tightly made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic Room (2002)There are three reasons to see Panic Room. 1) The titles: understated, gorgeous, uncanny letters floating in the Manhattan cityscape. 2) The photography: camera moving like an animal, slipping between tiny spaces, swinging across rooms and through floors, inhabiting the screen like another character. 3) Forest Whitaker, again (he's so good so often it's hard to not expect a great performance).The rest of the film is very good, directed with style and intelligence as usual by David Fincher (who did Seven and Fight Club). The plot is good, but maybe a little conventional overall, and if the details aren't completely predictable, the general flow of events is. The whole cast is quite good--Foster in a familiar embattled, determined role, and Jared Leto is an appropriately crazed, if slightly caricatured, bad guy who just wants money. Don't we all.I saw this when it came out and was dazzled and yet disappointed by the plot. The second time, knowing the events, I was able to just watch how they unfolded, and it was much better. Expect suspense, intensity, and beautiful camera-work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating and tedious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting and cinematography in this film are excellent. (Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker are particularly good.) But, this is one of those movies where everyone is SCREAMING at the screen to do some really obvious things. (I have included some examples in the "SPOILER" section below.) I know that this film is trying to lure you in and "feeeeeel" Jodie's pain, but when she can't even make simple, obvious choices to help herself I can no longer empathize with her. I think, "She deserves to be stuck in there, she's just too stupid to be out roaming the streets with the rest of us."Some of the camera shots are incredible and the timing of the movie is phenomenal. You do manage to stay at the edge of your seat without a lot of TENSE music added to force you there. Really, the movie is good, but the plot stinks.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!An example of how STUPID Jodie's character is. In the trailers for the film they show this very creepy scene where the bad guys hold up a sign reading "What we want is in that room." Now, does Jodie say "what is it?" or "how about I put it outside the door, you take it and then leave". NOPE, nothing....the film doesn't even address that fact. Later, it ends up being a stupid floor safe containing bonds. That's another thing, she is in this tiny, tiny room making McGuyver-esque use of everything and she doesn't notice a safe under the area rug????????</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb, huge plot holes, laughable dialog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic Room must be a comedy. It's not supposed to be a comedy. But because of its silly plot full of holes and ridiculous dialog, it turns out to be unintentionally funny.Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam and Jared Leto play a trio of robbers that makes the Three Stooges look smart. They resemble the hapless burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in Home Alone. Only this time it's Jodie Foster and Kristen Stuart who are home alone when the three goofballs break into their home to steal the millions of dollars hidden in the Panic Room. That's a vault room that the previous owner had built into the house. It's so safe that no one can break into it. It has its own phone and electrical system, its own air filtration system and surveillance cameras to see every room in the house. And guess who helped build it. Forest Whitaker, one of the robbers. This movie is so dumb. Here are just a few of the many glaring errors:1. Whitaker is able to pump propane gas into the room, even though it has its own ventilation system. He does this simply by knocking a hole in the drywall. The room itself is encased in concrete and steel.2.He's also tries to tap into a phone cable, which, get this, is sticking out of a jack in the wall and which, get this, Jodie Foster manages to, in the nick of time, yank out of the wall even though she is in the panic room. 3. The hapless robbers seal the house so that no one can get in or out. But, who happens to appear? Foster's husband. That's right. He manages to just appear in the foyer even though they have locked up the house tight and sealed the doors with screws. 4. How about the fact that large tools appear from nowhere such as the drill press which Whitaker uses to drill into the safe. Why would anyone go to all the trouble to put a safe in a Panic Room yet the safe is so weak you can drill into it? Beats me. 5. Foster's daughter who it turns out goes into diabetic coma and needs an injection. This certainly came out of the blue.In short, Panic Room is one of the stupidest movies in recent memory. It is not just stupid, it's incredibly stupid. The dialog is absolutely so bad it's a hoot. The plot is so full of holes you'll be laughing your butt off.Too bad. I love Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker. They have an immense amount of talent. They should never have been in this total piece of rubbish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING **** CONTAINS SPOILERSWhen will the critics quit being so polite to David Fincher. I hear he's a heck of guy, and really swell at parties but this was weak. And how did anyone give David Koepp $4 mil for this piece of garbage. I've seen this movie at least a million times and usually on TV for free!!! Don't studio execs watch movies these days.First of all, I want to know where the audiences were that were on the edge of their seats - because that theater needs bigger chairs. The audience I saw this stinker with didn't make a peep the whole time except for the occasional groan. Forget that the film was boring. Forget that the biggest drama in the whole movie wasn't about whether anyone was going to get in or out of the panic room - but rather whether a young girl is going to get her insulin shot - talk about a cheap plot twist - and the ridiculous sub B-movie twitching that she was order to do - (when someone is slipping into a coma they don't flop around like someone in a low rent sci-fi flick) - what the H was the deal with that ending!!!SPOILER ****Am I really supposed to believe that a skinny little dude like Dwight Yokum - almost has his hand severed in the door - loses about a pint of blood - then gets hit in the head with a sledgehammer at full force - falls down a flight of stairs and can still get up and kick Jodi Foster's ass - even though she hasn't been hurt in the entire film - (everyone else gets beat up but not her) - Jeez - that's straight out of Jim Bob Briggs-land. And as far as the twist that Forrest Whittaker comes back and saves the day - well it might have a little punch if it wasn't so telegraphed in the moments before he entered the room. I mean I've seen it before - but did Fincher really have to show him turning his head to hear the noise inside and then hesitate on the fence!!!!! Lame - lame - lame!!!People (and I include myself here) we are never going to get decent films if we keep accepting garbage like this and then defending it because we're told it comes with a pedigree. This is the same movie we've seen for years. Whether it's a thriller or a slasher film (and they are really becoming the same thing at this point) we keep getting B-grade drivel. And we as an audience keep accepting it. And until we say enough is enough this is what we will get!Boycott drivel now.</fullReview>

This new film has another very good performance by Jodie Foster but the acting standout of the film has to go to Dwight Yoakam with awesome performance as Raoul.

		<fullReview>At best, Panic Room is mediocre entertainment. A part from the slick direction. Panic has a bland plot, annoying characters, especially the girl, who I couldn't tell was a boy or a girl at first. Stupid situations, how she could get in and out of the room so easily.SpoilersUnrealistic characters, I mean there is no robber in the world who would have helped the daughter and then save both the mother and daughter in the end, losing the money. More lifeless entertainment from hollywood. Disappointing coming from David Fincher.

		<fullReview>This movie is a nice piece of work! Those expecting or needing an edgy film ala Seven or Fight Club, don't bother. This movie does not pretend or intend to be what it is not. The camera work is great, the photography is great, and the acting is note-perfect given the script.Nothing over-ambitious and the Fincher flick with the most appropriate running time and the least false notes so far. This is a classic thriller, much better than the negative reviews from other people led me to believe.The photography is perfect for the movie. That includes the virtual camera work. Yes it looks like a David Fincher movie, but no it is not intentionally depressing and ugly as his others. The lighting works with the settings (3am in a huge house.)Yes it's violent, that's why it's R rated. No, it's not something you'll necessarily want to watch a second time. This 90 very entertaining minutes of "now what's gonna happen"?So suspend your disbelief a tad, sit back, and be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Panic inside and outside the room!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PANIC ROOM is a suspense thriller quite different from what I was expecting since I thought it would be something in the Horror genre, but no, it isn't, the plot is about a robbery that three guys try to do to a house with a panic room (I think it was the this title which induced me in error, because panic room is a protection room to the owners of the house). So, it was different from what I was expecting but I liked it anyway because it's a great thriller, very suspenseful and very well shot. The setting is always the house but it doesn't turn out boring because it has a good pace with very little slow moments. About the cinematography I enjoyed the camera work which is excellent (especially in the first hour when they shot incredible details and the camera does a "travelling effect") and the light (almost the entire film is shot with little illumination, which makes it a suspenseful dark thriller, which I use to appreciate!:). The acting is also very good. I did enjoy it and I score it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With "Panic Room" Fincher Does It AGAIN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was leery after seeing the first trailer for Panic Room, but as I saw it each time I noticed something I liked about it. First, the story looked okay, but then I realised Forrest Whitaker was in it (usually a great sign!) and then I saw Jared Leto and noticed Dwight Yokam's name in the credits, and I was ready to see it. Then I realized this was the new David Fincher film, and I was HOOKED! I loved Seven, Fight Club, and I even admired Alien3, simply because of Fincher. The movie is fantastic, full of twists, turns and jolts. The performance of Jared Leto was awesome. His character was funny and seemed to hold the action together. Jodie Foster is great, as usual, and Kristen Stewart was very good as the Sarah (although from the trailers, it was hard to tell if it was a boy or girl...)and Dwight and Forrest were great as well. This is the best suspense film in a while, and Fincher once again proves he is at the top of his profession! "Go see Panic Room!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Say What? The script's the thing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched part of this film on 'Rogers Pay-TV' after seeing the nifty trailer on iTunes. About 15 minutes in, I wished I'd spent my $3 on a really good cup of coffee instead! Then, I started to read the reviews here at IMDb and realized that I was witnessing a murder in progress--a murder of the suspense-thriller genre.Since the camera work and cast are first class, how does one create such a muddled flick? Simple: the script. High school kids can't really act, but when they perform 'Oklahoma' or 'Fiddler on the Roof', the presentation is usually passable. Why? good script.There is no camera work at a live presentation of one of Shakespeare's plays, even using unknown but gifted performers - yet the final product is generally intriguing. Why? good script.A compelling actor like Hugh Laurie, Anthony Hopkins, Ralph Fiennes, or {fill in name of your fav American actor here - don't want to hurt your feelings - you get my point} could sit in a chair and stare at a live audience, or at a single camera for 2 hours - you'd be spellbound if they spin a good yarn, but only if they had a good script.But without a script, even the best actors toil in futility. Forest Whitaker is always brilliant. Jody Foster has 'A'-list talent. Jared Leto plays a good 'bizarro-type' (try his understated performance in 'Switchback' with Danny Glover) and Dwight Yoakam has the chops to 'weird you out' in bit roles (made me shudder in 'Sling Blade'). How could such a roster produce this piece of junk? Bad script. A revealing clue that the writer tanked the screenplay is when the bad guys show up and start cursing for no particular reason. The 'script' probably reads 'the bad guys show up and start cursing for no particular reason'.The array of dumb things in this film, listed here at IMDb, seems endless, but I'll add one more (apologies if someone got it before): Jody and daughter are using a flashlight to signal a sleeping neighbor for help,100 yards away. He wakes up, looks out his window and.... and.....and... they stop flashing the SOS and they begin to holler 'Help Help Help' (through a rainstorm). He can't hear. He goes back to sleep. Darn it - I hate it when that happens.Finally - looking for a good cast, nifty camera work, decent performance, and forgivable minor slips in logic? try 'Red Eye'! the difference? good script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is utter utter total crap, I couldn't even be bothered to watch the end of it, though half did (the end is the ultimate in crap endings). Its the kind of film playing on the siege mentality done to perfection in 'zombies dawn of the living dead', except that in this film, the loose ends and unreality get to the point where halfway through you just wanna scream at the screen and go 'oh yer - how realistic that is - not!'. To be honest I half expected donald duck and mickey to knock at the door.Now for some brief examples and possible spoilers so stop if you wannna actual suffer and see this movie with no for knowledge. OK here we go. A woman who learns all camera positions in 24 hours all of which just happen to be at head height (though don't appear that way on the monitors), a door that stops when it detects an obstacle that conveniently forgets that one time, people who can survive sledge hammers and falling 30 feet. Sure if the people concerned were affiliates of buffy, but they were meant to be regular guys. There are many others (the fire!, the phone!) For me the very nature of this film as with say oceans eleven or the score which are somewhat similar is that it covers all angles in the clever plot so there are no loose ends. This was so loose and unbelievable that it unraveled before me and half way through just left me idiot spotting how crap the script was. Can I score this with a negative number it is total worthless garbage. I HATED IT WITH A PASSION. How did this get 7.4/10 on imdb? It must be fixed, it got the same as 'naked' ? yer right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room was one of the lamest "thrillers" I've ever seen. I scare easily, and I was never on the edge of my seat. The bathrooms in the theater I visited were far more of a horror than the Panic Room. Jodie Foster wasn't given a chance to shine in this mediocre film. I felt the movie lacked an interesting plot. I was expecting numerous plot twists with this movie being a "thriller," but I was sorely disappointed. Just a warning for anyone who plans on seeing the movie, I don't think this is a spoiler, but I guess it was one of the only "surprises" in the movie... the girl stuck in the room has diabetes and needs her insulin! I didn't see that one coming a mile away, not even after we were shown her insulin monitor in one of the first scenes. I'm surprised Jodie Foster didn't start having an asthma attack, or even better a "panic attack" as she worried about her daughter because that's the sort of lame thing that would happen in this movie. Panic Room was one of the most predictable and unentertaining movies I have ever seen. I came into the movie with high expectations, and I left glad that I had only wasted $5.25 on the movie instead of $8.</fullReview>

This movie takes that definition of a hiding place to an entire new level, as it is fingernail-biting to see the protagonists shield themselves in a safe room from the antagonists, attempting to protect themselves from harm and, at the same time, trying to figure out what the bad guys want.Filmed with non-stop thrills, action and adventure, this crime thriller will surely give you an edge-of-your-seat entertainment, save from some lame acting moments.Grade B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple Tight Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director David Fincher lays out a tight simple thriller. It takes place all in and around the house. Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) is recently divorced and buying a house in the Upper West Side of Manhattan. It has a panic room. On their first night in the house, they get invaded by three criminals (Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, Jared Leto) intend on getting something from the previous owner left in the panic room. Only Meg and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) get there first.Fincher has striped away all the unnecessary filler from the story. It's a simple cat and mouse game. Nothing could be simpler. Even at almost 2 hours, there isn't a slow moment. All the actors get their fair share. Jodie and Forest lead the cast, but Jared and Kristen also shine. I wouldn't say this was the greatest or the most original. It is simply a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minimal But Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In slasher flicks like Scream (1996), break-ins are single scenes. Heist flicks like The Bank Job (2008) or The Score (2001) spend most of the films planning out the break-ins, and then only a scene or two actually carrying them out. So the fact that aside from the very beginning, Panic Room is just really one long break-in scene always made the film seem like a silly waste of time. I mean, it gives the whole plot away right in the title. A couple of thieves arrive and tear up the place, the family hides, problems occur. Hurray.The coincidence of everything just-so-happening to be available at the exact right time: the happenstance of the break-in coinciding with the idea that the house just so happens to contain a panic room, this seems too much to handle.Yet all the mighty forces align and provide the viewer with an experience that is actually quite satisfying. Although not an overly complicated plot, the script is very well written and includes explanations for exactly why these happenings occur as they do.For skeptic viewers like me, who usually find unexplainable exceptional coincidences a deal breakers, David Keopp's logical, explanatory script (Jurassic Park, Mission Impossible) provides answers, and an excellent foundation for David Fincher to build his dark mess. (IMDB says Keopp got 4 million bucks for the script, so?.).Seemingly, this film takes the primal fear of invasion, bad people coming into our homes in the night and doing bad things to us. But rather than exploit the concept a has been beaten to death, Panic Room does not rely on the traditional fear of invasion. It adds dimension, reason, even a kind of logic explaining how this whole event could have turned out right for everyone, if only it could have unfolded just a single day earlier.It is in considering the film's simplicity that the profound difficulty of this film's production is most realized. The decision for the director and crew to call "that's a wrap" must have been murky one.Unlike any of Fincher's other films, Panic Room is shot entirely on only one set, in linear time, and deals with only with a single event. It is minimal in its approach, like a play. It is essentially all based on the interaction of the actors stage together, almost.Forest Whitacker, Jodie Foster and even Dwight Yoakam all crank out great performances, but Fincher's dark, perfectly influential shots, using unusual angles, intercoms and video cameras, small vs. open spaces, and of course, darkness and rain are what make this cinema, and not theater. Aligning open frames with great musical peaks, the score by Howard Shore (Lord of the Rings) intensifies the single track plot of Panic Room, pushing it along as a series of arcs, suspensefully running up and down, each arc increasing in intensity, until the film hits the peak, and even though we knew all along what was coming, we are still very satisfied with when it finally does.Get more at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and entertaining thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Panic Room not knowing what to expect, I read nothing about it. I only knew that the cast had award winning actress Jodie Foster known for her role in "Silence of the Lambs". Knowing her from that movie and seeing the cover art of the DVD for Panic Room lead me to think this was a horror movie. I was happily surprised to see that Jared Leto was in the movie because he's a great actor and one of my favorite singers. Forest Whitaker is always good, and it was funny to see a young Kristen Stewart. Kristen is 12 in this movie and she does a surprisingly good job and turns out to be one of the most likable characters. So right off the bat the cast is strong. So the plot is a mom and her daughter move into a new house that has a room that is for emergencies that has a vault like door and monitors on the wall to watch whats going on inside the house. Three robber break in not knowing they moved in. When the robbers first break in one of them named Raoul drops 3 one liners that had me laughing at each one. This movie has several comedic moments that are sure to make you laugh. This movie isn't all jokes though, at times you're at the edge of your seat. It's a great thriller because the situation these people are in could happen to anyone. Well anyone who has an enormous room in their house with screens so you can watch whats going on in every room. You get so attached to the characters in this movie that you really want them to get help. On the other hand though you also like the dialog between the robbers so you don't really want them to be caught. I loved this movie and would suggest it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Panic Room'. Is set in a colossal old 'brownstone' semi in New York.It looks big enough to garrison a regiment, yet an embittered mother and her daughter, mean to live in it all by themselves. It's expensive, but their husband/father - who has apparently run-off with some air-head - is apparently rich enough to foot the bill. In short; it's financial revenge. On the master-bedroom floor is the titular panic-room. It's a mini-fortress, almost impregnable by conventional means and self-sufficient.On their first night, three hoods turn-up to burgle. Unbeknown to mother and daughter, there's a floor-safe in the panic room. It contains what the villains are after.Mother and daughter flee inside before the villains can catch them. A siege ensues.For the most part, I found this a very tense, well-acted piece of drama. It definitely had its moments. Jodi Foster was good as the over-protective mother, Kristen Stewart was adequate as the rebellious daughter. The villains did their villain thing.I was a little nonplussed by the curious lack of colour throughout. It might well have been filmed in black &amp; white. Perhaps it was meant to lend some noirish element; for me it was just inexplicably gloomy.I also enjoyed the fluid nature of the relationship dynamics. The nominal leader who ultimately goes to pieces and gets shot by the hard-man in a ski-mask. Later, after trapping his hand in the panic-room door, he himself is unmasked, gunless, a whimpering impotent. The 'expert' knows the criminal consequences of harming anyone whilst committing the robbery and means to avoid bloodshed at all costs. He, of course, has the most to lose. The police will soon realise that inside knowledge was needed. It can only be a matter of time before enquiries lead to him. He must be long gone without trace, almost proof positive of guilt. Yet he could never bluff it out because the mother and daughter would recognise him. I rather liked the ending, where an overhead helicopter whips all of the multi-million-dollar bearer-bonds into the air.There were a number of irritating little details, but by and large I overlooked these because the rest of the movie was sufficiently worthy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A taut thriller set in one house</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Meg Altman and her daughter Sarah buy a large new home in Manhattan they are surprised to find a steel reinforced safe room in the master bedroom; they certainly didn't think they would need it on their first night in the house. Equally Burnhan, Junior and Raoul; three men who break in hoping to find millions of dollars in a hidden safe had no idea that the house is occupied. Meg and Sarah manage to get into the safe room but there is no way to summon help; as the phone hasn't been reconnected yet. While they are huddled in the room watching the thieves on CCTV the thieves try to figure out how to get them out of the room as the safe is in that room. As the trio of thieves try to figure out how they will get into the room tempers fray.This is a tense thriller where the tensioned is maintained from the moment the thieves break in to the house to the end. This means that while one is watching it is possible to overlook a few questions that will be raised if one thinks about the situation; for example? would the ventilation system of a supposedly safe room be as vulnerable as it was here? The acting was pretty solid; Jodie Foster was as good as one would expect from this fine actress and the young Kristen Stewart was excellent as Sarah; it is of little surprise that she has gone on to become a star in her own right. Of the 'bad guys' Forrest Whitaker put in the best performance although I might think that because his character was the least unpleasant of the three! There are a surprising number of changes of situation throughout the film given that it all takes place within one house which helps keep things interesting. If you are after a gripping thriller that isn't non-stop action then this might be the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having your house broken into is one of the scariest things that could happen. You feel violated and lose that feeling of security. So many films have depicted this event. Few are as frighteningly real as 'Panic Room.' A sort of modern take on a bomb shelter, these are used to keep intruders out. It was only a matter of time before someone made a film involving one. The final product is roller coaster ride of a Thriller you won't soon forget.Pros: Strong performances. Taut direction. Suspenseful. Great, moody score. Nice cinematography. Perfectly paced. A few really memorable, tension-filled sequences. Some good twists and turns.Cons: Have to suspend disbelief at times. Characters could have used more fleshing out.Final thoughts: David Fincher once again proves that he's a force to be reckoned with. The best Thrillers keep up on the edge and surprise us. Thanks to his steady hand and writer David Koepp's suspenseful script, it's far from routine. Want to have your breath taken away? Kick back and sit through this.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher's often derided thriller demands repeat viewings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meg Altman and her daughter Sarah, move into a vast Brownstone home, this place is unique because it has a panic room, a room of safety from where no intruders can gain access. Sure enough on their first night in their new home, they are forced to flee to the room as three intruders break in to the house, but trouble is is that what the intruders want is in the panic room itself.From the off we know that Panic Room is going to be oozing David Fincher stylishness, the opening credits sprawled across the Manhattan skyscrape like advertising billboards, perfectly set the tone for the movie to follow. I personally think that following on from the harshness and ingenuity of Fight Club, many were surprised at the simplicity of Panic Room's structure, this is after all a straight forward cat and mousery thriller set in one foreboding building. Yet Fincher gains much claustrophobia from such a large building setting, managing to rack up the tension in every reel. Yet the film, in spite of the oppressive nature of the story, never sits still either. The action kicks in from the off and thru a series of devilish stunts, it continues thru to the pulse raising finale.The David Koepp screenplay does not seem dark enough on the first viewing, because some of the interplay between the three intruders is actually jocular, but it never loses sight of its thriller heart. Subsequent revisits to the film reveal it to be a tightly constructed character piece, in what is practically a five character story. The real winner in that department is Jodie Foster's Meg Altman, it would have been easy for the character to be ground out as some super heroine, with death defying feats of courage masking her out as wonder woman, but Fincher has her pure and simply as a resourceful human being, fiercely maternal and strong and intelligent she may be, but at her core she remains fallible, and with that she becomes believable. The other big plus point in the film is Fincher's use of the house, where his camera glides about like a phantom, a ghostly observer to the unfolding proceedings. In and out of locks and coffee pots, up and down stairs, and tracking the movements of the intruders, Fincher isn't showing off, he's putting us the viewer into the mix as well.Cast are very good, Jodie Foster, Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and a surprisingly potent Dwight Yoakam all come together very well under Fincher's watchful eye, whilst young Kristen Stewart as Sarah puts much emotive heart into a role that could so easily have been too syrupy approaching the final act. Yes it's fair to say that one has to suspend disbelief, this is after all a home invasion thriller following a true course, but in Fincher's hands it rises above cliché to thrive on atmospherics and character dynamics. Well put together and big on ticking time bomb tension, Panic Room gets better on repeat viewings. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't feel like Panic Room stood up to Fincher's previous lovable monsters (The Game, Seven, and Fight Club) but it was certainly better than what most people claim it to be. This movie has an incredible cast, a grouping that I wouldn't think could have played off of each other so well, but Fincher made it work nicely. After reading on who was originally cast, I applaud Fincher for going with Jodie Foster, she's dead on excellent in 'most' of her roles and is very believable in this film. To me, though, Kristen Stewart and Jerod Leto steal the scenes until the end where Dwight and Forrest really step out of the shadows and perform brilliantly! Take this movie for what you will, but the idea of it on top of the excellent direction makes it a classic thriller in the path of mid-era Hitchcock films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only way i could have had a minute of pleasure watching "Panic room" is if the "good bad guy"(always an interesting point of departure but totally unexploited here) got away with the money.Fincher obviously prefers morals to pleasure (a quality for a priest, a heavy load for a hollywood filmmaker). I guess even one minute of pleasure is too much to expect out of a Fincher movie. "Pleasure", (visual, intellectual or even physical), isn't that what a movie should bring to the viewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A major flaw!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plse note: spoilers below! I would have considered this movie to be a mediocre to fair thriller if not for one major flaw which ruined the whole movie for me. This flaw was the injection scene. Anyone who knows anything about diabetes knows that when someone is suffering from low blood sugar and verging on going into a coma the last thing you would do is inject them with insulin (which would just cause them to go into a coma that much faster and very likely kill them). Even if the syringe contained a sugar solution the film-makers should have known that to be the least bit effective this would have to have been injected directly into the blood stream not into stomach tissue. Not only is it insulting to diabetics everywhere that the film-makers couldn't even be bothered to get the facts right about this deadly disease, but this depiction could conceivably result in a tragedy. Anyone using this scene as a basic for trying to help someone who is suffering from low blood sugar could end up killing them. Other minor flaws with the movie: how could Forest Whitaker's character have know what Jodie Foster's character was doing when she was trying to ignite the gas, how likely is it that Jodie Foster's character would know how to reconnect the phone, pushing a light sofa in front of the door is not terribly effective in blocking the door which is made clear when Jodie Foster's character had no problem later in the movie in getting the front door open, etc., etc., etc. Very poorly thought out and executed. Shame on you guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THESE COMMENTS As a "suspense thriller" "Panic Room" does its basic job - lots of tension and scares. But in some ways, it isn't scary-thrilling in the same way as many others. Meg and Sarah aren't dealing with invulnerable monsters, nor with genius homicidal maniacs. The bad guys here are seriously flawed - that's the point. One of the three, Junior - the more or less leader, is an emotional and intellectual dimwit. Raoul has about a dozen more IQ points, but his invented-sinister nature make us rightly wary of him (he enters the picture in a ski mask for effectiveness - Junior calls "Joe Pesci"). Burnham is the genius of the outfit; he had worked on the design of the house's complex security systems and knows the girls' protective strengths and weaknesses. But he is by nature non-violent, unwilling to go all the way to hurt or kill. But together the three are a truly scary potent force, all together possessing: twisted emotions, amorality, and brilliant mind. Their imperfections give them a more realistic unpredictable sinister-ism than the typical scare movie villain. But the girls are flawed too. Meg (Jodie Foster) is recently divorced and is emotionally brittle. Eleven year old Sarah (Kristen Stewart) has serious diabetes. Her blood sugar must be constantly watched with a wrist monitor; over-excitement can send her blood sugar level plummeting, requiring an emergency shot to prevent her slipping into a coma. At the start of the movie, she has more or less alienated herself from her parents; she puts up with them, but is rapidly losing confidence in them. But she possesses a typical naive eleven year old ability to cooly assess situations and possibilities. Her impulsiveness becomes a power. The growth of the characters of Meg and Sarah, individually and together, is the beauty of this movie.MORE SPOILERS AHEAD I've put "Panic Room" down as one of my all-time favorites, and I'm looking forward to its someday DVD release. The characters of regular people Meg and Sarah fit right up there with the best of superheroes. They are human, with human weaknesses, which they rise above, and indeed use, in their battle for life. The panic room starts as a prison for the girls, but is later ironically turned into a prison for the bad guys, who cringe in fear of the intrepid mother. But the story isn't just about politically correct women's empowerment. SPOILER If they escape, it will require the cooperative effort of each of four flawed humans.As usual, Jodie Foster is outstanding as Meg, the brittle single mom who digs deep into her character to find the power required to battle for the life of her child. Kristen Stewart's Sarah is one of the truest depictions of the heart of an eleven year old I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The majority of the movie was not genius or even well thought out...but there was an element of suspense in most of the scenes that I actually did enjoy(although I wonder if it's genuine suspense, or if you feel that way because the actors are doing all but *saying* that's how you should be feeling...) I would have rated the film higher if the ending wasn't such a LETDOWN!!! They waste all this time making Forrest Whitaker into a good-bad guy, with no cherry on top! Does he die? Does he get arrested? Does Jodi save him? All we're left with is Jodi's "I just smelled a fart" look, then BAM! On to finding another flat! No payoff! Sure, some films like to leave the ending open to interpretation...but I don't think this qualifies as a successful attempt at that. Characters are supposed to grow and change by the film's end...in this film we're left at the exact same place we started...with Jodi and her kin seeking a home. Blah, why bother with the rest of the film if their greatest driving force in life is finding a Brownstone? The more I think about it, the more I dislike this movie. I want my two hours back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Screenplay + Bad Directing=Bad Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of Fincher. I love Fight Club, I like Seven and my opinions for his other films vary. His direction was so absurdly horrible, I couldn't help but to be distracted. Almost every shot was unmotivated toward the action; the camera was subjective to the house more than the characters, so the visual aspects dominated the film. Further more, it is my opinion that the visual aspects of the film (Fincher's trademark), were nothing to behold. The lens choices were terrible; extreme wide shots of intense drama on charcters made certain scenes come across phony; the lack of depth of field and very wide lenses, caused shot after shot to have so much 'dead space' in the frame, it seemed painfully obvious the reason was for a claustrophobic mood. As a fan of Fincher, it was a slap in the face to have the amount of product placement abundant (the Cocca Cola scene in the beginning is cringe inducing), when his previous 'Fight Club' basically negated his aesthetic choices in this film. The screenplay was brain dead and gimmicky, mood was so contrived it was shoved down your throat. Maybe Fincher should calm down a bit, understand the meaning of the term subtly and not be so in our face. Just because the camera moves through objects doesn't mean it is well directed, motivation is the key and that was absent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Fincher is a magician of sorts, he should work in a circus. He does things with his gadgets that are quite extraordinary, but, has absolutely no clue about drama. Based on a tiny, thin, invisible script he builds a theme park ride that gets very tired very soon. All of David Fincher's films look terrific, they all have ambitious intentions but they collapse under the poverty of the scripts. "Seven" is the better one, but still, after you get over the magnificent photography, you're left with a formula used and abused for years. "Fight Club" has a first hour that makes you think in you're in for a real treat. With superb performances by Norton, Pitt and Bonham Carter and then a massive let down. "The Game" was mystical, powerful, mysterious and spine chilling for the whole first part but then... They all have that same common denominator, opportunistic, thoughtless and unimaginative writing. That alone alienates the bulk of their potential audiences. Now "Panic Room" the most blatant example of what I'm trying to convey. No matter how brilliant the camera work, where are the characters? Where is the drama? What was with the husband? What about that semi visit by the police? Unforgivable. I should advice Mr. Fincher to look at films with less gadgetry, even less ambition and take note. From William Wyler's "Desperate Hours" to David Miller's "Midnight Lace" or quite simply look at the sort of writers Alfred Hitchcock worked with, without them Mr. Hitchcock would have been a director of the past not the legendary master for all seasons.</fullReview>

Best of all, the film is very suspenseful without being over the top (are you listening Hollywood?). Indeed, this shows how a film can be a pleasure to the mind and not just to the eye.

Compound home invasion, burglary, assault and murder with a second murder with nothing to gain but more jail time? Would any criminal be THAT stupid?

		<shortDescription>A tight thriller that you have probably overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Panic Room" is a well-made, really exciting thriller that stays interesting despite the limited location. This is one of those movies that I had seen years ago when it first came out. I'm not sure if I had simply forgotten or I hadn't realized how great this one was because at the time I was a dumb teenager but it really is terrific. The premise is pretty simple. A single mom (Meg, played by Jodie Foster) and her vulnerable daughter (Sarah, Kristen Stewart) move into a new house. The house comes with a panic room, a place where you can hide in should anything go wrong. A bunch of bad guys (Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam and Jared Leto) break into the place, so Sarah and her daughter hide in the room. Trouble is, that's where the villains are trying to get to.There are many smart choices in the movie, one of which is to keep the cast small. For most of the movie we only get 5characters and that allows us to get to know them. You feel like you're inside the movie, studying everyone and trying to get the edge on them by observing their mannerisms and gaging their personality, just as the people on either side of the panic room are doing. While you're getting inside the characters' heads, a strong sense of urgency builds. I'm no criminal, but I know that with a robbery, you have to get in and get out quick. The longer the plot drags on, the worse it's going to get because you increase the chances of something going wrong and of you getting caught. On the side of our heroes, there are some complications that build too, so you've got Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart's characters that want to get out asap, and the thieves that want to get in. Everyone is either trying to find a way to trick the other party into letting them in or out of the room, or trying to find a way around the big door that's separating everyone, or trying to force someone else to do it for them. Because the characters are intelligent, they're always trying something new and it kept me guessing as to what was going to happen next. It's really satisfying to see a movie where people act logically; always trying to sneak past each other's defenses (both physical and mental/emotional) and you'll constantly be surprised by the new elements introduced. "Panic Room" is a terrific thriller that really cleverly uses its location, creates genuine thrills and exciting feelings of paranoia and claustrophobia too. (On DVD, September 2012)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room is not one of David Fincher's best films, but it's still a magnificent piece of filmmaking. Thanks to his strong directing and some powerful acting performances, Panic Room rises above most thrillers regarding breaking and entering. This film is dark, well-written, and it reminds me of thrillers of old.Fincher's film is about a divorced wife and her daughter who move into a big house that has a panic room which is a room that will keep you safe in case of an intruder. But once the house is intruded by some people looking for millions, a deadly cat and mouse game will begin.This film is well-acted. Jodie Foster gives an elevated performance and is better than I thought she would be. Kristen Stewart, before her big fame, is actually pretty good. Forest Whittaker and Dwight Yoakam make great, memorable villains.Overall, this is a well-made, taut thriller that really gave me some thrills. It goes beyond the clichés and adds some new material. This is not Fincher's best film, but it shows how one of his weakest films is better than most films. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing about Panic Room was, in my opinion, the carefully balanced combination between realistic relatable events and cinematic fiction. Long before Saw portrayed a story taking place in maybe the cheapest single location in the history of the business (and became an all time hit), Panic Room used pretty much the same aspect.A claustrophobic mother and a diabetic daughter, locked in a seemingly impenetrable room after burglars have broken into their house. Both little Kristen Stewart and world famous Jodie Foster performed their roles very well. We also got to see Forest Whitaker (which is always a treat in my book), this time as one of the bad guys! However, writer Koepp and director Flincher were well aware that Whitaker has the "good guy" face and charisma, and made sure to use that too.The movie lacked a twist, if you ask me, which would have made it a much better thriller. Something smart to happen towards the end that the audience had no way of seeing coming. As it is, Panic Room had very few violent bloody scenes, and could have easily been rated PG-13 (so the F word is used more than once, so what?)All in all, Panic Room was a fun film which I really enjoyed watching. A good ol' fashion thriller with all the makings of a classic. Though it could have been a lot better, I'd still say it was definitely worth watching if you're a thriller fan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but disappointing ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film despite a few things: 1) Jared Leto's over-acting which made his character borderline comical 2) Dwight becoming considerably less menacing the moment he lost his mask 3) Unrealistic bits (911 puts you on hold? Doesn't trace the call?) 4) the fact that the weak &amp; abrupt ending left me going huh what? That's it???SPOILER - - - - - -&gt;Forest's character ends up saving their lives, and get's nothing out of this selfless act except a long insinuated jail sentence. I realize he was a bad guy and should typically go to jail but he is the only reason they made it out of that situation, and you're basically sending a message to people that says "don't do anything ethical like saving lives, it might just blow up in your face." It was a beautiful moment, him standing there, arms out, with his treasure blowing in the wind, knowing that in the end he'd given up everything for these people. And then all you get after that is Kristen and Jodie sipping a latte on a park bench reading the classifieds. "Hey, thanks. Life is good for us." Come on. Something should have turned out right for him. He turned back and they should have done something for him in return. That would have made this ending feel right.</fullReview>

But praising only Jodie Foster'd be unjust.

		<fullReview>Fincher has played around with the conventional format of film since day one. This movie is like the stage play you could never stage. Very few characters, a simple plot and all the elements of a thriller that you'll ever need. It takes a while to get over the CGI effects at the beginning, but once you get past that (as, it seems, does Fincher) the film really takes off. This went right into my Top 10. Watch it yourself and you'll figure why. This will be a film that directors and actors make reference to in 20 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither suspenseful nor entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How is it possible for this movie to have a rating of 7.5 - I thought the folks on the imdb had more taste than this!!!First of all the camera work seemed excessive, the script was implausible and annoyingly, predictable and the movie in its total effect was a great cure for insomnia.I did love the mother daughter dynamic between Meg (Jodie Foster) and Sarah (kristin stewart). Both gave quite good performances which, alas, did not make up for the terribly forced and trite acting of Leto, Dwight and Whittaker. There was no development and no convincing interaction in this threesome.The movie had some holes which I believe have already been given adequate attention on this list. I will give this movie (not film, mind you) a few points for effort. The initial camera work in the tour of the house was superb, especially the movement through keyholes and walls (we really didn't need to see the inside of a flashlight later on using this technique, however) I also love the opening credits - How unique and fun to watch!My real problem with the movie was that I had expectations. I have come to expect so much more from the director of Fight Club, Alien 3, The Game and Se7en, all of which I loved because they were so innovative! That was the problem with the Panic Room - It was not innovative in its feel or script. I also love most films Jodie Foster touches in any way and I was hoping for more - she came through with a great performance but had to work with such a pathetic script and that deserves kudos. This movie let me down in a big way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Boring Thriller with No Thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Except for a couple of scenes, watching PANIC ROOM was like watching paint dry. As a big fan of the director from his work on SE7EN, I had expected suspense and plot twists. What I got was HOME ALONE with four letter words and gore effects.It was at least half an hour too long. Well, it could have been an hour shorter, though: there's a scene early in the action where mother and daughter are in an elevator that no doubt had an alarm button in it. But then it would have been a short subject.The scene where the bad guys try to pump toxic gas into the room and the last time the door slams shut are both exciting. The camera work is awesome, the sound and music are great, and the opening titles are among the best I've ever seen. But there's so much talk, talk, talk between the three very dull bad guys.My respect for Jodie Foster would have been greater if at some point she had just turned to the camera and said, "Look, I know how bad this is, I'm ashamed of myself for doing it and I know how bored you are, but do you have any idea how much they're paying me to do this crap?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The overwhelming question that I needed answered before I could possibly enjoy this film was this:How was I supposed to sympathise with a women so well off that she can afford to buy a house with a room that serves no purpose other than for her to hide in when people break in to steal all her stuff?I mean, I have a good job, I pay a third of my income in direct taxes, I live in a nice neighbourhood with a garden and a garage (if not a picket fence). I am Mr Average Suburban. And yet the idea of a house WITH A ROOM THAT SERVES NO PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO HIDE IN WHEN PEOPLE BREAK IN TO STEAL ALL YOUR STUFF strikes me as both hilarious and repugnant. It's so forced that it hurts, it really hurts. I simply can't suspend my disbelief, and if I could, it would only mean that I would hold the protagonist in utter contempt.The only emotion that this insane, overblown shockfest imbued in me was disgust. Disgust at a society that would allow such a concept in the first place, but especially one that would tolerate a film with that as a premise being released as anything other than science fiction. Avoid.</fullReview>

The thugs can't hear her, only see her. After the policemen has gone she start destroying the video cams(!), so from being very careful not to risk her daughters life, she suddenly doesn't seem to care at all. The obvious reaction from the robbers would be that she said something to the police and that they were going in. Another plot holes (there are quite a few); the robbers knew she might had used the phone after rippig the cable from the wall, but they don't seem very concerned. Why taking the risk and stay? This film is trying to be "intelligent" but under the surface, it's just stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The credits are the best part, like many David Fincher films. OK, so its a bit formulaic, but the actors really make it work. It takes awhile to get started, but once it does, the suspense and mystery is undeniable. Many reviewers complained that the script was weak, I agree to some extent, but even with an unspectacular script this is still a very watchable thriller. If you think it's difficult to forgive the way this film grabs you, there are other ways to like it. The story, even clichéd, is still interesting and suspenseful. The best part of the movie, though, is the credits, which are not even as good as those Fincher used in Se7ven, which is a better movie, his best probably, better than Fight Club, go see that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a great admirer of director Fincher's earlier movies The Game and Seven. Fight Club was of lesser quality in my opinion and Panic Room is a complete letdown. Normally I find my IMDb ratings not much out of line with the consensus vote. But here I'm at a great difference. The main issues for me are the abstruse story and the female lead character. The plot outline is unconvincing to start with and the script is not good enough to make the viewer a believer. The gangsters do idiotic things, certainly not what real thieves would do (for example minimize noise). The dialogs are painfully bad to listen to, for example when the gangsters fight among themselves. It all comes across very forced and constructed. Then Jodie Foster is the coldest woman on the planet. I get a deep-freeze in my pants whenever I see her. As a mother she is completely unbelievable in the sense that she might have embraced a man in love to receive a child, and a terrible miscast in this movie. There is no grace, no redeeming charm whatsoever in her performance here. No wonder her movie husband left her! (Actually Foster's last good performance was in Nell, that suited her perfectly.) Hollywood is full of "older" attractive lead actresses who would have been so much better suited to star here and make a terrified mother actually believable: Kim Basinger, Michelle Pfeiffer, Andie McDowell, Deborah Unger (from The Game)... I'm sure I forget to name another 20 top candidates. So please Mr. Fincher, choose your next script carefully and cast a believable woman (again)! You can do better than this. Panic Room just doesn't work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Architecture of Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Ambitious directors have two holy grails: mastery of the self-referential narrative and establishing a new grammar of space, usually with architecture.Fincher is an ambitious, intelligent director who in past projects has explored the first of these. This time around, he explores the second. Hitchcock did this in `Rear Window,' a film often compared to this one. It has NO commonality at all expect the architectural aspiration.One can see these architectural ambitions in the team he assembled: writer David Koepp did the amazing `Snake Eyes,' the most ambitious mainstream film that explores the architecture of narrative. Cinematographer Darius Khondji is one of the recent fellow travelers of this emerging expertise. See the poetic underwater architecture in `In Dreams.' See what he did for master Polanski in melding image and narrative in `Ninth Gate.' Look at how his camera creates a city in `The City of Lost Children.' He is not master of this yet (not like Welles and Kurosawa) but he is familiar with what can be done, and willing to take risks. Khondji was fired from the film by barbarian financiers because of his expensive pains. Some of his work remains, especially in the first third.Add in Nichole Kidman (who had to drop out). I never could have guessed that this slight intellect, wife of a Scientologist, would become a force in intelligent films. But in `Eyes Wide Shut' she learned about projecting into the unseen narrative; in `Moulin Rouge' to the visual grammar; in `The Others,' she projected into the space around her (as did friend and fellow Australian Crowe in `Gladiator'). She had to drop out, but her selection is illustrative. Jodie, bless her heart, has no idea what Fincher is about so takes the story at face value.Forest Whitaker is another telling choice. A director himself, he recently learned how to homeopathically place himself in an off-screen narrative, working the master of that trick in `Ghost Dog.' That film worked with architected reference, not space, but the idea is the same.One knows from the first that what Fincher has in mind an architectural exploration, starting with the titles. Each credit assigns a name to a building. Each name except Fincher's who is notably suspended in space.Slap, slap one is quickly introduced to the building in the part of the film where one normally meets the characters. The characters here don't matter: they are furnishings. What matters is the physical relationship of spaces: four floors, stairs, elevator, etc. Right away we are also introduced to the bank of video monitors. This house is not only seen, but sees. (Shades of both `Fight Club' and `Snake Eyes.')Then we are given a remarkable tracking shot that outdoes de Palma, Altman, Andersen. This starts out with various angles on Meg in bed, then goes out the room, between the balusters and down the stairwell. It eventually takes us all through the house as the baddies break in. On and on it goes, in and out of a keyhole, through the handle of a coffeepot, through floors and walls. Each moment thrills.Then Khondji is fired and the tiresome wheels of the story grind and the requirements of the genre force us into bankable cliche. But that first third is nice.</fullReview>

The first 15 minutes nothing is going on, only information to the audience. Wouldn't it be better to learn about the panic room once they are in there? Instead of a long scene in which they explain everything about it and further more... there is no dramatically tension about the panic room. Is her daughter diabetic... why? only because they need a reason to be out of the room? This film has nothing to do with Mr. Hitchcock. Absolutely nothing. Hitchock made The Rope... one shot one set! This story needed that... Fincher thinks is hip and cool to move the camera around or through a key hole but... why? to show us that the house is not so safe? You can do better than that!

Scream at the screen because the damn film made such misleadingly promising overtures - and caused you to watch and hope for a while, wasting valuable sleeping time....Others have asked the question and Ill ask it again in the hope that some in Holywood take note of ranters like me - does anyone at these studios ever sit down and think thru their plot lines to check for 'holes'? After spending so much energy on costumes, sets, stunt work, marketting etc. - why is that the well always runs dry when it comes to penning a cogent script?Why ?SPOILERS (other than the film itself that is) Halfway thru this film, I felt like throwing the remote thru the screen. The whole premise of the film was to generate a believable tension based around a mother and child trapped in a vault-room - unable to get out or communicate to the outside world their predicament. The couple demonstrate extreme cleverness at certain points - however, when presented with the certain knowledge that all villains were downstairs arguing - and possessed also of a mobile phone - why did the mother not 'pop outside' for a minute and make the call to the police? Hmmm? At this point the whole edifice of tensions crashed down in a steaming heap. I can just about believe the crims were stupid enough not to stand guard - even though they knew the mother had the mobile....although on second thoughts - that might be an even more garish mistake... Foster - who I understand to be a rather smart cookie - should have said something. Maybe the order in which scenes were shot didnt make this stand out - but who comes along at the end and checks this sort of thing?Plot holes are ruining films.If claustrophobia and tension is your bag baby go see the much undervalued 'LEON' instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No need to panic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie that builds an entire plotline around one room in one house is just begging for trouble. I don't care if that one room's outfitted like Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants; if you limit your setting, you're asking for yawns. But that's what Panic Room does. Sure, there's a lot of action - such as it is - outside the room - but even what isn't contained within the ultrathick walls of the safe place is contained within the relatively small house itself (or maybe just the ultrathick walls of the screenwriter's mind).The gist of the story is that Meg Altman (Jodie Foster), who's recently been divorced from her husband, a very wealthy pharmaceutical dude, is buying this upscale brownstone in Manhattan for her and her generic kid (although not a cute generic kid; looks like they ran out of "cute" at Child Actors R Us and had to settle for not-so-cute-but-oh-so-spunky). Even though the fee is more than she's willing to pay and even though it's a little weird looking, our plucky heroine throws caution to the wind and buys the place. And immediately moves in - which, you homeowners know, happens with all the frequency of a loan getting approved quickly.The place has this complicated security system - it doesn't look all that large, frankly, but the system separates the house into zones, all "armed" at night. Sounds safe, right? When the house was being shown to Meg, she noticed that the master bedroom was smaller than it should be - surprise! There's a hidden room! Oh, what fun! What's it for, you ask? It's explained to Meg that if someone breaks into the house, she can get to the room and call the police from the handy-dandy not-connected-to-the-main-line phone; even if the main line's cut, you see, she can still call Officer Bob.Now, I don't know about you folks, if, while being shown a new place, I am told that the house has an awesome "safe room" in case someone breaks in - I'm getting the hell out of there. Wouldn't that tell even the biggest dunce that there's a crime problem in the area? I mean look - there's a friggin' security system! They're saying that a) people will break in, b) the security system won't do squat, c) you can't call the cops from the main line because they'll show up next week, so yay! We have this neato safe room for you.So to begin with, the premise is mired in utter stupidity. In fact, I sit here dumbfounded by its stupidity.Naturally, the first night Meg and her daughter Sarah are sleeping in the house, someone breaks in. Three burglars are there to recover something from the panic room's vault, but of course they don't expect anyone to be in the house. Okay, common mistake. One of them, Burnham (Forrest Whitaker), almost decides to call off the thing, since people are in there and he's got this thing against hurting people, and all that. But don't worry, he's soon talked out of it by Junior (Jared Leto), the nominal head of this happy bunch, which also includes the unexpected Raoul (Dwight Yoakam - didn't he used to have a music career, or something?).Whoosh! Meg and the youngster rush to the panic room, where they proceed to panic.A lot of contrivances abound. For one thing, Meg's claustrophobic, so she has problems dealing. For another, Sarah is diabetic, a fact that plays an unfortunate major role in the movie. Can Meg save her child before the bad guys get to her? Oh, can she?You know, just as an aside, I remember when Forrest Whitaker was just starting out in show biz. Remember Good Morning, Vietnam? That boy made some great career moves - Smoke was another. He's a great supporting-role kinda guy. It's just a crying shame this movie depends on him so heavily. He's the only one - yes, only one - who turns in even a decent performance. And since he's a bad guy, I should have been rooting against him, right? Ha! Guess again, Dr. Watson. I was hoping Burnham would escape.Jodie Foster, on the other hand, gives one of the most constipated performances of a lifetime. Did she check out her contract before agreeing to this crap? This woman's won OSCARS, for crying out loud! Geez, they couldn't get Ann Archer to do this role? Or Christine Lahti? Or Kathleen Turner? Or anyone else whose career has slowed down a bit?Eleven people, including me, were in the theater when I watched this movie. Eleven! It's a new movie, too! And because there were 11, I tried my darndest not to laugh out loud at the moronic dialog, inept direction, and incompetent camerawork. Really. I tried hard. But failed. I mean, I didn't want to embarrass myself, much as the actors onscreen were embarrassing themselves.Oh, and to add more insult to the whole shebang, the director is the same guy who brought the creative Fight Club and Seven to the big screen. Talk about slumming!This turkey is rated unwatchable. The movie was somehow allowed to rise from somewhere in the murky bowels of Mother Earth to fester like a cold sore in the mouth of the American audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only panic I experienced was when I thought I had paid to watch this movie.Although well put together, the plot leaves nothing to the imagination. Throughout the beginning of the film the view is left thinking "I wonder when that bit of information will be used later in the film". The villains are predictable and, given their goal, painfully stupid. In the name of suspense (I assume), the villains bumble around providing windows of opportunity, while the heroes dash around risking their lives with obvious consequences. There are so many points which are simply too far fetched to be believable, for example: The timing &amp; manner of the police arrival - If they took that long answering my distress call I would demand my taxes back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad writing and no suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't find fault with the acting or directing of this film. The camera angels on many shots were new and innovative. But the writing was was terrible. The premise was a good idea, but this was just stupid and predictable. There was very little suspense. Many of the people in the theater were laughing and checking their watches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Overlooked Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a shortened review. For my full length review, please visit: http://guywithamovieblog.blogspot.com/ I recently watched an analysis on the career of David Fincher, one of my favorite directors, and it put me in the mood to re-watch a lot of his films. It had been a while since I'd seen Panic Room, so I decided to start with that one.Panic Room is often considered to be a lesser work by the talented Fincher, but I think that's very unfair. I've always really liked the film, ever since I saw it in the theater during its release in 2002, but after watching it again, I think it may be one of Fincher's best - and a nearly perfect film.I think some of the criticisms of Panic Room may stem from the fact that it's a relatively simple film: a recently divorced woman (Meg played by Jodie Foster) and her pre-teen daughter (Sarah played by Kirsten Stewart) move into a new home, an extravagant three floor Manhattan brownstone with a secured "panic room" off of the master bedroom. The real estate agent explains to Meg how the room operates and how "you can never be too safe these days". On their first night there, a trio of men (Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam) break in and intend to rob them. Fincher, by way of his technical expertise and ability to direct his talented cast, manages to elevate the film quite a bit.The film starts out with a staple of Fincher's films, an interesting opening credits sequence. While not at the level of Se7en or Fight Club, the credits for Panic Room are first rate. Thanks to the score and title design, Fincher is able to evoke the feeling of a Hitchcock-like thriller and sets up what is going to be an intense and exhilarating film. I'd even go as far to say, this is the exact type of film Hitchcock himself would have made if he were making films in the 21st century. Like the best thrillers, the back story and set up is handled well and very quickly - within ten minutes or so, we have all the pertinent information we need about Meg's separation, Sarah's medical condition, the layout of the house, and the previous owner's family squabbles.As Meg and Sarah go to sleep on that first night, the three men break into the home and Meg retreats to the panic room with Sarah in tow. It's soon revealed that the men want something that is in the panic room itself and the film is at full tilt speed very quickly, and it barely lets up at all during its 112 minute running time.Meg and Sarah are fully realized, believable, and strong female characters. Foster, who replaced Nicole Kidman early in production, gives one of her very best performances as the terrified and angry mother who would do anything to protect her child. Stewart, best known now for not being able to fully close her mouth and the Twilight franchise, showed a lot of promise as a youngster. Sarah is, at times, brash and defiant, but then also scared and childlike. Stewart is able to handle both sides of the character with ease. Their chemistry together is palpable - you really believe they're mother and daughter.The three intruders - Burnham (Whitaker), Junior (Leto), and Raoul (Yoakam) - also work well together. Each one is a bit of an arch type - the mild mannered Burnham, the spoiled hothead Junior, and the sadistic wild card Raoul - but are all so interesting and well acted that it hardly matters we've seen these types of characters many times before. Fincher introduces us to this trio with a marvelous "floating" camera trick - digitally stitched together in post production - that goes through the whole house in seemingly one take, following them from one door to the next as they attempt to gain access. The shot is so masterfully done, it's really a sight to behold.I mentioned the score for the opening credits, but it's really wonderful throughout. It helps build and maintain the tension all through the film, up until the breathtaking finale, where everything comes to a head. Considering I've seen Panic Room at least four or five times and know exactly what's going to happen, you wouldn't think I'd be tense and on edge while watching it, but I was. There are several moments where I caught myself actually holding my breath, due to my excitement and fear.Generally, I don't care for the use of slow motion in films, but Fincher uses it in a couple of key sequences to add to the tension and dread, and he does so with his usual technical brilliance. These moments are heart racing affairs, where I found myself wishing things would speed back up just so I could see the outcome that much sooner.Considering how suspenseful and tense the film is, it might be a bit of surprise to hear there are some great moments of comedy, as well. Most of these instances come from Leto and Yoakam's performances, but Foster manages to add a couple of her own, too. It's a perfect mix, so that you don't get overwhelmed by the darkness and the dread.My only complaint in regards to Panic Room, is that some of the character's back stories (especially Burnham's) are handled in such a stiff and obvious manner. I'm not sure how else this important information could have been delivered, but I'm sure there had to be a better way.Overall, this is a tiny nitpick, though, and in the end Fincher has managed to create one of the very best thrillers I've ever seen. I can't recommend it enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quickie Review: Panic Room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider this to be a pretty sub-par offering from Fincher. An unmemorable and dire hour and forty five minutes awaits whoever watches this film. A fair bit of my dislike of the film stems from the aesthetics of the movie ? The CGI was pretty mediocre and distracting (such as from the not-really-tracking tracking shots as we are taken around the house, through walls and keyholes and such). Panic Room has that crappy indistinct and cloudy look that a lot of modern movies shot digitally have, despite the fact that the movie was filmed with Panavision Panaflex Platinum cameras. In his defence, Fincher made this in 2002 and a lot of modern movies haven't moved on from this look, whereas he clearly has if you look at his recent films. With a premise that harks back to the days of Hitchcock, Panic Room sees Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart locked in their home's safe room, as a gang of robbers search the house for valuables. Unfortunately, events during the course of the film become so far- fetched and unbelievable that your suspension of disbelief kind of commits suicide and you know longer care what's happening because it's so ridiculous and contrived. The script is a bit dumb, which makes it all the more strange that Fincher directed this. Best Scene: The opening credits were pretty cool. Apparently it was worked on for a whole year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart, home invasion thriller is full of suspense and great writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From David Fincher, the mastermind behind some of the most crowd pleasing thrillers of the 90s such as 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club', comes an insanely suspenseful home invasion thriller written by David Koepp who wrote the first two Jurassic Parks. This film follows recently divorced mother Meg Altman (played by Jodie Foster) and her diabetic preteen daughter Sarah (played by Kristen Stewart) who move in the luxury condos of Manhattan. Upon touring with a realtor, Meg and Sarah come across a small, high security room known as the "panic room" featuring medical supplies and video surveillance. Upon settling down for the night, Meg and Sarah are awoken by a trio of burglars: Junior (played by Jared Leto), Raoul (played by Dwight Yoakam), and the most moral of the three Burnham (played by Forest Whitaker); who bust through in search of a fortune left by Junior's grandfather who was the previous owner of the condo. Meg and her daughter quickly take shelter in the panic room, only to learn that what the burglars are searching for happens to be in that room.David Fincher is an expert conveying suspense in his movies, and this is the biggest aspect he achieves in this film. From the first minute of the arrival of the robbers, the film pulls us into a near non stop edge-of-your-seat thrill fest. There are plenty of heart- pounding moments throughout that are very unpredictable, and with the ingenious writing about David Koepp, it is also fun; even when the pacing has its occasional hiccups. Video surveillance plays a key role in the plot with the two main characters watching over the three criminals via video cam in the panic room, so some of the most suspenseful scenes take place through video surveillance; and the video surveillance works very well as a plot device. Then there are the characters are including the main character and her daughter, along with the three antagonists who are well crafted and decently written. Jodie Foster's character and her daughter played by the then 11-year old Kristen Stewart are characters the audiences quickly come to care about, and the criminals serve as the most interesting characters, with a big moral conflict between these three playing a key role in the plot. In addition to this, the performances are quite decent, especially by Jared Leto who is not known for such brash roles like this. Forest Whitaker is very charismatic as the criminal who holds moral values and comes off as a somewhat likable, despite this affiliation with the other two who act in pure evil.Panic Room is a very compelling movie and a decent piece of work by David Fincher. The cast is great in this, the direction is inspiring, and the plot is good and full of strong suspense. It is a solid pick for those fans of great suspense as it delivers the thrills strong and effectively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong film, weak(ish) ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic Room is not one of David Fincher's best. But that doesn't mean it's bad. Foster and Stewart are an impressive pairing as mother and daughter, breaking out of the usual female's 'damsel in distress' situation. Forest Whitaker and Jared Leto are two of the three burglar-villains set on stealing money hidden in Foster's new home's panic room, which is where mother and daughter have taken base. Both parties use their heads rather than their resources to resolve their conflicts. Panic Room is a little on the predictable side, but extremely tense throughout. It's not one of those films you can flick in and out of, as it had me grabbed by the privates, from the moment the burglars enter the house.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A house is under attack and there is only one place to hide. A special place.Starring Jodie Foster, Kristen Stewart and Forest Whitaker.Written by David Koepp.Directed by David Fincher.This starts off really slow!In fact I'd say the first two thirds of the film are slow and pretty silly. The guys that break into the house are more slapstick than they are sinister. Their various attempts at getting at the two main characters is lame at best and doesn't make for exciting viewing.However the final third of the film builds up to a decent climax and has enough thrills and spills to satisfy. It's a pity the rest of the film wasn't as entertaining. The acting is decent throughout, especially Jodie Foster, Kirsten Stewart and Forest Whitaker.It's a shame it took so long to get going. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie without first seeing the ratings, but when I did I was surprised. I thought it was done quite well. Panic Room had a really good idea, and I thought it was carried out in a fun yet still serious enough way to keep it feeling intense. I've read other reviews talking about how little sense the movie made, but none of these supposedly 'unrealistic' things bothered me, nor did I notice any of them, so it didn't take away from the experience for me. I thought that the characters were done pretty well too. They felt pretty real, and the actors all did quite good jobs. I actually cared about them and felt like I knew them relatively well by the end. Overall Panic Room is a solid movie. The plot is well-executed and the characters and acting is great. In the end I would recommend this movie, and I really don't understand why people don't seem to like it that much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshingly original film, 2002, apanic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Fincher, has again excelled and squarely delivered the goods, with familiar team, of 8mm, Se7en, whatever. In a great wonderfully honed script, this is nothing short of another psychological thrill ride with some truly breathless moments, that chokes you in it's intensity on it's first view. Consider the impasse too, which is what makes it like this. We have a new room to be introduced too and educated about. A panic room, is like a shelter, a safe room you hide in, if intruders ever break in. Electronically operated, thieves can't get into this room. Consider divorcée, Foster and her little daughter (younger budding actress Kristen Stewart) whose first night in their brownstone tenament is one night, they'll never forget, for whom barges in, a trio of thieves. They're headed by Whitaker, the only one with a heart as demonstrated much later on in the movie, in one scene he shares with Stewart, that I really liked, almost as much as I liked this film. His outcome, was one that sucked in the film's ending. This was the only thing that faulted the movie. Whitaker, accompanied by a snooty, younger, and sleazy looking guy (Leto, a trademark in character acting) really hasn't informed him about the third guy, for good reasons (hotheaded and detestable psychopath, Yoakam- Slingblade) a performance that'll scar you. Foster and Stewart hold out in the panic room, only what the thieves want, is in that room, making for one claustrophobic dilemmas, you could say. As well as being a solid never slacking psychological thriller, the story really works from a realistic standpoint, which I liked, one stunt Foster tries to get rid of them, almost backfiring, causing Leto to lose his stack. A hairy standout moment. Foster's husband is a seemingly much older guy with stringy who must be loaded. We share a little time with him, near the end. What Foster and Stewart do in their circumstances is exactly what you would do in their position, where the same goes for our thieves after that moolah. Watching Leto, blowing his stack is fun, but as I said it's really the piece of s..t Yoakam's character that has us. You really want to see this guy go, the inestimable hatred between him and Stewart, frighteningly evident. At one point, he candidly shouts threateningly to her saying "What the F you looking at". Fincher to me is a really interesting director, with not a large inventory of films to his credit, but they are handpicked stories, and original, discounting Alien 3 of course. Panic Room, continues that chain of originality, as if an event, in the waiting, if only for a better ending and rosier outcome for Whitaker, who sort of becomes the hero. I actually know a couple of people who disfavor this film, one a video store clerk. You can't please everyone. Fine choice for a night of suspenseful viewing, where ever actor does us solid in their fine performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher is one of my favorite contemporary directors. I've watched almost all of his more famous movies but somehow missed this one. So I thought to give it a shot. And I enjoyed it thoroughly. It's a claustrophobic thriller which acts more like a cat and mouse game.Almost completely shot indoors, yet it showcases some of Fincher's best efforts with the camera.Like always, Howard Shore has done a brilliant job with the score, setting the tone of this pulsating thriller.Jodie Foster is outstanding as a recently divorced mother with a teenage daughter(played by a very young but brilliant Kristen Stewart!) who isn't scared to take matters into her own hand. She is intelligent and likes to take necessary risks.More a player than a pawn. Her worthy opponent is one of the illegal intruders (played with excellence by Forest Whitaker). He is spot on as a criminal with compassion who is somehow forced to play the role of an antagonist in the great game of life.I wouldn't rank it among Fincher's well-known masterpieces like 'Seven'/'Fight Club'. But, overall, a decent 'edge-of-your-seat' thriller.No doubt about that.If you love this kind of movies, then you should give it a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room (2002): Dir: David Fincher / Cast: Jodie Foster, Kristen Stewart, Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, Dwight Yoakam: Entertaining thriller about survival and safety. Jodie Foster moves into a big house with her daughter after a separation. An impressive title sequence is followed by the standard tour of the house, which includes an elevator and a panic room for emergencies. Before long three men break in and begin a long night of terrorizing. Fine setup marred by predictable formula until a right turn is taken. Stylish directing by David Fincher who also made such intriguing thrillers as The Game and Fight Club. Foster is resourceful in her struggle to outwit the criminals as well as obtain medicine for her daughter. Kristen Stewart is effective as her daughter who needs medical care. We know where this is headed but it is the criminals who are the most interesting. Jared Leto leads the trio with profane instructions but Foster is reluctant to reason thus causing certain injuries to him. Forest Whitaker plays another criminal whom manufactured the safe room and needed to crack it. He is more human than the others and has other alternatives as to why he is doing this. Dwight Yoakam plays the third leg in this criminal tragedy where intelligence works against them. This is a well crafted thriller full of suspense and a theme regarding fear that is tense and immobilizing. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a Thriller? That's the words that came to my mind when I saw this film. Acting was top notch by every actor. Any director who wants to make a Thriller genre should watch this film.I was hooked up from start to finish. Jodie Foster displayed both vulnerability and resoluteness at the same time. The mother and daughter have to confront the intruders who want to get their hands on the money which is kept inside the panic room. Initially, unaware of their motives they holed up inside the same panic room. How they overcome this situation forms the crux of the story.Forest Whitaker also displayed compulsion as well as compassion to his character simultaneously.I highly recommend this movie. Watch it because it is one of the best film in thriller genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good thriller with two strong female leads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this thriller. Maybe it's a "girl power" thing. But I think it is a good entertaining movie. Maybe not the most unpredictable plot out there, but good for a Sunday with nothing else to do. i could do with a bit less gore and a LOT less F bombs but with a movie that has other aspects that make me like it enough, I can look past that. I want to address a few recurring complaints I have seen in other reviews. For one, GET OVER Kristen steward's "boyish" look. The comment "didn't know at first if it was a boy or girl" is a common comment in reviews I've read. When she started filming panic room she had just finished shooting a movie where she plays a girl that looks like (and is mistaken for) a boy. Thats why her hair is so short in this movie. (obviously she chose to really cut it rather than use a wig). Get over it. It's not that big of a deal and there's a very logical explanation behind it. If you don't want spoilers click off of this review right now. Also some have talked about the "unrealistic" depiction of diabetes. You want unrealistic, watch Con Air, where a character claims he'll die without his insulin in a short time. (Unlikely.) In panic room it IS realistic that Stewart, a type 1 diabetic who is thin, is prone to low blood sugar in times of stress. She probably took a little extra insulin because she drank extra coke (watch the pizza scene where Foster tells her to go easy on the soda but then ultimately pours her more). Taking her insulin like she should (and a little extra maybe) WOULD put her at risk of dangerously low sugar if there is something unexpected like missing her next meal, exercising, being under stress. It is realistic, I know Type 1 diabetics who have to stay up all night some nights to monitor their blood sugar because it's too low and won't stay up. Hypoglycemia can go downhill very quickly. And in the "almost coma" scene, Forrest Whittaker is NOT giving her insulin (as someone complained) they are giving her a shot of sugar, most likely glucagon, which diabetics do keep in syringes for emergency and is an appropriate treatment for this situation. It does not have to be given intravenously as someone claimed, and would be easy for someone who doesn't know much about injecting. (He should have cleaned the site first though and it shouldn't have been kept in the fridge but rather room temperature.) The most unrealistic thing about the diabetes storyline is the special monitor she wears on her wrist. From what I understand that technology (especially in 2002) is still very much "in the works" and isn't really "a thing' yet. My last rebuttal to other reviews is the scene where Forrest Whittaker gets arrested and loses all the money. OK maybe you want him to get away with the money because he's not such a bad guy. Im' not saying I felt differently, but I always saw this part of the movie differently. I saw it as a noble sacrifice, like the man in "A tale of Two Cities" who dies so the woman he loves can live happily ever after with the man she loves. In Panic Room, Forrest Whittaker is getting away with the money when he hears and realizes that the mother and daughter are still in danger. He hesitates a split second before going back to help them. I think it's a conscious decision he made, the ultimate sacrifice and redemption, that he KNOWS going back to help them can cost him his escape, but chooses to do it anyway because they're innocent and he can't live with himself if they come to harm. He values their lives over his own freedom. That's why when he does get caught and releases the money into the wind he has a look of resignation. I think he mourns his freedom, family, and the wealth he almost had, but that he knows he did the right thing and that gives him a peace about it all. I think it speaks volumes about what kind of person he really is deep inside. That makes him ultimately my favorite character. LOL I didn't mean to get so philosophical but it is a good movie and well worth the watch on a rainy Sunday without too much else to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director David Fincher has some Hitchcockian ("Rear Window", "Lifeboat" for example) "enclosed-space" fun with this frankly unbelievable thriller set almost entirely within an apartment building in New York as three would-be robbers break into the abode of a rich divorcée and her diabetic daughter to steal millions of dollars worth of bearer bonds. Luckily, this new apartment has a custom-made panic room to keep them safe-ish, but it's also where the loot is hidden. When mother and daughter lock themselves into the sealed compartment, a game of catch as catch can commences between them and the interlopers.Seasoned performers like Jodie Foster and Forrest Whitaker do a commendable job keeping their faces straight acting through ever more unlikely scenes as the film progresses, occasionally with dire dialogue to match, for instance mother hen Josie says to her initially bratty daughter played by a young Kristen Stewart, "It's disgusting how much I love you " the kind of line only a movie mother would utter.Fincher employs every weapon in his armoury to draw in the viewer, with a succession of camera tricks designed to create mini-climax after mini-climax but the premise won't stand it and in the end I just felt battered about the head by all the noise, violence, swearing and supposed high-tension.Besides Foster and Whitaker, the surprise turn in the acting is by country-singer Dwight Yoakum, although quite why he goes through half the film with his face covered escaped me. Maybe he had the measles. You will be amazed too at how he survives getting his hand jammed in a lift door, then getting walloped on the head with a sledge- hammer and falling down a flight of stairs, getting up one last time, as it happens, to swat away Stewart and threaten to cave in Foster's head. It's that kind of movie, ludicrous and crass yet not without some vicarious thrills along the way, but these are overdone and come in too quick succession. In the end then, it's easier to mock than be shocked by what's on display here.Which I'm sure was hardly the director's intention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is certainly not a great film, definitely one of Fincher's lesser efforts and nothing like his most acclaimed films. It's pretty standard, Hollywood stuff, but it's still enjoyable enough, to a degree. It doesn't do anything spectacular, even action0wise or tension-wise and that fault lies in the screenplay. Fincher definitely brings his usual directorial flair, but one can only do so much with a directorial vision when the script still doesn't allow for more. But it's still at least a bit better than The Game, while not as ambitious still doesn't frustrate as much. I hesitantly recommend it, but if one was to skip it it wouldn't be a big deal at all. Foster is strong though, as usual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** SPOILERS ***Pretty much what you would expect: A bunch of robbers coming to hit a place they hear has a lot of money (think "In Cold Blood"); a sudden, unwelcome, and ultimately psychotic addition to the team (like any heist movie); a character with a potentially life-threatening condition (lots of movies where someone's trapped); and a single location (like "Bound"). All of this is no surprise since the screenwriter is the untalented David Koepp (who ruined the film version of "Jurassic Park").David Fincher uses lots of camera tricks to try to make the film more interesting, but it is ugly looking like a lot of Fincher movies. Lots of monochromatic interiors, for example. Howard Shore's film score is lifeless and uninteresting, typical of modern film scores.Of course, there are a lot of plot holes, chiefly, everyone's making a TON of noise throughout the movie, and no one hears a thing; we learn the police had been notified, but take an hour to show up; Foster's ex just walks into the brownstone without the police (or anything else) in tow; The former owner just leaves tens of millions of dollars in the safe; wouldn't you leave bearer bonds like that in say, a safe deposit box?Oh well, if you're gonna see it, turn your brain off. At least!****** (6 Out of 10 Stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls somewhere in-between Home Alone and Funny Games.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through the lens of David Fincher and the pen of David Koepp comes this simplistic, but highly polished home invasion thriller that while being one of it's directors more incidental films, is still a hugely competent effort with more than enough to recommend it by. Meg Altman (Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Stewart) have just moved into their new Manhattan pad. Built into the master bedroom is a state of the art panic room and ? 'whaddya know!?' ? on the first night there's a break in. And so begins the film. Just like in his previous feature film Fight Club, David Fincher cleverly opts for CGI to create some otherwise impossible visuals as the camera prowls and glides around the huge house with an eerie grace prompting some good early tension. Once the break-in happens and we get acquainted with the invaders, some of that tension dissipates, indeed there's one comical moment in which a slightly burned Jared Leto reacts in a way that recalls the bungling burglars of Home Alone , but thanks to a menacing turn from Dwight Yoakam the balance is never tipped too far that way and we're never allowed to fully relax. Like all good survival horror's, Panic Room works like a fun puzzle as it often gives you the opportunity to mull over what you yourself might do in similar circumstances. Good direction makes Panic Room a functional suspense thriller that while in terms of classic status could never be mentioned in the same sentence as Se7en or Fight Club, still helps it stand tall in a long line of the old school Friday night-in popcorn rentals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher at it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back then when I first watched this, I never could've imagined (or anyone else for that matter), what would become of young Kristen Stewart. I wonder what people think of this movie, that got to know her through her Twilight movies? The movie of course is more of a Jodie Foster vehicle, but credit also has to go out to the male leads (one of the last roles for Jared Leto? Hope he decides to come back to acting, even if his music career works quite well for him).Fincher always was and is very particular when it comes to framing shots. The disc has quite a few features on him preparing for the movie. The whole "pre-viz" thing worked great. And the shot near the beginning of the movie, where you get to see the whole house works well later, when the viewer has some sort of orientation due to the fact, he had a "tour through the house". A thriller that works quite nice and that should have you at the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meg Altman is a single mother who is going through a divorce and just moved in separately with her pre teen diabetic daughter Sarah. She has bought a new home in New York which is practically a mansion. For their amusement this mansion has a room called 'Panic Room'. This room is equipped to keep people safe in the event for an emergency. And when some burglars comes to steal some thing the only safe place Meg and Sarah can find to hide is the panic room. But things start to become quite tense when they realize that what the burglars are looking for is also in the same room. While the bunch of crooks plan on how to get inside the room, Meg and Sarah has to look for a way to get help from the outside world. Panic Room is a very thrilling ride. It takes place 99% inside the mansion and over night. The sequences builds tension minute by minute and every move made by the burglars and the home people becomes tense every time. For the viewer it's a game of hoping for the best. And this packs good performance by Jodie Foster (Meg). When her kid starts to get sick she becomes desperate to find help. And she makes several very risky moves keeping her life on the edge. One other major reason for the success of this movie is the cinematography. Especially the sequences which require very dramatic camera movements and long shots combined with CG and moving cameras are done very skillfully. The viewer actually feels how big the house is and how you can really move in and around about it. This was directed back in 2004 by David Fincher way before he won the best director award at Golden Globes for 'Social Network'. And he actually nailed it.more at flickshout.tk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's clever, it's well-crafted, it's well-acted, and feels routine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess it's a measure of my respect for Jodie Foster as an actress that I expect more of her and the movies she chooses than a well-made, watchable drama that really doesn't rise above the level of ordinary.It's very watchable, though, and if you're looking for a good popcorn flick for a "girls' night in" evening, this is a movie I'll happily recommend.Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart bear the weight of this film as Meg Altman and her daughter Sarah Altman, who are the newly-shed ex-spouse and daughter of Stephen Altman (Patrick Bauchau), who is evidently a dirty rotten stinking rich magnate. They are house-hunting in the high-rent district of Manhattan and the realtor they are working with, Lydia Lynch (Ann Magnuson), has a lead on a property that is so new to the market that it isn't even in the listings yet, and so wonderful that it will be snapped up by someone before nightfall.It's the former home of an infirm and reclusive megamillionaire who equipped it with every modern convenience, including a state-of-the-art "panic room": a sort of high-security vault where the residents can stash themselves in the event of a home invasion. When closed, it's impregnable from the outside and equipped with closed-circuit monitoring of all the rest of the house.As the realtor who has the sales listing for this manse shows it to Foster and Stewart, we get the information that the eccentric former owner has recently died, and that he died intestate, and that the heirs are battling over his fortune.Jodie Foster as Meg allows herself to be talked into purchasing the house, and further talked into taking full possession immediately, and she and her daughter move in that very night.Thus starteth the nightmare. It develops that one of the heirs, "Junior" (played by Jared Leto), just happens to know that there is something hidden in the panic room. He wants to get this something and scoop the other heirs. And he has enlisted the assistance of a couple of baddies-buddies to help him get it: Burnham (Forest Whittaker), who works for the company that built the panic room; and Raoul (Dwight Yoakum), whose presence is only necessary as a dramatic device to bring a truly evil, menacing presence to the party.Junior, Burnham and Raoul break into the manse late in the rainy, spooky night and discover that the empty mansion they expected is unexpectedly inhabited. Meg and Sarah are sleeping upstairs. While the baddie-buddies discuss the unexpected development in menacing whispers downstairs, Meg awakens for a late-night potty run. Coming back from the bathroom in a sleepy stupor, she glances at the monitors in the panic room and sees the baddie-buddies up to no good downstairs.With great presence of mind, she manages to rouse her daughter and the two of them dive into the panic room just ahead of the baddies, who have come upstairs to see what can be done. So Meg and Sarah are safely ensconced in the panic room. The problem is, what the baddie-buddies want is hidden in the panic room with them.And so the rest of the movie consists of Junior, Burnham and Raoul trying to get Meg and Sarah out of the panic room, while Meg and Sarah try to find a way to get help to come and route the baddie-buddies.I won't spoil how this situation develops; it's well-done and suspenseful, and I enjoyed the movie even though I knew what the outcome was going to be. It was interesting to watch how the story moved along to the inevitable and predictable climax. Foster is, as always, very watchable; Stewart does a nice job, and Whittaker, Yoakum and Leto are workmanlike baddies.It's a good entertaining movie that hits all the right buttons and leaves you satisfied without breaking any new ground or giving us any new insights. Which, for Foster and the kind of work she usually does, is faint praise indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful, but marred by inconsistent tension levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With two excellent actors and a strong premise, this suspense thriller opens with potential. The basic premise is that new tenants to an apartment, a mother (Jodie Foster) and daughter (Kristin Stewart), inadvertently get caught up in an "inside job" robbery at the apartment building. They're in the wrong place at the wrong time.The ensuing cat/mouse pursuit, complete with a well crafted claustrophobic atmosphere, provide for what is usually an exciting story. The chess moves made by both sides are logical to the characters, building the plot and suspense level. Forest Whitaker (as one of the three criminals) and Foster deliver the convincing performances expected from these talented actors. However, weaker acting of others in the cast, and inconsistent direction, don't maintain the mood or tension. This weakens the film's effectiveness.The other two villains start out menacing, but when you see some idiot trap his hand in a doorway (and some other slapstick behavior), it's too awkward to take it seriously. The intent was clearly not a Home Alone type satire, but sometimes resembles it. The line reads by the the two dumb crooks, as well as Stewart, just aren't convincing; they each become caricatures. The latter's role is a tom-boy diabetic teen with an attitude, but she plays it more like a mumbling zombie that spikes her insulin shots with heavy depressants.Whitaker and Foster carry the film, and ultimately, succeed in saving it. The ending sequence works well, and has a nice irony attached. Good for one-time viewing, but you probably won't want to revisit it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After divorcing her wealthy husband, scholarly Jodie Foster (as Meg Altman) goes house shopping with her beautiful young daughter Kristen Stewart (as Sarah). The pair find a spacious "to die for" Manhattan brownstone, and quickly take up residence. One of the home's selling points is a "Panic Room" where you can hide out safely in the unlikely event of a home intrusion. Well, you guessed it. As the new residents begin their very first night's sleep, three dangerous invaders enter the house...Looking for millions hidden (guess where!), the crooked trio - kindly non-violent Forest Whitaker (as Burnham), maniacal bus driver Dwight Yoakam (as Raoul), and "not built for prison" Jared Leto (as Junior) - terrorize the new residents. David Fincher directs the cameras to move everywhere and anywhere; he surfs through the house - up stairs and through pipes, vents, keyholes, and even walls. This is a predictable, well-produced David Koepp thriller, with some prolonged gruesome scenes.****** Panic Room (3/29/02) David Fincher ~ Jodie Foster, Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, Jared Leto</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stall for the inevitable double cross.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides being a thrill a minute actioner, Panic Room clearly exemplifies the fact that there's no honor among thieves.Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart give above board performances as Meg and Sarah Altman. The two latest statistics of the broken family syndrome, they have just moved into a majestic house in Manhatten.Unfortunately for them, their home has been targeted by a trio of thieves intent on liberating millions of dollars in bearer bonds hidden inside. The three consist of Burnham (Forest Whitaker) Junior (Jared Leto) and Raoul chillingly portrayed by Dwight Yoakam.It is only after the three are inside that they realize the dwelling is occupied. Yet the stakes are so high, they decide to pursue their quest. Awakened by the intruders, Meg and Sarah take refuge in the covertly installed panic room. As was revealed early in the movie, the room is virtually indestructible and the thieves spend the majority of the film trying to gain access to it. Not only do they want to get to Meg and Sarah, but the treasure they seek is in the room.During their endeavors Junior and Raoul engage in a power struggle, while Burnham just wants to get the whole thing over with.They are really creative in their attempts to get the Altmans to open the door, trying everything from poison gas to beating Meg's soon to be ex husband to a pulp. Meg and Sarah are just as creative in seeking outside help.As time races along and it becomes clear that the room is impregnable, the inevitable falling out occurs between Yoakam, Leto and Whitaker.I really liked the clip at which the movie progressed. There are more than enough tense moments, tight spots and fisticuffs to keep your attention. Performances were first rate and convincing, especially Dwight Yoakam as the cold blooded Raoul.There were several flaws however. Early on while Meg and Sarah are initially examining the house, Meg reveals to us that she is extremely claustrophobic, yet throughout the remainder, she shows no such symptom's even though she is confined in the panic room. Another is when the real estate agent demonstrates that the panic room door will not shut if anything is obstructing it, much like an elevator door. Yet later, it slams firmly shut on Raouls hand.Despite these minor flaws, Panic Room is exciting, suspenseful and will have your heart skipping a few beats.</fullReview>

At this point, I lose all interest in the movie as credibility has left the building so to speak. SPOILERS, good example is when Jodie Foster leaves the panic room for the insulin stored in her daughter's room. I mean she had a cell phone with her, why not call the police from her bedroom and get them to come immediately and then go back into the panic room. Also, when she finally does make it to her daughter's room, she double checks whether the insulin is in the wallet, as if her and her daughter would not keep it ready at all times. They just keep on coming after that.Some one should advise Hollywood that the general public are not that dumb!!!</fullReview>

As the daughter and mother wake to find they have broken in,they race to a panic room which they can't get into.The problem the thieves have is that the money is inside that room and they have to find a way of getting in there.So the mother and daughter are trapped inside,no phones,no weapons,nothing they can do about it.What really let me down about this thriller was that it was directed by David Fincher and after Seven and Fight club you would expect better. Like all Finchers other movies,it contains a twist at the end,Panic room is just too straight forward,it is too much of a regular film. I was impressed with the tension and the suspense but that was all it had to it,nothing original. I rate 3/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want to marry David Fincher, but not this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie. After all Fincher did `Fight Club', which is in my personal top three movies of all time, as well as `Se7en' which is in my top ten. He's got a lot to live up to and yet this concept, a sort of adult `Home Alone' had me wary. could he pull it off? Almost, but he was let down by a poor script by David `Spiderman' Koepp.The plot's nice and simple. Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) has moved into a huge New York home with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart), using money gained from her divorce. One of the house's features is a panic room - a room cut off from the outside world which you can lock yourself into in times of trouble. Guess what? Trouble arrives in the form of three burglars intent on stealing something. The problem? What they want is in the panic room, and the Altman's, terrified, have now locked themselves in.The script is where things get let down. It's obvious. You can generally predicate what's going to happen and are left unsurprised then when it does. The burglars feel very much like stock characters - there's the I-am-not-so-bad-just-down-on-my-luck type (Forrest Whittaker), the crazy-wild-guy (a disappointing Jared Leto), and the cold-psychotic-guy (Dwight Yoakam). They thus feel one dimensional, not helped by Leto's manic, over-the-top performance that almost renders them comically inept. This isn't good for a thriller. Fortunately Jodie Foster puts in a fine performance as the strong, concerned mother who genuinely emotes fear, love, and hate on screen and Kristen Stewart is a welcome new addition for teenage actors by virtue of not being loathsome as most are.It's up to David Fincher to save the movie, and he mostly succeeds. He's the current maestro of atmosphere and visuals in Hollywood, using innovative techniques to help otherwise staid scripts rise over their limitations. Here he doesn't get quite as creative as he does with `Fight Club', both because it's a more mainstream picture and because the movie doesn't require it. Nevertheless his camera work is superb. It roams from room to room, and yet also is able to enter keyholes, or examine minute particles of dust in incredibly fluid transitions. Naturally, with Fincher at the helm, there's a great use of lighting and shadows - one of his goals was to achieve a `realism' in this movie, in that the viewer would be no more privy to what a character could see than that character. This works excellently, allowing him to crank up the tension by suffocating the viewer in the same closed universe as the protagonists. The use of a relatively small set, notches up the claustrophobic angle, accentuated by the aforementioned lighting. The music scheme to the movie is typically subdued, never overwhelming but creating a linger sense of fore boding in the viewer's head - Howard Shore's work is again appreciated by me for not having the full on effect of a James Horner piece.Despite Fincher and Foster's work here, I can't help but feel disappointed by `The Panic Room' because of the oft-flimsy screenplay that failed to fully realise the movie's potential. The visuals and acting were good enough to distract me and let me gawp at their prettiness, but afterwards I was left a bit cold feeling Fincher's creative talents could be better spent on material that allowed him to expend all his energies. It's his work alone here that makes me add a few marks on to the movie to give it a 7.8/10.</fullReview>

SPOILERS AHEAD! when Meg and her child come to the house we see the mobile phone in closeup, when 3 guys come and rumble the bedroom we again see the mobile phone this time under the bed. even at that point im sure that it was clear in everyones mind that the phone would be useful in future situations. now where is the unpredictability? it was also very sentimental to see one of the robbers giving an insulin shot to the girl but hey this is all too much mainstream! even the camera movements cant make the film an exciting one. hope that Finch will regain his all-time-unpredictability in Mission Impossible 3..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't panic, but Fincher's lost the plot...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How fortunate that Jodie Foster happens to be wearing a tight white cleavage-inducing camisole and grey sports pants to bed on the night when three burglars come knocking. If she had chosen to wear a pair of snuggly Bridget Jones pyjamas as night clothes on the first night in her new home, then we wouldn't have a film would we?Whilst this is arguably a more aesthetically pleasing choice (particularly to the testosterone-fuelled males among the audience), it does represent a conformity to action movie formula and cliché which has satisfyingly lacked in David Fincher's previous efforts.It is not entirely clear why Foster and her pubescent daughter need quite so much space when they move in to a multi-storey town horse, but need it they do, and into the bargain comes an impenetrable `panic' room, into which our heroines retreat when said trio arrive. The problem though, is that their booty is in that very room. This ensues a war of guile and one-upmanship as both parties try to solve this immensely tricky conundrum.Given the rather limited premise and setting, it is testament to Fincher's directorial flair that he has created a strikingly visual film. ?Panic Room' is, at times, reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's ?Rope', as the camera pans through the building in long takes (engineered by hidden editing), showing us every corner of every room of the location.Unfortunately though, comparisons with the master end there, as Fincher fails to capture a sense of terror and suspense that pervade so much of Hitchcock's work. In fact the complete opposite is true, as the film becomes increasingly predictable and formulaic right up until its ridiculously clichéd climax.Indeed, to favourably compare ?Panic Room' with ?Rope' is not to tell the whole story, as it also whiffs of ?Alien' and, yes, ?Home Alone'. Jodie Foster's character, the strong female in distress, could easily be Sigourney Weaver's Ripley at home on planet Earth. Likewise, given that some of the burglars' behaviour borders on slapstick, it might just as well be Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci who represent what is, after all, a genuine threat to the lives of our two heroines.One would think that a straightforward premise would implicate a straightforward plot. Not the case. The film is as implausible as it is predictable. Details are skipped over for the sake of convenience so the movie is, in this sense, incredibly lazy. (Possible spoilers ahead.) Most of us can't even change a fuse but Foster can, it seems, make telephones. Why, into this `impenetrable' room, can gas be pumped from the outside? Why, by the same rationale, is there a small pipe that leads out to the Manhattan streets? Much of the content is a betrayal of the premise on which it is based.?Panic Room' is ultimately a fairly enjoyable film, but we expect more than that from Fincher. There are countless flaws that disappoint and annoy. Some blatant and shameless product placement for Sony and Evian water is a particularly difficult pill to swallow given the anti-consumerist themes of Fincher's previous movie ?Fight Club'.</fullReview>

The story wasn't really explained that well. Forest Witaker was good in it. You tend to loose interest after the first hour. For a movie that was suppose to be suspenseful, I wasn't frightened at all. Save yourself the trip and the seven bucks you would have paid to see it plus the money for the snacks and go rent a movie.

		<fullReview>When Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristin Stewart) move into a new house, they find their lives in danger on the very first night as 3 burglars break in, attempting to steal a large sum of money hidden in the houses' main selling point, the Panic Room. Of course, as soon as Meg sees the robbers, she grabs her kid and the 2 lock themselves inside the panic room. The robbers try just about everything to try and coax the two out of hiding. Of course, luck would have it, that the phone line inside the Panic Room has been disconnected and even after Ms Foster bravely exits the room to grab her cellphone they find that there is no reception. Even later we find out that the girl is a diabetic and her insulin level is dropping faster than Oprah would should she be jumping off a diving board. The robbers now enter the panic room with the girl still trapped inside and the mother just manages to throw her insulin injections into the room before the robbers close the door. It all comes down to an edge-of-your-seat climax as the courageous mother fights for her daughter's life and all hell breaks loose. Jodie Foster is brilliant as the mother and Forest Whittaker and Jared Leto play their stereotypical bad guy characters well. The suspense is built up nicely throughout the film and overall, is a great thriller worth seeing more than once. Even the opening credits are interesting!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good tense drama that keeps you watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminds me of Hitchcocks 'The Rear Window' where the same tense drama is developed through the story. The film also has some feel to the classic movie ?Wait Until Dark' where a blind woman played by Audrey Hepburn is subjected to a similar kind of ordeal. The tense drama that develops between Alton played by Jodie Foster and the three intruders is quite believable and therefore compelling to watch. Instinctive thinking in the face of adversity is well portrayed and makes this movie all that more watchable while giving it momentum. We are also shown the very dark side of people on one hand where cold-blooded killing is the norm and also the morally conscious person where protecting life is more important above anything else. Look out for the opening credits its so beautifully done!</fullReview>

Sadly, although 'Panic Room' is slick, I found the, 'lighting-the-gaseous-fumes scene' preposterous and the complex camera tracking moves over-employed.

		<fullReview>Panic Room had an interesting premise. A family consisting of a mother and daughter, have their home gangbusted by a group of thieves and hide in a room built to keep out any intruders from coming in. It had some suspense but at times dragged on. The acting was so-so, Foster was ok but has done much better work (Silence of the Lambs). The 3 thieves were bordering on comedic. Very bad acting. The ending also fizzled off too quickly. Overall a decent thriller with some good cinematography and suspense but nothing great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard but Solid Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mother and daughter move into a Manhattan apartment that has a small, tightly sealed, security sensitive 'panic room'. A room that is generally used by those who are rich and prominent, to hide out in when being invaded by intruders. Naturally, on their very first night there, the place is broken into and the two must use it.Generally solid, well paced thriller that avoids the claustrophobic feeling despite all the action taking place in one building. The building by the way was actually constructed on a sound stage, but done with such detail that you won't even notice the difference. You get a real good sense of it's dimensions because director Fincher literally glides the camera all through the place. It's almost like being a fly on the wall. It definitely gives the viewer the intended sense that the building, and especially the room, is like a third character.Foster and Swanson, who play the mother and daughter respectively, do a competent job. Foster gives her patented 'don't mess with me look' and Swanson seems very much like a young Jodie. Also the screenwriters make sure to ardently adhere to the first mandate of screenwriting 101, which is if you have a bunch of people trapped anywhere one of them must be a diabetic and in desperate need of a insulin shot.The crooks are actually the ones who become the 'stars'. Although they are not quite the complete clowns of HOME ALONE notary, they are still quite human. Their constant bickering is both lively and fun.The film builds quite nicely, but the ending seems a bit abrupt. There are also a few loose ends that go unanswered. Also there is a discrepancy involving a 911 operator that had several people in the theater verbally rolling their eyes (including a eight year old girl that was sitting right behind me).Despite a few flaws this a refreshing change of pace for a modern movie. The emphasis is on the suspense and not the special effects or violence.Foster was reportedly pregnant during the shoot, but they disguise it well, except for one really quick moment. Also the man sleeping in the apartment across the street is actually Andrew Kevin Walker. He was the screenwriter for SEVEN, another feature directed by Fincher.</fullReview>

No. Does his hand, when freed, resemble a piece of bloody paper? No. In fact, this indestructable guy get additionally whacked over the head with a sledgehammer, knocked over a bannister and still comes back for more, to be a serious threat. Ridiculous.And why, oh why,, just for once, can't the bad guys get away with it? Why did Forest Whittaker come back? Why not take off, and actually not be predictable? Using the morality thing, we know he was a 'good' character, didn't he deserve to get away with it?!This could've been such a good film....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of '02, so far. *MAJOR SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sign of a good movie for me is when I don't have to look at my watch once- (I looked at it over 10 times during A.I.- what does that tell you?!) Panic Room is a good non-watch-checking movie.It was extremely well-written; not boring at all and constantly increasing the tension as it goes on. The directing by David Fincher (Se7en) was excellent- while a lot of directors might consider a thriller "beneath them", and deliver very pedestrian efforts, Fincher invests in this movie giving really cool &amp; innovative camera shots (the keyhole shot, the CG assisted kitchen shot and the subtle-but-brilliant shot of the shadow behind Foster (the one on the poster).)The acting was very good. I was really surprised that *SPOILER* Jared Leto was killed off so soon, but I suppose Dwight Yoakam was really allowed to develop after this. After seeing Jodie Foster in this movie, I can't imagine Nicole Kidman playing the role. While Kidman was very good in The Others, this role really suited Foster. Kristen Stewart was brilliant, particularly encouraging her mother to tell the thieves to " get the f*** out of my house!" Forest Whitaker was also good- I was surprised he didn't get away at the end. Jared Leto was a bit annoying at first, but got better, and Yoakam was amusing delivering a couple of deadpan jokes.Very enjoyable film- it develops like a game of chess, each side getting a move and it's very suspenseful- especially Foster running for her cellphone. Poor old Patrick Bauchau got the s*** kicked into him! Anyhow, Fincher once again delivers. Excellent.</fullReview>

Annoying for the camera work (interesting at the beginning but tedious to watch the camera follow the propane going from the tank to the room, etc.)Annoying to be taken for idiots who don't know about diabetic shots (why didn't she just grab the bag in the fridge..noooo she had to show us the actual needle to make us understand that her daughter needed shots when her sugar level goes down..duh !!I could go on but the movie has already wasted enough of my time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If anyone can remember the famous 'Likely Lads' TV episode, whereby the lads go to great lengths to avoid knowing the England football result before they watch the highlights on TV, you'll know what I mean. This is very exciting (sad, I know) but I haven't seen a single review of this film; nor have I heard anything about it; nor did I get any vibes from the fellow audience (who numbered about ten in a large cinema).Basically, I wanted to write a review and not be swayed in any manner by other opinions. Well, here goes. What the hell was Jodie Foster doing in this load of old rubbish? I mean, 'Hannibal' was rubbish without her, so I guess she may have been making this movie at roughly the same time? Why? Why? Why? Is it meant to be a comedy or what? Even Jodie Foster's normally impeccable acting was reduced to mediocrity in this unbelievable tale of a so-called 'panic room'. The big mystery is why didn't they come out before carnage, mayhem, and bad lines abounded?! If the papers tomorrow rate this movie I'm an ITV Digital's Monkey's Uncle. I know that there are always some bits of a 'thriller' which are bound to contain far-fetched plot-lines, but I seemed to be doing five-bar gates of the flaws and running out of fingers after the first ten minutes. I did enjoy the credits, thankfully at the start of the movie where they belong; but, that aside, and I can think of no other credit-worthy points to make. It really was like an adult version of 'Home Alone', complete with daughter and mother; but the humour was more akin to the 'Carry On' series. Perhaps I'll discover, when I read other reviews on this site (as I managed not to peep once during navigation to this area), that I am in a minority, in which case I'll know I've gone completely loopy. The reason I wanted to see this movie was because I am not unfamiliar with the ability to have a good panic, but panic I did not. Thank God for the trailer of 'Killing me Softly'. At least I had a good gawk at my number one pin-up Heather Graham, but even that didn't improve my mood sufficiently to be able to enjoy this load of all codswallop!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains possible spoilers.This film never lets up. Of course, what film DOES let up in these days of the big pounding-sound track, retina-tattooing, senses-flooding filmic Experience? What gives this flick distinction is the excellence of the performances, the rapidity and intensity with which the challenges present themselves, and perhaps most important, the general level of verisimilitude/credibility of the events. (I only caught them on two questionable points: 1.the propane fire should have raged probably out of control, raising the temp. of flammable material in the area enough to combust it, and 2.the descent into diabetic coma seemed too slow/stretched for story's sake.)Forrest Whittaker is the heart of the film. Even if the rest of the film is too much for you, see it for his performance. We see his character-- a plodding career security company employee/nebbish who hopes to retrieve a dead man's millions from the safe room of an uninhabited house-- being sucked inexorably into something far more violent and ambitious than he can handle. From the first time we see him, a great bear of a man being danced circles around by his incessantly gibbering, candy-nosed accomplice, we sense his unbridgeable distance from the frenzied would-be brain of the expedition, and his doom; we begin to root for him, if only over his out-of-control accomplices. It is a sad, knowing performance, one wherein a single gaze speaks volumes. It forms an excellent companion piece to his role in Ghost Dog a couple of years ago.Ten stars. I wish all Hollywood's formulaic thrillers could be this good. --And if the movie-going public was a little more insightful and discerning, they might become so.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, the person who accompanied me to the film didn't want to wait out the credits. Did anyone sit all the way through?

I caught myself thinking "don't go there", "look out behind you", "no way would *I* do that". I came out of the movie very satisfied having seen a good story told well and acted well. And for the lovers of technology - go marvel at the incredible detail of the opening credits - the reflections in the windows, the perspective and shading of the lettering with the changes of ambient lighting - they look so real. And note also the startling camera work: especially note when the camera goes places cameras can't go, like through the handle of a coffee pot. Neat! Go see this movie - you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something's just off (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You expect more from David Fincher than this. You expect a kicking hard-rock soundtrack, and brutality that will have a revelatory aspect to it, as it did in Seven, the Game, and Fight Club. Most of all, you expect to be captivated by characters. I may have walked in a couple of minutes late (just as they were beginning the tour of the house) but something just felt off about Panic Room. Maybe it's the lead casting. After seeing what Nicole Kidman did with the Others, I can't help but wonder how she would have made the claustrophobia a lot more palpable in this film. (Shouldn't we be getting the feeling that living in a big house is a comfort to Meg given her claustrophobia, from the start?) Also, the relationship between her and Sarah seems really -- dead. I know she's just gone through a divorce, but you expect a little more honesty in the relationship between them. On the other hand, the three thugs are wonderfully cast. I had no way of imagining that Dwight Yoakam was the thug operating under that ski mask, and it is a welcome change to see Jared Leto as a sniveling know-it-all who finds himself (SPOILER) the least necessary of the trio.  You keep watching the film for Whitaker, however, and maybe that's where the problem comes in. Because the ending of this film seems even more unjust and less poetic than that of Seven. (SPOILERS) I for one left the theater wondering what the hell was the point of making this guy into the hero, fundamentally, who'd go and give the daughter an insulin shot to save her life, and then double back to save Meg at the end, only to end up damned.  (SPOILER) And also, when and where did all those cops come from? I mean, it might have made sense if the first duo had decided to stay staked outside the apartment and happened to see Whitaker coming out, but a friggin' SWAT team? What was that about? MY ALTERNATE ENDING: The best sequence in the film, and perhaps one that should have capped the entire movie, was the propane bit. That has to be saved until the end, planned by Burnham to take care of Raul AND Junior. Burnham knows, having designed the rooms, that she's got a lighter in there. So, he protests about the amount going in, knowing the two of them'll disagree. He tells them both to listen in, urging them to hear them coughing, and then backs away at just the right second. They both get burnt and collapse. Whitaker gets away with the money Junior had offered (but not the bearer bonds). The two cops arrive, with Meg's call having gotten through. Meg and Sarah get out OK, it would have been a much better flick. (Even better -- now the cop's doubt about her saying "there are three" makes even more sense, because he sees only two men lying on the ground, and Meg, with Burnham having given the insulin shot, denies the cop's claim. Burnham goes home, and Meg and Sarah decide to move to a smaller apartment, sans panic room.  Now, as the ending was, I and many others walked out having been somewhat thrilled but wondering what the heck was the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The point of this film is to ask yourself, what would I do in this situation? For the most part, Panic Room has us asking that question at a feverish pitch.David Fincher has a wonderful directorial style that ignores the physical limitations of the world (walls, floors, etc.) when describing the spaces the characters operate in. There is also an intensity of character focus which is more prevalent in his earlier films than in Panic Room. Unfortunately this intensity disappears about two-thirds of the way through the film, and the final third becomes run of the mill and predictable in both writing and direction. Present however is Fincher's usual play with colour.Despite several attempts at shoring up the main characters, the only one whose characterisation remains strong is Bhurman (Forrest Whittaker). Raoul (Dwight Yokam) changes from a frighteningly cold-blooded mercenary to a run-of-the-mill villain. Meg (Jodie Foster) seems weak throughout, and young Sarah (Kristen Stewart) is difficult to identify with as she portrays the stereotypical annoying teen.The verdict: this is a good film, not a great one. The first two thirds are a delight to watch for Fincher's direction, the last third is disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Wait Until Dark" everyday life-ness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I loved and can recommend most about this movie was that it had a sort of a "Wait Until Dark" kind of dark yet home, family, housewife, everyday life atmosphere. I think, in that sense, it was a quiet mystery rather than an action thriller. Also I really adored the Sarah (daughter) character. She reminds you of the very early Jodie Foster. I even thought that she was a boy for the first hour or so. The somewhat dry relationship between Sarah and her mother Meg (played by Foster) gives magic to the entire film, even though I'm not a real Foster fan. It's a movie that tells you "You can't lock yourself in and still survive".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crap. That´s my opinion about this one. The people who criticise Fincher often say that every other movie he makes is a bad one. So far it´s true. It feels like the producers say: "Hey it´s that guy who made "Fight Club", let´s give him lot´s of money and not read the script". As you probably know Foster moves in with her daughter in a new house. A big one for two people. 3 stories to be exact, and it isnt as if its a spooky dark house on top of a hill either. It´s a ordinary house. Except it´s got a Panic Room. Some bad guys break in so Meg and Sarah has to "hide themselves in the Panic Room" (you couldnt guess that one now could you). They sit in the Panic room for a little more than an hour and the bad guys try to break in. Wow. I really got scared. Mind you , there´s nothing wrong with the actors, (except for Foster who only has one facial expression and you can never hear what she´s saying), so see it if you want to see some good camera-work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Fincher should include in the DVD Extras the real ending!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's quite difficult to believe "Panic Room" as a creation of one of the most astonishing directors from nowadays: David Fincher. His path along the film industry has been followed by many newborn directors, trying to copy the style of Fincher's creations, like "Se7en" or "Fight Club". But David Fincher didn't exactly start from nothing. He begun working at the special effects crew in productions like "Return of the Jedi", "Never Ending Story" and "The Temple of Doom", in the ILM. Then, in 1992, he directed his first well-known film: "Alien3".Three years later, it started the "Fincher's fest": in 1995, "Se7en" came out from his imagination and became one of the best movies of the 90's. In 1997, "The Game", not as good as the 1995 production, but still on the Fincher's track. And two years later, the outstanding and incredible "Fight Club", who broke all the models in the film industry creating a new way of modern criticism. And here comes "Panic Room", starring a brilliant-as-always Jodie Foster and the typical creepy atmosphere of "The Game". Two things really original in the film: the starting credits (very original) and the camera movements, typical in Fincher's films: he will put the camera through the keyhole, the coffee pot handle or the wall, wherever he wants. A worth look. You should consider that this film is NOT like the other Fincher's creation. First, IT HAS NO TWIST ENDING AT ALL. If you're expecting some twist like the "Fight Club" one, you'll be extremely disappointed (like me for example). You should understand this movie like a new one, not like a following of the style of the other movies. Anyway, you wouldn't have had energy for a twist in the plot, because "Panic Room" really scares the crap out you! It keeps you at the edge of the seat during the 2 hours! It's true! Probably the most frightening movie from the last years. Maybe "Panic Room" could be compared to "Home Alone" but for adults, maybe the ending is quite predictable and poor (hey, think about "Planet of the Apes" for a bad ending), but it's a brilliant thriller with a creepy atmosphere, a lot of style, and created by David Fincher. "Panic Room" is very good way to spend your money and your time! Worth a look!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**SPOILER** Cringeworthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very average. Jodie Foster wears a low-cut tank top and has a lot of running and bending over scenes, while trying to play the strong, in-control mother protecting her daughter. Quite a mixed message. Much is made of her drinking before falling asleep, so that she doesn't hear three bumbling crooks breaking and entering, and walking around her house. Then she is awake and fully cognizant instantly, so that she can get into the panic room with her daughter. You will cringe often watching the crooks screw up, then watching Jodie and daughter react poorly, so that the movie plot can continue to unfold. The scene where she connects phone wires then tells her daughter she has no idea what she's doing is a perfect example (of course she hooks it up right and makes the call, while the criminal races to the basement to cut the line). After much melodrama it's all for nothing, as the loot just blows away into the night, and the "good" criminal gets caught anyway. Wait for it to play on television or rent it from the library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie wasn't scary, as some people would want you to believe it to be. However, I wasn't bored either. Plus, I got to see Jodie Foster who I thought was a looker in this movie.***Possible Spoiler***The film kept went on fast pace enough for me to keep my interest in. It was interesting to see a movie with mainly one background setting, which is the house. Then the focus was on one of the rooms called, "panic room", where the money was hidden.One of the "bad guys" in the movie is Forest Whitaker, who is responsible for building the house. What I didn't get was, if he knew where the panic room was, why didn't he stand guard in front of the room in the first place as soon as he found out that someone had moved in? He knew there was no way an intruder could brake in to the room. The result, the whole plot of the movie.Overall, I have to say this is one of the many slightly-above-mediocre movies that came out from the last decade. They just don't make the movies like they used to. As long as there are morons out there who approve of making "movies" like 'Freddy Got Fingered' and 'Dude Where's My Car?' (and who writes these garbage so called script???), being an average movie translates to a good movie going by today's standards. And no, I have not seen either of the movies. But you don't have to see the whole movie to draw a conclusion that the "movie" is a dud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen this movie yet, but a friend of mine told me about some of what happens, especially Foster's character's claustrophobia. Seems it really affects her at first, but once in the room that crippling affliction seems to be COMPLETELY gone, as if EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS PRODUCTION simply forgot to keep this affliction going. One does not overcome such an affliction like that (snapping of fingers)!I guess this goes to show that as long as an audience is taken for a roller coaster ride, logic be damned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but ultimately forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher's "Panic Room" traps and eventually buries itself under cliche and familiarity. Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman, who recently divorced from her husband and moves into a new house with her daughter (Kristen Stewart). Of course the first night in their new home, three burglars brake inside in pursuit of a missing fortune located in the panic room. Meg and her daughter, Sarah, hide in the panic room after the three men break into the home. Thus begins the cat-and-house game between the mother and daughter and the burglars. The definite highlights of the film are the camera movements and Foster's performance. The camera is extremely mobile, moving all around the house, through walls and along the ground. This adds to the sense of dread around the situation along with the claustrophobic feel of the house and panic room itself. This style perhaps allows the audience to get an even better idea of the surroundings than any of the actual characters in the film. Jodie Foster does a great job in a difficult role. She switches from a confused and weak protagonist to a smart and creative heroine in a split second and does it with the utmost ease imaginable. David Fincher films have always featured intentive camera work and dark source material and this is no different. The problem though relies in the fact that while Meg is a strong lead, the script allows for no other memorable roles only cliches. Forest Whitaker, a vert gifted actor, plays the bad guy with the noble intentions. Jared Leto (who was terrific in "Requiem For A Dream") is the over-the-top psychotic one and (country singer) Dwight Yoakam plays the evil one that never dies. Throughout the course of the movie Raoul (Yoakam) has his hand crushed in a metal door, and is bashed in the head and still keeps coming back for more. Foster's acting in "Panic Room" shows why she is one of Hollywood's best actresses and Fincher adds some dark touches. The film, however, bogs down under cliche to point where the whole film, especially the ending, leaves an empty feeling inside. A 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable but flimsy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I'll start by saying that I expected more from David Fincher. Se7en and Fight Club are two of the finest (albeit disturbing) films to have been made in years.Yes, the plot is a bit flimsy, with some gaping holes. I also didn't feel that the film was terribly suspenseful, but I may just be jaded. On the other hand, the cinematography was excellent, as were most of the actors, and I was never bored as some here have said.There was one major technical flaw that I want to delve into, since I haven't seen anyone else mention it, and just 'cause I'm that way. Critical, that is.The entire episode with the propane tank was completely impossible. Firstly, because propane tanks require a special hose with a valve in order to release the propane, you can't just duct-tape a garden hose onto them. Secondly, propane is heavier than air; it would have gone to the floor of the panic room, not remained at the top. And thirdly, propane has an (highly effective) odourant added to it for safety reasons, Jodie would not have had to stick her nose into the air duct to know she was being gassed.No, I am not a real-life Hank Hill, anyone who owns a propane grill should know these facts.All that aside, I did enjoy the film overall, although I may have preferredto watch it on DVD at home. I'd give it a 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diabetes portrayed properly - ggraham-2 of Lincoln, Nebraska is incorrect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just wanted to respond to ggraham-2 of Lincoln, Nebraska, who must have missed the bit in the film where Forrest Whittaker asks Sarah which needle she needs. To which Sarah shakes her head at the insulin and when he picks up the orange emergency case containing pure glucose in a needle Sarah nods. Being a diabetic I was happy to see low blood sugar finally being treated properly in a movie. Low blood sugar/insulin shock means the body has too much insulin and will crash if sugar/glucose is not administered immediately. Forrest gave Sarah the right shot - he gave her pure glucose. Now, if you want to see how to not correct low blood sugar/insulin shock just rent ConAir because Nicolas Cage is trying throughout the whole movie to get a needle to give his buddy an insulin shot to correct that fact that he hasn't eaten (low blood sugar/insulin shock). Wrong. Nicolas would kill the guy if he gave him insulin. Anyway, I liked Panic Room with or without the diabetic angle. I do want to know where to get the glucose monitoring watch Sarah wears in the movie but I'm assuming it's a movie prop because my searches have only brought up one glucose watch and it looks nothing like Sarah's sleek sporty watch. Thanks, Laura</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lured into the Panic Room by a catchy trailer. It is, in fact, a catchy movie. Set in a large, old, New York brownstone which had been previously owned by an eccentric old man(unseen) with a eye on security, the film is shot in drab grays, primarily on a stormy night.Claustrophobic mom Meg Altman(Jodie Foster) and her angsty daughter Sarah(played very well by Kristen Stewart)try to get a good night's sleep in this altogether too large apartment. Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto &amp; Dwight Yokam(again cast as the 'baddy' - see also SlingBlade) play the unseemly trio bent on disurbing the peace.The film works on the level of the filmaker's careful use of camera angles, stark lighting and good editing. But the fatal flaw, is too much detail at the beginning about the Panic Room itself.I don't like movies which lay out too much 'could go wrong' at the beginning. It would have been just as effective to 'mention' the panic room as the real estate selling factor and not give it so much weight at the very beginning, thereby setting the scene for the entire movie. Most movie goers are sophisticated enough to put the pieces together without gratuitous information.Would I recommend it? YES, definitely. It does a good job of making you wonder how it will turn out, despite some cloying 'giveaway' details.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very intense, but also a good character movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was thrilling as well as it was a good drama. Jodie Foster does an outstanding job as per usual as Meg Altman. Forest Whitaker also does a great job as the reluctant villian. Sure, the character is a little cliche (bad guy who doesn't want to be bad but has to for someone he cares about), but that didn't matter to me, because he did a great job none the less. Great acting, and some heart stopping intensity makes this the best thriller I've seen in a couple of years.I think that Kristen Stewart did an exceptional job as Jodie Foster's angry and sarcastic daughter Sarah (another a cliche character, but once again, played to perfection), who has to hide out in the panic room with her mom. Dwight Yoakam steals the show as the mysteriously scary robber Raoul, who remains an enigma through the whole movie. Raoul is the violent and mentally unstable (of course!) thief, would have no problem blowing away Meg and her Daughter. This movie takes some pretty scary turns here and there, with a lot of slow motion running and getting away in the nick of time.I have to admit that I went in to the theatre with low expectations (it was a Sunday and I was bored, so I grabbed a friend and went to the movies), but I was pleasantly surprised when I left. There was action, a little comedy, and non stop thrills, which is usually what I like about a movie, besides great acting, but it has that too! I recommend this to everyone who doesn't mind a good deal of violence, and isn't claustrophobic. Enjoy! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typical Hollywood fare with all the thrills and implausibilities intact. We have one character who gets his hand caught in a heavy steel door for minutes on end, gets shot and falls down a steep staircase, yet still manages to crawl back up the stairs to wield an axe at the heroine. We have a wealthy housewife from Connecticut who can figure out how to strip an outside phone line and connect it to her cell phone. If you're interested in yet another movie that asks the question, "will Jodie outwit the bad guys?" (and is there ever any doubt?) then this movie is for you. The pluses: the opening credits are some of the most amazing I've seen. The photographic angles are also breathtaking - Fincher takes you inside the phone line, inside the key hole, etc. Whatever you do, don't see it alone.</fullReview>

Because, for chrissake, it's Dwight Yoakam! The dorky old guy that sings country and has that music video where he and the band are all bouncing on trampolines, complete with bouncing instruments including a grand piano! A grand piano!! At least, I'm pretty sure that's Dwight Yoakam. It's either him or the Mavericks, it's been a while since I've watched CMT :P."After that, it gets irrelevant to the movie, but I think it expresses my opinions better than I could do it now because it's how I felt half an hour after seeing the movie, and if that's not an accurate depiction of my opinion, I don't know what would be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trespassing the house is the main factor to ignite the plot, once it happens at the very first minutes of the movie and immediately provides suspenseful moments. This perspective is different in relation to some other Thriller movies, where tension progressively rises up as time passes. Throughout the film, we can notice constant changes between extremely suspenseful moments and other not so much ones, in which characters stop to brainstorm the next step to be taken and serve as "refreshments" for spectators. This can be considered as a real psychological Thriller, once an interesting "action and reaction game" is created by taking into account all various elements featured in the plot.

		<fullReview>Panic Room is not a bad film by any means, but it does suffer somewhat from a mediocre script, thin characterization and a lackluster ending.The main problem I have with Panic Room is the performance of the three thieves. They enter the film like The Three Stooges, immediately undermining the tension that their entrance generates. I mean, for the film to work as strongly as it could, they should be a major threat, but instead they enter the film while bickering like a bunch of numbskulls. And two of them even think they can break through concrete and three inch steel with a sledgehammer. You're dealing with mental midgets here.Stupidest of the three is Leto's character. He doesn't know how escrow works, he puts his head against the wall when Foster is about to ignite the gas they're pumping into the panic room, he shouts at a PA system and he exposes his plan to screw over his fellow burglars simply by talking to himself. The extent of his stupidity is really too much to ask of an audience with any intelligence and his whole character smacks of lazy writing.But thankfully Leto's character gets shot halfway through. And his killing is nicely done. It's quick, it's brutal and it allows the unhinged Raoul to step up to the plate as the main villain. And although Raoul is a knob and a bit of a rent a psycho, he does seem like a genuine threat. And it's even more impressive considering that the actor who plays him, Dwight Yoakam, is a country music star. He may sing hick music, but he turns in a superb performance.But although Yoakam is excellent, the film easily belongs to Foster. She's strong, she's resourceful and she's entirely believable as a mother who'll blow your head off if you mess around with her kid. After all, is there anything more dangerous than a mother backed into a corner? Personally I'd rather take on a 6 foot 4, 300-pound, bum-hungry redneck called Bubba than a 5 foot 4 woman who wants to defend her kid. The burglars should have left the second they realized they were dealing with a 'mom'.However, while I can easily believe in Foster managing to wrestle a gun off of the psychotic Raoul (again illustrating how stupid the thieves are, Raoul at one point tells her to come out of hiding so he can shoot her and get things over. Didn't he ever have a mum?), her MacGyver routine stretches credibility ? igniting the gas is fair enough, but there's one bit where she somehow hooks up the phone line. She even says, "I have no idea" when her daughter asks her what she's doing. It's obvious that Koepp (the writer) has written himself into a corner and this is the result: suddenly she's a phone expert. But I'm willing to overlook these sorts of things as Fincher gives us ample opportunity to stare at Foster's cleavage when things get silly. It was actually an excellent decision to have her spend virtually the whole film in a black vest, as you're never too far from jiggling breasts, which is fair compensation for gaps in logic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Fincher's Most Underrated Film, Arguably.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of Se7en &amp; Fight Club, Panic Room arrives as another intensely gripping, nail- biting &amp; edge-of-the-seat experience from David Fincher which further solidifies his position as one of the modern masters of thrillers, and beautifully balances its style with substance to succeed as one of the most captivating, entertaining &amp; satisfying works of Fincher's career.Set in New York City, the story of Panic Room concerns a recently divorced mother &amp; her 11-year old daughter who purchase a new house which comes equipped with a safe room in case the security is breached. But on the very first night, three burglars break into their house in search for a missing fortune which is present in the very room where the two ladies are now hiding.Directed by David Fincher, the film quickly sets up its plot &amp; from there on handles its suspense amazingly well throughout its runtime. Screenplay is brilliantly penned down by David Koepp, cinematography is quality stuff that comes very much influenced from Fincher's last film, editing keeps the narrative tightly structured, &amp; Howard Shore's score takes its tense ambiance to a nerve-wracking level.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Jodie Foster, Kristen Stewart, Forest Whitaker &amp; Jared Leto, who all chip in with fabulous performances. Foster is undoubtedly the most impressive of them all but Whitaker isn't far behind while Leto is near unrecognizable in his role. Also, the film makes extensive use of visual effects, including CGI, but it is executed in a very subtle manner which could easily go unnoticed.On an overall scale, Panic Room is a masterly executed thriller that has Fincher's trademarks signed all over it &amp; is effective enough to qualify as one of the best films of its year. It may not be counted amongst the director's finest works but that's no indication of it being any lesser in quality than others. Arguably his most underrated work along with The Game, Panic Room comes strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher's style brought to fruition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic Room remains sleek, trim and well-executed right through to its conclusion. For some cinematic snobs, the film seems to be too neatly wrapped up. However, thanks to the very stylistic and innovative direction of David Fincher and solid performances from Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart, this film holds tension for as long as thrillers do, and then some.The premise is as simple as can be: a mother and daughter move into a new Manhattan home, three men break in one night while the two women protect themselves in the home's panic room and shut the burglars out. This classic chess-like standoff allows for several breath-holding moments made even better by a brooding Howard Shore score and some of the most amazing camera work ever put on film. Fincher went even further than his excellent work in Fight Club to combine CGI with Steadicam style to give us a virtual tour of the house, allowing us to understand its every dimension as it is the only set used. Adding to this tension is strong acting from Jodie Foster as the everywoman, capable of sticking up for herself and her safety along with Kristen Stewart as her wisecracking daughter, Forrest Whitaker as a morally centered burglar, Jared Leto as a whacked-out greedy one and Dwight Yoakam as a psychotic gun-toting accomplice.If you are searching for simple entertainment, thrilling sequences and solid performances, this has that and more. The material is lifted out of the doldrums of mediocrity by David Fincher's brilliance of pacing, shot choice, angles and swirling camera moves that will make you ask, "how did they do that?" Of course, by the end, you will be too busy trying to catch your breath to answer that question.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a nice neat thriller. The claustrophobic setting allows us to focus purely on the lead characters and motivations and actions with no extraneous distractions.The acting is good as you'd expect with the adult cast but even the child, Stewart, is watchable. With the sick daughter the danger was that this would become maudlin and emotional but it avoids that, the danger to her health is simply used to crank up the pressure as the film progresses.There are a few twists as hope is stripped from the pair in the panic room and as the criminals realise they won't be having everything their own way. There are some pieces of action throughout although the action mostly takes a back seat to the build up of tension.Over all there are enough surprises to keep you interested and the ending, although predictable, is done well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Panic Room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic Room is a disappointing film by David Fincher, who turns to be an inconsistent director. Simply put, it doesn't utilize it's true potential. Here's why.First of all the claustrophobic settings are used to little effect, apart from maybe the scenes where the burglars fill the panic room with gas, and the one with Altman trying to get out to fetch the medicine for her daughter. Then the reverse situation with Altman out and the burglars in is still not used to full effect.Then we have the slight irony of the security cameras. As the burglars break in, Altman and her daughter watch as the intruders move around their house. Not terribly sharp, but a nice touch nonetheless in this age of reality shows et all.Finally there seems to be a very faint touch of symbolism, with the money hidden in the bourgeois mansion inhabited by it's upper class denizens, the lower class burglars breaking in, the most humane of them almost making it, but then surrendering to the police. The final scene with the money flying in the air is nice.But despite Fincher's hints at what could be social commentary, this is mostly a generic action thriller, deplete with Hollywood-type slow motion scenes etc. It does show though Fincher's evolution as a director, using some fairly elaborate angles and shots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if this has any spoilers, but to be on the safe side...! I agree with most, this film severely lacks the potential you expect from Jodie Foster. The first act (prior to them going in) is basically just moping about. It kept coming back to me how a single mother can afford this cavernous mansion in Manhattan. I cracked up when the daughter (it took me a while to realise it was a girl) said, "What's going on?" or whatever and Mum replies, "People in the house" or something. Just in case she didn't spot the armed men, one of whom has a balaclava on, right in front of them. Well, duh! It's such a slow film - sure the photography is okay but the music is too dramatic. The music reminds me of "Silence of the Lambs" but without the tension.The characters are inconsistent (well, the one with the braided hair who swears a lot).The film is on in the background now and I lost interest just before she ran and got the cellphone.The other half is enjoying it but honestly, after reading some of the reviews on here, I'm not going to waste my time!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With David Fincher in the Directors chair, you could be forgiven for expecting a masterpiece (Given his previous successes), Panic room however, is no masterpiece it is just a good Thriller.Trapped in a Panic Room in their new home, Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her Daughter Sarah, are caught up in a game of Cat and Mouse with a team of Burglars who just want the money that is hidden there. Trouble is its hidden in the Panic Room.Originally expecting an empty house, the criminals are left without a plan, but still remain defiant in the face of defeat.With some Creepy and Dark Direction, and a solid cast. Panic room turns to be a good thriller, and sadly nothing more.8/10</fullReview>

The film had standout performances from Jodie Foster, Jared Leto and Forest Whitaker. While Dwight Yoakam and Kristen Stewart are worth a mention too. The flashy camera work was quite unique and stunning, well all of Finchers films have great cinematography.The dark atmosphere of dread was top-notch, the score was okay, but under all that gloss it's still just an average thriller. The story brought nothing new to the genre, at times it was too predictable and the pace had its flat moments- but I truly didn't care for most of the characters (except for Whitaker's) and the films ending felt like a deflated cop out. 3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of those summer movies that you did not expect much from. It seemed like a rather inane plot and simple story. However, few could have imagined the truly great performances handed in, primarily by the bad guys here. Jared Leto is incredible as the weasel in charge of this criminal operation. Moreover, Dwight Yoakum, who is always great, turns in both a funny and evil performance. Couple this with the performances of Jodi Foster and Forrest Whittaker, and you got a movie. One does not need a great great story, when you have big time talent to tell it. The story involves a heist of an old house occupied by Foster and her daughter. However, what the bad guys need, is locked in the safest room in the house, which also happens to be where Foster and her daughter are locked in. That is the premise, you will have to watch the rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jodie Foster, is not only a very intelligent lady, but also a fine actress and I wonder what she was doing in this mediocre movie. The opening scenes, with a fast traveling camera and techniques similar to those used in computer games,create expectations which are only partially fulfilled.After a short while, the plot becomes far too predictable. Furthermore, the ongoing discussions between the three intruders and the difficulties they encounter are somewhat comical at times, to the extent that one is inadvertently reminded of similar occurrences in comedy features such as "Home Alone". The climax offers no specific impact as it contains no real elements of surprise. The movie lacks tension and one views it therefore with a constant feeling of slight boredom and disinterest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Fincher is a very inventive director (Seven, The Game and Fight Club), and I really expected more from him with Panic Room. It's stylish and suspenseful, but not quite as good as I hoped. Decent acting all around, and a fairly good script. But there are no ending revelations or shocking surprises, what you see is what you get. It was definitely better than Alien 3, but aside from that I think this is probably my least favorite of Fincher movie. Overall I give it **1/2 out of four stars...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and Sloppy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: although I don't spoil the end of the movie, I do mention a number of things that happen in the movie. If you don't want to be spoiled, skip this review.My wife is diabetic. She absolutely flipped over how the film messed up the plot surrounding the girl's diabetes. While locked in the room, Jodie Foster and the girl spend some time looking for a candy bar or something with sugar. The glucose meter the girl is wearing shows her blood sugar is dropping. The refridgerator in the girl's room shows the bottle of insulin. So, the girl's sugar is dropping. What does the mother do? Try to get her insulin. Ummm... sorry, that would kill her! Insulin drops blood sugar levels. What she needed was to eat something with sugar in it. It's possible that the syringe that is eventually given to the girl is actually full of a glucose solution, but this wasn't mentioned in the film and not supported by shots of the interior of the fridge. Besides, glucose has to be shot into the blood stream while Forest Whitaker's character was told how to shoot insulin, which can _not_ be injected into the blood stream.The fact that the movie got a fairly easy to research thing like this wrong shows its sloppy nature. It's just as sloppy with foreshadowing. Insulin in the fridge? The girl is going to have trouble with her diabetes while locked in the room (you can figure this out before the home invasion even begins). Call to her ex-husband? He'll end up showing up. One of the thieves is troubled with his conscience at the film's beginning? He's the guy who will end up saving things in the end.Film characters in desperate situations -- if they are not portrayed as stupid -- have to act smarter than us. When we can think of things to do that they can't, we feel cheated. If the woman and daughter in the room can see the bad guys, they know where all the bad guys are located. So, why didn't they take several opportunities when they saw the bad guys were occupied to open the door, dial out, call 911 quickly, and then shut the door? Why couldn't they fashion an antenna from all the wire in the room and hang it out the ventilation pipe?It made for a rather disappointing film. The acting isn't too bad, but I've seen Foster and Whitacker in other things where they were much better. It's not a horrible movie, just not one of the better options out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start? A builder who doesn't know his own product (Mr Whittaker doesn't seem know about the intercom in the room outside the panic room door), a diabetic using an antique hypo (she'd use a spring loaded one, these are designed for kids!) also she's a diabetic who doesn't carry chocolate and her mother doesn't either? I think not! the fact that the diabetic info is introduced so LATE in the film, prior to that most of us would have thought they just keep checking her watch to see how long it takes the police to come, 911 put her on hold? Please, don't insult us! The room only has 1 method of entry for air (the being gassed scene), wouldn't they have a back-up? This IS an enclosed room/tomb for flips sake! And why IS Raul there anyway, can anyone tell me? Did the robbers not think to put the cameras out of action? (another mistake by forest w!) The film is SO inconsistent, it made me feel lots was cut but it didn't help the movie at all. Also, this is a single parent family in America who don't own a gun? They may not OWN a gun but Foster seems to be able to use one OK. Forest is supposed to be a builder of panic rooms, I think he's just an assistant, or even an assistant to an assistant. Why foster didn't indicate to the police like they asked her is beyond me, the villains wouldn't have seen her make any sign, she had her back to them. Poor film, poorly planned and scripted. Foster and Whittaker should have avoided this. Director of film, be ashamed of this poor excuse for a movie!</fullReview>

While you never know how the story would twist in his former works, the script of Panic Room is a regular Hollywood thriller like 1000 others that keeps you minimally attracted from the beginning to the end (the end of the movie is probably the most disappointing - you would expect some final, unexpected twist, but nothing). The only thing that is really excellent is the movement and the viewpoints of the camera - a Fincher feature one is used to since Fight Club.

		<shortDescription>Claustrophobic Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Panic Room" directed by David Fincher, tries to copy the style of Alfred Hitchcock. It is a creepy dark old house movie that contains many twists and turns in its plot, and holds a few surprises as well. Meg Altman (Jodie Foster)is separated and has moved into a large old brownstone town house with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart), formerly owned by an eccentric and paranoid multi-millionaire. The furniture has not all arrived and many boxes remain unpacked. In the house, the former owner had built a "panic room", a room that could be sealed off from the rest of the house and hide the residents if danger threatened. As luck would have it, three burglars intent on finding a large amount of hidden cash left by the former owner, break into the house. Burnham (Forest Whitaker) was the man who designed and built the panic room. Junior (Jared Leto) had worked for the eccentric. Junior has brought along a mysterious brooding and masked third member, Raoul (Dwight Yoakum) to help out. Of course, mother and daughter flee to the panic room and most of the rest of the film deals with the cat and mouse games played to get them to open the door.  Burnham just wants to get the loot. Junior harbors a secret and Raoul is a ticking time bomb. Meanwhile Meg's ex-husband Stephen who had been alerted by Meg before communication was cut off, arrives on the scene and is used by the criminals to coax the women out of the room. Finally, Meg is tricked out into the open and the crooks gain entry to the panic room. Then we learn that Sarah, who is still inside, has an unnamed illness which requires her to have an injection to survive. But how will she get her injection? By the way, this "illness" suggests diabetes although the disease is never mentioned. An injection of insulin would require a specific measured dosage and the patient would have to eat something immediately after the injection. In the film Sarah, appears to be given a pre-mixed injection but does not have anything to eat. If this was the case, she would have relapsed into the comatose like state she was in before. Anyway, eventually everything is sorted out and justice prevails. Jodie Foster is excellent as always and young Kristen Stewart does Ok as Sarah. Whitaker is good as the bad guy with a conscience, Leto is suitably sleazy as Junior but country crooner Yoakum is positively frightening as the psychopathic Raoul.  "Panic Room" is a pretty good claustrophobic thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the overly narrative previews which reveal too much, I decided early that this probably wasn't a film I intended to see . . . then I saw Howard Shore's name on it. Directed by David Fincher, an entertaining director. Vastly overrated, but not bad by any means. Just a second for the previews--how are films supposed to shock audiences now with trailers that tell all? The fact .5 second clips that are all strung together when viewed endlessly on every new film and every commercial tells a lot more than trailer editors will want to give their audience credit for. Not a one surprise in this film.Beyond the trailer, on to the film itself. The opening credits bothered me, though many people seemed amazed at the ability to incorporate CG text into the architecture of various buildings. They don't really do anything for the mood, and I didn't feel they belonged in this movie about the inside of an apartment building. We get a tour of the apartment to get a feel for geography, a few cliche elements that this film could not survive without (medical condition, newness to the area) then soon the stage is set for the scenario after which the film gets its name.The villain Raoul struck me as a cliche 'real' bad guy thrown in because the script required his presense; he came across as nothing more than a gimmick in his portrayal. People die when you expect them to, exactly as formulated in many many films before this one. The film goes completely quiet on cue in an attempt to crank up the suspence of one particular tight moment, but it just comes off as an awkward plagerism of technique that never quite works for Panic Room. Like many of the plot elements, even the humor would have worked 20+ years ago when it would've been -more- original. As a result, it's just tired. Panic Room does sport a few good performances, an interesting score, and some very nice camera work, and in places tries to be more than it can be. I give it credit for trying, but in the end it's about average with the pack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. The spectrum of comments this film elicits should give you a clue that you're going to have to decide for yourself. To address some of those comments:For hard-core David Fincher fans -- Yes, it's probably his worst work. I blame the script, and I'm not sure why it interested him to begin with. But if you do "Se7en," "The Game," and "Fight Club," eventually you will come up against a script that, while interesting, does not lend itself to visual exploitation. And here it is.For hard-core action fans -- The whole thing takes place in a house. What did you expect, Lethal Weapon? Sometimes, action intensifies BECAUSE it takes place in cramped quarters. If you don't dig that, fine. But this film never promised anything else.For the idiot who sees this film as a racist rape warning (I can't be bothered listing his name) -- If you're looking at a white guy in cornrows as proof as racism, you really need to finish graduate school and get out into the real world. Even Freud conceded that sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. If there were no black characters, you would have bitched about that. In fact, the black guy comes off as perhaps the most humane character in the film, in terms of what he sacrifices to make things right. Keep voting Democrat, but dude, get off your high horse. You're way off base.So, beyond that, it's still a fun film worth watching. I figured it would be better. It wasn't, but that doesn't mean it's not good. It is. So enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I could think of something passionate to say one way or the other about this movie, but in my view it's just a very run of the mill thriller in which a couple of good actors are wasted. Everything is predictable; the tension barely simmers. Watchable, not nothing special. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe the positive reviews people have given this film. I am a great admirer of both Se7en and Fight Club (and Jodie Foster), so I had great expectations here. What a disappointment! It proves again that even a talented director and star can't save a lame script so full of ridiculousness that my husband and I laughed out loud. The huge plot holes have already been covered by others here, so I won't belabor them, but come on . . . especially the scene in which the police finally show up, yet our plucky Meg sends them away with nary a blink. Ye gods. One saving grace was the mention of Joe Pesci--better to be upfront about "Home Alone:the Dark Side" than not, I guess. Fincher's style couldn't save this black-hole of a script, but I doubt anything could. Sad. Sad. Sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers.no matter how great the directing is, if the film has a bad script, there is nothing one can do to save it. The 'baddies' in the movie are similar to the guys in 'Home Alone'; just plain stupid. When Jodie was smashing all the cameras and one of the guy said, "now why didn't we think of that" gives big indication of bad script writing. But considering the person that did the script also am responsible for Jarassic Park, I guess it is expected. David's direction is not bad, he attempted to bring in a few interesting shots and camera angles, but the 'computer generated' effect is alittle too obvious. If we are to talk about suspense and tension build ups, it is still a long way from the standards of Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry, but I, too, found this movie rather trashy, predictable and slow in moving along the plot. Not much you can do when you're locked in a room waiting for villains to leave. Unless there is character development and twists in the plot. None of which happened in this sad flick. What a waste of Jody Foster's talent and why would she do this?

		<fullReview>A bad film for Jodie Foster, because Fincher try to gave her a sex-appeal she never really had. It was easy to understand, when you know, that first Nicole Kidman should play the mainrule. That would be an other film (but it was better for her to take "The Others" another film who played in one house... but with ghosts...) Fincher was not a good director, and the question of morality, that is the important question in a film with Foster, was not clear enough. One of the gangsters look like Fincher himself. That say much about this film. The idea to take one house and make a suspense about the inside or outside of one room was very good, but the irritation of the famous camera-moving is only in the beginning. The film is in the end a convention and take not care enough for the daughter. We know not enough about her. I don't like it and wish that Foster would make a better film in the future - perhaps together with N.Kinski, because "Hotel New Hampshire and "Accused" are much more important than the buissneß of "The Silence of the Lambs" who make "Panic Room" possible.

		<fullReview>Panic Room comes from the genius that is David Fincher. He is yet to make a movie as strong as Se7en (a dark, depressing yet brilliant film). So people who think they will witness something as earth-shattering as that will be disappointed. However, Fincher once again proves he is a master of suspense with the throughly engaging, yet predictable movie Panic Room. Jodie Foster is a woman who moves into an incredible new apartment in New York with her teenage daughter. Once certain plot points are introduced (and I am careful not to reveal too much) you know certain things must happen. Foster's daughter has an illness, so we know that later on her illness is going to play a factor. When the intruders are introduced, you know who is going to turn on who and who is going to have to go from bad guy to good guy. David Koepp's script is nothing special. It's effective, it serves its purpose, but you are not going to remember this movie based on the story. I thought all the actors involved were good (Foster and Forrest Whitaker were the standouts), but the star of this movie is David Fincher. From the opening credits, Panic Room is an exercise in style. Fincher knows how to make effective use of shadows, darkness, dim lights, and ultra cool camera shots. This is what makes Panic Room fun. Hitchcock would've been proud. But he wouldn't have made this unless he had a better script. Nonetheless, the movie is a treat....a mindless, buttery popcorn treat. But hey, isn't that why we go to the movies? 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but that is about all. I was a little disappointed after seeing this film. (SPOILERS): I was expecting some big plot twist at the end, but there really wasn't. We get a mean Dwight Yokum, but he just wasn't one of those villains you love to hate. I thought there was a lot of filler that wasn't to entertaining like them shining a light out of the toilet and trying to get a cell phone and such what. Were we supposed to see Forrest Whitaker as the potential "hero" just because he gave the kid the glucose shot and acting like he didn't really want to rob the place once he found out people were home. He agreed to do something illegal, so he should get whats coming to him. Which I guess he sort of does at the end? (END OF SPOILERS)FINAL VERDICT: You may like Panic Room if you are a Jodie Foster fan, but it really is to predictable to hold the interest of the casual movie fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it inconceivable that people are comparing this dull film to the testosterone/adrenaline charged masterpiece that is Fight Club. Whereas Fight Club had a message and allowed grown men to fantasize about being supermasculine individuals; all we get from Panic Room is an annoying control freak in Jodie Foster (writhe in annoyance at her pseudo-phobic bark for the estate agent to open the door to the Panic Room) who is the typical woman scorned trying to reassert some Oestrogen induced inferiority complex turnaround. And as for the daughter, her character was simply 'I am mature and cool and rebellious' without any vulnerability until it is thrown at us in bucketloads when she starts convulsing. A film about a room in a posh house. Wow. Fightclub was visually stunning and powerful, I wanted to leave the cinema and beat up some streetkids, but Panic Room left me annoyed at Jodie Foster....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen this, I can honestly say that it's one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen so far. I thought it was going to be amazing and beautifully crafted, but unfortunately it wasn't. It has such a ridiculous plot, this movie is called "Panic Room", but I don't understand why it's called like that; it was supposed to be called "Safety Room" or whatever.I'm really sorry that Jodie Foster couldn't save it even a little. Her performance wasn't as outstanding as it was when she portrayed Clarice in "The Silence of the Lambs". I expected more from her performance. The acting wasn't convincing at all. It was terrible. I wasn't scared at all throughout the whole movie, especially when Jodie Foster and her daughter screamed; I considered it was funny, they didn't really know how to make their performances believable. I have no clue what's wrong with Jodie Foster; maybe she's tired of movies. Anyway the acting wasn't the only bad thing in this movie: the ending was disappointing as well and it was so predictable and foolish. I can't believe I thought it was going to be interesting. Now I see how wrong I was. Overall, I'd not recommend this movie to anybody even though it features Jodie Foster. Since the house was good looking and dark and also it had some touches of good suspense I rate it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that has a camera that can go anywhere!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film. It wasn't by any means exceptional, but nevertheless original.Jodie Foster, who is looking slightly older then I expected, played a very good part. So did Forest Whitaker, Yoakam Dwight and Leto Jared. If you have read any other review, then the first thing that was probably mentioned was the camera work. Let me say that in parts this is exceptional. Very similar to some of the stuff used in Fight Club (remember the scene at the beginning inside the brain and the shot of the camera going down the sight of the gun). It is not as distinctive as the trick started by the Matrix, which has been copied over and over but is just as impressive. Each time the camera moves to focus on something or moves through a wall and even at one point into a lock, you really feel the smoothness and the effort it tries to give you. Equally impressive is the script and acting although I have to say the script is very simple but with a few genuinely funny one liners. The film feels in some places very run-of-the-mill and the end although it could have been a lot worse, but it doesn't give you any surprises. I also expected it to be tenser than it was. Don't get me wrong it isn't boring but it seems to go through the motions rather than throw anything unexpected at you. With the dark lighting, good script, excellent camera work and Jodie Foster this film is worth seeing. Without David Fincher behind the camera it could have been awful. Just don't expect too much, this is not Seven, or Fight Club6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tense, inventive, suspenseful thriller puts a clever spin on the game of hide and seek. Foster stars as a divorced mother who, along with her daughter, moves into a new house with a state-of-the-art hiding room. Ironically enough, the room comes in handy when a trio of burglars break into their new home on the very first night. A simple burglary turns into an exciting cat and mouse game when they learn that the burglars want access to the room. Rock solid performances, Fincher's savvy direction, and creative plot twists are enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. The only thing it lacks is a really good, sound finale, but by that point you won't so much mind. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't repeat the plot - 390 other people seem to have done that already.SPOILERS AHEADBut I agree with the gripes about the ending - there was a moment, right at the end, when the movie theater went completely, hear-a-pin-drop silent, and THAT's when I thought Fincher should have ended Panic Room. You'll know it if you've seen it - Jodie, camera draws in to a close-up, rain hammering down, her eyes wide, nothing else but the eyes, then darkness ... and BAM! That's where I wanted the credits. Sadly, we get a lukewarm coda that is a classic case of a studio losing its nerve and attempting a lame, feel-good ending.Hey, it was a lot better than most of the crap I've seen at the cinema recently. And no, it's not a classic - if you're so inclined, it'd be easy to spend the film looking for plot holes to snigger about. But I didn't - I spent the film happily peering down Jodie Foster's cleavage, wondering what I'd have done if I were each of the characters (I decided that if I were the villains, I'd have made it look like I'd left the building ... been entirely silent and then jumped her when she opened the door. Would have worked, 100%). The film would have been MUCH more creepy if the bad guys had all been cold, efficient and businesslike (as they would surely have been in real life). Instead we got two comedy cliche bad guys and a stereotyped pull-at-your-heartstrings bad guy (Forrest W), about whom we all care a lot more in the end (frustratingly, this emotion is never paid back and we're left wondering - which brings us back to the end. We get the "that's OK then" feeling for the Mum and her kid, but not for the one person we're really rooting for) ...Anyway, I gave it 7. In a better year, it'd get 5.5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: there may be plot spoilers in this review.This piece seems to have two major problems: some elements are far too superfluous, while others are simply not there.On the technical side, I found that the (I admit) beautifully original sweeping camera shots/dollies throughout the house were creative and well-made. However, when viewed in the cinema, they tend to make an audience feel queasy rather than excited or interested. I suspect these scenes would have a different 'feel' (and therefore a different impact) on smaller screens. The transparency of these shots (especially the computer-generated ones) did however mean that I personally was made aware all too often that I was watching a film, rather than being drawn into the whole experience. It was a nice idea, but half of these shots could have been left out.As far as the plot is concerned, I felt that the major weakness there was the lack of character motivation and history. For example, the character is obviously very frightened when she is first shut in the room - yet she still wants to buy the house. Why? I would have expected her to not want to stay there (in fact, the plot could have been contrived very differently to make this a lot scarier). The characters are introduced in a very weak, cliched, manner.The idea of a panic room is an excellent one for a creepy film, but frankly: I wasn't that impressed.And finally, how is it possible to put one's HAND in a FLAME and come out unburned (and still nicely manicured)?</fullReview>

The script by David Koepp is very tightly written. It keeps us engrossed in the story and we don't want to keep our eyes from the screen for one moment.The Panic Room of the title comes in very handy for Meg and her daughter and serves them well and protect them from the intruders trying to get into it to get the treasure left by the previous owner.Jody Foster's acting is very tight and controlled.

Three intruders have broken in.The room is a `panic room', sadly said to be commonly installed in new rich peoples houses in Manhattan who live in fear of home invasions.It has thick steel walls, food and medical provisions, its own power, phone and air supply, and is designed to keep intruders out.You rush in, punch a button, a door rapidly slams shut and settle in, with the invaders on the outside. Surveillance cameras give views of the rest of the house.David Koepp (Carlito's Way, Mission: Impossible, and Snake Eyes) wrote Panic Room. David Ficher (Seven, The Game, Fight Club) is the director. They have concocted a classy thriller, a rich piece of escapism about people trying to escape.Jodie Foster is in her element as the mum Meg. Meg is capable and smart which is handy because Panic Room becomes a strategic battle. The defenses of the room are formidable and the intruders will only get in if the can persuade Meg or her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) to open the door.The intruders are a mix. One is a dangerous hothead, another is a strategist and the other put the team together. They expected the house to be empty and need to adjust to the idea of an assault on the inhabitants of the house.Forrest Whitaker (The Crying Game) is the strategist and brains amongst the intruders. Country singer Dwight Yoakam is a credible maddie and Jared Leto makes up the trio. Young Kristen Stewart does a fine job as young Sarah.The opening credits are spectacular and the camera craft by David Ficher and his team is outstanding. Ficher loves to swing cameras through the house in elaborate, impressive, digitally enhanced shots. Panic Room is a terrific display of film making. It will have the adrenaline rushing.4 Wide Eyed Flys Out Of Five</fullReview>

He plays a very good evil burglar. His Character is RAUL and he's just plain stupid AND mean. Also, Jodi Foster's daughter looked like Macauly Caulkin. I thought he was a BOY for a long time. This is a decent movie. I saw it during a matinae because the weather was TOO HOT here. Decent character development. Forrest Whittaker stole the movie though. The care Forrest Whittaker shows the kid is cool. Also, Forrest Whittaker ends up doing something none of us quite expect. Forrest Whittaker should play more roles like this.

		<fullReview>Maybe it's not hype that is the problem.... because I don't think that people who rely on how much hype a film gets just to see movies, are the same people who appreciate Fincher and all he's worth as a director. The bottom line: I was bored out of my mind watching this "thriller". Once I'm bored, I can't really judge anything else, like how good the acting is, etc, etc, . I can say that I think the acting was fine by everyone-even Leto-but I NEVER thought a Fincher film would bore me. Maybe this is just me, but I could kinda' tell from the very beginning that it was gonna disappoint me. When it first started, it took forever to build up. Before any action had happened, I already knew it was a formulaic script. The daughter, mentioning the father: "F- 'im.", and Jodie saying, "Don't start....but yeah...f- him." Sure it could be realistic and probably is, but have we heard it before? About a million times. The reason why I thought I would love this movie(besides not thinking that Fincher could make a bad film) was because I did think it had potential. And because it was based in one house-particularly in ONE ROOM, the script would have to get *creative with us, so we'd get a double dose of a great script and Fincher's narrative genius.  It turns out that he went halfway: Fincher thought the best thing would be to minimize his directing style to allow the script to tell the story. But again that would only work if David Koepp's script was any good. So alas we get a dumb script with only a little bit of Fincher. The first minute of &lt;Fight Club&gt; you knew the movie was gonna be good. I hope Fincher blows us away with his future projects...then we'll forgive him for &lt;Panic Room&gt;;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Considerably predictable and disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider Jodie Foster as the world's best actress and I always enjoy Forrest Whitaker. However, they were definitely plagued by a poor script. As writers and directors attempt to come up fresh ideas on the big screen, this one fell short of the mark. I didn't find myself scared at any moment during the film and the only suspenseful segment of the film was when Meg (Jodie Foster) was attempting to get from the panic room to retrieve her cellular phone. Expectations often play a role in determining whether or not a film is entertaining and that was the case with Panic Room. However, you still come to expect to be scared at some point by watching a movie that is called a 'thriller.' I was not. Bring back 'The Exorcist!' Now that's scary!</fullReview>

But it seemed to me that all the great camera shots were shot in the first couple scenes and not used throughout the movie, if it stayed this way then it could have been better.

		<fullReview>Panic Room`Panic Room' is a hydraulic press of a movie that lays on increasing tension throughout its running time until it seems ready to burst. It has its continuity gaps and its less plausible moments, but it's an extremely skillful and well-paced thriller for those who are willing to give it some leeway. The domestic horror film has evolved into a genre in its own right, and is normally a vehicle for a flashily villainous star role. But `Panic Room' succeeds by quickly establishing its premise and working exclusively within its bounds. This is a film that would get lost if it were allowed out of its cage. In the middle of a messy divorce from her wealthy husband, Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) moves into an old brownstone on Manhattan's West Side with her sulky tweenage daughter. The place comes with a touch of ultra-modern security ? a steel-reinforced safe room with its own phone line, closed-circuit security monitors, and enough survival supplies to last Dick Cheney for 6 months. This `panic room' will become the focus of the film, which revolves around who and what is inside and outside it, and when. The film recalls `Bound,' Andy and Larry Wachowski's excellent thriller that also squeezed intensity out of two rooms like Andre the Giant juicing an orange. And like the Wachowskis, director David Fincher likes to play with his camera. We get shots that sweep through staircase railings, the handle of a coffee pot, and the floors and walls themselves. Fincher seems to taunt his characters with a camera that moves far more freely than they themselves can. Foster's Altman, newly independent from her husband, living on her own for the first time in a while, and with a diabetic daughter in tow, is a control freak created of necessity, and `Panic Room' is such a micro-manager's nightmare. Screenwriter David Koepp cleverly engineers this cinematic exploration of the Cold War concept of Mutually Assured Destruction to create its thrills with cell phones, stuck fingers, blood sugar, and help that arrives at exactly the wrong time. These characters spend most of their time where they don't want to be, trying to get where they can't, but each controls the other's situation more than his own, and uses this leverage to maneuver as if playing a demented game of chess. Think of it as a twisted version of the stubborn kid who sits at the dinner table for hours rather than eat his beets (by the way, Mom and Dad, it was worth it).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing... (With Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me tell you, this was one of THE most disappointing films I've seen in a while, and from Fincher, no less (who I will not mention again, since his rep has been attacked frequently already). This movie is a typical thriller movie that doesn't even make you think. **Spoilers**The first thing that truly disappointed me was the lack of any new concept in robbery. Just like all the trailers say, "What they want is in that room". Well, it's money. Yawn. Then, of course, there's the little girl. A plot device, nothing more. I was, of course, saddened to see Jared Leto in such a plain role after "Requiem". Of course, I could go on and on about how he should hold a higher standard, and whatnot, but then again, Jodie Foster did this movie as well. Then, of course, was the horribly disappointing ending. And the fact that the guy got hit in the head with a sledgehammer, fell down the stairs, and lived. And the "Add on" scene, which frankly was useless (What kind of house shall we get? I don't know, lets ask the director?). And the terrible typical tense scenes which, for some reason, I didn't find tense at all. Actually, my favorite part was when the door close on the guys fingers, and the other guy refused to open it until she left. That and the flying gas tank of fiery destruction.I think the entire second half of the movie should have ended in a giant slapstick "Three Stooges" type ending, with Jodie Foster running around the house and hitting people on the head with a sledgehammer, the masked wonder with his gun shooting at shadows and hitting the tubby guy in the butt, and some weird jokes involving needles. It would have been much more interesting. Nyuk nyuk nyuk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can people call this film "predictable" with a straight face? I mean, sure it's predictable, but only in the sense that every thriller is predictable. The ending will come as no surprise to anyone who has ever seen a movie before. The good guys are fine, the bad guys are captured or killed. Ok, so in that regard, it is predictable. But to criticize the film on this score is an immense injustice. First, like I said, practically all films are predictable in this sense. I mean, come on! Did anyone for a second think that Han, Luke, and Chewie *wouldn't* rescue the Princess? Did anyone really think that the Raiders of the Lost Ark might not find have found it? Did anyone really think that the cute children in "Jurassic Park" wouldn't survive? No!! All movies are predictable. Not all, but all of them that anyone wants to go and see. Get used to it. Plus, it's only the final result that's predictable. To continue the chess metaphor I've seen other reviewers adopt (Ebert, I think it was), you know going in the final position of the pieces, and you know who will have won. But in this film, as in chess, as in... I don't, basketball, it isn't the result that matters. It's the journey from the opening, through the middle, to the destination, that's important. This film gives us a seemingly perfect stalemate situation... good guys can't get out, can't get help, bad guys can't get in, won't leave. The situation cannot remain in equilibrium forever, but there is no immediately apparent way for either side to break to deadlock.But, pretty soon, they start thinking. One side comes up with a plan, puts it in action. The other side responds. Stalemate restored. These plans are ingenious and plausible, and situations that result are tense and exciting. Tension and excitement are common commodities in thrillers, but let me repeat: ingenious and plausible. When's the last time you saw a thriller whose plot was ingenious and plausible. I can't recall. That's what makes this film so good. It's not a groundbreaking, visionary work. It's just a film that has an abundance of Hollywood's rarest and most precious asset, simple quality. Do people even appreciate quality anymore? I don't know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good movie, indeed, but not the one you could expected from the guy who directed "Se7en" and "Fight club". Anyway, my expectations are my problem; so, in spite of mi disappointment, there are good possibilities your experience will be different. I could say this is the worst movie Fincher has directed, but that is also something to be taken with a grain of salt: even the worst Fincher's movie is well ahead of most of Hollywood movies.Good or bad, no doubt this is a film which deserves to be seen and which can make you think a lot. It is a quite accurate metaphor of the US as a safe room, where you can control every corner of the world, and, in spite of that (or because of that), we are not immune to horror. Think about 9/11 and you can not avoid to feel this movie as almost horribly prophetic.The day after I saw it, I was thinking about safety, horror and how you just can not close your doors to the unthinkable, when I came in the Bible with these rather thought-provoking lines:"...the day of the Lord is going to come like a thief in the night. It is when people are saying 'How quiet and peaceful it is' that sudden destruction falls on them, as suddenly as labour pains come on a pregnant woman; and there is no escape". (I Thessalonians 5: 1-3)Watch it and think about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brave ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler regarding ending...I enjoyed this film despite some of its obvious flaws, but what I admired most was the ending. It takes a lot of nerve to end a film the way Fincher does here, requiring the audience to do some thinking. I'm referring specifically to the penultimate scene, that ends on Jodie Foster's face. A lesser director would have her character rush out to save the Forrest Whitaker character, yelling "wait, he's my butler" (and part of me wanted to see him get away, afterall he was nothing but a safe-cracker and the original plan was rather victimless), but by refraining from such action, Fincher creates the most exciting moment of a rather exciting film with nothing more than a close-up of Jodie Foster. Will she run out to save him or let him be punished for the hell she just experienced? Sensing his decency, this crosses her mind, but after contemplating his fate, she ultimately makes the right decision. It's a very powerful moment that will probably be missed my most, simply because it is so subtle and action-less while the rest of the film relies so heavily upon action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't see why people think this movie is scary; the premise is a bit unusual, and being robbed in your own house isn't pleasant, but as the robbers made clear early on--the residents weren't in any mortal danger. Although things get out of hand (otherwise there'd be no movie), the movie's constant struggle for comic relief is not only unwelcome (especially in a thriller, and it wasn't funny anyway) but it defeats the genre by subduing the suspense. There are a few scenes beyond belief, and the final scene felt cheap--something which I suppose is hard to avoid in a clever movie. My rating: 5/10--I can't let alone the feeling of injustice in the last few scenes</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, yes I enjoyed this movie. Yes it was made well, the acting is good, and the sheer thought of being trapped in a "panic room" is eerie. But what ruined the movie for me was its ending, or rather the lack thereof. To me, what makes or breaks a movie is it's beginning and ending. If your movie opens with a lot of action then it has to go out with a big bang! Now by no means did this movie open in a huge way (I did like how the credits actually loomed over New York City though...this WAS set in New York right?) but it seemed as if the director was unable to think up a way to end it. The last ten minutes are predictable and the ending scenes just seem to have been tacked on. This is only MY opinion however, so I do suggest you see this film. My final judgment for Panic Room is a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Panic Room" is a stylish thriller about a single mom (Jodie Foster) that relocates to an upper West Side apartment with her daughter (Kristen Stewart) just after her divorce. The apartment has everything one could possibly desire-including something called a "panic room"-an impenetrable safe room used for surveillance, and in times of dire emergency. Unfortunately for mother and daughter, three armed intruders break in during their first night in their new home. What follows is a tortuous ordeal spent in the only refuge they have: the panic room.Given David Fincher's track record, one goes into this movie with high expectations. Add to that the caliber of the actors involved, and "Panic Room" seems that it will indeed be a sure bet. Unfortunately, this is not the case. While the film is masterfully photographed and contains some great performances, illogical story elements greatly diminish the tautness and excitement this film could have generated.***MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD***1) Burnham (Forest Whitaker) breaks into the apartment-he does NOT disable the system first. Since no one responds to the break in, we are forced to assume he has somehow arranged (through his connections) for everyone working at the monitoring station that night to disregard the call. This isn't too horrible on it's own, but?2) Meg (Foster) and her daughter decide to STOP signaling "SOS" just as the next door neighbor BEGINS to look out the window and see the light. Why? Why choose to yell through a tiny vent across a 30 yard separation during a hellish rainstorm to a neighbor behind a closed window?3) Meg probably wouldn't be alive after lighting the gas from inside the panic room's ventilation shaft. She would most likely die from her lungs collapsing due to all the oxygen in that room being sucked out. At the very least, most of her body would be burned horribly. Her eyebrows aren't even singed.4) Whenever a 911 call is placed, it's immediately logged-whether you hang up or not. At least one Police cruiser is dispatched to EVERY 911 call just for safety's sake-there are NO exceptions to this.5) The gap between the ex-husband's arrival and that of the police is wholly unbelievable. And even if you stupidly assume the NYPD "takes forever to respond to 911 calls," they would never hesitate when the call is coming from THAT neighborhood.6) When a 911 call AND a call from a frightened husband regarding the SAME ADDRESS come into the police dispatcher's office, more than one car would be sent to the premises. In addition, the police would not leave that address without an investigation-it may be a child or domestic abuse case.7) Since when do police officers interrogate women about "unfinished sentences" on their doorstep? This isn't a plot hole as much as it is annoying.8) When Raoul (Dwight Yoakam) sees Meg disabling the many surveillance cameras around the house, he asks, "why didn't WE do that?" Good question. When the intruders realized someone else was in the house, shouldn't that have been the FIRST thing they did? Or are we to assume they wanted to leave them connected for drama's sake?9) When someone gets hit squarely in the head by a swung sledgehammer, they don't get up. When they additionally fall down a stairwell, they REALLY don't get up. And, if that same person miraculously survives the shattered skull, that person would not run up the stairs, and suddenly find reasonable use of a hand that was completely crushed in a mechanical steel door.***END SPOILERS***Any one of these points wouldn't be noticeable. But as the film goes on, the cumulative effect makes "Panic Room" lose its edge. And this leads to an even larger problem: once the story loses believability, the audience becomes less involved, excited and thrilled. The movie then starts to feel long and tedious. **SPOILER** Strangely enough, the denouement seems to hurtle out of control, and the film suddenly stops on a dime at the end-with an odd dramatic music swell as we watch Jodie Foster staring (presumably) at Forest Whitaker and? nothing happens. Go figure. **END SPOILER**It's a shame this film is weakened by flawed logic. I stress "weakened," because the film has some very positive elements. The cinematography is very exciting, chock full of interesting camera angles and moody lighting. In addition, the acting by everyone involved is great. Jodie Foster once again shows she's still one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood. Jared Leto is magnetic, and Stewart terrifically underplays her role as Jodie Foster's daughter. In addition, the filmmakers did a great job establishing backstory in some creative and efficient ways-something refreshing in a thriller of this type.In the end, Panic Room is basically a good-looking thriller that lacks the punch. Perhaps Fincher and the writers should have concentrated more on believability rather than swooping dolly shots that travel through keyholes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without providing any spoilers, let's just say that this is a minor thriller done in a big way by a very cinematic director and one of the better writers working in Hollywood. It's slick stylishness is evident the minute it starts; a lot of people are as impressed with the credits as they are with the film. It's a dark, shadowy gothic that's well played, but fairly traditional in form and character. The biggest criticism I have is that it's all really lacking in spontaneity; that a lot of the plot points and characterizations were developed by committee. You know what I mean: this person is this way and that person is this type and you can count on this to happen, etc. etc. Things tend to be relatively predictable instead of unsettling or shocking. All the real excitement here is in the camera work, the subtle humor and the rather hip gothics of the production design. Wouldn't it have been really creepy and unsettling to have seen the World Trade Center in the title sequence? That would have given the finale a much more unsettling tone now, wouldn't it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>warning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning! Don't expect to like this movie if you liked Fincher's last three movies! The best thing about this movie was the beginning credits and a few of the camera shots. spoilers, interpretation: So it appears that Fincher has taken the Kevin Smith route: in order to safeguard his directing career he is going to intersperse corny Hollywood mainstream movies with his innovative films. 'Aliens 3' and 'Panic Room' fall into the first category, with 'Se7en,' 'The Game,' and 'Fight Club' falling into the latter. I have no problem with Fincher's survival instinct, I just wish I would have known of it ahead of time. So take this as a warning. What you have with 'Panic Room' is your typical Hollywood "thriller." It's not thrilling if you've seen a "thriller" before and remember any of it. A goal is made apparent within the first ten minutes of the movie, and the other two hours are used to frustrate this goal, over and over and over again. Even unrealistic aspects are accepted if they cause frustration. Also, anytime there is an uncomfortable moment, prolong it as long as possible. Use contrived undeveloped tension to add suspense (tension between Jody and daughter, Jody and husband, Jody and good robber - of course all three tensions are resolved nearly simultaneously in the end ). Make use of poetic justice because the good guys always win. Another hackneyed ploy: throw in an anti-materialistic moral into the mix (all three robbers, as well as Jody and daughter, are punished because of their greed) even if it hasn't been built up and has nothing to do with anything in the movie. Advice for film majors: suspense doesn't make corny humor funny, it just makes it annoying. I'll give Fincher another chance of course. In my opinion, nobody has ever directed four must-sees in a row. So I don't resent him, I'm just a bit disappointed. This was not even close to a must-see. It really was ridiculous; I ended up laughing at many of the supposedly scary parts because they were so unbelievably trite. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! I think Jody Foster is great in thriller-type movies. The mother-daughter relationship of the characters allowed me to feel the terror and excitement- feeling them care for each other more than they care for themselves. The movie takes off rather quickly and stays exciting throughout the entire film. I didn't think the movie was scary, yet I found myself talking to the characters out loud and gritting my teeth through most of the scenes. I enjoyed the compassionate villan that Forest Whittiker played. I found myself torn- wanting the family to come out on top, as well as him; feeling that they could even be friends when all of this is over. I think it is a movie that is best when seen in the theater, so you can lose yourself in the characters. This is a movie I will see over and over again.

		<fullReview>I read Koepp's script last fall and enjoyed it a lot -- but it's really just an intricate chess game without much characterization. I thought Foster and the rest of the cast would fill in the shades of grey and nuances need to create fully realized characters. But unfortunately, there's not much to them. Only Forest Whitaker stands out here -- he's the bad guy with heart that you want to get away (and I don't care what anyone says....SPOILER BELOW!...that scene in the backyard with the bond certificates floating away from him is poignant because of that. You want him to get away -- he's the only one who deserves the loot. The other two crooks were either lunatics or psychotic.Technically, this is a beautiful film (loved the credit sequence) with snazzy computerized camera zooms through floors, coffee pots, locks etc. (but Fincher risks cliching himself if he keeps this up -- I mean, do we need a subjective camera swoop into a flashlight's bulb?). But none of that's enough to elevate the movie from the B-level genre picture Koepp wrote.Overall, not worth full price. See it on a matinee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Fincher "tween" Flick Doesn't Fly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher has the style and technique that gives a visually impressive and immersive experience, but without the "knock your socks off" story the impact is diminished. It seems that Fincher gets a rather less than spectacular story for every other film he makes, starting with his first film and it leaves the audience less than blown away. Alien 3 looked good and was a solid effort, but the viewer didn't leave the theatre cheering the way his follow up Se7en did. Then his next "tween" film, The Game had an interesting premise, but lacked the "what the hell is going on" twist and turns that made Fight Club the much loved story it was.Here now we have Panic Room which in my humble opinion continues this trend by telling a rather simple tale that really leaves you simply asking yourself, "How are they going to get out of this one?" instead of "What the hell is going to happen next?" With Alien3, The Game and now Panic Room we pretty much know where this story is going it's just a matter of how we get there whereas Se7en and Fight Club in the end left us in awe, slightly dizzy and numb from the trip we had just been on.Panic Room (and Alien and The Game for that matter) is a 1st rate suspense-thriller that carries the audience through the whole film without any snags and delivers a much better than average film.The cast was top notch and though we've seen most of these actors in many other films they left any hint of their former movie identities at home and delivered totally new and convincing performances. My only gripe is with such genre blowing titles as Se7en and Fight Club under his belt you'd think Fincher would be searching for a much more amazing tale to tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good suspense ruined by bad plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of this movie, I was sucked in by the fancy camerawork and fast paced action. Those aspects of the movie were consistent throughout, but I could not bring myself to overlook the obvious unrealistic aspects of the plot. The bumbling crooks reminded me of when I was eight years old watching "Home Alone". I kept waiting for them to trip over some Micro Machines and get hit with some paint cans or an iron. The film was very predictable with obvious foreshadowing and a hackneyed, unoriginal climax. I feel the need to point the most obvious flaw in the movie, so the next section will contain a minor spoiler:*********SPOILER ALERT***********When you dial 9-1-1, the operator will never say "please hold", and if they cannot call back, the police will arrive ASAP. This would have been game over for the wet bandits, but the director needed to get another hour out of the movie.*********************************In the end, the fancy cinematography, great acting, and superb special effects could not redeem the horribly written script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friends and I made sure to see Panic Room at one of the first showtimes on the day it opened, lest someone spoil it for us. Having been a huge fan of both Jodie Foster and David Finchers works perhaps I set my sights a bit high.I must say though that as far as camera work the film is revolutionary. Fincher always does great stuff (the title sequence of Fight Club for example). It was amazing to me how they pulled off some of the shots. This made the house actually seem like it was one of the characters in the film.The acting performances were all very strong. Jodie Foster had wonderful believable chemistry with the young girl who played her daughter. The other three characters also played well against them. Dwight Yoakam was particularly menacing, and Jared Leto's character added some much needed lighter moments to the story.It was entertaining and certainly provided a decent 2 hour distraction. I didn't find it as "edge of your seat thrillerish" as it has been billed in reviews. Walking out I was glad I'd seen it but for some reason found the story to be a bit empty and flat, salvaged by the good acting and interesting cinematography and editing. Worth the time but not something I'll watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked out of this movie feeling as though I had been cheated. I was expecting so much more, and the ending just left me hanging. The cinematography was really great, and I was left in awe wondering how some of the shots were done, but still this movie was hyped as this huge thriller and I was expecting to be on the edge of my seat fearful of what was going to happen next. But that never came. There were a few twists and turns, some predictable, some not... but the last thing I was expecting were the one liners... "be careful" was the funniest line in the movie, but I wasn't expecting to laugh at this movie...So, again, back to the ending....I can't explain why it's wrong, or what was wrong with it, but it just didn't fit. There needed to be more, and I was expecting some kind of closure...and that never came.Overall, I'd say I was quite disappointed with this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Panic Room' opens with one of the most stylishly elegant, visually arresting and classily designed credit sequences I have seen fronting a movie in a very long time. Would that the rest of the film managed to live up to that high quality level. Instead, `Panic Room' emerges as second-rate, warmed-over Hitchcock with barely a suspenseful moment to be had for love or money. And love and money pretty much turn out to be the two dominant `themes' of this claustrophobic thriller, which stars Jodie Foster as an embittered, recently divorced mother who purchases a spectacular home on the west side of Manhattan for herself and her diabetic teenaged daughter. The great selling point of this property turns out to be an elaborately designed `panic room,' which theoretically will provide a place of safety should robbers ever break onto the premises. And lo and behold, what should happen on their very first night staying in the place! You guessed it: three armed men, intent on stealing a secret cache of loot hidden in a safe located right there in the panic room, storm the place and make the young mother and her daughter virtual prisoners in their own fortress-like sanctuary. The majority of the movie is spent with the two terrified women stuck behind the implacable steel door while the three hoodlums work on ways of trying to ferret them out.The single noteworthy element of `Panic Room' is that master cinematographer, Conrad Hall, has managed to make the house itself into something of a character ? actually a far more interesting character than any of the people we encounter in the film. He does this by having his camera move through walls, creep along air ducts and spy on the inhabitants' activities from bizarre angles, the effect of which is that we get an impressive sense of geography that helps us to map out the intricacies of the building itself. This is not, however, enough to compensate for an underwritten screenplay filled with hackneyed plot elements, stereotypical characters and precious little in the way of nail-biting suspense. Particularly grating is the team of three familiar burglars, consisting of the humanitarian with a heart-of-gold (Forest Whitaker), the sardonic but ineffectual `brains' of the operation (Jared Leto) and, of course, the trigger-happy psychotic (Dwight Yoakum) who is called in at the last moment and ends up making life just plain miserable for everyone involved, criminals and decent citizens alike. Straight from central casting, these three men provide us with not one single surprise in the course of the film's running time. An actress of the caliber of Jodie Foster need do little but phone in her performance in a role as shallow as this one here ? which is essentially what she does. Ms. Foster has exactly two good moments in the film: an early dinner scene between her and her daughter in which she subtly conveys the hurt and confusion occasioned by the breakup of her marriage, and a sequence later in the film when she is forced to play out the required policemen-at-the-door scene (I doubt I am giving anything away by revealing that there IS such a scene in this movie).`Panic Room' will probably manage to get under the skin of only the most confirmed claustrophobics. The rest of us will probably find ourselves breaking out of the theater for quite different reasons altogether.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Edge-Of-Your-Seat Thriller Full of Suspense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got done seeing this at the theater, and I loved this movie!!! It was full of suspense and thrills, and kept you on the edge of your seat. Jodie Foster gives another spectacular performance (as usual), newcomer Kristen Stewart was really good, Forest Whitaker was again great, and Jared Leto was really good too. Brilliant director David Fincher (Fight Club) directed the movie greatly and gave the film a neat feeling. The movie is about Meg Altman (Jodie Foster), who has moved into a new house with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart). Located in the house is a "panic room" with steel and concrete all around it, with a steel door, telephone, intercom, and surveillance camera so you can see every room in the house. The first night at the house, Meg is confronted by Burnham (Forest Whitaker), Junior (Jared Leto), and their other friend, whom helps them break into the house to steal a fortune. Meg and Sarah get inside the panic room, and now must stop them. This was such a grrrrrreat movie! I give The Panic Room a 10 out of 10!!!!! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Home Alone... For Adults. Even a Macauly Culkin Character! (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never usually write reviews on imdb, but have been a long and loyal user for my movie info needs!I had time to spare on this long weekend as a friend asked me to see "Panic Room." This is a title I have never heard of or heard anything about, not even tv trailers.My informative friends also knew little more: Jodie Foster is in it! So I decided to go for it! Showtime is in 30 minutes!It is quite a different experience going into a movie, when there is no hype, expectations nor credibility to trust. In other words, I was ready for the unexpected: I didn't get that!!!I loved Jodie Foster in Contact and Anna and the King. In this one however, I gained a more detailed apreciation: for her breasts. In a movie which clearly goes out to express "Women Power," is totally accomplished if they are proud that their foes are dim witted two bit cliched criminals.Now, by all means I love movies which bend reality - on purpose. Panic Room on the contrary makes things connect together to nicely or as Homer Simpson would say, "A nice little package."Every action is down to the wire, just in time, buzzer beaters. Baddies failing to get in the Panic Room at the very last moment. Phone line connected instant before baddies cut it. Even the cops show up the instant the big sledgehammer melee is up.A criminal with morals? Ahhhhhhhhh! (Hands clasped on cheeks) How convenient! A leadership ambitioned criminal who has no leadership skills what so ever, other than an intimidating vocabulary of foul language and a wicked hairdoo.Movies don't usually get me angry - and cynical but this movie did it for me! What also peed me off tonight was that my shallow friends and I also watched "Requiem for a Dream" after dinner. Let's just say they laughed more during that then Panic Room, which they fixated their undivided concentration on making 'witty' comments on 'plot' developments and foreshadows.Now I could go on ranting on the total positive for Requiem: brilliant! But much respect has already been paid homage to it. Now, if they rewrote the criminals in this movie as the Daniel Stern / Joe Pesci jokesters from Home Alone - now there would be a movie!!!!!!See Panic Room if you've lost your innocence for Home Alone. Or if you enjoyed Home Alone solely for its plot, or Macauly Culkin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a role once pegged for Nicole Kidman, Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman, newly divorced from her husband, a pharmaceuticals millionaire. She moves into a new, large, four story, brownstone on the Upper West Side with her daughter in tow. Along with the standard spacious rooms and spiralling staircase is an elevator (the previous owner being disabled) and a "panic room". The titled room is a steel encased room that houses a bank of tv's taking video feeds from camera's around the house. This "safe room" is to protect yourself from a home invasion, after all, what are you going to do if someone breaks into your home: "...call the police and wait until Tuesday?".Now enter: Jared Leto, the kid with the plan, doing his best "Brad-Pitt-in-Fight-Club" impersonation; Forest Whitaker as the soft-hearted, but clear-headed of the criminals and Dwight Yoakam in another terrifying turn as the quiet but viscious one. Director David Ficher doesn't waste any time in getting to business. On the first night the home is broken into and while Meg and Sarah make it safely to the panic room, there's just one problem - what the criminals want is *in* the panic room.In Fincher's fifth feature he tones down the wild visual style of "Fight Club" and "Se7en" and opts for a more classical, Hitchcock-ian style. Of course, Fincher doesn't leave his bag of tricks at home, offering some amazing tracking shots between rooms and floors.Foster is great in the lead role measuring out her change from vulnerable to protective mother in measured doses. Leto almost overacts his way out of the role, choosing large gestures and tics in addition to articulation, but luckily Whitaker and Yoakam reel him in everytime he almost reaches into the ridiculous with calm, cool and in Yoakam's case unnerving performances.Fincher's take on the thriller genre is wonderful, with shifting perspective's and genuine surprises. There are a couple key turns which I can't give away here, except to say that this is another top notch directorial effort by David Fincher.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can be honest by saying that I might not even had seen Panic room, no less on Opening Night, had it not been for a friend pleading for me to go. However, I went and I enjoyed the movie in an overall sense.Ok, Fincher has and will do better work. This movie won't touch his cult classics like Seven, Fight Club or even The Game...well it won't for me especially for the first two...but it's enjoyable.The premise, plot, story or whatever you might call it was the lacking feature in it. The idea was cool but it just didn't seem to be one that a movie of 10 star calibre would get. However, great acting from a few solid, seasoned veterans and a brilliant sense of a directions from a brilliant director carried the movie to an above average showing.Foster is her usual amazing self with a smart, witty, and not too overemotional performance. She isn't just going through the motions in this movie but instead giving a believable, solid performance.The three villains play their roles well. Whitaker, of course, shines the brightest. But Yokam is strong as the true protaganist. Alongside as the third villain, Jared Leto continues to impress me as a strong actor in a gutty performance.It's an enjoyable movie for adults and one that all movie types can enjoy. A particular scene with a sledge hammer made the entire audience cringe, a sharp job with that by Fincher as mass audience reactions always make for an enjoyable movie.If this movie enticed you in the least bit, or if like me you love an actor or actress or perhaps the director or even movies in general. Check out Panic Room for a good viewing.My Rating: 7 out of 10 Best Performance: Sorry Jodie, but Forrest Whitaker made the movie with his acting. Another strong showing for the very strong and capable actor. Biggest Surprise: Dwight Yokam. Strong performance. Go see it???? Yes. Don't expect past Fincher marvels...just a good viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "The Panic Room" we have a fine colleciton of actors, a good director and an interesting premise - all the elements for a great film. Sadly, it never quite got there. There are gaps in the story line, bouts of unnecessary violence, predictable plot turns, and incomplete character development. There are some great directorial choices involving unusual camera angles and live action intermixed with B&amp;W closed-circuit TV effectively using both visuals and audio. The movie kept moving at a fair pace and the 2 hours flew buy. Overall it was eminently entertaining. Not as good as "Wait Until Dark" but better than "What Lies Beneath."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, "Panic Room" was a disappointment, but was nevertheless fairly entertaining. The film fails to develop its main characters adequately before overeagerly diving into the sticky situation in which the main characters find themselves for 90% of this movie. The "villains" were a bit too weak in my opinion and were more comic than intimidating....not a good quality to have in a movie that is clearly intending to be a thriller. Another aspect that made them weak was that I kept finding myself thinking "Why don't they just...and they would win!?" I'm sorry Mr.Fincher, but I have to have a villain who has more common sense than Joe Schmo in order for a thriller to be thrilling. Nevertheless, I think there was enough solid directing and acting (to be expected from Jodie Foster and Forrest Whitaker) to make this movie worth watching. I attribute all of the shortcomings of this film to the writers. Overall, I give it a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room *** ?It's about time someone made a good thriller. Don't Say A Word tried to be a thriller, but failed. Most thrillers today wind up with the protagonist spouting off a clever one-liner and then shooting the bad guy. In fact, a thriller starring Jennifer `J-Lo' Lopez was previewed before Panic Room. When a thriller lists a song in its credits during the preview, especially when the song is off of an upcoming album called `J to the Lo', you can bet it's going to be predictable as all get-out. And not in the good way. Panic Room is predictable in the good way.I saw an interview with Alfred Hitchcock several years ago. To paraphrase what he said: Show the bad guys placing a bomb underneath the dining room table. Then, have the good guys sit at the table and talk about baseball. The audience knows that the bomb is there, but the good guys don't. While the baseball conversation is happening, the audience is squirming in their seats thinking `Don't talk about baseball, you idiots! There's a bomb under the table!' Does the bomb go off? It might, and that's what makes a thriller work ? show something bad that might happen, and then pile surprises on top of that.The trailers for Panic Room tell you everything you need to know about the plot. Actually, there isn't much of a plot. It's a premise. Playwright George Bernard Shaw once said that he never used plots. He had a situation, put characters into the situation, and watched what would happen. That's what happens here.Meg Altman (Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Stewart) just moved into a gorgeous house: a mix between a townhouse and a brownstone, or, a brownhouse. The house has all sorts of nifty things, like an elevator (the last resident was very rich and disabled). The movie gets its title from the panic room in the house. It's explained in the trailers, but, to recap, the panic room is a house within the house. It has its own ventilation system, phone line, plumbing, and electricity. If you shut the massive steel door, no one can get in. Now, the last resident had loads of money and several kids. The inheritance is in dispute, and there are millions of dollars missing. Three people who know more about the panic room than Meg and Sarah break into the house. Junior (Leto), Burnham (Whitaker) and Raoul (Yoakam) are the bad guys ? some worse than others. Then, things get messy. And tense.I like David Fincher. I like him a lot. Se7en is a near-classic. Fight Club is in my DVD collection. I'm not entirely sure what his motives as a director are (the great directors typically explore their psyches on the screen: Spielberg fights Nazis and tries to forgive his father, Lucas relives his childhood, Hitchcock showed his contempt for humanity, Kubrick asked the questions that needed to be asked), but whatever they are, they sure look cool. Fincher started off directing music videos, so he understands pacing and editing ? essentials for a thriller.Now, for a thriller to really work, it has to start off slowly. You need to be introduced to the characters, details need to be shown, and all of these things take time. No detail is unimportant in a thriller. Often, however, the details are shown quickly or are not the center of attention. The first part of a thriller needs to move slowly. We already know that these robbers are going to break into the house, and the mother and daughter will be locked in the panic room. So, from the beginning, the audience is already anxious ? when is it going to happen? Then, of course, it does happen. Other things are added into the mix, and we keep saying, OK ? now what? How does this wind up? But, it shouldn't be tense all the time. The audience needs breaks. Throw in a laugh, or a lull in the action. Fincher has this down.Enough of my lecture series ? time to get into the nitty gritty. What did I like?First off, the story. I don't care if it was plausible or not ? it had me. I didn't notice any loose-ends or plot-holes. Even apparent plot-holes are addressed. `Why the hell didn't we do that?' asks Raoul at one point. The thing he's referring to is obvious, but, given the premise, it's understandable why the thugs didn't do it in the first place.Secondly, the acting. Jodie Foster is no slouch at all. The fact that she spends most of the movie in a leotard doesn't hurt, either. Forest Whitaker is excellent. He has a very quiet presence on the screen, but he commands attention. Jared Leto ? he's almost a chameleon. I didn't recognize him at first. Very good character actor. Kristen Stewart ? I've never seen her before, but her performance is unforced, which is tough to find in a child actor. Dwight Yoakam ? wow. This is only the second time I've seen him act, but he is very, very good. He was absolutely unrecognizable in Sling Blade, and he is just evil in this role.What didn't I like? Hmmm....This is really odd for me to say, but the special effects. Don't get me wrong ? they were excellent. I thought that Blue Sky (the people who did Ice Age) did it. They did the FX for Fight Club, and similar techniques were used, but, Toybox handled the digital FX here. While they were very, very good effects, at times it seemed to draw me out of ?the moment'. Things are cool, I'm entranced by the movie, and then all of a sudden I'm snapped back into reality because of an effect. This is coming from a guy who grew up with the Star Wars movies. But, the effects should add to the story, not remind the audience that they are watching a movie. Did Keanu Reeves really do that crazy bending in The Matrix? Of course not. Did it work? You betcha. Can a camera really move through walls like it does in Panic Room? No. Does it work? Yes, but only to a point. After that point, it actually detracts from the experience.Is Panic Room Hitchcockian? It actually almost is. That is, if Hitch were making movies today, and didn't have nearly as many issues, he might have done this. If you're claustrophobic, you might want to skip this. If you want to see how a thriller should be made, you need to check this out. And, if you hate Dwight Yoakam (unlike me. I think he's great.), you DEFINATELY want to see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** If there is one thing I cannot overlook in a film, it's a plot hole. Or even worse, an implausible story supposedly based in reality. If either of these two fatalities occur, I can still like the film--but will not take it seriously. It's kind of like sleeping with someone you don't respect, or reading Jackie Collins.Panic Room isn't a terrible movie, but it commits these two cardinal sins. Jodie Foster's husband is a rich, cheating prick, so she buys a giant Manhattan brownstone in order to get revenge. The house was previously owned by a dead, paranoid millionaire, and comes complete with a "Panic Room" with video camera monitors, a phone, a motion sensor door (so no one gets caught in it), and food. The son of the millionaire, unscary Jared Leto, knows there's money in a safe inside the Panic Room and gets crazy Raoul (Dwight Yoakam), and a security expert (docile and friendly Forrest Whitaker) to help him get rich quick.But herein lies the problem: For some reason, dumbass Leto allows the house to sit empty for two weeks before performing the heist, and before he knows it, Jodie and daughter are all moved in. Instead of waiting until they're not home, Leto and pals debate for an hour about whether to try for the money anyway, and decide to go for the dough. Jodie glimpses them on the monitors during their quibble, runs and grabs her kid, and, OF COURSE, goes into the Panic Room.Unfortunately, though, the phone isn't hooked up in the Panic Room--DARN!--and Jodie's kid has diabetes and needs insulin, fast. Double DARN! When Jodie runs to get her kid's insulin, teddy bears Whitaker and Raoul get their shot at the room and here comes another dumb plot hole. Raoul's hand gets caught in the Panic Room door--which, if you'll remember, has a motion sensor that makes getting his hand caught impossible! Ah-HA!Sadly, Panic Room is not terrifying, all plot turns are contrived or ridiculous, and the story is written as if it was built around the concept of a Panic Room existing, instead of being a clever story that happens to include a Panic Room. It lacks order, meat, and ingenuity. But putting all that aside, it's sort of okay Jodie has a nice bod, the old house is cool, and Jared Leto is humorously spastic. Which is to say, it's about as tolerable as an episode of Dawson's Creek.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to Panic Room. I am a big fan of David Fincher, and "Fight Club" is one of my favourite films of all time. I can say that my expectations were realised.I managed to see a finished print in Brisbane, Australia the other day. First of all, this film knocked me out. It is one of the best thrillers ever. Too many thrillers sink themselves into a mire of cliche and just end up becoming stupid revenge fantasies (Ransom anyone?). This film is made with intelligence as only David Fincher can do. Also David Koepp's economical script can receive top credit as well.It is his best script since 'The Trigger Effect".Performance wise, Jodie Foster is of course excellent, but it is Forest Whitaker as the criminal with a conscience, and Dwight Yoakam as the criminal without one, that excel in this film. Yoakam is a standout as the suitably creepy, and nasty Raoul."Panic Room" is definitely one to see. The best film so far of 2002 and one of my favourites of all time. I can't wait to own it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it would be a movie worth watching since Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker were in it. It is a waste of time. The main character, acted by Jodie Foster, is pretty weak and incompetent, who finally realized she had a cell phone in the bedroom, more than half way thru the movie. Also, she's trapped in a room and doesn't know what's in it. What exactly is she spending her time while in the safe room. Make an inventory.She knows how important her daughter's medical condition is but doesn't look to see if there is food until it is almost too late. She falls for a stupid trick. She really needs to be more careful. She really should first call the police when she first gets out. Where exactly is her cell phone...I didn't even watch the last 30 minutes when the cops showed up at the door. I am going to assume that she thought it best not to tell them to keep them "safe". This movie grossed millions for the new and different plot but definitely not for common sense of the "victim".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie quite a few times and It has a lot of good thrills and even a couple scares, but this film lacks realism.The story is about a divorced mother and her teenage daughter buying a new home that has a panic room to protect them in case of a burglary. But then three robbers DO break into the house and they lock themselves in. The three criminals are relentless and determined because they think there is a lot of money stored away in the panic room.I won't give the rest away if case you haven't seen it, but I will tell you that this film has a lot of violence, like most of Fincher's films.The acting wasn't bad, but it wasn't flawless either, and the script probably could've been better. But it's a good thriller and it's good to watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite all the plot holes- a decent thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read some of the other reviews and felt that a lot of them were rather harsh. I admit that there were many flaws in the tale and won't bother to go through them all as that ground has been well covered. As I read the plot holes, I found myself amazed at the fact I hadn't noticed most of them while I was watching the film as I tend to pick fault with story lines of movies a lot.I confess to being totally ignorant on the subject of diabetes, and although this wasn't supposed to be a public information film, I think they ought to have got those medical facts right because there are enough people out there that have diabetes and would know the difference and especially having made it such an important part of the plot it should have been accurate. Otherwise I think the errors are forgivable and didn't intrude on my enjoyment of the film. I have come to expect to spend a good bit of any thriller shouting "Why are you doing THAT?" I think in Panic Room the characters were good enough to engage the audience and once the movie got into the main story the direction kept it rolling along in a competent manner. Overall; a decent thriller if you don't look too closely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Efficiently Made, Claustrophobic Thriller, but Could Have Used a Tighter Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film Jodie Foster plays Meg, a wealthy divorcée looking for a new home in New York for herself and her teenage daughter Sarah. The house she chooses is a luxury Manhattan brownstone with an unusual feature- a "panic room", or strongroom in which the householder can take refuge from intruders. Meg's panic room is put to the test on her very first night in her new home. A gang of three burglars break in searching for a fortune which they believe was concealed in the house by its former owner. Meg and Sarah retreat to the panic room, but unfortunately that is the very room in which the money is hidden. Roger Ebert's comparison of the film to a game of chess is an apt one. We have an apparent stalemate, with the villains unable to break into the panic room but Meg and Sarah unable to escape to safety or to force the three men to leave her home. Both sides are compelled to try one gambit after another to try and break the deadlock. A complication is the fact that Sarah is a diabetic and desperately needs a life-saving injection.As has been pointed out elsewhere, the strongest influence on the film seems to have been "Wait until Dark" from the late sixties. In that film, Audrey Hepburn also played a New York resident menaced in her own home by three criminals who have broken in to search for something which she does not even know exists. In both films the three criminals are strongly differentiated. In the earlier film, the characters played by Richard Crenna and Jack Weston are non-violent con-men who attempt to trick Hepburn's character into handing over the "McGuffin" (a doll filled with drugs) by an elaborate ruse; the menacing figure is their boss Roat (played by Alan Arkin), a murderously violent thug. In "Panic Room" there is also a murderous psychopath and two comparatively non-violent accomplices. The most violent of the three is named Raoul; I wondered if the similarity of this name to "Roat" could be a deliberate reference to the earlier film. In both films the downfall of the villains is caused by the fact that their differing characters and dissensions between them make it impossible for them to work together as a team. (This suggests that other influences may have been "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" and the British black comedy "The Ladykillers").Jodie Foster is one of the most talented actresses in the cinema today, and her performance as Meg is a good one. The trouble with Jodie is that she has given so many great performances ("The Accused", "Silence of the Lambs", "Sommersby", "Nell") that a merely good one can come to seem disappointing, particularly in a film like this one where a truly great performance in the lead role could have transformed an entertaining but minor thriller into a major one. (In "Wait Until Dark" Audrey Hepburn achieves the feat of turning that film, despite its often far-fetched plot, into something eminently watchable).For much of the time "Panic Room" is an efficiently made, claustrophobic thriller. Like Terence Young, who directed "Wait Until Dark", David Fincher is clearly much influenced by Alfred Hitchcock. It does, however, suffer from certain weaknesses. The most important is that identified by reviewer Ricky Roma, namely that the three villains, especially the character played by Jared Leto, are often too clumsy and bungling to seem really threatening. The best of the three actors who play them is Forest Whitaker as Burnham, a craftsman who specialises in making panic rooms himself, but even so the sudden twist at the end when Burnham shifts from being Meg's enemy to being her protector never seems plausible. My overall impression was that "Panic Room" was based on a promising idea for a thriller, but that it could have been a much better film if the plotting and the script had been tightened up. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot was outstanding; the acting was outstanding; the digital graphics were outstanding; the sound, the lighting, the overall feel was definitely outstanding; however, one thing still looms in the overall satisfactory residual effects of this film - The Ending.Unlike most motion pictures, this particular film contains no real ending. It doesn't leave a cliffhanger as hint to a 'part two'; it doesn't even leave with any real conclusion. All that we know is that Jodi Foster's character &amp; her daughter survived. We don't know what happened with the father, with the remaining robber, with the millions in bonds, etc.This movie leaves an excited viewer feeling completely balked.I believe that a lot more excitement would've followed this movie around for years and possibly gained quite a devoted following had it actually been granted with some form of ending.All of the actors delivered "stunning performances", but were left in the cold with no resolution.I don't recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys seeing a movie through until the bitter end (nor 'happy' end); there is none here.-KT Pierce; Auburn, AL</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher had quickly become one of my favorite directors of the 1990's with his three entertaining and stylish movies Se7en, The Game and Fight Club. So of course expectations were high.Meg Altman has just divorced her husband and is about to use the money she got from the settlement to buy an apartment for herself and her daughter. Little does she know that the apartment is also the stash of some criminals who soon come to collect their money, believing the house to still be empty. The mother and daughter hide in the apartments' "Panic room" while the criminals realize that someone is watching.There are several flaws in "Panic Room" that i think makes this a disappointment. First of all the script is not very innovative or interesting. The premise of the women hiding in the panic room is not so bad, but it's hard to build much suspense with just a few people and just one apartment. For that to work the acting has to be solid. And that is another reason this fails. Forest Whitaker looks completely lost as one of the criminals, he couldn't scare a baby. Jared Leto certainly seems to enjoy himself but is equally lost. The only one who manages fit in his part is Dwight Yoakam. Jodie Foster is not bad, but this is not one of her better performances.The style from Finchers other movies is still there. The camera takes us for a ride several times and it's all very nicely shot. But still the movie relies to heavily on actors that fail to deliver. In the end it makes this a disappointment. Not bad, but uninteresting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5/10. Not a patch on Se7en, The Game and Fight Club</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher came up with some of the most arresting visuals and ideas in the 1990s - Se7en, The Game and Fight Club, but this dark thriller doesn't reach the same high standards.It is a watchable affair nonetheless, with Jodie Foster as a recently separated mother searching for prime New York apartment block space with her 10-year (roughly) old son (Kristen Stewart). The apartment is spanking brand new with all the mod cons, including the all important "panic room", a kind of impenetrable safe for humans. This comes in handy when their quarters are invaded by a group of professional burglars (Billy Bob Thornton, Forest Whittaker and Dwight Yoakam).A battle of wits ensues, but it becomes increasingly hackneyed and silly, particularly the bit with the gas pipe. It has plenty of tense moments, but the daft plot lets it down. The gloomy visuals add a certain degree of class, however.If you have seen Desperate Hours and many other films of this type, then you will pretty much know the routine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very finely crafted thriller.The plot centers around the use of the titled Panic Room by Foster's character and her daughter, when their place is seeming to be burglarised. But this is only the half of it, as the plot turns this way and that as Foster and the burglars battle wits.The tension between adversaries is excellent, but what I really liked about this film was the style element. Fincher uses camera viewpoints that would move impossibly through walls, windows and pipes, to truly explore the panic room's connections to the outside world, and the house itself, to bring across the interesting concept that the film and story were as much about the property (as a character) than the actual people in it - and I'd not really seen that do before so well, if at all.Very competent thriller, and highly enjoyable.My score: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first problem with this movie: trying to accept Jodie Foster as a mom. Frankly, I'm not a huge fan of Jodie Foster to begin with. She was good in "Silence Of The Lambs," and years ago I liked her in "Carny" I believe it was, but I just do not - and I don't think I ever will - see her as a maternal figure. That was a stumbling block I couldn't overcome while watching this movie.The story (of a mom and daughter trapped in a secret room in their house after it's invaded by a trio of dangerous criminals) also struck me as a bit silly. (I also found myself wondering why a woman with one daughter wants a house that is at least three stories high from what I could see. How much room do they need?) The criminals were unconvincing. The guy in the mask (Dwight Yoakum) was hardly scary, even though he was, I think, supposed to be the hard nosed one, and Forest Whitaker as Burnham - the most "likeable" of the three - seemed strangely out of place (and his very violent bit at the end seemed out of character for a guy who said earlier "I never hurt anybody." I mean, he could have just tackled the guy!)Also, what's with the androgynous child (Kristen Stewart?) I seriously thought Meg's child was a boy for almost half the movie until I noticed her name was Sarah.To me, it didn't add up to a success.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched "Panic Room" because it came as a free loan from a neighbor. They didn't particularly like it either, but watched it because of Jodie Foster. There wasn't anything I could like about it. Why would a newly-divorced woman with small daughter want such a gigantic house? Once the story kicks off, logic tells us the good mother and her child will do OK, because Jodie Foster is in it, and the bad guys will get their comeuppance. That story has been done endless times. So, there must be something else to attract the viewer. Foster didn't play a particularly likeable character, the bad guys were disgusting, so what can we, the audience, identify with? None of us have panic rooms in our houses. The DVD was good, technically it was a good film. But when it was over I thought to myself, "So what?" I don't know why this film was made, and when that's the case I figure the highest rating I can give, on a 10-point scale, is "5".</fullReview>

"The police are already on the way. Do you want to add anothermurder to the list of charges against you?" Meg is an idiot.I am embarrassed to say that I saw this movie. I rated it a 3 because I really like Jodi Foster's work and I can't blame the lousy story on her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent yet misplaced cast - subpar movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I can't understand how Foster would turn down the reprising role of Clarice in a sure to be hit "Hannibal" and then accept the role for this sleeper. Of course, "Hannibal" was not a hit, which I think the poor turnout had a lot to do with her not taking on the role.But anyway, the premise for this movie about a separated mother and her diabetic teen daughter being terrorized by would be thieves, probably would have been better suited for more up and coming younger actors than the superstars Foster and Whittaker. If they used younger stars (like those of the teen thrillers), it probably would have done better. Adding Foster and Whittaker immediately placed the film into a more adult market, and this may be why it didn't do so well. I could see Leto and the surprisingly talented newcomer Kristen Stewart in their roles, but Foster and Whittaker seemed out of place.The movie is rather slow at times to be a thriller and I caught myself dozing at various points. Foster just goes thru the motions of the script, and never convinces me that this role was no more than just some quick pocket cash. Whittaker is pretty good as the tough but compassionate lead thief, and I would like to see him in more "bad guy" type roles, but it's still not a type of movie I expect to see him in. Leto is very good as the hotheaded young "rookie" thief, and newcomer Kristen Stewart did the best acting job - from being the sassy teen to the near death diabetic teen.Overall, to me, the best part of the film is the cool style in which the opening credits were displayed. After that, it just cruised along in slow motion without really causing even a stir, yet alone "panic". This is a $1.00 show movie, or wait for the 5 day rental stickers to appear at the video store. 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A completely ineffectual thriller that has all the fancy camera work, top set design and an A list actress and director. What's missing though is the suspense, intrigue, and that on the edge of your seat aura. Kudos to Jodie Foster for doing a fine job in a very sterile film. A half empty script that's beautifully shot.Pick yourself up one of those black and white british thrillers from the 60's. That's the real Mccoy, this is just Hollywood baloney.</fullReview>

The script is so weak and boring that even the talent of these actors couldn't save it. I kept waiting for the PANIC to kick in...but it was just a bunch of bumbling fools scurrying about a giant house for an hour and a half while a mom and her daughter watch on video monitors. I wish the Farrelly Brothers would have got a hold of this idea first, and cast Chris Rock, Jim Carrey and Ben Stiller as the bad guys. At least then I would have known that I was SUPPOSED to be laughing at the idiocy of the plot...instead of waiting for the non-existent suspense!! Bad bad movie.</fullReview>

This movie played half like From Dusk Till Dawn 2 with all the ridiculous camera tricks, passing through the floor and whatever. Very pointless and distracting I thought.I think this story could have been good if someone took the time to do one more rewrite. The criminals had so little credibility the rest of the film came up lacking. A crazy guy, an idiot and a nice guy sound more like the Three Stooges than a believable threat in a supposedly serious film. Did anyone not see the ending coming? Did anyone even care how it'd end?I like the idea here, I just wish someone had taken the time to even out the numerous idiotic plot points and then tap David Fincher on the shoulder and tell him to direct it the way he has directed his other works, all of which are superior to this, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst yet from Fincher, and that's saying something.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher is the most overrated filmmaker of his generation. The only stuff from him that I like are his videos for Aerosmith during their early-90's social realism period. I remember when everyone was all breathless about "Se7en". I rented the video &amp; I thought it was a stupid rip-off of "The Silence of the Lambs", with lots of pretentious camera trickery. Then there was all the deep conversations about "Fight Club". I saw it &amp; thought it was even dumber than "Se7en". Now comes "Panic Room", supposedly Fincher's least pretentious film yet. This is the (unintentionally) silliest thing I have seen since "Deep Blue Sea".The plot as such involves a single mother &amp; her 12-year old daughter moving into a "modest" 4-story 80,000,000,000,000 square foot home with "two bedrooms and one tiny bathroom". The tiny bathroom is bigger than my entire apartment. And in the master bedroom, there's a panic room where they can lock themselves in if the house is burglarized. Which it is. On the very night they move in, no less. And as if that weren't contrived enough, the burglars want in the panic room. But wait there's more: Mom's claustrophobic. And the daughter's diabetic &amp; needs insulin shots every few hours.And if the plot weren't bad enough, there's the dialogue: One of the burglars smashes a mirror with a sledgehammer while trying to get into the panic room, and another calmly says "That's seven years' bad luck." And when the daughter is trying to calm down, she recites the titles of Beatles albums, starting with "Yesterday &amp; Today". How would a 12-year-old know about that album? It went out of print before she was born &amp; has never been issued on CD.And for over two hours, there are shots of things being *just* out of Jodie Foster's reach (apparently, the character's mother took Thalidomyde), alternating with a bunch of hare-brained schemes to get into (or keep people out of) the panic room. I stuck around for the end credits, half expecting to see the screenplay credited to Lucy Ricardo &amp; Ethel Mertz.There are good points to this film: the visual palate is interesting, and the cast do well with the material they are given.I have nothing against directors who throw in every trick in the book. I admire Quentin Tarantino, Alfred Hitchcock, Peter Jackson, Sam Raimi, &amp; Robert Rodriguez. Unlike those other directors, however, David Fincher is bereft of any real sense of humor &amp; expects everything he does to be taken ultra-seriously, not unlike Oliver Stone. Stone, however, did a couple of honest-to-god masterpieces before going off the deep end into bizarre, over-stylized conspiracy theories. Fincher has yet to make an even palatable film. And the screenplay for this film begs for a director who doesn't take himself so seriously. 4 out of 10</fullReview>

Jodie Foster did to try to make the film work but (just like the other actors) but the script was just lame. Nice concept but no eye for details. For instance the scene when she found out the cell phone didn't work in the room.Fair enough, that could happen in real life, but at the moment she got out of the room to get the stuff she needed to aid her daughter she didn't use her cellphone! Make a call, cops arrive , everybody safe. Maybe i am just whining to much but there were more scences like this that just irritated me. The only reason i gave 4/10 points is because of the great camera job. Really looked impressive the way the camera just slided through the walls and ceilings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tubbysays: PANIC ROOM? The only panic I felt was my own while witnessing this turgidly predictable mediocrity inexorably uncurl. Jodie Foster is embarrassingly dreadful. I was about 30 minutes in when I realised her son was androgenous and in fact her daughter. Drama? Apart from the fact that the script is constipated by predicability, all suspense is lost because you know Foster's starring. What can happen to a star? The writer even throws in the diabetic kid needs his shot routine. Tubby says, there's only the tension of praying it might end after 90 minutes. It doesn't. It goes on and on and on. As a Farah Fawcett tv movie it just might work. Titles excellent. Cast do their best. (apart from JF and offspring, who are as compelling as carrots) Forest Whitaker goes into his slow by meaningful routine. Music tries to do job of the script, but only points up it's vacuity. Tech excellence ditto. Is it likely that this director might at some point find the talent to actually tell a story? He seems grimly insecure unless he can find a way to shoot a simple scene in the most horrendously self-conscious way. I heard Foster turned down the risible HANNIBAL for reasons of it's violence. Perhaps her beef was that she didn't actually didn't get to perform any. This piece of dozy am dram offers her the chance. Queue to miss, or recomend to someone you despise.</fullReview>

A room that enables the residents to jump in and stay safe in case of any danger and of course panic.And that is precisely what happens to this team of a Claustrophobic mother and Diabetic daughter.

		<fullReview>Yes, I know the "don't open that door" type of teasing is a big part of the scare genre. But even within the suspension of disbelief required for these type of plots - it has to make *some* sense within its internal set of rules. For example, the half-naked teenager is allowed to open the door where the monster is obviously hiding instead of calling the police but she is definitely not allowed to hand the chainsaw to Jason and bare her neck...There were far too many of these *too* stupid and inconsistent moments in the movie which made it very annoying. It was obvious that the director wanted to show off 5 or 6 different "effects" and decided not to let the plot get in the way. Sorry guy, but even for a mindless scare flick, plots and characters matter too, that's why they have screenwriters and actors not just directors and cinematographers...I want my 8 bucks back...</fullReview>

This had the right personnel: promising director, Jodie Foster, a potentially gripping thriller, and it falls flat, with a thud that is as unconvincing as the movie itself. Certainly a step back for David Fincher as creative figure.I assume you all know the general plot outline by now. Nice idea, but just downright dismal execution. Ridiculous, illogical plot "twists," unbelievable character behaviors, unbelievable dialogue, a storyline as unfocused and meandering as the characters running to and fro about the house, and a predictable, dud ending (with your "villain that just won't die" thingy). Just about every bad Hollywood filmmaking cliche is employed, to make what is, so far, the most overrated movie of the year. I've seen it in countless mediocre, formulaic, manufactured movies before, and this offers nothing new. After about half-way through, the movie lost whatever grip it had on me."She's destroying all the surveillance cameras in the house. Gee, why didn't we think of that?"*roll eyes*3 points out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved both 'The Game' and 'Fight Club', though didn't care for 'Seven'. But I didn't like 'Panic Room' at all.This is a movie conveniently written, and worse, you feel it. I don't want to give anything away since they are many "mini twists", which is what thrillers tend to be. However, once you see the movie, and think back, you'll see what I mean. There's one example where the robbers say they should have thought of doing a particular thing earlier. And that's the fundamental problem -- there are many things done in this movie to sustain the story or add suspense. Bottom line: I suppose if you don't analyze it too much, it makes for a thriller. But for me, I just felt it was a burden to see it through to the absolutlely anticlimactic ending. 4/10.-Mark</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sometimes still can't believe how incredibly stupid and boring Hollywood's blockbusters have become. With disasters like Tomb Raider or Pearl Harbour in mind, one can't possibly look forward to next blockbuster summer. Who knows how empty and hollow Attack of the Clones nad its clones may be.But here is David Fincher, Hollywood's hotshot, with something we wouldn't expect from him: A flat, boring so-called thriller. After two overrated (Seven, Fight Club), one underrated (Alien 3) and one just plain good film (The Game), we believed that guy could do at least one thing: Keep us interested.Wrong. After probably twenty minutes, Panic Room falls flat. Jodie Foster and her terrible cliché daughter hide in a special Panic Room in their new house when Forest Whitaker and two thugs (one of them being Jared Leto in the worst of overacting moods) break in to get the previous owner's money out of the Panic Room.And that's about it. Fincher shows absolutely no talent for suspense here. When Foster at one point leaves the Panic Room to get her mobile, it's important that no one hears her. So Fincher turns off the sound and makes it all slow motion. No excitement. Fincher prefers to show one digital camera move after the other, which is boring at first but ultimately becomes unbearable. There's also a digital gas explosion. I wasn't sure whether I was watching Poltergeist IV at that point.The script doesn't help. The attackers are not scary at all. Whitaker's the nice guy, the good guy, the sad guy; Leto is a joke, and Raoul, the masked marauder, is all violence. So we're not really afraid. What scared me was Jodie Foster's daughter because I had hoped that we would never have to see a movie character like that again.Then, after 90 minutes of boredom, comes a moment that totally sinks the film: The gangsters are in the panic room with Foster's daughter. The cops arrive. Foster's opening the door, telling the cops nothing's wrong because she's afraid something might happen to her daughter. Now at that point we know that the gangsters have absolutely NO CHANCE of hearing what she tells the cops because the film told us EXPLICITLY earlier on. So why doesn't she tell the cops to stay outside, but also what is going on in there??? I rest my case.The finale would be a letdown - if there was anything good in the film before that.Now don't get me wrong: Of course it's not as bad as Michael Bay. But exactly that is why I'm so disappointed. And by the way, it worked with the audience I saw it with, so it may work with you. But I hated it and it makes me angry that this film turned out to be so bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Fincher will not be winning any Directing awards for Panic Room. He had a true opportunity to take a movie to the next level and while it was not a miserable attempt, it was a failed attempt. The movie started strong with some very interesting camera work. Great angles and continual motion. Unfortunately, about a third of the way in Fincher seemed to lose his confidence in his ability to frame a scene properly and the movie suffers because of it. Suspense that was created by Fincher's early movement fades and by the end the action fades into an average episode of NYPD blues...The writing is almost good but there are no signs of brilliance here at all. The bad guys were cliched. They make occasionally interesting decisions, however they end up being disappointing. In my opinion for this type of movie to be great, the bad guys should be the most intelligent characters in the story. This is just not the case in this one. They end up running around like Keystone Cops. Jodie Foster's character is the usual semi-terrified, semi-brave one she usually plays. It really is getting old Jodie, even if you do only make one movie every two years...The daughter reminds me of Edward Furlong from Terminator II. That is right. Annoying.Considering these flaws, and perhaps a few others I would have given this movie a 6 or maybe even a 7. But for some non-sensical reason David Fincher or somebody down at the studio added on an extra 30 seconds to the movie that somehow took some of the life out of the movie. It was a very 'made for TV' moment, and made my eyes roll into the back of my head it was so whatever. Perhaps it could be that I never really gave a damn about the so-called heroeines in the first place... 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PANIC ROOM (2002) *** Jodie Foster, Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, Dwight Yoakam, Kristen Stewart, Patrick Bauchau, Ann Magnuson, Ian Buchanan. Foster excels in this thriller straight out of `Wait Until Dark' with Foster as a recently divorced mother in NYC who buys a pricy townhouse with the aforementioned titular safe house that comes quite indeed handy when a trio of thugs break in on her first (dark and stormy) night. What follows are some standard plot devices and fill-in-the-blank setups with David Koepp's stillborn script yet a well-played by the cast with a few twists and turns laid down by filmmaker extraordinaire David Fincher and skillful camerawork by his co-horts Conrad W. Hall and Darius Khondji. Composer Howard Shore summons the late, great Bernard Herrmann with his atmospherically apropro score and stop-on-the-dime editing by James Haygood and Angus Hall keep the pace lively. ** Kudos to music/sound engineer Greg La Porta's (sadly uncredited) ingenuity as well!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another good example of film-making from Fincher and company</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher, director of such rough edge contemporary classics such as Se7en and Fight Club, returns with his fifth film, Panic Room, a concentrated crackerjack movie with enough suspense for three movies. Foster gives her best in a good number of years as a new tenant in a large house in Manhattan with roomy spaces and a "panic room" where nobody can get in once you lock the door, on the third floor. The first night seems to be going smoothly for the woman and her daughter, until a trio of ill-matched thieves and somewhat masterminds (Forrest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam) break in the house and the panic room comes into play. What also comes into play is one of the most ingeniously crafted chess game thrillers I've seen in a while. The film goes down thanks to an ending after an appropriate ending, and some character inconsistencies, otherwise, it is worth the while. Great cinematography by Conrad W. Hall and Darius Khondji. Between A- and B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was just awful. Isn't the point of a thriller or suspenseful movie to, well, thrill and cause suspense? Because there wasn't a single instant of either one in this movie. The plot line was not only predictable, it was boring. The script was awful. The cinematography was good but the editing drove me insane -- what was with all the completely random fade ins and outs to black? I kept expecting commercials to appear on the movie screen. I think that the editor and director must have been trying to cause suspense with them, but that's the most juvenile way of causing suspense I've ever seen. I feel very disappointed in both the director -- who apparently was the same director of the excellent Fight Club -- and Jodie Foster. With as grand a career as hers, she should know better than to sign herself up for a dud like this one. I was expecting to at least be entertained by this movie, and I wasn't. It was a waste of my money and my Friday night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reliance on cliches almost ruins a decent thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Foster turns in a very convincing performance, and the bad guys are all effective and interesting, but over-reliance on cliches and showy, pointless camerawork brings down this film several notches. A sampling of the more tired cliches:1) Foster's character, who is forced to spend much of the film inside a small, windowless room, is a claustrophobic 2) Her daughter is a diabetic who needs a shot or she will die 3) The evil psychotic bad guy can withstand punishment that would kill HerculesFincher and the cast manage to mostly redeem the movie, although the former's use of camera pyrotechnics distracts from the tension more often than it helps. Worth seeing, but catch a matinee unless you are an avid Fincher and/or Foster fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~yawn~A completely predictable thriller from start to finish.The only true suspense of the movie was when the house was being broken into. As soon as the crooks break into the house you learned that this was going to be a home alone with a few gun shot victims. Why even bother with going any further into the movie when the two idiots and the crook with a heart start messing things up within 20 minutes of the film. The end feels like your starting back at the beginning with just as many unanswered questions: What happened to the dad? Why did the only crook with a brain get caught after doing good things? What happened with him?From start to finish, the film had MANY MANY flaws. Examples of flaws include Jodie Foster's invincible to fire hand and the crook whose fingers were caught in the door that wasn't suppose to close on ANYTHING. They go on and on, but ~yawning again~? Go see Ice Age! It's a much better film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a film lover I have always found David Fincher's style to be new and fresh, very entertaining to watch. His past three films, Seven, The Game, and Fight Club are at the top of my lists. However, I was very disappointed with PANIC ROOM.With the slim two-dimensional characters, a mediocre plot line, and the poor dialogue I had a hard time believing I was watching a Fincher Film. The acting was good for what they had to work with, but the ending and the plot progressions were very predictable and heavy handed. Fincher style usually is to give you bits and pieces of information as you need it, but in PR the audience knows what is going to happen 30-40 minutes before it actually happens. I do not know if it is the script, the editor or produces' that are responsible for this piece... But we know that Fincher can direct a great film and the visuals were great. But something was wrong. This is not a great film in my opinion.For the new Director of Photography Conrad, I think the film looked like a great film. But it was lacking in so many departments that it is considered to me as just fair.</fullReview>

Some of you, including the person who wrote the plot summary (What are you his mother?) may disagree with me here. So...I give you this rant. His shot's might as well have been hand drawn because the CGI is just plain ridiculous. Jodi Foster does ok but her acting is overshadowed by her Cleavage. Dwight Yoakum's character might as well have been named Larry (everyones favorite "Home Alone" cap-burglar). With his stamina nothing short of kryptonite should be able to hurt him. The pop-culture references in this movie are worse than those written in this humble review. This rant could go on... but why waste the time.

		<shortDescription>Don't Trap Yourself in the "Panic Room!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher has fashioned some first-rate films since he started directing movies back in 1992. The Colorado native called the shots on "Se7en" (1995), a gripping serial killer saga starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as the cops and Kevin Stacey as the villain, that disturbed as much as it enthralled audiences. He toyed mischievously with audiences in "The Game" (1997) toplining Michael Douglas and Sean Penn in the tradition of George Roy Hill's Oscar-winning Best Picture "The Sting." The incomparable and offbeat "Fight Club" (1999) qualified hands down as Fincher's finest, reuniting him with Brad Pitt and co-starring Edward Norton in a pre-terrorist 9/11 opus. Until he made the Jodie Foster crime film "Panic Room," "Alien 3" ranked as Fincher's least distinguished epic, with a shaven-headed Sigourney Weaver impersonating science officer Ripley for the last time as a flesh &amp; blood human being. Comparatively, as the least commercial entry in the creature-feature franchise, the anemic "Alien 3" induced sleep rather than suspense. No matter how atrocious "Alien 3" seemed, "Panic Room" weighs in as infinitely worse. Only deep-fried Jodie Foster fans will savor this superficial, occasionally sadistic exercise in futility. Actually, the producers cast Nicole Kidman, but she injured herself and pulled out. A hopelessly miscast Jodie Foster brings a certain elegance to this unexceptional nail-biter. Indeed, lensers Conrad Hall and Darius Khondji's atmospheric cinematography, the eerie lighting, and the looming interiors win "Panic Room" brownie points, not nearly enough.This inferior feminist fable takes its title from a 12 by 12 foot, steel-plated, concrete bunker inside a four-story Brownstone in Upper West Side Manhattan. The reclusive tycoon who owned it has died, and our divorced heroine, Meg Altman (a bespectacled Jodie Foster) and her diabetic daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart of "Twilight") now occupy the place. Plagued by paranoia, the late millionaire equipped the townhouse with a secret room. This impregnable bomb shelter boasts a high tech surveillance system with a cameras that scan the premises 24 hours a day from every angle inside and outside. The chamber contains its own ventilation system and features a separate telephone line. During the first night that Meg and Sarah sleep in their new beds, they awaken to find themselves at the mercy of three harebrained hoodlums out to steal millions of dollars worth of bearer bonds that the dead financier concealed in a vault in the safe room.Predictably, Meg and Sarah hole up in the bunker while Junior (Jared Leto of "Girl, Interrupted"), Burnham (Forrest Whitaker of "Bird"), and Raoul (country singer Dwight Yoakam of "Sling Blade") toil incompetently to evict them. Aside from their vulnerability as females-at-risk with flaws?Meg suffers from claustrophobia, while Sarah requires insulin shots)?these females do little to appeal to our sympathy. Ironically, Whitaker's character emerges as not only the most sympathetic but also the most interesting. Poor Patrick Bauchau of "A View to a Kill" plays Meg's millionaire, ex-husband (no relation to the deceased tycoon) and takes a hellacious beating from Raoul in a scene which will undoubtedly sicken some viewers.This tedious, third-rate tale unravels from the outset with a premise as contrived as it convoluted plot. What veteran scenarist David Koepp of "Stir of Echoes" fame doesn't steal from his own scripts, he appropriates from the durable Audrey Hepburn thriller "Wait Until Dark" (1967) and the exciting Sean Connery caper "The Anderson Tapes" (1972). The Raoul character clearly recalls the Mafia thug in "Anderson Tapes" that veteran character actor Val Avery played in a ski-mask with a penchant for violence. The ending that disposes of the bearer bonds comes straight out of John Huston's "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" (1948). Had the "Panic Room" been a tenth as entertaining as any of those classics, this derivative mishmash with its unintentionally hilarious histrionics might have proved tolerable. Instead, "Panic Room" resembles a heavy-handed Lifetime channel version of "Home Alone." Decked out in a black, tank-top to display cleavage, Jodie Foster imitates the antics of Macaulay Culkin as she battles a trio of bungling burglars. These clueless cretins make the Three Stooges appear like intellectual titans. Foster is a top-flight actress who shouldn't have stooped to this one-dimensional nonsense. Koepp's script bristles with inconsistencies. After making a big deal about Meg's claustrophobia early in the film, Fincher and Koepp unaccountably drop it from the plot when they tighten the screws on our protagonists. The scene with the butane gas tank elicits derision more than dread, and the flashlight batteries in another scene were clearly of the Eveready variety.Don't get trapped in the "Panic Room."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one thing that annoys me in this movie is that, eventhough Jodie Foster's character couldn't use her cell phone inside the safe room, she had plenty of time at some moment to go out the room and call the police from her bedroom while the burglars were fighting downstairs. Maybe she "should" have dropped it when trying to get a signal through that small hole in the panic room... Apart from that, it's pretty entertaining though I wish Jodie Foster would use her talent for more ambitious and risky films ...</fullReview>

I wasted near 2 hours of my time watching this piece of rubbish.First Off, the acting is truly a disappointment. Jodie Foster is a good actress, no doubt, but she is just really unconvincing here, but in a way I dont think she was right for the part. I kind of wish Nicole Kidman took the role instead. The Girl is irritating. Forrest Whitaker and Jared Leto are decent. The Other guy is stupid.There are interesting shots in this movie, but thats just showing off style for its almost complete lack of substance. David Fincher can make a good movie but this movie just didnt thrill me in the slightest. The Script is also bad. Theres alot of pointless stuff in here just to show off violence. I dont mind Violence in movies but it was kind of unnecessary here.This movie was one of the worst ones of 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Panic room" is not one of Jodie Foster's better effort. There are too many writer incongruities to make the whole movie plausible. **SPOILER** the biggest fault comes when the robbers held the daughter as hostage, they held all the cards, they could have demanded Foster to surrender her weapon and come to them. They did not or fumbled the idea. Also, it was silly for Foster to give her only weapon to her half-dead former husband while she prowled around in her slender frame with a big, heavy sledge hammer against 2 robbers. Lastly, the biggest fau paux came in form of the prize the robbers came for. Hoping to find cash, they found 22 bonds of a million $ each. Treasury bonds are held electronically. There are statements but no certificates. With saving bonds you have the option of receiving certificates, but they are payable to the registered owner only. There are no such thing as 22 pieces of paper (bonds) of a million $ each that would exchange for real money that one walked away with. The writers obviously did not research their plot well.</fullReview>

Let's trot out all the Hollywood cliches, folks! *POSSIBLE SPOILERS* Not 5 minutes into this movie, you can just about predict everything that will happen. Will Jodie &amp; daughter make it out alive? Duh! Will Forest Whitaker, the only black among the "bad guys", be the one to show (predictable) humanity? Yup! Will Jared Leto, (passing off obnoxious, annoying ranting and swearing as "acting") be the first villain to bite the dust? Indubitably! The estranged husband/father--gratuitous and pointless. Dwight Yoakam--gimme a break! The child actress was almost as grating as the kids in One-Hour Photo and Unfaithful. Even the panic room gadgetry was dull, and the plot devices--such as a diabetic child--were forced and trite. This movie is pure, predictable, over-hyped, Hollywood pap. Jodie Foster--what were you thinking of? Forest Whitaker--you should know better! Jared Leto--consider a new line of work. Dwight Yoakam--stick to singing. If I sound angry, I'm sorry. But I hate to see what passes as "blockbuster entertainment" these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete misfire -- 3 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic Room is easily the most disappointing movie in the last year or so. This movie had a great premise, a very good director, and an excellent lead actress. But it is a complete misfire of a movie. There are so many things wrong with the film that I don't know where to begin, but here goes. The biggest problem is in the casting of and writing for the "villains." These guys are one step removed from the comic villains of Home Alone. Their periodic bickering and one-liners are not appropriate for this kind of film, and they serve as a distraction. Because the villains aren't imposing, the terror is not the least bit intense. *spoiler alerts to follow* Next, the Forest Whitaker character (the only truly good performance in the movie) is the only character that has a three-dimensional side. I cared more about him than I did the under-written Jodie Foster character. Even worse, since they made this character gray, I wanted to know what happens to him -- there is NO closure at the end. He gives up his money and freedom to do the right thing and abide by his conscience, and we don't even know what happens to him! I wanted to see Jodie Foster not press charges against him. Something -- anything other than that lame tacked-on ending in the park. Back to the comment about the lack of three-dimensional characters. First rule of suspense -- make the audience care about the potential victims. It just didn't happen for me with Jodie or the doddering husband, which leads me to the next problem: unintentional comedy. The hubby looked about 25 years too old for Foster and after he was beaten up looked like Grandpa from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. There was also more than one occasion when both my fiancee and I laughed out loud when we clearly weren't supposed to. I also can't believe how stupid the characters behaved in this movie -- here we were one step removed from dumb teens in a slasher movie. I really liked Se7en and The Game, but I must lay most of the blame at David Fincher's feet. During the first ten minutes of the film -- especially when mother and daughter turned in for the night -- the movie was eerily atmospheric, as the house itself was a character and the audience knew something bad was going to happen. As the camera panned around the house, I was creeped out as I wondered to myself where the bad guys were and what they were going to do. As soon as we saw them outside getting out of the car, the suspense lessened dramatically. Then as soon as they started the silly bickering, the suspense was gone. It never returned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a really pleasant surprise for me. Though I am a real fan of the other fincher movies (especially "se7en" and "the game"), I didn't really now what to expect from this one.The story didn't sound very original, but like stuff that could make a great movie in the hands of the right director.Well, Fincher was the right director. With this movie about a young divorced woman and her daughter being trapped in a security room of their house while criminals trying to lure them out in my opinion is his very best work so far.Despite some little plot holes that are very easily forgiven, "Panic Room" not only is a great flick, but a wonderful pice of art. I think so because even though the whole movie takes place in one big house, director David Fincher and cinematographers Conrad W. Hall and Darius Khondji manage to create some truly unique shots you haven't seen in any other movies so far.I don't want to go too much into detail, but if you are even a little interested in the art of film making, you have to see this movie.Of course I also highly recommend it for fans of Fincher and/or Jodie Foster.I talked to some guys who didn't really understand what I meant when I told them how great the (digitally enhanced) camera movements were, but that was only because they weren't really movie fans who would recognize these kinds of details.My conclusion: you might argue that the plot is not very original, but the cinematography alone justifies to see this movie at least once.I give it 9 out of 10 points.</fullReview>

I mean, if you look on the video screens at the men to get out to get your cell phone, then surely you can look again to get out and call 911 when they are all downstairs, instead you have to to the lengthy procedure of trying to hook up the landline&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A little bit dumb I think.

		<fullReview>I expected a much better film from Fincher. How on earth can this film have an IMDB rating of 7.5? Fincher did pretty good with a bad script, but that is where he failed. A good director is supposed fix a bad script, plug the holes, smooth over the rough spots; this he did not do. Even if all the implausibles were removed (which could have been done), the story gives us nothing to cheer about. We don't connect emotionally with the characters. That was also true in Fight Club, but it didn't matter because the characters there were quirky and interesting, not so in Panic Room. I also dislike films that are darkly lit all the way through. And in this case, fairly monochromatic. Pure blue flame? It looked like CG electricity. Have the guts to shoot in black and white if you want that effect.I must say, Forest Whitaker is the perfect good badguy. Thanks for casting Ann Magnuson. She deserves bigger and better roles.Oh well, even a good director is bound to have a misfire or two. Fincher is lucky. This one will make money.</fullReview>

The plot seemed forced along in parts, such as the husband showing up on his own to see what was wrong. This IS New York City we're talking about, and the guy's closer to Moses than Van Damme. You would think after getting an emergency phone call you would wait for the police. Bring a gun or some mace at least. However he does the "Friday the 13th There's danger there let me go have a look" thing. Speaking of old Vorhees the one criminal that gets hit in the head with a sledgehammer, falls over the railing to the ground floor which is several floors down then crawls back up a few minutes later was REALLY Jasonish. Lastly it baffled me why she didn't at least tell the police what her situation was as no audio could get up to the panic room. Even if it was just to say "You can't come in or they will kill my daughter but here is the situation." Jodie Foster did a good job and most of the movie is pretty good but the things I mentioned really dragged the whole overall rating down in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't "panic" too much if you miss this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From its slick television trailers to its odd opening credits with the stars' names hovering in the air along with the skyscrapers of New York, Panic Room looked like it was going to be right up my alley with the other Hitchcockian thrillers that I enjoy. The intriguing camera angles that came around the corners at the actors and through the keyhole to the burglars were very unique and piqued my interest. However, these proved to be the highlights of merely a mediocre film. The burglars, looking so menacing in the commercials, were simply bumbling idiots who didn't seem to have an organized plan on how to rob the house. They represented all different personality types across the spectrum: Burnham (Forest Whitaker), the kindhearted inside guy who is just there to do his job and not hurt anyone; Junior (Jared Leto), the bitter son teetering on the brink of hysteria; and Raoul (Dwight Yoakam), the thug who doesn't mind shedding some blood to get the job done. While Jodie Foster did a fairly good job and it was nice to see her in a movie different from her standard fare, the role really could have been done by pretty much any other actress in Hollywood. The movie seemed to stretch out a little too long, and it got a little old seeing what sorts of ideas the burglars came up with to try to get inside the panic room. Overall, this movie was definitely not as scary as I thought it would be, and while there were some good points, it was somewhat of a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER* The last straw for me in being willing to ignore some plot holes was when Dwight Yoakam said (as Jodie Foster's character was smashing all the surveillance cameras) "Why didn't we think of that?" Why, indeed, did the "bad guys" not think to smash those cameras (even when they stared right at them).It is holes in the plot, like that, that make you want to just say out loud "oh come on!" In fact, people did say that, among other things (like "this movie is stupid") when I saw it.Fancy camera work, tight direction and good actors does not a thriller make when the plausibility is ever so slight!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for Fincher fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning! Don't expect to like this movie if you liked Fincher's last three movies!spoilers, interpretation:So it appears that Fincher has taken the Kevin Smith route: in order to safeguard his directing career he is going to intersperse corny Hollywood mainstream movies with his innovative films. 'Aliens 3' and 'Panic Room' fall into the first category, with 'Se7en,' 'The Game,' and 'Fight Club' falling into the latter. I have no problem with Fincher's survival instinct, I just wish I would have known of it ahead of time. So take this as a warning.What you have with 'Panic Room' is your typical Hollywood "thriller." It's not thrilling if you've seen a "thriller" before and remember any of it. A goal is made apparent within the first ten minutes of the movie, and the other two hours are used to frustrate this goal, over and over and over again. Even unrealistic aspects are accepted if they cause frustration. Also, anytime there is an uncomfortable moment, prolong it as long as possible. Use contrived undeveloped tension to add suspense (tension between Jody and daughter, Jody and husband, Jody and good robber - of course all three tensions are resolved nearly simultaneously in the end ). Make use of poetic justice because the good guys always win. Another hackneyed ploy: throw in an anti-materialistic moral into the mix (all three robbers, as well as Jody and daughter, are punished because of their greed) even if it hasn't been built up and has nothing to do with anything in the movie. Advice for film majors: suspense doesn't make corny humor funny, it just makes it annoying.I'll give Fincher another chance of course. In my opinion, nobody has ever directed four must-sees in a row. So I don't resent him, I'm just a bit disappointed. This was not even close to a must-see. It really was ridiculous; I ended up laughing at many of the supposedly scary parts because they were so unbelievably trite. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room is one of those films where the premise is better than the execution. That's not to say it's a bad film, certainly not, but it does suffer somewhat from a mediocre script, thin characterization and a lackluster ending.The main problem I have with Panic Room is how dumb the three thieves are. They enter the film like The Three Stooges, immediately undermining the tension that their entrance generates. I mean, for the film to work as strongly as it could, they should be a major threat, but instead they enter the film while bickering like a bunch of numbskulls. And two of them even think they can break through concrete and three inch steel with a sledgehammer. You're dealing with mental midgets here.Stupidest of the three is Leto's character. He doesn't know how escrow works, he puts his head against the wall when Foster is about to ignite the gas they're pumping into the panic room, he shouts at a PA system and he exposes his plan to screw over his fellow burglars simply by talking to himself. The extent of his stupidity is really too much to ask of an audience with any intelligence and his whole character smacks of lazy writing.But thankfully Leto's character gets shot halfway through. And his killing is nicely done. It's quick, it's brutal and it allows the unhinged Raoul to step up to the plate as the main villain. And although Raoul is a knob and a bit of a rent a psycho, he does seem like a genuine threat. And it's even more impressive considering that the actor who plays him, Dwight Yoakam, is a country music star. He may sing hick music, but he turns in a superb performance.But although Yoakam is excellent, the film easily belongs to Foster. She's strong, she's resourceful and she's entirely believable as a mother who'll blow your head off if you mess around with her kid. After all, is there anything more dangerous than a mother backed into a corner? Personally I'd rather take on a 6 foot 4, 300-pound, bum-hungry redneck called Bubba than a 5 foot 4 woman who wants to defend her kid. The burglars should have left the second they realised they were dealing with a 'mom'.However, while I can easily believe in Foster managing to wrestle a gun off of the psychotic Raoul (again illustrating how stupid the thieves are, Raoul at one point tells her to come out of hiding so he can shoot her and get things over. Didn't he ever have a mum?), her MacGyver routine stretches credibility ? igniting the gas is fair enough, but there's one bit where she somehow hooks up the phone line. She even says, "I have no idea" when her daughter asks her what she's doing. It's obvious that Koepp (the writer) has written himself into a corner and this is the result: suddenly she's a phone expert. But I'm willing to overlook these sorts of things as Fincher gives us ample opportunity to stare at Foster's cleavage when things get silly. It was actually an excellent decision to have her spend virtually the whole film in a black vest, as you're never too far from jiggling breasts, which is fair compensation for gaps in logic.All this shallowness has made me forget Foster's best moment, the bit when she sadistically kicks the door to torture Raoul after he gets his fingers trapped. Like I said before, don't mess with a mom. When you mess with a mom you enter a world of pain.Back to the script problems? The scene where the police turn up is poorly written. Not only does the main cop show far too much interest for a man in his line of work but he even asks Foster if she wants to communicate by blinking her eyes. Even movie cops shouldn't act this silly. Then there's the way that Foster's claustrophobia is disposed of. What's the point in establishing a problem if you're not going to use it? You can even sense Fincher's disinterest in the script in his flashy direction. It's like he has to invent lots of complicated shots to keep him from getting bored. But I do have to say that visually the film is superb. There are some wonderful shots. Although I have to say that I prefer the more simple visuals. For example, I love the use of widescreen ? there's one great shot when you have lift going down on one side of the frame and Leto kicking the door on the other. And I also love Fincher's use of slow motion. The scene where Foster escapes the panic room to grab her phone is excellent, especially in the way that it builds tension by slowing everything down and removing the sound. But the flashier computer shots ? the 'camera' flies into locks, torches and through chairs ? smacks too much of empty grandstanding. Fincher should have worried more about the script.But although the script is decidedly average and although in the end things get too silly ? Raoul gets hit in the head with a sledgehammer and falls several floors but still survives to fight some more ? I do enjoy the film. It's certainly helped by Fincher's visuals and the amazing house (if I were a commie instead of a greedy capitalist, I'd say it was obscene to have two people live in such a huge place). Oh yeah, and of course, it's helped by Foster. She can do the strong woman thing in her sleep but she always does it well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea of this movie didn't seem great to me, but with a good enough director I figured I would give it a chance. The movie is at best so-so, but there are just too many instances of ridiculous behavior that I got tired of it. It's the typical problem with such a narrow concept of a movie, that constant coincidences and misguided actions are necessary to maintain the plot. I probably could have forgiven most of those implausibilities and flaws had it not been for the horribly pathetic and cliched ending. At best I can say that the acting was decent and Fincher has some good moments of direction, but overall a throwaway movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a Terrible Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote a rather lengthy previous review of this movie, pointing out the reasons why I find it so objectionable. I'm not surprised it didn't get printed. IMDB has become extremely corporate, and does the best it can to filter good reviews. That aside, this movie is still terrible. I saw it recently on a movie channel and decided to give it another shot. It makes even less sense on the second viewing.What pervades this film is an obvious sense of not caring. This can be completely attributed to David Koepp's awful screenplay. As the movie progresses it becomes Pollyanna-esque. It is evident that any plot contrivance which can place the heroines in peril will be used, regardless of its inanity or detriment to the impact of the story.The setup itself is ridiculous: recently-independent feisty woman with diabetic daughter alone in giant brownstone they obviously cannot afford. I could take that, alone. Really. But things quickly get worse.The first obvious problems are Koepp's terrible, cringing attempts at humor. Scenes which should be serious are wrapped up with zingers and one-liners which just thud. An example is the pyrotechnic scene with the propane. Immediately after the action, Meg cracks wise with her daughter, "Don't you ever do that!" It just doesn't work. One-liners are a relic from 80's popcorn action films. I remember few in masterful suspense movies.Detailing the numerous, obvious flaws and plot holes would take pages. But I will list a few of my favorites:- The door makes a tremendous noise when opened. That is covered early in the film, then is forgotten later, when the plot requires it. - When Meg comes out to get her cell phone, the bed has at least a foot of clearance underneath it. Yet she only just puts her arm under the bed, and struggles to reach it. This is so she will knock over the lamp and alert the criminals. - The cell phone would have worked if she reached all the way out the duct. - Simply dialing 911 would have brought a desired response from the cops. - If the job was supposed to be easy, why were three guys involved ... except to get the requisite crazy gunman into the tale.This is all very early in the film. This is when Koepp and Fincher should be building the suspense, drawing us in. But it's hard to do that when the setup is so contrived and mechanical. The payoff at the end is itself fraught with problems, not the least of which is the Van Damme comeback of the guy who gets whacked in the face with a sledgehammer. I've actually seen that once before in a Three Stooges short. I have never seen a good movie by David Koepp. Some good ideas, but all with lazy and sloppy execution. It seems he works backwards from the results: he sees where he needs to go and hacks out a path to it. That's product development, not writing.What we had here was a cool concept for a story, some really good actors, and a good director. Koepp just blew it. But it sold pretty well, so expect "Panic Room 2: Panic Harder" any day now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Set up for sucess, but riddled with too many holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic Room had the potential to be a very engaging and a very different suspense/action movie. Jodie Foster plays the divorced wife of a rich man who moves into a very elegant Brownstone/Townhouse mix. With her daughter, the pair discovers that the house has a "panic room" -- a covert room fully equipped with water, food, and supplies in case of emeregency. Sure enough, the room will be put to use very early on. The filmmakers spend little time BS'ing and just jump right to central premise of the movie: lockdown.My main gripe with the film is that too much of the action went back and forth between the characters trapped in the room and the characters on the outside. This third-person approach just seemed to dilute much of the suspense in the movie -- even though the filmmakers used every gimmick in the book to build suspense. The movie should have focused more on the plight of those in the room -- make the viewer feel as if he or she is in the room, rather than watching omniscently as a third person spectator.As with any suspenseful movie -- horror movies being the prime example -- characters in this movie make stupid decisions which the audience knows will cost them later. I have a tolerance for a few mental slips at which I may express verbally their stupidity, but when the film constantly relies on character mistakes and horrendously bad luck, it begins to get on one's nerves. I can understand a few bad things happening -- I can suspend some reality &amp; accept some improbable events for the sake of the story -- but not the onslaught of impossible occurrences. In particular, the two lines in the movie which delegitimizes so much of the movie:-"Hello, 911!" -"Please hold."The film does have some dazzling camera tricks, as the camera gives the audience a magnificent tour of the house (although I believe these tricks helped contribute to the third-person problem which I believe causes the movie to suffer). Additionally, the acting is very good. The movie just suffers from a well-contrived concept turned into a poorly-told story.4/10</fullReview>

He tried to imitate Hitchcock's style, but failed miserably after a good start, losing all suspence for high predictability and poor situations. The only thing I really liked of this movie is the camera shooting, the use of moving cameras: THAT is a remarkable side of this otherwise poor movie.

		<fullReview>&gt;I don't have much to say that hasn't been said in the other reviews of this film. I WORSHIPPED "Fight Club," but I think the real strength of that movie was it's fantastic screenplay, which really organized the brilliant mess of the novel. What's more, the jazzy shots in Fight Club worked to amplify the story. Here some of them work, but the rest are purely gratuitous.&gt;In this movie, there is not a single gadget that we don't have to "fly into" with the help of CGI. In some of the shots this works, like the first one which establishes the layout of the house, but he keeps using the trick until it just becomes pointless. The nadir is when we have to enter the bulb of a flashlight... for no reason. I kept thinking "This could have seen such an efficient low-budget movie, if they didn't blow all this money on pointless special effects." In Fight Club this worked because it further fetishized all of the consumer products, and made the CGI itself a consumer product, further amplifying the themes of the story. Not so here.&gt;This is one of those thrillers in which you could suggest a thousand more intelligent things for the characters to do than they can think of themselves. For example, after the robbers first arrive, Jodie and co. can see that all three are downstairs, and she has unending amounts of time to walk the five feet she needs to go to get her cell phone. But no, she has to wait until we've pumped more "tension" into the story. I think the movie lost a lot of viewers this way.&gt;The general sense that this movie gives off is that it was time for Fincher and co. to do a movie, and this is the best script they had at the time. I think they should have just waited for a meatier script to come along. I can see why Jodie Foster would want to work with this director, but why not wait for a better story? This whole thing was just so trite, it's hard to imagine spending that much time and effort on making it.&gt;But the opening credits were nice.--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com</fullReview>

This movie has one of the dumbest plots I have seen in the suspense/thriller genre. There is some amazing camera work as is usual in Fincher's films, but that does not even come close to making up for the lack of a good story. Every twist and turn in the movie is completely predictable, and the foundation of the plot is highly implausable to begin with. I would not recommend this at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Being The Further Perils Of Pauline, Er, Jodie Foster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fincher in retrograde. Others have delved into the "story" but I won't bother as this sort of stuff was done better nearly 100 years ago in "Perils Of Pauline" (will the heroine get rescued by the villain from the locomotive/bandsaw/raft-over-the-waterfall?). All "Pauline" lacked was expletives and gore, which this flick has in abundance. It's just not done right, so the effect is unintentionally comical. The suspense comes in the form of just how many holes in the storyline can the viewer spot every minute or so. After the first ten minutes of gratuitous product shots of Coca Cola, Evian and Sony littered about The House I had already lost whatever sense of going to the movies is supposed to be about because they were not even GOOD placements (Quick ECU of hand opening bedside fridge (!) reaching for bottle of Evian) and they drain any opening scenes of momentum. This was followed by some of the most unconvincing thugs that ever wandered onto a set. Jared Leto played a loud, foul-mouthed intruder in the manner of a wanna-be actor on his first audition ...I kept expecting an off-camera voice to yell "Thanks. We'll call you." It's as if Rick Fox of the L.A. Lakers (whom Leto slightly resembles) was to suddenly land a supporting role and imagined himself An Actor (come to think of it, Rick Fox might have been a better choice). The bumbling trio is rounded-out by a psycho-killer (Raoul) portrayed by Dwight Yoakam and a con-with-a-conscience played by Forest Whitaker. Yoakam and Leto (in a real bad display of miscasting) are about as sinister as a pair of Don Martin cartoon crooks who couldn't crack an egg, let alone a safe inside of a "panic" room, while Whitaker does OK with his role by reading his lines without screwing them up. If he could have improvised the script, he would have (spoiler ahead) taken his partner Yoakam apart after the latter had a major malfunction to a certain part of his anatomy and was subsequently rendered harmless by an incident with a sliding steel door. These three very unwise men almost succeed in breaking into the panic room, but quit trying for some reason known only to them. An implausable episode with an air duct heightens the awareness in the viewer that this "panic room" is about as easy to break into as a can of sardines. There are security cams galore throughout the house, but does anybody think to do anything about them? The Whitaker character has a heart of gold and could have stopped the movie with a happy ending 2/3's of the way through, but then...oh why bother? Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart are the victims, along with you, the viewer. And The L.A. Times is already running "puff pieces" in its "Calendar" section about "Panic Rooms" and why they are "catching-on" with the rich and paranoid under the guise of "news" and how "David Fincher-this and Jodie Foster-that"... so go on and be a chump and plunk down your $8.50 and wish you didn't. Like Edward Van Sloan said in the intro to "Frankenstein": "Well, we warned you! "Or save yourself the trouble and go rent Kubrick's "The Killing" and see the ending that Fincher pays homage to in his own tepid little way. 4 out of 10 for some neat camera work that will soon be turning-up in every TV spot that can afford it while it's still "cutting-edge."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher´s least successful film yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh yes, one senses what "Panic Room" is about. Is the loss of ones freedom the necessary price to be paid for total security? And what´s total security worth, when there´s nothing but?But one doesn´t see it on the screen. On the scree we have a perfectly staged, lit, set designed, orchestrated, written, directed, scored and last but not least edited cat and mouse game between Ms. Foster and mainly Mr. Whitaker. Nothing less. Nothing more.The premise being that the houses of the very rich contain "panic rooms" as in when in panic go there. No intruder can invade that room and its inhabitant can last longer than the best equipped burglar.David Koepp´s screenplay introduces a very weak McGuffin but then again that keeps the McGuffin in line with the surrounding script itself. For all the stylishness of Mr. Fincher´s staging, it´s let down by the other David´s writing. It´s only too evident that there once was a brilliant movie idea that pitifully enough never materialized into a real movie.Keeping that in mind you just have to marvel at what a masterful director Mr. Fincher is, even when his material sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible thrillers are not exciting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a moment to share my thought on the new film Panic Room. I happened to get a pass to an advance screening of it, and the US release date is March 29th (2 weeks from now). Many people (including myself) liked Fight Club and will probably go see Panic Room in part because it's directed by the same guy.I have to recommend against paying money to see this movie.For those of you who don't know, the basic plot :A mother and daughter move into a house that was owned by a reclusive multi-millionaire. The house comes with a "panic room", a safe room adjacent to the master bedroom which is intended to keep the person safe in case of home invasion. Of course, shortly after moving in, there is just such a home invasion.The fundamental problem with this film is that it isn't plausible. In order for a dramatic situation to be suspenseful, the audience has to be able to imagine that actual events would unfold as they unfold in the film. This is not the case with "Panic Room," and neither nice cinematography or solid performances from two (Stewart and Whitaker) of the five leads can save it.Example :The mother and daughter are in the panic room. They're unable to call the police because they haven't hooked up the extra phone line, but the bad guys can't get in because the room is encased in steel and concrete. The bad guys try to think of a way to put pressure on the people inside, and knock holes in the wall. Luckily for them, the ventilation duct for the room is easily accessible behind a thin layer of drywall. The bad guys make use of this to pump propane gas into the room, causing a crisis.This crisis is only exciting if one can imagine a world in which a paranoid millionaire pays tens of thousands of dollars to construct a steel and concrete safe room, wire cameras to it, stock it with supplies, etc. etc., and then ALLOW UNRESTRICTED ACCESS TO THE AIR HE WILL BE BREATHING.There's a long list of similar no-brainer plot holes that you could drive a Budget truck (from Pittsburgh) through. There's lots of bells and whistles and the script/direction keeps the movie going, but the real excitement of a thriller like this lies in imagining "what would I do in this situation?" However, you could never be in this situation, because this movie is not set in the real world that you and I share. The movie even makes hip self-aware nods to some of the most obvious plot holes, but referencing them without explaining them only serves to make them more glaring.I give it a thumbs down. I don't have a problem suspending disbelief, but I do have a problem suspending rational thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do people who make movies ever take the time to watch the movie they made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic Room proves what I have suspected for awhile now "if you've seen the trailer, chances are good you've seen the best of it." This movie could have been great. It was a fresh idea (the "Panic Room concept") showing the great lengths the wealthy will go through to service just about anything.The problem with Panic Room the movie is "it was like watching a movie made by the Oxygen channel for girls." It also had all the clichés any politically correct person could ask for. Mother behaves like wild animal when her young are threatened, no good cheating husband is useless, a coward and thoroughly beaten up. The relationship between the mother and daughter is more of the tired, over used "were really friends; not just mother and daughter." The only good guy was a Black man who had a "real" problem of being down on his luck in a custody battle (I think that's what it was, because the movie did little to flesh that out.) and the villains were morons to boot. For me it was like watching Home Alone two without the humor or the movie making skill involved.I kept watching this film school like production, because I was sure that "any moment it will get good." I stayed to the bitter end; God I wish I hadn't. If the ending had been more like what we thought it might be since it seemed to lead us in a particular direction, then I would have said "Not a great movie, but not awful either.If I had made this movie the ending would have looked like this ; " After Forest comes in and shoots the bad guy he then turns to run out the door. The daughter says "Please... wait!" Jody says "No let me go!" Daughter says "Mom he saved my life... all of our lives!" Jody gives Forest a long stare as the SWAT team enters. They start ordering Forest to the ground, then Jody speaks and says "No wait! He's our alarm guy. He came here to check on us... "he saved us all." The overly cautious Cop from earlier doesn't believe her and asks everyone if that's the way it really is and each actor agree although Jody must give a short glare at her hubby to get him to go along. Last shot in the scene is both Jody and the cop staring at each other, the cop with a knowing look of Bull when he sees it and Jody with her poker face of conviction that says "I win you loose."The camera fades to black during this stand off and the last scene is mother, daughter and Forest in the day light talking about what their plans are for the Bearer Bonds. Forest is going to hire a great lawyer to keep custody of his kids. Jody is now independently wealthy and no longer needs her looser x . Daughter want's a red Corvette convertible, but Jody says collage fund first. Daughter rolls her eyes, they all laugh, hugs are exchanged and Jody and daughter watch as Forest walks off into the sun set."What did you say? Formula? Same old, same old? Sure, but at least my movie HAS a formulated plot, and a complete IDEA, and a happy ending to a terrible situation to boot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought to myself, great, David Fincher is brilliant, this will be fantastic, but no. Panic Room is disappointing at best. It starts well, with wonderfully clever long, sweeping shots full of Fincheresque imagination, and little cinematic hints of events to follow, however, the subtle hints begin to become screamingly overdone, and the audience is treated as children to be explained to. This never happens in Fincher's past gems. Also, never before have we had to put up with ridiculously stupid characters; the premise of the movie is flawed, no protagonist or antagonist should be that ill equipped.</fullReview>

Forget about suspension of disbelief since a teenage horror movie is more believable!

		<shortDescription>A boring, strange movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by writing that I don't usually write reviews for big-budget movies, with tons of reviews already out there, but I have made an exception for this movie:This movie is very odd, because it seems to want to bring elements of "Home Alone" to an adult audience, while attempting to make a strong female character, and at the same time have said-character where a tank top which shows her constant cleavage. The strangest thing is that they are selling this as a "thriller," while really it seemed to me to be a "yawner," at least up until the first shot was fired. MAYBE A SPOILER Then it kicked it up a notch (from Neutral to 1st gear), and after the "ruse" from the intruders another notch (from 1st to 2nd). END SPOILER From there the movie just seemed unbelievable, but at the same time, amazingly watchable (not unlike a horror movie).My problems with this movie are many. First, if you are going to try and tailor a movie to a female audience, why bring Fincher on board as the director? It doesn't make sense, because he is going to try to make the film dark and draw soon-to-be-disappointed males (like myself) into see the movie. It doesn't make sense, and while I brought "the great one" up, anyone else see his "Alien3" disaster? He needs a great script to shine, and this failed to have that.Back to the target audience, if the movie is tailored to women, why have Jodie Foster run around with her breasts hanging halfway out her shirt for the first-half of the movie? I'm a guy, and would usually applaud such blatant T&amp;A, but it's JODIE FOSTER, and I was looking for a plot, not her cleavage. Once the movie was over, the first thing I said to the two women I went with was, "Jodie Foster's breasts should have had top billing, because they were the only thing going for the first half of the movie."On to the "missing" plot, I cannot believe you can rehash bits and pieces of different movies and expect it to work. Everything just seemed thrown together and then you have to suspend reality more times than should be expected. SPOILER "Hey look, Jodie was ten inches from the fire and didn't get burned, but Jared Leto did." C'mon, let a three-year old watch that part, and tell me if he believes that could happen. It's just stupid. That coupled with country music's hardest head, and now you've gone to far-fetched. END SPOILER Also, the fact that I went in thinking that the idea of a "Panic Room" seemed utterly stupid, and left feeling that the plot-device actually did NOT seem to hurt the film, means that Fincher should be congratulated on being able to sweep over the idea either quite well, or quick enough to not let the audience really think about it.The actors all seemed to be acting in there own movies. Foster ran around enough that it was hard to tell how well she was "acting." I think she was doing her best "I Know What You Did Last Summer" impression by running around like mad and leaning over everything just to make sure you knew she was female. Leto played his part well, but unfortunately his character had the depth of a mud-puddle. Forest Whitaker brought his "every other movie" role to this, and just seemed TOO nice from the VERY beginning. Note: It is nice to have the character progress over the movie, instead of keeping him the same. Dwight Yoakam brought some much needed life to the movie, and progressed into what you figured he would be, but how hard is it to act in a ski-mask though? The girl played her part well, and was very realistic in most every scene. She shouldn't have ran circles around some of the other, more decorated actors the way she did.If you "must-see" this movie, you will be fairly impressed with the cinematography, some of the acting and occasionally the direction. If you are a guy, you will probably find the plot too "sweet" and the action not up to par. If you are an avid film watcher, like myself, you will find most of the ideas have been recycled and that the acting and writing are not as good as they should be. Overall I was quite disappointed, but I'm not the target audience (but who really is?). I rate it a 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie with such a simple premise, taking place on such a confined set, should be very compact, but David Fincher's thin, disappointing "Panic Room" seems scattered. Recently-divorced woman and her un-girlie preteen daughter take refuge in a "safe room" after three thugs break into their posh Manhattan digs; they don't want to kill anyone, but what they're after is in that precise room. The contrivances in the set-up are very nearly smoothed out (except for a stupid bit involving a flashlight) and the show-off camera techniques are actually welcomed (they add some jazzy visual juice to spike the proceedings). However, Jodie Foster isn't given much to work with in the lead--in fact, nobody is. It's a by-the-numbers exercise in suspense, with echoes of "Wait Until Dark" besides. It does get your blood pumping, but the direction and the editing allow it to flag in the stretch. The finale is hectic and visually confusing--releasing the tension the narrative has built up--and the epilogue is flat. Why not add some offhand humor to the mother-daughter conversation? Something like, "Let's pass on that apartment, Mom, it's got a panic room." **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic room disappointed me. It sounds a lot more interesting than it is. The premise is that a mom and her kids are trapped in a "safe room" while dangerous criminals try everything they can to get into the safe room.Unfortunately - the movie goes very wrong.First - I found her older kid distracting as I couldn't tell if it was a boy or a girl. I know it sounds stupid, but the whole movie this bugged me. Secondly - I think this movie would have been much better if the criminals had a collective IQ above that of a rodent. These are the dumbest criminals this side of "Home Alone". Which makes the whole picture unbelievable. Thirdly - In a cat and mouse thriller - the movie needs to be one step above the audience. This movie is so stupidly written that the audience figures out what's going to happen and waits for the film to catch up.The last distraction is that there is no point to the direction. Camera shots are pointlessly convoluted (i.e. swoop down the stairs over the counter and through the keyhole). It's like the director knew that the story couldn't hold it's own - so he threw in a bunch of camera effects just to try to keep the audience interested.This movie is unrealistic, boring and takes the audience's IQ for granted.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This had the opportunity to be a good movie, but the story line and characters were so flawed it was pathetic. The little girl is portrayed as being a diabetic going into a coma because of low blood sugar. Unfortunately, the insulin shot she supposedly needs would worsen her condition, not help. Diabetics suffer from high blood sugar, unless they take too MUCH insulin. Then, there is a third crook who suddenly is brought in, for no reason, other than to be the mean guy. The fellow who is supposedly smart enough to design panic rooms, is too stupid to take off the jacket he is wearing with his name on it. All the crooks had to do was act like they left the hosue to get Foster and her kid out of the panic room. But, no, let's build a story around incredible stupidity. Why do two people need, or for that matter, want a three story house? How ludicrous is that? Makes no sense. Jody foster can afford a three story house in Manhattan, but has to hook up a friggin phone line herself and didn't get it done before the crooks show up. Finally, you can short out a phone line anywhere in the house and it will make the line appear busy to outsiders and be unusable to insiders. Why would mister smart enough to design a panic room have to use a sledge hammer to disable the phone line?! These were a few of the things that took away from my enjoyment of this movie, eliminate those flaws, and it was a neat concept, just poorly done in the details.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is usually the movies that had the potential to be good that make the worst movies. Panic Room is just such a film. David Finchner, with the exception of his first film Alien 3, has up to this point been making exemplary films. They are suspenseful when they mean to be and thought provoking as well. Panic Room is not. While Finchner has been known for his original cinematography here, with the exception of the establishing shot of the Alten's apartment, a lot of it is superfulous and quite distracting. The other major problem here is that David Koepp's script makes two of the three robbers quite likeable and sympathetic. Worst of all is the resolution, very incomplete and illogical. A lot of ingredients for a good if not great film were here, just someone left the oven on for too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical dumb thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After four excellent movies - the last of which, "Fight Club", is an absolute highlight in his career - Fincher makes his first non-remarkable film. While the movie does have some trademark Fincherisms such as great photography (though less spectacular this time around, due to the fact that everything happens in a house), interesting camera work, and some suspense, there is a feeling that this is merely a thriller like any other. And like almost every other thriller, this one has its share of idiotic moments (which come mostly in the obligatory "grand finale").Firstly, there is no logic in Foster not telling the two cops at the door what the situation is and that they shouldn't get inside the house because her daughter's life is in jeopardy; after all, she knows that Yoakam and Whitaker can't hear the conversation. Secondly, why in hell would Foster's (ex)husband (who looks more like her grandfather when he first appears) be alarmed enough to call the police yet also be dumb enough to enter the house himself, before the cops arrive? Both of these things aren't entirely moronic or incredible, but the first has a dose of illogicality in it, while the second is a little far-fetched.However, there is nothing - and I mean nothing - that can excuse the incredible imbecility of my third example: in the "grand finale" Yoakam gets hit by Foster on the head with a SLEDGEHAMMER, and then FALLS ALL THE WAY DOWN a couple of meters to the bottom floor. Yet what happens? Yoakam RISES FROM THE DEAD - or from THE UNCONSCIOUS, if you like - and walks around as if Foster merely scratched his face with her nails, and then proceeds to threaten Foster and her family once again. May I remind you at this point that neither Foster nor her daughter got a sledgehammer smashed onto their heads and yet Yoakam is in better shape than they are. Add to this the fact that Yoakam had previously had half of his hand crushed to bits by a steel door, and you've got a truly spectacular bit of idiotic writing. I truly can't get past this appallingly inane moment, and this is the main reason why I consider this movie to be slightly better than average - at best. It may be great for a thriller, but thrillers are generally so bad that it means nothing to say that this is a very good thriller. This sledgehammer/Yoakam moment rates right up there with "Fatal Attraction"'s bathtub/Close moment and any major dumb De Palma moment. Plus, there is the total predictability the moment Yoakam first appears that he will kill or at least beat up one of his partners-in-crime.Fincher is the best young director in recent years, and I hope that this movie isn't the beginning of his fall, the way it has happened with the Coen brothers. He should seek out unusual scripts, the way he has done for his three previous films and stay away from standard fare; that kind of stuff (or crap) he should leave to the Van Sants and De Palmas of the film world. Jodie Foster is quite good here, better than in her other movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashy, gimmicky and nothing special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fincher's latest film is nothing more than an excercise in flashy camera tricks and comic/disaster situations. There are much more humorous moments then there are tense moments and the film lacks the feel of a real thriller like "Psycho" or "The Sixth Sense". This is due to the one-liner writing and absurd plot line. Granted, Fincher's "Panic Room" is well made and the production is nearly flawless. But the highly-stylized shots and the crazed performance of Dwight Yoakam do nothing but provide a few cheap thrills in a film that contains criminals who do nothing but "the three stooges" routine for the first hour of the film. This is disappointing coming from Fincher whose thriller "Seven" was such a brilliant film and coming off the amazing "Fight Club". I was expecting more than petty slapstick and a by-the-numbers performance from Jodie Foster. Weak plot but well made. Definitely a renter. Slightly above average: 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer to this movie and decided not to go. Joy of joys I was then invited to see a preview screening for free. I went with low expectations and these were shattered. This film is contrived, insulting, boring and a total waste of your time and money.It is not the scary suspense you are lead to believe by the trailer. In fact you've only just met Jodie Foster and her daughter when the crime begins, and you care no more for them as characters than the criminals who are trying to get inside the "panic room". The minimal plot is completely inconsistent and has you laughing in despair. After films such as Fight Club and Seven, it's hard to see how the director could have made a film so monumentally awful. Sadly though your left wondering if it was all done on purpose, not so much as to mess with your mind, but just to see how disappointed and angry they can make you feel, whilst running away with your cash.On top of this the film was shot terribly, showing countless close ups of mundane items, such as phone rechargers and plugs, and repeatedly flying the camera through walls, door cracks, key holes and coffee pot handles. Complemented by blatant brand placement, contrived close ups of Jodie's bust and unnecessarily gruesome violence.However, there is in fact a good game you can play with this film. Take any detail, and then ask yourself "Does this really make sense?" or "Was this believable?". I challenge you to find one thing that made sense. A few for example...If you built a panic room so that no one could get in or harm the occupant, would you really put the wires and ventilation system on the outside?Rather than simply stocking a panic room with water, might you not also put some food inside?Is there any reason why you can't use a cell phone inside the room? Wouldn't this have been an obvious feature?It goes on and on, but don't waste too much more of your time on it, you've already been robbed of 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It would have been easier if the thieves just rent the place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The entire movie falls to pieces when you suddenly realize that if the thieves rent the place to get the three million dollars, it would be a lot less messier, no "thirty years in jail" and a happy ending. But no, they had to complicate matters. Just the fact that they entered the house is enough to scare the people living there would be more than enough to get a vacant building. In any movie, I think the most important element in a story, is not really the plot, as what Aristotle thinks! It is the premise of the story being more important than the plot. Then we have all these movie producers reading up on interesting plots and catchy titles. Yes "must see movie" does grab you, but premise, and then as the story unfolds, it is the suspense that keep people watching. The plots are just the mechanics of holding the suspense minute by minute. The premise of the logic of the whole thing that makes a story believable enough to draw our interest throughout the story. It is true Panic Room has some of the finest actors, including Forest Whitaker, Jodie Foster, but if the premise doesn't hold, the story feels a bit off like a comedy. At least this is my literary criticism studies with four years down the toilet. When will the producers learn?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of unbelievably stupid and incompetent characters in ridiculously unlikely circumstances act out a predictable sequence of thriller clichés. Forest Whitaker does his usual hesitant bad guy with a kind heart, Jodie Foster does her usual panicky executive mom.I suppose the film is technically well done (hence the score of 3, not 1). Cinematography and sound are competent, but it's hard to judge the quality of direction, acting or editing when the script is so bad you just want to grab the characters by their collar and shout "get a clue, you idiot!".Avoid, avoid, avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really surprised people have rated this as high as 7/10. It was another one where the trailer made it look better than what it was. Occasionally Panic Room threatened to get interesting but never was more than ok.We had the entire cinema to ourselves for this &amp; 20 minutes in I could see why. It was handy as we were able to regularly say to each other "why is she doing that" or "I thought that couldn't happen" without bothering anyone. Likewise we had a loud chat about what a stupid idea it was calling a boy Sarah, before eventually one of us suggested it may be a girl.Anyway, the film. The main problems (aside of the cliched to death, diabetic girl who needed her sugar intake) was the flaws &amp; inconsistencies. I was aware of some beforehand &amp; thought I could put up with them but they became really irritating. Leaving aside the propane gas error!(1) You had a panic room which you could only speak out of, not into. By the end of the film it had reversed &amp; Jodie was speaking into it. There may have been a reason I missed, but even allowing for that would have created more questions.(2) We're told at the start there are sensors so the door of the room would not shut if something was in the way. Fine. What happens later? Jodie traps the villains' hand in there. Why did it not open again? If it was because the hand was between the 2 ultra violet sensor lines (and not through them) why mention it at the start at all? Forget the sensors completely &amp; it would have worked better.(3) Then there's a brief allusion to Foster's claustrophobia at the start, that miraculously disappears without trace as the film went on.(4) Why tell the police she was fine, and then immediately proceed to smash all the cameras up? Surely the latter would've angered the villains' just as much as the former.On top of that, what a gas lighter was doing in the room I weren't sure, nor why they couldn't have use the hole looking out to push something(s) through to gain help. The ending also seemed a rush job, infact the final scene seemed of no purpose whatsoever other than to suggest the moral of the story was 'don't live in a big house.' The directing from Fincher (and I enjoyed Seven &amp; The Game) become a tad over the top by the end moving through wall, so did the over emphasis on darkness.The story could moved along quicker but was best suited to a one hour TV crime show , not a film. But even allowing for the Home Alone esque villains, the acting wasn't bad &amp; I've still seen a lot worse.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room... mere words cannot describe the expectations that have hit rock bottom for me and many others. How can one come from such brilliant works of film (i.e. Seven, The Game, Fight Club...even Alien 3)to this level of plot holes, pop culture references, and comedians posing as villains? I'm sure that there are many people who will walk away from this movie thinking that it was a "good movie", but by whose standards? We all know the type of people that will like this movie; the same people that wait with great anticipation to see any of the cookie cutter movies that are smothering the art we all know as film. It is a shame to see that David Fincher has dropped to this level, and I hope that this is not the caliber of work that we can expect in the future. A word of advice for all viewers who hold Fincher in high esteem, steer clear of this movie if you do not want to become disillusioned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my God! This is a David Fincher movie, The guy who gave movies like "Fight Club" and "Se7en".The only thing that will come out of you after watching this movie is 'what a waste!'. The story and the plot of the movie is brilliant. If properly directed this movies could have been in the list of top movies. The beginning was good, but there are times when you will definitely conclude that even YOU could have done work better than that if you were the director. The thugs, their unnatural movements (three of them going in a line!) and conversation between them, the way of getting ideas to get out of the panic room and another hundreds of things are just complete abnormal, unnatural, and irritating. Also the way Fincher used his camera, like point of vision going through different holes and walls (the type he used in some part of the beginning of Fight Club) THROUGHOUT the movie, is also very irritating. If you want to give someone an example of bad direction, show him/her this movie!Well, I must quote something about Kristen Stewart when I write a review on her movie. I think only her dialogs and behaviors seemed real. Ya, the child Kristen was good. I like her!6/10: for real bad direction and good concept, plot and story which may glue you to the seat till the end of the movie(of course with irritations inside you).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room(2002) Suspenseful home invasion flick where Jodie Foster and her daughter lock themselves away in a self contained and impregnable room of their large brownstone home in Manhattan after three men enter the home in search of millions of dollars they believe to be hidden away. The movie at this point becomes a chess game where the thieves try to get Foster out of the room, which unbeknown to her is where the money is hidden. Dark and frightening at times, Panic Room is aided by a good cast including Forest Whitaker and the always crazy Dwight Yoakam as the gun wielding Raoul. Foster gives a solid performance as the frightened mom who decides to fight back. Violent and obscenity laced, Panic room should keep you on the edge of your seat</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I ve always been a great follower of David Finchers work. Several years ago after seeing SE7EN for the first time, I realized that this was director with exceptional, cinematic ability. Fincher will grip you and kindly invite you into his world, then traps you inside. PANIC ROOM, Finchers latest movie was a fantastic, simple, yet gripping piece of filmaking. From the opening title sequence and throughout, this movie had all the elements of a Hitchcock classic, however Fincher brought his dark, raw and gothic-like ambience to it, making this a much watch picture. With an exceptional cast and a stunning director, this movie is a simplistic popcorn Saturday night in with the misses movie. Go and rent now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not-much-panic room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard about this movie when a screenwriting website ripped the script to shreds. And I can't say they were wrong. The good : Jodie, Forest, the atmosphere, the camerawork (I wonder how much CGI was used). The bad : the plot development, the ending...I cannot understand why anyone would think this movie to be scary. And I say this as someone who has a very low fright threshold. The villains are such a wimpy bunch that I actually started feeling sorry for them in the second half of the film. They do not represent much of a threat after 1 1/4 hours of movie time. The finale is totally ridiculous as has been mentioned before. There are several plot holes, and I do not agree with Ebert that the behaviour of the characters is believable and realistic. The central conceit (woman and daughter besieged in impregnable room) is too static to carry the entire film : very little actually happens, which is logical as hero and villains cannot interact directly. So in act III the roles are reversed - and any creepiness or fear is completely lost, the victim becomes the agressor, and I was left wondering just how long this was going to go on for. It's also possible to predict a lot of what's going to happen, especially in the first half of the film. In other words, much ado about nothing, and I absolutely do not understand the gigantic success of the film. Jodie deserves far better than this!</fullReview>

I wonder if he could have done the "I'm really fed up withthis," hand gestures a few more times. The scene at the door with the cops has to be one of the mostidiotic exchanges I've ever seen on film. The child attacking thekiller with two syringes wasn't all that thrilling, but watching himcold cock her into the fireplace almost made up for it and Igenerally like kids a lot.

		<fullReview>This movie isn't bad, but by no means does it live up to Fincher's last movie Fight Club, nor his previous movies before that: 'The Game' and 'Seven'. It's almost as if Fincher has taken a break from the hard-hitting, complex style of his three previous movies, and Panic Room is a relaxed, maybe even 'on-the-side' kind of project.Panic Room has some memorable scenes, and when people ask me 'is it good?', I can only say that it's entertaining, but not to expect too much. So what good scenes? Well, go and see it and find out. All the performances are good, the actors seem relaxed. But for me, the movie, or more specifically the story, is missing something.It certainly isn't missing special camera effects, there's plenty of this sort of thing - perhaps too much. The camera goes places where cameras aren't supposed to go. It's eye candy for eye candy sake, and audiences will lap it up (I did).As a work of art, this movie is unresolved in my opinion...but like I said, still entertaining. Will make a great DVD. And I'm looking forward to Fincher's next movie - hopefully he'll be back from his 'break'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading many reviews and hearing everyone rant and rave about this movie, I finally decided to check it out. Boy, do I wish I could get my $8.75 back for this piece of junk. I went in expecting to be thrilled and kept on the edge of my seat like so many people were claiming, but I left the theater baffled and VERY disappointed.You all know the basic plot of the movie (if not, go find out about it), so I don't think I have to go into details on it. Instead, I'll concentrate on telling you the reasons why I thought this movie sucked.Basically, I didn't find the movie thrilling at all. Everything that occurs in the movie is SO predictable that you're not thrilled or surprised by anything that happens. Supposedly though, the whole thrilling part of the movie is supposed to be the idea of you being in Jodie Foster's situation. However, if you're anything like me, you don't have a panic room so it's kind of hard to relate. In real life, if people break into your house (God forbid), they're going to take what they want and aside from having an alarm system or something, there's pretty much nothing you can do about it.Also, if this were real life and you by chance HAD a panic room, once you locked yourself in the room you're safe. There would be no reason to go out, no reason to do anything but either wait for the police to come or wait for the robbers to leave. But since this is a movie, of course there HAS to be some reason for Jodie Foster to leave the room or else the movie would have no point since the room is impenetrable (although last time I checked, steel is far from impenetrable). So the movie throws in ridiculous, predictable excuses for her to leave the room that are there for no other reason than to prolong this sorry excuse for a movie.Finally, the biggest thing that bothered me about the movie was the end scenes. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone (although the movie is so predictable, there's nothing to spoil about it), so let's just say that someone portrays super-human abilities after having something done to them. When you see the movie, you'll know what I mean.The bottom line is that this movie is nothing but a waste of your time and money. As one of my friends that saw the movie with me said, "This is basically just an R-rated version of 'Home Alone.'" I couldn't have said it better myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply awful film from talented people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this at home with 3 other people and we all agreed it was terrible. A routine thriller with predictable and cliched plot twists which is filled with inconsistencies. It lost us all from the beginning when Jodie Foster and her transsexual-looking daughter move into the largest apartment house in the entire Manhatten area. It's absolutely vast, could house about fifty people and must cost a fortune to rent - yet here we have a single mom and her kid snapping it up without a blink of an eye. Like, yeah!! Then, when the burglars arrive and Foster and child hide in the panic room the idiots tell her what they want is in the room - why didn't they simply go away and come back later when she had left the mansion to go to work (?). And then Foster is in the panic room and they are all two flights of stairs down arguing and she can see them on a close circuit monitor but doesn't quickly pop out to pick up her mobile phone in the bedroom to call the police (oh, she remembers to do this half an hour later when they are closer to the bedroom and conveniently knocks over a lamp while looking for the phone...). The villians keep using the F word to no apparent purpose and then helpfully all shoot each other whilst a SWAT team randomly appears at the end when it is all too late. Absolute awful screenwriting credited to at least 4 people. All concerned have done far better and you wonder what attracted them to this mediocre story in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room proves to be a very disappointing film in all aspects, except the creepiness factor. Visual "innovation" cannot save uneven plot with characters you don't believe-in for a minute. And that "innovation" means countless camera drives through insides of locks, through the walls, into the glowing fiber of the flashlight ... none of which reveals anything pertinent to the story. What seemed fresh in Fight Club is now used over and over and over ... but without a structure or purpose it really only underlines the weakness of the whole undertaking. Foster seems to be not well in trying to walk a fine acting line between unsecure sheepish mother and soon-to-burst-out ass kicking mental patient. There is a plenty of "I love you's" between mother and daughter characters but you feel no real relationship between the two. Her character's behaviour towards the end of the movie is out of the common sense realm. She knows that she can tell the visiting cops anything she wants because the bad guys have no audio-only pictures while watching them, but follows with a long scene of trying to make the cops believe nothing's wrong in the house. ... there are plenty of opportunities to better their plight, in the last quarter of the movie she's the one with the gun, yet isn't able to use it to her advantage... And of course she hits the bad guy in the head with a big sledgehammer so hard, he falls down to the next floor, only to come back half a minute later for the "finale" Pleeeeaaaasseeee! How could the director believe that by splattering his "style" all over some overworked, formula, made-by-committee movie, he can save this goulash of superficiality. He created a creepy movie but not scary one. Once you don't believe - you're not afraid. Well done acting work by Dwight Yoakam as Raul-the really bad guy of the bunch. Forest Whitaker plays, forgettably, the other, - a "big teddy bear" kind of a criminal, "see, he's got problems at home, that's why he breaks into people's houses"... You don't know if you should get him a counselor, fifty bucks or a hug ... Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are face to face mostly low-minded Hollywood thriller from the video clip director of Madonna, David Fincher and screenplay writer of the big budget movies David Koepp, like Jurassic Park, Carlito's Way, Mission Impossible. In my opinion both Davids really messed up a basic good story which one could be more presentable on the other's hands. They were lucky about the producers hooked up Jodie Foster to replace original cast Nicole Kidman for the high box office income. Also Kidman should be finds herself lucky after watching it, even if she (accidentally!) gets rid of this one. Couple of minutes after, starting to watch this movie by why! questions then bla..bla..bla..it ends without shows any reasoning. Foster's performance as unusual and talented Whitaker supposed to be taken unawares while sitting his home without work. So bad acting from big stars, bad directing from a young director plus very nonsensical dialogs, like Foster does to the police officer in her front door. It is very interesting the neighbors hears nothing but loud talks and gunfires coming from a small pistol with silencer after whole wall breaking and the gas blowout at that time on an average quiet street. For the final this movie is absolutely,definitely,literally incapable in it's own class or kind. I think one David is enough for one movie set. I give four stars on ten stars scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The simple premise means the action feels forced but the cast are OK and the film is enjoyable enough to watch once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thinking themselves lucky to have gotten a tip on a large two-storey building, with a garden in Manhattan, divorcée Meg Altman and her daughter snap it up at asking price quicker than you can say "do you really need all that space?" and move in right away. As well as the space and the garden the house also has a curiosity value with a steel lined panic room built in and, despite Meg's dislike of it, it is an interesting addition that she'll never need to use. However there is another party that is interested in the house, specifically something valuable that they have come to steal. Spotting them in the house, Meg quickly grabs Sarah and runs into the room ? problem is, what the gang want is in the room with them. While Meg and Sarah fortify their position, the gang try to work out how to either get into the room or get them to come out of the room.Sometimes the simplest ideas can be very effective and produce great thrills because the script knows the boundaries and generates thrills by reminding us all the time that we are stuck within those boundaries (Die Hard and Speed come to mind as examples) and so I hoped that Panic Room would manage to do the same and work with a good sense of claustrophobia and tension. At times it does do it pretty well but it can't do it consistently and at times it does feel padded and like specific situations feel forced to squeeze the maximum tension out of them. This is not to say that it is a poor film, because it isn't ? I actually quite enjoyed sections of it but it was certainly not good enough to be worth a second look. It is a bit forced and I was never really truly gripped by it because there were too many things that niggled me about the film's inner logic but, like I said, it did enough to keep working just about.The cast try hard and indeed much of the tension comes from their hard work. Foster has to throw herself about with all the twists that the script requires of her and she does it reasonably well. She didn't convince as a person but she was good with her tension. Whitaker and his crew are where the guts of the film lies and, although their infighting is predictable, it is no less enjoyable for it. He is the crook with a heart but he does have a good screen presence that worked for me; likewise I thought Leto was pretty good. Yoakam is not as good but he was effective enough. Stewart is so-so but manages to avoid the cutesy kid thing that too many fall into. Se7en writer Walker has a small role as a neighbour but really the film belongs to the crooks and Foster and they do all they can to help the material rise above itself.Overall this is an OK film but one that doesn't use its boundaries to its strength but rather they weaken the action and mean that several of the action scenes feel a little forced and unlikely. Despite this the cast help the material and the film does manage to be enjoyable even if it is nothing special and not really worth watching more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Un what? Unconvincing? Unsatisfying? Uninvolving? Unrewarding? I'm not sure what the most apt description is, but something's clearly missing.Oh, it was a decent enough thriller. I enjoyed it. Fincher knows how to pace and all that. Both villains and heroines came up with good ideas. There are at least two moments (towards the end) that would justify even a lesser film."Unfinished" is perhaps the word I'm searching for. The characters need a bit more work; the script is, after all, as heavily nuts-and-bolts as it can be about everything else, in which context the villains tend rather to look too much like cartoons, and the heroines don't seem quite real, either, a bit like spies who have assumed the identities of ordinary citizens with too little preparation. The CGI which David Fincher now seems addicted to also gives the impression that the movie isn't ready for release yet. It's as if sections from the rough computer-animated storyboard accidentally found their way into the final cut. There's a shot in which the camera glides rapidly across the kitchen, travelling forward as if on rails just a centimetre or two above the benches. Such a shot would be ALMOST impossible to commit to film, but Fincher should have tried anyway. If we'd sensed that the kitchen benches and walls and so on were REAL, rather than elements in a video game, the effect would have been thrilling; as it is, the REAL movie involving real people trapped behind three inches of real solid steel, might as well have stopped playing for a few seconds. There are far too many such shots. Fincher takes his virtual camera into keyholes and through the floor and shows us what his CGI artists think a wave of clear flammable gas might have as it enters the air not because he should, but because he can. In fact, he shouldn't.The epilogue doesn't seem right to me, either. We see mother and daughter going though the real estate section of a newspaper, looking for a new flat. Too obvious. And anyway: they'd just been fighting, not primarily to save their lives, but to defend their territory. A better epilogue would have seen them decisively making a home in the building they'd successfully held in the face of invaders. I'll admit they could easily stand to rent out two of the three floors to other people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This wasn't a bad movie, but it was just like every other thriller movie you've ever seen. Without Forest Whitaker and Jodie Foster this movie could be a 'USA' Original Movie.The opening sequence was good. The camera moves through the house walls and through tiny appliance handles to show action from one side of the house to another. It was an obvious digital trick, but slick none the less. Nothing else is really worth commenting about. The movie is so predictable that it is quickly forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good direction + good acting + poor writing = mediocre film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had very high hopes for this movie, but in my opinion, it failed. I love David Fincher, and he does not disappoint in terms of direction. In general, it's full of great visuals. The opening sequence and a couple other scenes are an incredible testament to the realistic computer graphics available today. Color, focus, angle, and a myriad of other elements also make this film stimulating visually. All the actors do their parts justice; Jodie Foster is convincing, the daughter pulls off apathy and so forth, Whitaker comes across as a reluctant man forced by circumstance, and there's a great (albeit small) performance by Cop #1.However, good acting and good direction do not make this film. The plot moves snappily for the first half of the film, but almost every twist is predictable, and the pace begins to drag, hiccuping along into the second half. On a positive note, there is a great deal of dead-on comedy woven into the lulls; but afterwards it almost feels forced. Also, gore was added to the film for no apparent reason. To make matters worse, I was very unsatisfied by the climax and resolution. To what degree Koepp deserves the blame for these mismatched, unpleasant elements I do not know, but in my opinion he hasn't written a great script since Jurassic Park, which had all the comedy of Panic Room, but must have stolen the suspense from the second half.Overall, I'd give this movie 2 out of 5. The plot simply disappoints. Worth seeing if you're a fan of Fincher or any of the actors, but not worth buying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only time you should panic is if you are about to watch this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although "Panic Room" is probably meant to be a thriller or suspense film or something like that, I couldn't help but think it was a comedy. The zany robbers, the lonely house, and the little "girl", who really really really really looks like a boy. From this description, "Panic Room" has all the right ingredients for a "Home Alone" style laugh-fest. The little girl even looks remarkably like Macualy Culkin. However, after only a short way into the film, my hopes and dreams were shattered mercifully by the director. On viewing "Panic Room", no humorous brick-throwing-at-robbers-heads did I witness; no side-splitting falling-down-stair action; no comical electrocutions; and no grievous-bodily-harm inflicted on the devious home-invaders from the spirited young under-dog. Instead, the film subjects the viewer to one of the most painful experiences of their lifetime.The movie drags and drags, never actually achieving anything of great importance. Every supposed "twist" and "turn" can be easily predicted with the tiniest amount of foresight, and you couldn't give a crap as to whether any of the characters live or die. However, the most irritating problem with the movie is probably the ludicrous plot, which makes you scream and yell at the TV(or movie) screen at the incredibly dumb characters. It seems that when criminals invade your house and you are locked in the very room they are trying to get into, your brain only works at half-capacity. This can also be said about the people who made this film. The dim-witted characters are annoying-as-hell, but what can be expected from a movie that centers around just one room in a house. "Phone Booth" had the right idea with the "one-scene-only" style story, but "Panic Room" doesn't.After viewing it, you wish that Macualy Culkin was around, and he was setting your scalp on fire, knocking you down stairs with paint cans, or hurling bricks at your head from the top of a 3-storey building. Any or all of these would cause less pain than sitting through the krud-tastic lame-fest that is "Panic Room". In the end, why couldn't have Jodie Foster and Boy-girl just have gotten a house with a 'Panic Gun'. It would have made a lot more sense, and made the movie a lot shorter- which would have been a good thing.Damn you "Panic Room". Damn you for wasting my time; and damn you for getting me so fired up that I'm wasting my time writing this review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Damn shame if you ask me! Jodie Foster refused to be the president of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival to do this. Maybe it looked good on the page and it certainly looks good on the screen, specially the opening credits but there is very little else to recommend. David Fincher does some dizzying things with the camera but the script by the very rich David Koepp is just plain amateurish. I was so frustrated by the waste of everything here. The characters seem a facsimile of characters from other, better, movies without being able to nail that extra dimension that could make them, at least, watchable. The husband, the cops even the baddies are all laughable. Jodie Foster has a couple of moments and she's one of my heroes anyway but that's maybe why I felt so annoyed by this movie, so much so that I decided to vent my frustration writing this comment. If you love Jodie Foster, avoid this for her sake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Newly divorced mother Meg moves into a large house with diabetic daughter Sarah. It is a surprise to them when a gang of three burglars break in on the first evening, and no less so than to the burglars, who thought the house was empty. Fortunately the house has a panic room into which Meg and Sarah escape, and so the suspense begins to mount.This is a high concept movie - a simple set up, developed to its fullest extent. The house is the film's single location, the cast is small, and the suspense is racked up by director David Fincher far beyond what you might expect. In this, David Koepp's concept and script helps, by developing the events which can happen between these five people in believable - and increasingly tense - ways.This is a gripping and enjoyable thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Fincher misses the mark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic Room is the first time we see a genuinely intellectually bereft David Fincher, but it won't be the last, and it probably is no coincidence that it exists hot on the heels of one of Fincher's least successful films, which ironically will become one of his most popular. Sandwiched between Fight Club and Zodiac, two of Fincher's best, if not his best, it has the feel of an exhausted director and a conflicted film maker who wants (needs) to invite a larger audience. In Panic Room, Fincher is still attracted to strong themes. The house is a transitional space for Meg (Jodi Foster) and Sarah (Kristen Stewart), over large and painted as a threatening space, just as Fincher did with The Game. In The Game the family home is a threat to Nicholas because it is the scene of his fathers suicide which laid a trajectory Nicholas inevitably follows. In Panic Room, the enormous house is a threat because Meg has left the safety of her marriage and is venturing out of the family home into a house she will need to defend with her androgynous daughter Sarah. Meg is in a feminist transition, Sarah is a new generation of self sufficient female. And yet, Fincher strangely keeps the force of his directorial presence at the surface, resting only on the house as impregnated fortress and the panic room as both a source of safety and vulnerability. Panic Room is a new set of problems for Fincher, different to what had with Alien?, which was the only film that could be counted as a failure prior to Panic Room being made - at least the only one Fincher really considered a failure. It could be that Fight Club just took too much out of him, because we don't see the surfacing here of a need for commercial appeal, but rather a failed attempt in the stylistic approach that leaves the film soulless.Panic Room comes out in 2002, right at the start of a new century and it becomes one of several films at the time to use video surveillance as a vehicle for a citizens big brother style of visual oppression over each other. The cameras are static, while Fincher's camera is the only entity that can move through the house with giant sweeping motions that imply an all-seeing eye. The fixed video surveillance is always seen through the presence of the character watching, and it immediately provokes reaction. It is only when Meg destroys the cameras that she is able to defeat the intruders, and provoke the comment "Why didn't we think of that". Yet none of this scope is portrayed with the substance that, for example, the Ikea catalog house is portrayed in Fight Club. Fincher is able to give the aesthetic sense of all of us living in an Ikea catalog in Fight Club, cross referencing the square cleanliness of the apartment and the office against the ruinous warmth of Tyler Durdens mansion. While Panic Room stands on its high themes, Fincher never properly establishes a connection between the human creatures who are both trapped and liberated by their video equipment. Meg is distrustful of the equipment immediately, from her claustrophobia (which bizarrely disappears) through to her struggling to program the electronics of the panic room, and subsequently not hooking up the phone line. We never get a sense of an immersion, a connection with the equipment, therefore we never get a sense of it betraying her, as we do with the Ikea houses. Fincher overlaps her "scared housewife" persona with an ineptitude that, although overcome toward the end in triumph, still keeps her at a distance from what could have been the most powerful theme of the film, if Fincher hadn't shied away from it. Think of Sex Lies and Videotape (made thirteen years earlier) and the way Soderbergh was able to establish a connection between the anxiety surrounding human interaction and the relief of distance created through the surveillance properties of video. Fincher is never able to convince us of a two-edged sword connection between the advantages Meg clearly has because she can see her intruders, and the problems this causes for her.This is especially highlighted in the first time Meg sees the panic room, and makes a reference to Edgar Allen Poe. This has some significance when later we realize the burglars want to infiltrate the house in order to get to the panic room which sits like a proclamation of what is to come, think of The Raven, but loses power when compared with The Tell Tale Heart, which is obviously the story being referenced. The old man's "evil eye" is the video surveillance, and the young man's murder represented in the relationship between Junior (Jarod Leto) and the old man who lived in the house previously (who built the Panic Room) as well as Meg's emerging feminist. Unlike the Tell Tale Heart, money is the motive, but the image of the vulture like all-seeing eye, coupled with Fincher's brilliant feel for paranoia, becomes a great idea so poorly represented that the garishness of the conspiracy thriller takes over, and flattens all plotting nuances except for the clichés we revive through the viewer. Much of this is the problem of an uncharacteristically ordinary script by David Koepp who brings poorly conceived, clichéd antagonists into the house. The value of the invaders is left to quality of performance, and Jared Leto is a horribly shrill, hysterical Junior, Dwight Yoakim is an unconvincing symbol of chaotic evil (that flails even too much for chaos) and only Forest Whitaker becomes an interesting foe, and that is mostly because he wisely downplays his heart-of-gold-victim-of- circumstance Burnham rescuing us from that hopeless cliché. Even Jodi Fosters great performance as Meg and Kristen Stewart's confidently portrayed Sarah can't save the film from its self-inflicted wounds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Increasingly Riveting But Uncomfortably Claustrophobic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher is simply one of the finest directors to ever live. He sticks to drama-thrillers but does it so well. Panic Room has a simple premise but is executed unbelievably well. It's also for the most part well acted and the last 20 minutes or so is a true cinematic thrill ride. Out of a home invasion film, Panic Room gives just about as much as you would want.All the colors throughout the house signal Fincher's style. He uses almost all grey, black, and hints of dark blue. He sets the tone in the opening credits with Howard Shore's haunting score playing, and promises quite a ride. At first, it seemed to have all the clichés from past films. She doesn't set up the phone, the child has a medical problem, she turns away just as the robber is passing her room, and also the fact that they rob the house on the first day they buy it. With that being said it gets away from clichés and brings us a nail biting invasion film. Forest Whitaker is a big reason why Panic Room will stick with me for awhile. He plays the intruder who is torn between staying for the money or leaving to ensure the family is safe. He's the best character by far and overshadowed even the great Jared Leto and Jodie Foster. Even Kristen Stewart impressed me with her acting in the supporting role as the child.I really liked the few twists and turns it took near the end. I always like a film that keeps me on the edge of my toes and makes me believe that the main characters could be in danger. If anything this film can give someone a few tips on how to handle an invasion, that is if your house is a mansion with like 5 floors and a panic room. I'm not sure why this film gets all the hate or just lack of love. Sure it's not a complicated plot and sure it doesn't have the shock value of Se7en or Fight Club, but it's still a well directed movie with some great performances. But I will say that I did not like Dwight Yoakam's performance. Partially due to them writing him as the prototypical villain.Panic Room also has a high re-watchability factor. It's not a long film and the 2 hours fly by. It's one of those movies that you don't go out of your way to see, but when it's on, you keep it on. So far, Fincher hasn't made a bad film. In fact, I think his worst movie is The Game which is still a solid film. I look forward to THIS WEEK's Gone Girl to see what else he brings to the mystery-thriller-crime-drama genres.+Fincher's style written all over it +Whitaker's performance +Intense and unique in some aspects +Re-Watchable -Cliché filled -Yoakam was a weak villain 8.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS It's a sad thing when once great director is making a movie below his reputation. It's not about the fact that it's not as good as his best movies , but that there was no need for him to make it in the first place . Such is the case of David Fincher and "Panic room".Why did he made this movie ? There wasn't anything in this story that would made "PR" a amazing movie , even if all the elements were done right. This is kinda of movie that a craftsman , not an artist should do. What is more intriguing is that the movie turned out to be bad.The main problem lies in the script . I've never been a fan of David Koepp and all you could expect from him appears here . Some cliché , some stupidity and some predictability mixed together . For example ? the three thugs . From the first time they appear you now that they are three cliché ? one innocent saint , one bad psycho and one neutral idiot . It's not strange who will kill who long before the movie will end. It's also not strange who will make a sacrifice and who will be an almost indestructible killing machine.The stupidity ? When you're robbing a house , even an empty one , you should wear a mask . Only one robber was intelligent to think about that. One thug knows everything about Jodie Foster life , yet he doesn't for how many days according to law the house should be empty. The cameras are on , yet none of the thugs didn't figure out to destroy them (as one even points out later in the movie). A bottle of gas "magically" appear out of nowhere , when thugs need it . A police will "magically" appear at the end of the movie , not to mention it will be completely pointless.The predictability ? I was able guess almost all the twists here ? the body swap , the phone , the SOS . Maybe I'm reading too many criminal novels or maybe they weren't too clever from the beginning.The other problem is the surprisingly bad direction by Fincher . As usual he tries to make his film a dark one . It's his trademark and it worked really well in his other movies . Here it doesn't work . It seems like he is unnecessary trying to make a dangerous situation even more serious than it should be. Like this isn't a game of cat and mouse between our heroes and the thugs , but some sort a battle for souls. The movie also completely lacks hurt and tension. It left me cold. Not to mention that Fincher annoyingly plays with camera in MTV style ? camera looks through key hole , camera flies through walls and so on. Seriously, Fincher aren't you too old for this cheap stuff ? On the other hands the movie is very often unintentionally funny and that obviously wasn't the point . The exploding gas is like a stuff from the 80's comedy . Truth to be told the whole relations between the trio of thugs is hard to take seriously . They acting like children and one could wonder if it wouldn't be a better idea to make a comedy out of this story.Good things ? Decent acting from all actors and a bits of really good black humor in the dialogues. Some ideas aren't that far-fetched . I doesn't change the fact that it's better to watch "Wait until dark" once more instead of this crap. I give it 4/10.</fullReview>

David Fincher put some excellent camera-work into the film that is truly mesmerizing. His shot selections were perfect and precise, which makes the movie much more watchable.

		<fullReview>David Fincher is one of my favorite directors, apart from Alien 3 all of his films I've seen hold real high quality. It took several year after it was released until I finally saw Panic Room. I tried to see it with an opened mind since I knew the reviews had been mixed. Mostly I found it an entertaining movie. It has its flaws and its not up to the standard of Fincher's Se7en or Fight club. The script is the big flaw, the story is pretty thin and simple. It just starts and you don't really get much of an background, I guess it not really necessary but even later the story is weak in giving any explanation to some of the events. A couple of thinks I feel doesn't make complete sense, maybe some plot holes but it doesn't bother me. However the script also lack in the description of the characters but the film is saved in that department thanks to the always great Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker, its also fun to see the young Kristen Stewart who is also really good. The bad guys feel weak, not frightening. Forest Whitaker manages to give his character a bit of substance but the others are just blank. However the film still succeeds in delivering an positive experience thank to other aspects. Fincher is great at creating suspense and that is what lifts this. The dark tone works really well and certain parts takes one to the edge of the seat. The action is well considered to not take away the suspense, and also very nice-looking, unrealistic at one time but not a problem. I get the feeling that it was intentionally that not much focus was put one the plot. One gets a bit of B-movie vibe and thats not bad its nice sometimes to see a thriller that doesn't mess with your head other than with tension keep you somewhat on the edge. Style over substance. Eventough this doesn't play in the same league as some of the other films by David Fincher, Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker I don't feel disappointed. Its a simple, thrilling entertainment nothing more and nothing less. Actually I can think that it's very good what the crew has succeeded in making of the, not bad but simple material. It is a good entertaining watch, the mixed and some quite negative reviews that I've read get me the feeling that the film has been judged by high expectations and not from what it turned out to be. I figure thats often the case that one views it from what it could or maybe should have been. I myself is also often guilty of being affected of such anticipations. But I liked Panic Room, my grade ends up at 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But unfortunately it continues in a bad performance throughout the movie. Jodie Foster doesn't exactly do her best performance, and the same goes with Withtaker. Although these two people were the movie's good parts. The rest is just a confusing mess with a bunch of plot-holes. The entire script is just an annoying piece of fail which unfortunately keep the viewer looking for holes. So I will, as most people already have done, make a list of things I found strange with this movie.1,Why doesn't the burglars use the microphone close to the bed? 2,Wouldn't it be more appropriate with a common surveillance system like all other houses, instead of a locked room without any food? 3, Why doesn't the movie handle daughter's diabetic problem? It just appears out of nowhere 4,How did her husband get in? Why didn't they at least lock the front door? 5, Why does Withtaker let go of the money when it is safely inside his collar? He could try to stash them or at least keep them. 6, How could the burglar that got hit with the sledgehammer survive? How could he walk after falling down 4 meters? How could he after this have the powers to assault a woman when his hand is completely destroyed? 7, What is the purpose of stealing the money? Who has stashed it? Why is it there? 8, Why does Jodie walk right past her husband when she sees him lying "dead" on the bed? 9, Why does the criminals accept that Jodie destroys the camera system? She could potentially bring the police. 10, Why doesn't the daughter stab the two men with the syringe earlier? 11, Why is Jodie's face so weird in the end just before they cut to black? What does she see? It just stops so sudden.You could probably fill in with more stuff. I just did this to ease my heart a bit, and somehow prove my point.Bottom line: This movie has some good parts. I really liked the opening credits, the magnificent camera work and the CGI. But this movie doesn't get onto you. It doesn't play on your emotional strings. Predictable plot, blatant characters and a bunch of plot-holes makes it hard for this film to really suck you in and make you participate in the action. I give this movie a 5 out of a 10, because it's still a entertaining flick, at least it gives you one or two laughs ;).Gustaf</fullReview>

Think about the camera work when it zooms through the kitchen, seemingly suspended. I agree that Finch is woefully underrated as a director.While the premise looms as somewhat predictable, what happens throughout the course of the story is anything but predictable-plot twists and turns abound.This movie is another gem in Jodie Foster's crown!</fullReview>

Watching the baddies wind up Inside the Safe room w/ Foster on the Outside in the last third of the movie wasn't Quite what I expected, esp. w/ her daughter locked in-but there ya be. It's Hollywood.I didn't really buy into some of the plot-twists, the phones not working, Forest saving the day at the end, Yoakum becoming 'Jaws' from the Bond flicks after a he gets hammered and falls 2 flights over a stair well, etc. C'mon that was really believable unless it was a Michael Bay movie, and this clearly was Not.Foster and Whitaker are fine. It's a decently paced suspenseful flick until you get into the last third, then-well you saw my points. It's cliché time.Good time passer, nothing more. Foster as always is good.**1/2 outta ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jodie Foster registers well as a middle aged New Yorker looking for a new house with her teenage daughter (K Stewart) in the city. During their first night in they're spacious new Brownstone home three burglars break-in resulting in a game of "Cat and Mouse".This movie had high expectations and it didn't fail to deliver. With its suspenseful scenes and great visuals this movie is one of my favorites. The opening scene has shown the capability of computer graphics/generation today. The location was chosen very wisely as it brought twists into the script.Although Jodie Foster was very convincing (as usual) it didn't make up for the long and tedious second half of the film. Most of the twists were very predictable and didn't deliver the suspense.On another note Kristen Stewart proved herself in her first big role. She plays the diabetic daughter of Jodie Foster. Kristen and Jodie worked extremely well together, resulting in two very well played characters. On the same note Jared Leto brought a very much-needed comical element to his character (Junior).Even though this movie had its major flaws it still delivered a decent script and great cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "Panic Room" is about a recently-divorced mother, Megan Altman, and her daughter who decide to move into an expensive home in a upscale big-city district. The home is striking in its three enormous floors, elevator, and a high-tech security system. The film gets its name from a room that was installed by the home's previous owner - the panic room. It is a safe room in the house, complete with its own air source, staple goods, video monitors, etc.Unbeknownst to its new owners, the house has a large sum of money hidden in it. A bunch of crooks, aware of this, break in late one evening. What ensues is a fight for survival for Megan and her daughter. The panic room becomes the apex of this struggle.Jodie Foster gives us yet another excellent performance as Megan Altman. And the director, David Fincher, displays some great creativity in the introductory credits. The names are shown in a 3D-block format that make them appear as signs within a city. He also does a good job in showing the passage of shots through parts of the house, such as the walls, ventilation system, etc. I was very impressed.Where "Panic Room" teetered a bit (*SPOILERS BELOW) was in things like the almost-too-ironic nature of Megan's daughter happening to be diabetic. The served well in the film's plot, but I felt it was far-fetched. Also, there is NO WAY Megan could have ignited that gas stream and not been burned to a crisp! That was definitely a stretch, although I confess to liking the suspense of seeing what would happen. Raoul's ability to hike up a flight of steps after being hit with a sledgehammer and knocked off a balcony, was...well, draw your own conclusions. All I know is that it is VERY unlikely he could get back up and then almost take out the entire family, especially with a crushed hand. One last point also bothers me. Forest Whitaker's character, Burnham, just doesn't feel credible enough. I understand his sympathy for the family due to his love for his own, but his actions flip-flop. First he is gassing them and next he is helping the little girl. I had trouble believing he would really return to stop Raoul."Panic Room" does a good job at delivering suspense and does so with some unique and quality shots. The cast, including Jared Leto's character and his idiocy, put forth a stupendous effort. The story is just shaky in a few places (why didn't Junior just wait until the family was gone to rob the place?). 6/10 P.S.: I guess the director didn't learn from "Die Hard"'s plot hole. Bearer bonds have traceable serial numbers on them. While it is unlikely the old man would have confessed the bonds' existence only to Junior, it is even more unlikely he (or anyone else) would be able to cash them without jumping some serious hoops.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room is basically a collection of small plot twists and plot devices that occasionally gets you on the edge of your seat, but never forms a cohesive whole. Sure, there's a plot, and it more or less makes sense, but it does not have a very enjoyable flow. Even the most mindless movie has a progression, and Panic Room's progression is unengaging, despite some nice individual scenes and cool tricks. Panic Room isn't even mindless, so it has no excuse. The ending is also very weak.There are even a few scenes that are downright boring. I don't mean slow parts, those are fine and help provide contrast with the thrilling parts, I mean uninteresting parts. Having those is bad. Having Forest Whitaker seems to be good, though. His part has some weaknesses, but he plays it very well.If you're a thriller fan and you've watched the best ones, and you need something new, Panic Room is OK, but otherwise, skip it in favor of something better.</fullReview>

I thought it was a good idea and it does keep you on the edge of your seat, one of those films you kinda shout at the tele. Forrest Whittaker was good as well as a sort of 'technician' robber.And the ending was a bit of a classic as well, confirming your faith in humanity in an otherwise very dangerous situation.A good 7/10 film, i recommend you watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fincher certainly makes my film experience more stimulating. I think part of it is because, like Kubrick, he has become so selective of his work that he won't do mainstream. That makes no difference to me, I'll back on whatever visions he comes up with next.Spoiler minefield ahead...The home-invasion genre has gone through hoops in the last half-century. From 'Living Dead' to 'Straw Dogs' to 'Home Alone' (just to name a few) we've gotten so many different perspectives on the subject. Since all "plot" ideas have been used, Fincher must innovate in some technical or artistic manner.And innovate he does! Whereas Peckinpah was stuck positioning the characters in relation to one another by editing around the house, Fincher goes the next step. So we get a camera not constricted by walls. Despite having a less-polished look to it, I admire CGI in instances like this where the idea exceeds simple amazement like, say, a thousand battle droids.My bigger problem is the so-called battle between "style" and "substance". Often the argument is used to belittle a film like this: "it has loads of style but no substance to back it up." I believe that there is no real criterion for "substance". Is it story? character development? "Feel good" moments? All that is subjective.Since we have a criteria for style, and boy does Fincher invest in it, it's easier to judge something like 'Panic Room' on that level. I'm convinced now that style_is_substance. Kubrick helped push the notion, just look what he did. This is, in part, why the documentary-style is dying.All in all, a great recovery from 'Fight Club'. This is far more interesting than 'Unbreakable'--which was Shyamalan's equivalent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>VERY MINOR SPOILERS AHEADWhen i first went to see Panic Room, i had no idea what it was about. I went with no expectations and no idea's in my head. I thought the movie was really good. It was a well made movie with good acting and good direction. The script was original and it made for excellent entertainment. The movie is about a divorced woman in her 30's called Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) moving into their new house in New York. On the first night in their new home, three men break into the house in order to retrieve a hidden cache of cash. Mother and daughter hide in a secret room called the "Panic Room" which has been built for such emergencies. They are safe for the moment as no one can get into the room...but the men need to get in there. Because what they're looking for is hidden inside that room. I would recommend this movie as it is well made and provides good entertainment. Which is what movie's are supposed to do in the first place.8/10</fullReview>

The men werent looking to hurt them, they just wanted in the Panic Room, where the bonds were, accumilating $22 million. It goes back and forth on the criminals trying to get in, and the mother and daughter trying to keep them out.

		<shortDescription>The desperate hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) recently divorced her husband (Patrick Bauchau) because he had a relationship with another woman (Nicole Kidman, but you won't see her on screen). With her daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart), she finds a new home in a wealthy neighborhood of New York City. The apartment has a panic room, i. e. an armored shelter where people can hide and survive for a long time, in case the mansion being besieged by strangers. As Meg and Sarah spend their first night in the apartment, three men step inside the apartment looking for a missing fortune. Burnham (Forest Whitaker), the most human of the three, spent his life building panic rooms and knows all their secrets; he's only there to get the money. Junior is a spontaneous crazy and stupid young kid, and the masked and enigmatic Raoul is the head of all this and the most cruel of the criminals. When Meg and Sarah realize that strangers are in the house, they take refuge in the panic room. And this is exactly where the three guys want to have a look. They start playing a cat and mouse game.The panic room is probably the most classic David Fincher movie so far. This movie bears some similarity with William Wyler's `The desperate hours' (1955). In this respect, Jodie Foster has the exact same line as Fredric March in that movie: `Get out of my house' (except that, following the advice of her daughter, she adds:'Get the f*** out of my house!', obviously times have changed, we are some fifty years later). And I must say that Panic room holds pretty well the comparison with Wyler's movie. Much of the interest that we get is in what will be the new ideas developed by the criminals to get into the room and the creative reaction of Meg and Sarah to counter their efforts. It also strongly lies in the characters. The determination of Meg to protect her daughter and her house is equal to the determination of the three criminals to get into the room. It gives a suspenseful thriller till the last sequence. You can be a cool director making great shots, and there are a few interesting ones in this movie. But you are nothing without a good script. This movie is here to prove it again. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to imagine how they can make a movie in a "Panic Room"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That was the thought running through my head, that how could they possibly make a movie based on one room, only David Fincher probably could've made this work. This is a brilliantly made movie, I've never met anyone so far who hates this movie, there's absolutely nothing that you could criticise about this movie. I wonder if panic rooms actually exist or is it just for the movie?. The cast was great, all the 3 bad guys had great characteristics, first of Forest Whitaker as Burnham is troublesome yet a soft hearted criminal, then we have Jared Leto as Junior who adds good humor to each scene he's in &amp; last of all we have Dwight Yoakam as Raoul who seems to be a very dangerous and psychotic man. Jodie Foster &amp; her daughter Kristen Stewart acted really great from start to finish. This is actually a movie that you can watch with the whole family. An excellent thriller, a movie very similar to this is " PHONE BOOTH ", it has the same sorta atmosphere. So to end my summary I give this movie a 9.5 / 10. Highly enjoyable thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good thriller from Fincher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher sure has made some excellent work in the past. Fight Club, The Game and Se7en are all thrillers, and they're all outstanding. This is another thriller, and though it's not as good as the three before-mentioned movies, it's still pretty good. Fincher once again proves that he is one of the best directors of his generation. The acting is quite good, and especially Jodie Foster gives an excellent performance. Fosters daughter in the movie, Jared Leto and Forest Whitaker also gives good performances, although there's nothing special about them. The script is original, but just isn't deep enough for Fincher. This stops this movie from becoming something extra-ordinary, and I think that with a better script, this movie could have been something that could reach up to Finchers former work. But it still is a pretty good thriller, extremely suspenseful and scary.7.2/10 - the movie's only problem is the script, which should've been deeper and more special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am slowly becoming a David Fincher fan. The best thing about this film is landing Jodie Foster in the starring role. She's one of those actresses that just carries a role with charisma and believabilty. First off,this film is pure unadulterated entertainment.Sure, there are times when you shout at the screen for the characters to not do certain risky things,but that was the rush for me. The set up being of Foster and her daughter trapped in a self contained "smart room" trying to out wit three burglers who need something in that room is the perfect ingredient to move the audience. I remember when I saw the poster for this film. I hadn't even seen any commercials of it so the film was interesting to me. My wife and I were on vacation and we both thought it might be good. So,on it's opening night..in Jackson,Tennessee..we go and watch it. I was very pleased and found the film to be a surprising pleasure. The year this came out had several films I found delight in(Resident Evil,Blade 2,Legally Blonde),but this was the ultimate experience. I thought it was one of the best films of that year. It was a roller coaster ride and I didn't want it to end. *****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As always i have to admit David Fincher is quite a genius in building up suspense and making you live with the movie, he has done it with 4 movies now, we all know which, the thing about Fincher is that he keeps you guessing till the very end everytime, that includes this movie.The movie is about a divorced Mother who moves into a big house with her daughter, the house has a panic room (duh) and at the very first night burglers come to collect a hidden treasure hidden in the house, expecting nobody to be there they just walk directly in, the mother and her kid hides in the panic room, and of course they both suffer from each their weakness with closed in rooms.The movie is very moving and thrilling, Fincher is a master at building up the thrilling moments and the suspense that keeps a movie alive, this was shown first in Se7en, and since that he haven't made a bad movie. This one is good too incase someone misunderstood.One of the things i really like about Fincher is his originality and his creativity, and his untradiontal methods, for example in this movie we got a very different camera work from what has been seen before, which is nice at some points, it doesn't forefill it's purpose at all times, but it's a good idea with a "free" camera and it does work quite well most of the time. Furthermore Fincher always gives an ending that doesn't fit into the regular Hollywood formular, nice to have a director with guts to not always end a movie with the obvious happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While films concentrated in one scenery and a few roles can really deliver, this one has plenty of apparent drawbacks, all of which an actor of Jodie Foster's caliber should be experienced enough to avoid. Panic Room doesn't build up any tension whatsoever, it's just a lining up of obligatory scenes that crossed the writer's mind. Cliches and unplausibility reign throughout its duration. The roles are non-demanding, hence any actor could do (let alone this cast). I can give a credit for some really nice camerawork, but fragmentary visual redemption is perhaps the only aspect worth mentioning in this movie.</fullReview>

Also what others reviewers already noted, this movie suffers from a very cripple scenario and ditto plot, which holds you back from getting involved to the events in the movie.On the upside this movie has some good acting and inventive camera work, so I voted 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*May contain spoilers*The Panic Room is an excellent movie, with wonderful actors. Though I definitely cannot compare it to movies such as Lord of the Rings (completely different categories), it ranks up high on my list.The plot is like this: Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart), decide to move to a new house. The first thing they notice, which was not in their other homes, is something called a "Panic Room" (hence the name of the film). A Panic Room is designed for a person to hide in there if someone were to break into their house. Surprise, surprise; they get some use out of it.The first night in their new home, someone breaks in. Three men, Burnham (Forest Whitaker), Raoul (Dwight Yoakam), and Junior (Jared Leto), have come to steal some money (approximately three million dollars). The problem is, it's in the Panic Room.Meg and Sarah have locked themselves in there; unfortunately, Sarah is a diabetic, and her medicine is still outside of the Panic Room. To add on to things, Meg is a bit claustrophobic (afraid of small places). They can't call 9-1-1 (the phone in there isn't connected). One thing leads to another.I leave the rest for you to find out.Overall, I give it four out of five stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's what I like about Panic Room right there - it stands alongside 'Aliens' in this very rare (I'd say sadly underused) category. And since the first time I actually saw it was with my mother, and we spent a lot of the time yelping and grabbing each other's arms and blinking like crazy in sympathy, I'd call it very effective.Things I love about this film:- The astonishing camera work, flying into keyholes, through the handle of a kettle, cross-sectioning walls, etc. I like to think of this as the ghost of the house - probably Mr Pearlstein looking on in bemused disgust.- The excellent, subtle performance of the girl playing Sarah, and the immediately believable relationship between her and Meg. They don't just look related, they echo one another's verbal and facial mannerisms.- The delineation of the three intruders and their differing motives - Burnham with the 'custody lawyers up his ass,' Junior out for what he can get (and do his siblings and cousins out of), Raoul because... I think Raoul was just really hoping he'd get to kill someone. I have never seen anyone deserve to get his fingers slammed in a heavy door *more*.To viewers outside America, the whole concept of a panic room is pretty alien and more than a little disturbing, so I cannot say I ever watched the movie with a feeling of 'it could happen to me,' yet I was emotionally *with* Meg and Sarah - and sometimes, despite myself, the intruders - all the way, particularly in the utterly dismaying moment when, after Meg's brave dash, the cellphone proves unusable. I'd give the film four stars out of five - it isn't one of my adored favourites, but it is a very good, solid watch that I also enjoyed on a repeat viewing. I get a little fed up with people commenting on this movie and pointing out the 'mistakes' Meg makes, like not giving the suggested signal to the police. I thought she managed extraordinarily well, and would not be half as interested in seeing a movie in which the heroine *never* made any important mistakes. It makes her a more realistic and human character, and fits in with the stubbornness, occasionally making her one-eyed, that is one of her key traits. As for people who consider it implausible that Officer Keeney should be so persistent in trying to find out if something was wrong, a) it's training, and b) when Meg brushed her hair away from her face, the fresh red burn on her hand from the propane scene was clearly visible. Now, he can't know how she got burned, but it is sufficiently at odds with her claim to be fine to make him wonder. Don't you think?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who would have thought that home security would make such a great foundation for a movie thriller? But not only do we see an excellent plot, but we also see some fine performances in an imaginative film experience. Special effects pervade this movie for scene changes and place setting. I hope to see more things like this in other movies.The plot surrounds the circumstances of a new divorcee who has just spent a chunk of a settlement to purchase a huge old house with a "panic room", a place where the residents can flee when confronted with criminal threats. Her first night finds her with burglars breaking in looking for something that the previous owner left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High tension, soft story (*spoilers*)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*spoilers!!!*To my opinion, Panic Room was made with a great fealing for building up the tension and keeping it that way. I got incredibly nervous when Jodie Foster ran out into her bedroom to get her cell phone while the burglars were comming back up.However, there were few strange parts in the story which altered my overall rating on this film.1. If the panic room is so designed that it would imposible to get in, why is it possible that intruders can easily access the phone lines and the ventilation shafts? I mean, that clearly showed that this panic room was not as safely as it should have been. The drain tunnel wich Jodie Foster and her daughter used to send light signals through it could also have been used by the burglars to blow in gas or something.2. Why wouldn't there be any other means of communication in the panic room? Now the victims had only 1 phone that they could use, so that if the phone would not work (which was the case), they would be stuck there forever! There should have been something like a cell phone with a large antenna or a 27MC radio.3. Why was it impossible to talk to the police? The burglars could not hear Jodie Foster talking, so if she just said like "my daughter is held hostage and if you show up she will be shot", than the police would at least try to find a solution. If the squadteam showed up just 10 minutes earlier, then maybe the daughter would have been shot because the burglars would think that Jodie Foster alarmed the police!!Without these flaws I would give the movie an 8, but now only a small 6. If you shoot a movie at such a small spot with a small number of actors, than you should invest the energy and time you gained by that into a foolproof script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMPORTANT: THIS IS A SPOILER (SO IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, DON'T READ ON)Ok, this movie was filled with great suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat everytime the Panic Room door was opened... but Mr. Director, please tell me why do you not have Jodie Foster or the daughter help Forest Whitaker in some way for not only saving the girl's life, but for coming back and saving the day again when he could have gotten off easy with a cool $22 million?!?! Instead you have no idea what happened to him, by only showing him surrounded by the cops and throwing the $$ away. All he was trying to do was pay for a custody battle or something, right? And he never had any intention of hurting anyone (he thought the house was empty). I think the least the girls could have done is not press charges and possibly explain how he was just a concerned father with no other way to pay to fight for his kids (if this was not his intention, then maybe just say that he saved their lives twice and is not like the other 2 robbers). But maybe they helped him out in a deleted scene on the DVD???I really liked the rest of the movie, but its hard to recommend a movie to someone if you know that they are going to give the ending two thumbs down.</fullReview>

The performances by Foster and the girl were excellent, and the intruders did exactly what was required of them. The cinematography was also impressive (similar to fight club) and unusual for a movie like this, with very dark and steady scenes, and a very ingenious fluid movement around the house (although I think the 'camera goes inside a light bulb' movement was pushing it a little).The ending dragged on a little bit, but ended on a pleasing note and the opening credits were unlike anything I've seen before.***1/2 / *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Panic Room" is a strong thriller that rewrites the rules of its genre with assured audacity. Through inventive, Hitchcockian camera techniques (through the coffeepot handle, between pegs in the banister, etc.) and three-dimensional characters, director David Fincher pulls off the astonishing feat of confining us, like the characters, in a steel-walled 'panic room' reserved specifically for home invasion. Jodie Foster shines in a strong female role that's the equivalent of her work in "The Silence of the Lambs," and Fincher proves--as he did previously in "Fight Club"--that he's one of our finest up-and-coming directors.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking over Fincher's products to-date, I'd say I'm a fan. I liked Alien3 for what it was, and it was very ambitious of him at that early stage to take on such a heavy franchise, and go in somewhat a different direction.I liked Se7en. I didn't like it at first, but have grown to really appreciate it, having begun to understand a little more about the character Somerset as somewhat of a modern-day Joe Friday (I realized it was deliberate when I saw his office # is Joe Friday's badge number).I liked the Game.So, when Panic Room came out, I expected I'd like it too. Au contraire.Sorry folks, but there were far too many times my wife and I had to say out loud "that's so dumb." Granted, I don't know how sharp I'd be under such stress, but have you ever noticed how "people" in movies live as though they've never watched a movie in their lives? We all sit in a theatre and say "you know how in movies this happens? Don't do this" but people in movies seem to have never seen a movie, so they don't know NOT to do it.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD Among the many things that totally destroyed the credibility hence the tension in the film is the scene where the husband shows up. First of all, the man with the plan thinks he can just say "sorry things didn't work out fellas, I'm outta here" and literally just walk out the front door. Obviously, he doesn't understand the psychology of crime.But, as the remaining two are arguing, the husband is standing at the door...he claims his wife's call "scared the sh-- out of him" and he did call the cops...but as scared as he claims to have been, he certainly didn't do the smart thing and wait for the cops (who, for so many to show up at the end, seem to take a long time in getting there). Anyway, if he really was scared, why not show him peaking from a corner of the doorway? Naturally, he'd see all the blood right where he was standing, surely he'd be bright enough to understand that something is going down, stay in the shadows, call the cops again on his cell phone and say "hey man, lotsa blood, get here quick" but no - he's got to stand straight up in the middle of the door frame, asking nay begging for what was coming to him.Damn stupid.And, for the record, I expect that Jodie Foster is a tad petite to really haul around a sledge hammer, but if adrenaline has given her that "lift-car-off-daughter" strength, then a guy who gets hit with said sledge hammer, AND then falls headlong down a storey who has already had his hand crushed by a steel door that's 4 inches thick, just doesn't get up and physically beat up anyone. Sorry. Stupid.Can anyone tell me why Raoul was even there? And, why the gun? Whitaker's character had all the brains of the operation, and no one was supposed to even be there, so two guys could easily have walked in (as they did) and taken care of business.Back to the psychology of crime for a moment. From the first demonstration of what kind of guy Raoul was, my thought was "they oughtta shoot him, he's out of control." SPOILERS HERE - truth be told, Whitaker ultimately did have to shoot him. Crime psych says when planning an operation, you calculate the odds of certain things happening and decide before they happen what your course of action would be. This helps you by providing both a clearer rational mind not bent by the stress of being in the situation PLUS the advantage of having the opportunity to procure resources to support any possible decisions you had planned that you might have to make. You want as few variables as possible, constants are what you want to work with. Whitaker should have stuck with his first reaction to people in the place by indeed walking out.Anyway, an out-of-control teammate threatens your chances of success, so they must be removed from the situation. Bottom line, had Whitaker removed Raoul earlier, they'd probably have gotten away with it. As it stands, Whitaker was on his way to freedom and a morality attack brought him back inside, where he finally dealt with Raoul, but at what cost to him? Eliminate variables when you are in control, not when things are out of control. Unfortunately, Whitaker wasn't prepared and hadn't made a prior decision based on reason on how to handle such a variable.And as for Junior, again, crime demands commitment. There is no "walking out the front door" once it's on.I'm no crook, but I've watched a few movies and read a few newspapers in my time. Clearly, the writers of this movie wanted us to watch a story of some bumbling grown-up Home Alone goofs make enough mistakes to buttress at least the public service announcement "so remember kids, crime does not pay" when in reality, a few simple rule observances could have made them $22 million dollars richer.If there's ANY redeeming quality, it's that, as films today are becoming so perfect, so dependent upon a priori knowledge and plots so twisted that the "truth is stranger than fiction" saying is almost disproved, it's a tad refreshing that there are still idiots out there that make mistakes and aren't nine-lived cat slick art thieves and special agents who never die. (see Hackman, Lindo and DeVito in Heist for an interesting balance of both bumbling and plan execution excellence).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not up to the directors other movies, not by a mile. Its not up to other female-in-distress-in-an-urban-setting either, such as "Wait Until Dark" or "Lady in a Cage".But its all right time filler. Jodie is not her usual mannered self, for which I was deeply grateful, and the kid that plays her daughter is not overly obnoxious, but close..They are moving into what amounts to a castle, in terms of what most Manhattan apartments are. The rent has to be six figures a month; most people pay $1200 for something the size of the panic room alone.Almost immediately, they are broken into. They retreat to the 'panic room' and much to their horror, what the robbers are after happens to be in that very room. The robbers are amateurs, almost bumbling idiots who couldn't break into a little girls diary, but they seem to think they have a chance at the safe in the panic room.I didn't mind the movie except for one scene in which the cops finally show up. By now, Jodie has switched locales with the robbers and has to answer the door when they ring. She is told to get rid of them and through video cameras, the robbers can verify that she does exactly that, but since they can only see and not hear, it didn't seem logical to me that Jodie would not vocalize the situation to the police officers, given the opportunity. One of them is next to positive something is wrong and even suggests that she give a signal to indicate danger, but I guess the movie wasn't supposed to end there. Nice to see that Jared Leto's arm grew back after "Requiem for a Dream" and its always a pleasure to see Forest Whitaker, although I found his character a little too nice, given his intentions. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy Fincher movie, on par with his lesser "The Game"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of "Panic Room" interested me. I've always created situations of getting stuck in an elevator or some such, and playing out all the different scenarios in my mind (usually when I'm taking a long elevator ride). The idea of small, constricting spaces where everything can go wrong, and most often does, appeals to me for some reason. So the idea that an (almost) entire movie take place within the confines of one room, without being something like "Tape" or Kiarostami's "Ten," seemed instantly promising.And the movie fulfilled my expectations. I wasn't expecting some sort of masterpiece, or necessarily any better a movie than something Fincher's done before. As is stands, I still think "Se7en" is his best film, I was very interested in "Fight Club" for the most part, despite the obvious flaws, and enjoyed "The Game" thoroughly. This, for me, falls into "The Game" category. It's not nearly as polished as "Se7en," and not as intriguing, really, as "Fight Club." But both "Panic Room" and "The Game" work on somewhat of a gimmick level. I mean, does anyone NOT know how this movie is going to end? We want to see this movie because we want to get tense, and we do.The basic idea here is that Jodie Foster and her daughter spend an entire movie within an impenetrable panic room, a hidden room placed in a home to protect from intruders. And whaddya know, when the two girls move in, the bad guys soon follow. So that's all there is, really. The choice of actors is interesting. I've never fell under the spell Foster has cast on some, but I have nothing against her. She's suitable in this movie, but someone else -- someone more capable of showing repressed anxiety could have been better. But no complaints. The bad guys -- Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker, and a masked Dwight Yoakam -- are fun. Leto is just annoying, but that's a small complaint in the context of the movie. Whitaker is someone I adore, and here you can't help but love the wacky-eyed guy. Yoakam, whose music I love, is a hoot.Unlike "Se7en," which benefited enormously due to its distinctive look, "Panic Room," I think, is far too murky. The whole house is green! That one amazingly fluid tracking shot that glides through rails, keyholes, floors is fun to look at, but it's so much of a show-off piece that I can't believe it wasn't at least half computer-generated.Of course, there are flaws here. The bad guys describe too much of what they're going to be doing, rather than doing. Jodie Foster talks to herself too much. Not only are the girls forced into the panic room, but it turns out Foster's daughter is diabetic. When people are bashed with sledgehammers, they rise again. Explosions don't seem to hurt people indiscriminately. But none of this matters, because we all know what we're getting into when we watch this movie.And Fincher's craft gives it a little extra oomph.***1/2</fullReview>

The photogrammetry in this film is seamless and the pacing is fast and furious.

		<shortDescription>Not Fincher's best, but still impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latest movie by David Fincher is not exactly what you may call a masterpiece, but is still one of the best thrillers in a long time. First of all, because it's a Fincher. And you can see the director's cut. He used most of the same techniques that made his previous movies (Se7en, Fight Club, The Game) the best thrillers of the 90s. Then, there is the superb cinematography of Darius Khondji, who really puts his mark on the tensionate atmosphere in the picture with slow moves of the camera. Jodie Foster also gives a pretty good performance and the villains are beautifully portrayed by Forrest Withaker, Christian Bale and Dwight Yoakam. So it's a decent movie, but not revolutionary (like Se7en and Fight Club) and I think that Fincher is indeed a master of suspense. Probabily, the new Hitchcock. The only thing that disappointed me in Panic Room was the end. A bit to predictable. Otherwise, a good film that might haunt you for a while. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie can be best categorized as a highly stylized, psychological thriller. It comes to us via David Fincher, one of the most creative and visionary directors of the last quarter century. It combines aspects of his earlier works such as `The Game' and `Fight Club', to meld edge of your seat suspense with his trademark visual style.`Panic Room', illustrates the classic struggle of good versus evil. Meg Altman played by Jodie Foster, is a recently divorced woman who moves into a ritzy New York brownstone with her daughter (Kristen Stewart). On their first night in the new house they get a surprise when three men invade their home. The two women escape to the `panic room', a reinforced steel and concrete room made for just this kind of situation. They come to find out that what the men are after is in this room. Now the women must find a way to get the bad guys out of the house while being trapped in their enclosure.This movie does well to create an air of suspense throughout by using beautiful camera movement, intense lighting contrasts, and dead-on acting.One of the standout performances comes from singer turned actor Dwight Yoakam. Yoakam plays one of the intruders (Raoul), who is a true on-screen, representation of evil. From his masked face to his willingness to stop at nothing, he has a chilling effectiveness.During the course of the film there are many plot twists and turns, one of the many thumbprints of any Fincher film. Although not his best work, the wonderful performances from Foster and Yoakam, along with the overall visual presentation make this movie a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have varied opinions on Director David Fincher's thriller `The Panic Room'. Please don't panic! I will state my opinions in just one paragraph. Jodie Foster stars as an overprotective mother of an androgynous diabetic teenager. They are entrapped in a home security room nicknamed The Panic Room after burglars invade their two-story New York residence. Forrest Whittaker, Dwight Yoakam, and Jared Leto co-star as the argumentative perpetrators. `Panic Room' is intense and Fincher's direction was secured enough not to be invaded with negative reviews. However, the film's cause of alarm was in its staid screenplay. `Panic Room' is not enticing enough to break into, but there is no need to panic if you do decide to enter `The Panic Room'. *** Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room focuses on a woman and her daughter as they search for the perfect house. They end up with anything other than perfect, however, when they discover that three thugs are looking for something in the safest room in the house.This "Panic Room" is meant to keep any intruders out and keep everybody inside it safe. However, throughout the movie, the thugs are able to endanger the lives of the house owners over and over again, which seems a little unrealistic, considering it took many years to develop that room.But the good plot, characters, and camera movements are enough to outweigh any flaws that Panic Room might have. Certain events in the movie really piqued my interest, and I was excited to see what was going to happen next. What could be done to the panic room? What could the mother and daughter do to evade it?Actually, what kept me going was the question: "What can they do with this movie?" At first I was thinking not much could be done. But a strange, semi-twisted plot caught me by surprise, and I was pretty impressed.The music is composed by Howard Shore. I generally don't like him, especially with his work in The Two Towers, but in this movie his music is light and eerie. It doesn't get in the way, and it's not screechy like horror movies.The most interesting part of Panic Room is the use of the cameras. Just the way they move through floors, walls, or pan around in an eerie semicircle are extremely satisfying. They really add to the movie.All in all, I was impressed with Panic Room. It's not the best movie, and not without it's flaws, but it's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>dear GOD! Jodie foster never ceases to amaze in her films(silence of the lambs, contact and PANIC ROOM) this movie is my favorite movie of all time. David Fincher is an excellent director(seven, the game)Ths film also included a great cast...the three men who layed the robbers where very powerful in their roles. I think this movie would have still been very excellent if it were with Nicole Kidman, she is also a great actress(the othes, to die for and moulin rouge) i really enjoyed this movie...it is a brilliant game of cat and mouse....i made sure i bought it the day it came out...GO RENT IT NOW! 10\10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning...a Spoiler is here!!At the Movie Theater, I thought I was gonna watch a movie that was created by the Genius Fincher, but I was left dissatified - with these fake shocks, and ropey suspense Thiller did not match up to en noir brillance of Se7en.What happened to the Oscar Winner Jodie Foster? - whatta waste!! and this Rauol guy makes me laugh...'My name's Raaaauuuooooh' and as a robber, he wears a sock over his face.....I pictured him like an Hispanic with dark hair-but he removed the disguise and turned out to look like a professor...what!?!is this Rauol?? he reminded me of a Bernie or Something!!I like it when Leto turned Freddy Krueger on us to the side of the face, and cool Cainerolls by the way!I feel sorry for Jodie Foster's Diabetic Daughter, due to a Hyperglycemic attack-she needs a shot of insulin badly as well as shivering, being blue on the lips and Forrest Whittaker tries to soothe her says 'DO YOU NEED THE SHOT??????' God Lawd!!! of course she does...she dying!! If I was Diabetic, I do not want him to be my Doctor. The Audience were howling with laughter at that scene.There are some silly special effect like looking though the filament of the light bulb inside the flashlight?????? it is like being in High School Physics class, and via the keyhole-do we wanna know what is inside the Keyhole...come now!!It was a Disappointment, a dismal film...I thought the Matrix was bad!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room is a Modern Thriller that puts others to shame! It a starts when a newly divorced Mother and her child move into a truly individual townhouse in New York. Hidden in the master bedroom is a Panic Room for use in case of intruders entering the house. On the first night spent in the house, Meg wakes in the middle of the night to find three intruders in her home. Meg and her daughter flee into their Panic Room where they become trapped in a deadly game of Cat and Mouse. This film is exellantly shot with special effects that add to the deadly suspense. I rate this film: 9/10 :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room is a very engaging thriller which makes good use with the material it is given. Tops off to the cinematography which looms through the house going through walls and keyholes. there are excellent performances from two time Academy Award Winner Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker. There are a few unexpected surprises which occur, ensuring that you stay on the edge of your seat. There are some scenes that make you winch and it could have went on a bit longer but these are only minor flaws. Panic Room is an impeccably directed and well acted film which is well worth watching. 7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent sound track, inspiring acting and a brilliant scrip but what else can we expect when the greatest scriptwriter in Hollywood teams up with one of the most talked about directors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic room is David Finchers recent contribution to the 2002 cinema scene. Award winning director Fincher is one of the most talked about directors of the 90's He assisted on such classic films as Return of the Jedi before breaking into directing himself, first earning recognition for Alien 3. His career really took off when in 1997 he directed the dark thriller Seven earning him worldwide recognition. Other credits include Fight Club and the Game. Panic Room is the creation of David Koepp one of Hollywood's most prolific scriptwriters Koepp who has worked with some of the greatest directors names such as Spielberg and Zemekis and has written some of the biggest blockbusters of all time films such as Carlito's Way, Mission Impossible and Spiderman. From start to finish the sheer tension of the film hits you. Fincher's choice of an emotive sound track helps to build tension, perfect if you want to get close on a Saturday night. The use of camera angles keeps you worrying throughout the film but the cliché thunderstorm is a little too predictable. The setting makes up for that conveying a somewhat dark charm, rarely seen since Kubricks The Shining, which it echoes. Panic room is one of the best thrillers in years, an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish. Jodie Foster is her usual brilliant self and puts in a performance, which could rival that of Claris Starling in the chilling Silence of the Lambs. Forrest Whitaker also puts in a memorable performance as the troubled villain. Sheer Excellence but what else can be expected when on of Hollywood's greatest director teams up with the hottest Hollywood scriptwriter. The story centres on a town house in Manhattan. The house is purchased by a recently divorced mother and her and her daughter move in. Thieves break into the house believing that it's empty only to find to their horror that it's not. Realising there's invaders the divorcee and her daughter flee to the panic room, an impenetrable room designed for just such a situation. Unbeknown to her and her daughter what the thieves actually want is in the panic room with them and the intruders will do Anything or hurt anyone to get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It supposed to be the best thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of the film is quite simple, and happened only on one night. The story goes when a single mother (Jodie Foster) and her daughter (Kristen Stewart) just moved into their new apartment and they found this room called Panic Room, which supposed to be the most safety room, in case an emergency happens. Soon after, they already find out what is really utilize of the room, when on that night, three assailant (Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam) broke in to they house. When the women realized what is going on, she and her daughter rushed to the Panic Room, and organized a battle to the assailants. The result is a perfect combination of heart pounding drama and enthralling thriller. David Fincher does a good director, and he succeeds to make a brilliant film. Of course this film is not award worthy, but manage to its own dignity with became the first class thriller. Jodie Foster is good as always and so does with Kristen Stewart. She indeed here's to stay! Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam also display more than it need to make this film superb. Technically, `Panic Room' is in the good parts; good photography, good score, good audio etc. Like I said, it supposed to be the best thriller, because it perfectly combined drama and thriller became a good answer as a modern film's concept. Unfortunately, `Panic Room' is also fell on those typical Hollywood recipe for a thriller (watch it for your self to prove it!). Well, despite of that, `Panic Room' is always be one of my favorite thriller, came a long as `What Lies Beneath', `The Silence of the Lambs', `Scream' and `Psycho', and I certainly sure that you will feel the same. 8/10</fullReview>

That said, our favorite actress Jodie Foster adds an extra level to the film. This is simplistic, straight forward and extremely efficient without using cheap tricks that most thrillers do. It is also fun to see that David Fincher once again takes a stab at Jared Leto's face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, Panic Room is not a hash on Fincher's previous efforts like the incredible Fight Club or Se7en, but this is Fincher paying homage to the work of Hitchcock - it certainly borrows the formula that made Dial M For Murder and The Apartment successful. Jodie Fostor is brilliant as standard, breathing life into the cliched cardboard mother. Kristen Stewart is definitly one to watch, with a stunning performance from such an inexperienced actress. Dwight Yoakham is devilishly fiendish as Raoul (who steals the movie), Whitaker playing safe with the bankrupt father, and Jared Leto making his character even more exciting than it deserves to be. David Koepps script isn't for the kind of people who like brain food movies - ultimtaely he realises there isn't much he can do with the story, but he pumps it with amazing wit and excitement that you really don't know what to expect from one minute to the next. And, of course, David Fincher's contribution, with the stunning pan-scan that has to be seen to be believed, wonderful CGI cameras that makes the Matrix looks like yesterday's technology. His film noirish qualities bring style and glamour to an otherwise dull subject, even though Koepps screenplay does play with the audience's emotions. All in all it's well worth watching (especially for the tensest moment in the movie - BEING PLAYED IN SLOW MOTION! GENIUS!) just to see how David Fincher can go wild into mainstream once in a while, coming out on top.9/10 - its not perfect, but its a terrific night in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find few films contemptible. Most films are beneath contempt. After one hundred years of film making, it is clear that film is, as Cocteau discovered, a poor storytelling device. It is a trivial failing for most Hollywood film makers. The way good lyrics get in the way of the music, a good story or screenplay gets in the way of movie making. Films are visceral. That is why films like the Panic Room get made.Unlike George Parker of Orange County California, I don't suggest you turn off your brain and enjoy the ride. David Fincher (Fight Club) and David Koepp (Spider Man) are Hollywood successes. Jody Foster is a legend. It is mainstream Hollywood that is responsible for this film, that is disturbing and ultimately, deserving of contempt.The premise of the Panic Room, stated in the first 20 minutes, is casually racist. We are presented with a vulnerable, white, rich, Jewish, first wife menaced by a large black man in work clothes, a man in corn rows, and a third named Raoul in a ski mask bought for the occasion. Fincher uses breast display to wring every bit of frisson from the possibility that Jody Foster will be raped (it's happened before). That the three men are not intent on rape is unimportant, what is important is that we become viscerally concerned for petite Jody Foster's safety. Jody Foster not Meg Altman.Let me summarize: the hook is that sexually vulnerable, rich, white and maternal Jody Foster (again, not her character Meg Altman) is about to be raped by a large black man and two other ethnically challenged men. Believe it.Aside from the casual racism and sexism (consider the portrayal of male characters), there is a good deal of social Darwinism, but I don't have the stomach or time to discuss it. It would make me too angry to do anything else today.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, this high tech business worked much better in FIGHT CLUB.The script was sub-par. Great idea. But, lacked the punch of deep emotional exploration.I have a suspicion the main reason Jodie Foster took the role was because her character is an empowered single mother raising a child all alone. Just like our boy Al Pacino loving to play the guy who's been married 3 times and has like 17 kids.I guess in such cases, life truly does imitate art...and disfunction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not since Seven has director David Fincher made a work so thrilling that it is captivating. When a mother and her daughter move into a new house they are visited by a trio of crooks looking for a big payoff. To escape the criminals they hide in a panic room, a hidden security room that is impossible to get into. This film is so good that I can almost forgive Fincher for the dreadful Fight Club and rethink his talent as a director because he has some very interesting camera methods. Never mind the fact that the story is original or that Jodie Foster as the mother and Forest Whitaker as a criminal are so poignant that they are downright chilling, but the true winning element here is how Fincher allows everything to unfold. It isn't that we know what is going to happen that thrills us, it isn't that we don't know what will happen that thrills us, but what thrills us is that we expect that we don't know what is going to happen. The script is so well structured that we expect that something will probably happen but we can't be to sure until it actually happens. This is helped along by the fact that the film is shrouded in mystery. We get the feeling that there is something more to the mother than meets the eye, we also have three criminals breaking into a house and we don't know why, the criminals also don't know why there is someone living in the house, there is a third criminal who wasn't supposed to be in on the job who wears a black ski mask and we really don't know what is going to be in that safe. The script is very smart in that is gives us little information on our characters, leaving our minds to wander over all of the possibilities and keep you guessing right up until the very end, even then there might still be a few questions roaming in the back of your mind. The only problem with this film is that Fincher still seems content on making everyone on screen comparable to human slime. He did it in Alien 3, he did it in Seven, he did it in The Game, you better believe he did it in Fight Club and now he is doing it here to. This is not a film you are going to get some deep philosophical message from, to put it bluntly this film is pure trash, everything here in done in the name of entertainment and boy is it ever entertaining. So in the end what we have here is a thinking movie for an average crowd and it pains me to say this but I don't think anyone could have done this film justice but David Fincher, he produces the creepy atmosphere that creates tension through the whole thing, he has so hardly gory fatal head wound shots and overall he just makes everything work.</fullReview>

Maybe the script is a little bit simplistic, and the end too much as you expect it - but overall this is worth renting, and even watching in the theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher's previous films, Seven, The Game, Fight Club already had stories, good stories to lift the movie up. Panic Room is mainly about a burglary, and anyone who has no experience in film making could easily have screwed this one up. But Fincher doesn't, he does it well, sets the right atmosphere for a traditional thriller. He directs the actors well, and makes the cinematographer deliver the slick and tricky camera moves that the script called for. So what is Panic Room? It's his best film to me, maybe not the plot, or the characters, but it's where he uses his talent as a director at its best. For those who find Seven too dark and gory, or Fight Club to high-testosterone, so stick to Panic Room besides watching the Game again and again. :)</fullReview>

The supence was there and it saved the movie, and the loveable Jared Leto came as a surprising step up from "Paul" of urban legend. but it is clearly a movie souly for fans of the genre not at all an "somthing for everyone" peice so if you like Jodie Foster or if you like Supense/thrillers I recomend this movie otherwise don't bother </fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happens when one of Hollywood's most ingenious filmmakers decides to try something totally different than what they're known for? Well, sometimes, they're praised for it and sometimes they're trashed for straying too far from what they do best. In David Fincher's case, he's created some of the most mind-boggling, creative, and visually impressive movies in cinematic history. This time out (his fourth), the guy who directed Se7en, Fight Club, and The Game, trys something totally different. And it works.In Panic Room, Fincher takes a COMPLETELY stripped-down script, a confined setting, his AWESOME visuals and makes it all work. Here's a mom (newly divorced) who takes her daughter and moves into a gargantuan town-house in West Side Manhattan. Along with the house comes a Panic Room. The opening of the film gives us a brief little rundown of a panic room. It's a concrete room with it's own telephone, ventilation system, survival kit, and monitor system so that the house can be watched at all times. In short, the Panic Room has one purpose: to keep people out. One night (their first night, no less) three crooks break in. The brains behind the outfit, Junior (Jared Leto), the inside man Burnham (Forest Whitaker) and the psychopath with a gun, Raoul (noneother than Dwight Yoakam). With these three, there's no telling what's liable to happen but they all have one agenda: to get INSIDE that room, because (wouldn't ya know it?) what they're after is INSIDE that room. There's your set-up right there and it sets the stage for much cat and mouse, profanity-spewing action. Awesome camera tricks, great dialogue, and good strong performances by all, carry this one, making it one of the most entertaining movies I've seen all year. To say any more would spoil something, but I will say that David Fincher tried something new and it worked. I can't wait for his next picture.The performances here are flawless. Jodi Foster is incredible as the sharp-witted mom and her and Kristen Stewart have great chemistry as the mother and daughter in a tight situation. Jared Leto was suprisingly funny as the dread-locked Junior and Forest Whitaker shines as the only one of the three who seems to have a heart. Dwight Yoakam once again proves that he's got what it takes to be a great actor. His portrayel of Raoul was scary as hell. The guy is a walking time bomb. You have to understand that David Fincher didn't want to play with our heads on this one. His goal was to deliver a "popcorn/suspense film" and it works right on up to the last frame. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All those who think that Fincher is using old ideas from his other films have really missed the point of what Fincher is. He is an Auteur not just a director. The flowing shots and dark lighting a Finch's trademarks. If I had to give an example of a Fincher film then I'd use this film. Those that say this is a bad film and Fincher could have done better don't know that David wouldn't release a film unless he thought it was the best it could be. In short know what your writing about before you start to rubbish it. This film may not be what everyone expected but it is one of Fincher's best yet.

		<shortDescription>nothing exciting about this picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on DVD a couple of months ago and what I can say as a summary is 'There is absolutely nothing to panic about'. The story comes to a resolution even in the first half an hour. The rest of the picture consists of some slow motion tricks that the director is using for the sake of creating a suspenseful atmosphere, but unfortunately he can't manage that. Besides, there are some logic errors as well. We know that what you're talking in the panic room can't be heard by someone outside even from the monitor. Then, how come Jodie Foster can't alert the policemen at the door about the thieves? I think a successful actress like Jodie Foster deserves much better roles than this one. I don't recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good thriller. I'm sure the comedy 'Scary movie' will give you more excitement than this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HAS ITS MOMENTS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A disappointment pretty much from beginning to end, with a couple of big-bang moements thrown in for good measure. Foster is not to blame for this mishmosh, the script and the direction are. The illogic of a single mom with one kid buying such a big house in the first place throws the whole film off. The kid looks enough like Foster, right down to leaving you wondering in the beginning if this is a girl or boy. In the film, she is coming off of a (reasonably) conventional marriage where the husband has run off with a bimbo. The only decent touch: the ex-husband is about 60 years old, old-man ugly, and foreign to boot. Foster clearly married her dad in this one. For bad-film aficionados, watch for the scene where Foster lets loose with a primal scream. It's enough to make a strong man cringe. The climax turns into a FRIDAY THE 13TH rehash, almost identical to the climax of the Robert DeNiro remake of CAPE FEAR. But it's not enough to save this dumb, dumb film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fincher has never made me sit up as a director of note and this film reinforces that view.Elegance in filmmaking here is limited to some hi-tech cinematography which makes the audience feel that they fly through furniture miniaturized to the size of a fly. Much of the film was filmed in near darkness. The plot development was most unimpressive. Facts were wrong (propane being lighter than air, for one). Why does one of the hoods cover his face in the beginning? What has the broken marriage to help with the screenplay unless Fincher sees the Panic Room as a refuge to that as well. But the end of the film makes you wonder if the film had any impact on the marriage.Jodie Foster, so impressive in "Contact" seemed dumber than her daughter--who I thought was her son until halfway through the movie.I keep seeing Fincher's films to spot an iota of brilliance but I have not seen anything that makes him an above-average director by world standards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Panic Room is essentially the story of a jilted wife, newly divorced from her wealthy, philandering husband and her young daughter having to fend for themselves and fight off three intruders the night they move into their new large brownstone on the upper west side of Manhattan. The only place of refuge that they can turn to is the "panic room" - a room built for any sort of emergency to seal them off inside and keep them safe from whatever lurks beyond - an impenetrable fortress of concrete and steel. The intruders in the meantime wreak havoc on the house trying to get into that room and a tale of cat and mouse follows. Given the whole idea of a panic room and the premise of outwitting three seriously dangerous men in your home leaves open such a vast array of opportunity for twists and turns and suspense in a movie.Now, all that being said, I would like to say that I was disappointed with this film, but I can't as I found myself too lackadaisical to be able to ever get disappointed. Technically proficient this movie certainly was, but I pin this waste of time on the writer, David Koepp and whoever the hell the producers were on this film. Jodie Foster as Meg Altman turns in a wonderful performance, when does she ever seem to fall short as an actress? Her daughter, played by Kristen Stewart was also quite good and David Fincher as a director, well, he's just magic. You give that man a camera and he settles for nothing less than perfection. However I have a suggestion for the studios regarding Mr. Fincher - why don't you try giving him a top A list script. Hell, I don't know, maybe have William Goldman stir one up for him, but for God's sake, do something because to see such a stellar actress and such a phenomenal director deliver all the way round and still have the story be so-so - well, the blames on the executives and the people who were supposed to be producing this thing. I looked up the budget on Imdb as soon as I finished viewing it, and to find out it cost 48 million nearly made me choke. Yeah, movie budgets are soaring through the roof nowadays, but please, for close to 50 mil, I want suspense, and I want plot twists that I don't expect and there wasn't much here that I wasn't already anticipating way ahead of time. I voted a 7 and I really think that's too high but I did so only because of Foster and Fincher - afterall, why should they suffer for something that wasn't their fault.Oh, and by the way, Jared Leto is soooooo two dimensional in this film - what was he thinking? And actually, what was Fincher thinking putting him in the role? Villains can be very complex and they can be three dimensional, hell - real life ones are. Leto, on the other hand, spends half his time whining and the other half screaming and never does it come across as anything deeper going on in him. Dwight Yoakim is slightly up the food chain from Leto, but on an acting level he's still superficial. The only one that holds up is Burnham, played by Forest Whitaker. He shows that it's possible to take a part of a burglar and have conflicts and criminality at the same time as having humanity. Perhaps if the other villains had been as good as him it may have helped the story not seem so robotic in it's style.All in all, I would say it's not a bad movie, but if you're looking for a good thriller, I would not recommend this film. The only recommend I would give for this film is if you're killing time watching cable. Above and beyond that, it just doesn't do enough to warrant much more. And not to nag, but will somebody please give David Fincher a great script, finally???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing "panic" attack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the box office disappointment of "Fight Club", it seems as if director David Fincher felt the need to pursue less controversial, more rudimentary ground for his next film. Probably the same could be said for Jodie Foster, who after the failure of "Anna and the King", apparently wanted to play it safe and reaffirm herself as a successful female Hollywood star. And so they both settled for "Panic Room". I say settled because perhaps this latest feature is a letdown for fans of both stars, and in hindsight, is probably also for both of those two individuals. After a "so that's what all the fuss was about?" title sequence, the story begins as single mother Meg Altman (Foster) and her daughter Sarah move in to their new home in bustling New York City. A guide shows them around the house, detailing the house's features, including its panic room. Essentially this first act exists so that we the viewers become acclimated to the geography of house, and Fincher does a good job at this. But already Meg Altman is established as a pent-up nervous reck - unlike everyone else, she would rather not have that panic room in her house. Geez, Meg just moved into a new home and already she looks like she could have a heart attack at any minute. Not too much later the three villains of the picture show up, intent on getting a certain amount of money in bonds contained within the panic room, and mistakingly think that they are alone in the house to do so. Thus begins the film's string of unlikely coincidences, and annoying character and story contrivances. Not only is Jared Leto's character frequently misinformed, but he doesn't shut up, and of course he only cares for himself when it comes to the bottom line, partners be damned. Plus it never fails that this type of character will prove himself to be an utter moron when it comes to strategy. For when it comes to logic and fore-thought, that is completely Burnham's (Forest Whitaker) speciality. But he's not just a devious antagonist, he's one with a heart. One who deep down inside cares for others, especially when they are about to go into a coma or when they are being tortured by someone else. Uh-huh. Nevertheless, once both of the Altmans are trapped within their own confines, the story covers their numerous attempts to get out of the room while defeating the three burglars in the process. In one sequence, the three bad-guys try to coerce Meg and Sarah to come out of the panic room by spewing noxious gas into the room via a hose. While this was a slightly inventive sequence, I thought a more foolproof method to do this if I were the one of the burglars would be to instead pump water into the room via the hose. I don't know how the screenwriters would have written their way out of that one, but perhaps that kind of suspense sequence has been done in too many movies already? Overall, most of these suspense sequences are in that kind of mold, but they make-up a major part of the movie and are only semi-gratifying. They are slightly suspenseful, but after Meg and Sarah find their way out of one, it's onto the next one; and none of them particularly advance the story in anyway. They just add to the film's running time and are strictly for entertainment purposes. They're cotton-candy suspense sequences. In fact, the only sequence that is vibrant throughout the entire movie occurs a little past midway through, when a pair of suspicious policemen show up to check out what's going on inside the house. It's only in this moment that Foster lets down her steely intense guard and enjoys having a role in this joyless feature. The dialogue between Meg and the two policemen is comic and subtle and tense, all tightly wrapped together. And it is only then that Fincher discards his heavy, brooding tone that he is known for. A paired down suspense film like this needs some air to breathe, and amid all the over-the-top, unnecessarily explicit violence, it is hard to find. More than any other Fincher film, this is "just" a movie, in structure and in content. So why is the film as unpleasant and unsatisfyingly taught as it is? Expect both Fincher and Foster to go back to more substantial material in the future. Final Grade: B-</fullReview>

From the very beginning it doesn't seem to make much sense, because you wonder why this woman would choose to buy this monstrosity of a house. It is NOT a fit. I think that the director and writer should have taken the claustrophobia of being in a small closed-in space and run with that more....hello, the name of the movie IS "PANIC Room". You see, there didn't need to be all the bloody violence. Terror in the captives' minds would have been scarier i.e. real panic and not so much fighting back from little Sir Jody. I did like the acting, especially Jared Leto, and, I do agree, the daughter was kind of a freak. All in all, a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Others will describe the details of the movie but I must tell you one scene which is somewhat unrealistic. A close relative is Type-1 diabetic. I have seen the situation with the low-blood-sugar daughter many times. While closer than many Hollywood attempts, here's my experience with someone whose blood glucose has dipped below 40. They get very combative, not compliant. Once the blood sugar drops to the point of being in convulsions, the person doesn't "come back". The spell doesn't pass. The blood sugar keeps getting lower and lower until coma. The shot Forrest W. administers was mostly right, except for a few small details. At the blood sugar she was at, the daughter likely would not have been able to help him at all. Didn't you find it odd the prior owners would build this room and not put any food in it? Especially candy or other carbohydrates? There's plenty of Type-1 diabetics around to help Hollywood get it right. Most productions I've seen always get it wrong.</fullReview>

There is no possible way to get in, but unfortunetley what the three robbers want is in that room and they aren't leaving until they get it. Panic Room is a great movie, which is superbly shot, with great acting by Foster, Stewart, Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam.</fullReview>

My roommate and I spent the first half of the movie trying to figure out if Jodie Foster's androgynous child was a boy or a girl. As always Jared Leto plays the part of the bumbling idiot with remarkable accuracy and I was happy as a fat kid in a kiddy pool of fudge when he was shot in the face. Dwight Yokum played himself well. The movie was like diving into a swimming pool full of razorblades and the ending was like cleaning the wounds with lemon juice.

It starts on a New York pavement, after seeing Hollywood like billboards dressing the skyline. It immediately gives you a cinematographic mood.After this sequence you know you'll be entertained for the next 2 hours. like Se7en and Fight club, David Fincher knows how to pin your eyes on the silver screen. The image moves through walls and floors, giving an idea of what the house looks like. Every movie he makes is a mixture of influences that reach from flat commercial productions to weird moody unreal Kubrick like scenes -and anything between that-, while it remains good to watch for anyone.Panic room is a story about a woman (Jodie Foster) divorcing her rich husband. She and her daughter move into a big empty house in New York. It contains a 'panic room', designed to fled to in case of need. It monitors the whole house and can be opened only from the inside while occupied. Three burglars enter the house to look for hidden millions. One is a pretty nice technician, another has a very large mouth and the last thief is basically a common slasher. These armed men know where the money is, but they can't get to this room. It's locked, and made of solid steel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room is a straight action flick that doesn't make an attempt to bring in characterization or deep themes about life. Since I'm an action movie buff, that's right up my alley. Sort of a waste of the acting talent of Jodie Foster, however. Actually, the acting is good throughout the film, but it doesn't matter.The film makes an attempt to be clever, and to be realistic, but it succeeds more in the latter. Much of the action involves conflict at a distance, which is only mildly interesting. Not much blows up; it's more of a psychological thriller.Who should see this film:-- Action movie buffs, but only on a rainy dayI'll give "Panic Room" a so-so 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Fincher showed his great direction with Seven, and once again with Fight Club. This time he does it again, proving that he can make a great film just using nothing but the inside of a house. He smoothly runs the story using many elements of the house to increase the suspense and smartly use the camera to make you feel the darkness of the atmosphere. He soon pushes the movie into a fast, violent, and somewhat creepy thriller leading to a good ending. Overall, I give the movie a 8 and a half out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically Brilliant But Still Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher's cold technical skills are a perfect fit for this manipulative, by-the-numbers thriller starring Jodie Foster as a newly-divorced mother whose brownstone is invaded by three men looking for a fortune hidden in a fortified room. The first half is Fincher showing off--at the expense of the plot--with impossibly complicated tracking and zoom shots through rails and walls and electrical outlets and plenty of scenes filmed at floor level. But he settles down in the second half and lets the conflicts between Foster and the intruders as well as between the intruders themselves (well-played by Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam) play out; then the film becomes engrossing, well-paced and satisfying. Fincher and his screenwriter, David Koepp, play fast and loose with the story--there are plenty of holes in the plot (a scene involving the use of sound is particularly flawed)--but the performances and the razzle-dazzle help you get past the suspect moments. Darkly but cleanly photographed in Panavision by Conrad W. Hall and Darius Khondji.</fullReview>

Sure, it's fun watching strange camera movements but when that's just about all there is to this movie, then it's a real downer. It's like watching Home Alone, complete with silly criminals and "funny" jokes. To tell you the truth; I find it plain awful. It's by far the worst achievement from Fincher to date.

		<fullReview>Panic Room is exactly the type of movie you would want to see at the theater, or even at home when it comes out on video. Following a terrific opening titles sequence, Jodie Foster and her daughter are moving into a big mansion, recovering from a bad divorce. Everything's okay on their first night until three burglars enter the home unaware of its occupants and looking for several million dollars locked in a safe. That safe just happens to be in the panic room, designed to protect the house's occupants in case of an emergency, and that's exactly where Foster and her child go. Now the crooks have to devise a way to get the two out. This film is extremely pleasing with a twist around every corner. Director Fincher sets the entire movie inside a house and it holds your interest until the end. Foster tries various ways to get out of the room, all of them mixed with hair-raising tension as the crooks also use various ways to get them out. This film is taught and drenched in beautiful camera-work. Shots through keyholes and coffee pot handles and even a close-up of small concrete particles shifting and moving give the camera a fluid style and it's amazing. There are very few special effects, just a solid thrill ride the whole way through. You'll be gripping your seat a lot of the time. Forget all the junk about stupid crooks and no plot, this movie is worth your money if you want to see a great thriller that doesn't cheat you out on scares. Extremely entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge fan of Davis Fincher I was a little bit upset when I watched Panic Room,I begun to feel tired of watching the same story for two hours.Of corse that I understand that is a difficult task to develope a script which is limited to a single room.Jodie Foster and her daughter stay all the time in it , so on the first hour you'll be excited but when you see that the story won't go anywhere you'll stay very tired of the `room'.I liked very much Seven ,and Fight Club is definately one of the best movies that I have ever seen.This Panic Room has positive aspects too,like the unconventional work that Fincher does filming.Like Zoon in everything or beeing inside of the gas tube. I noticed that Fincher was inpired by Hitchcock when he planned to do this movie.Everything is there: the music,suspense,a little bit of terror and violence.If you want to relax stay away from this movie but if you want to have fun this is the right one,but don't expect a masterpiece ?cos it's not.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must be Fincher`s best outing yet.Better than both "The Game" and "Fight Club" after my opinion.But,of course-miles away from the masterpiece "Seven"."Panic Room is a very exciting and intense thriller,similar to many of Alfred Hitchcock`s movies.All actors involved gives strong performances,and especially Forest Whitaker.He has a very nervous look on his face and as he says;he don`t hurt people. A very quiet and anxious guy. Jodie Foster is always good and country singer Dwight Yoakam is pretty mean as the most brutal of the three men.He acts good.Jared Leto was great in "Requiem For A Dream" and gives another strong role here. Enough of this information.What I think? "Panic Room is one of the 10 years best thrillers and is a MUST SEE for everyone who like a good movie.It has a creepy and dark atmosphere and some of the camera work is outstanding! Especially the slow-motion sequences.Great! The way Fincher uses the camera when they are going to break in is an extremely memorable part.This movie would not been the same if Fincher hadn`t directed it. Advice;run to the nearest cinema and watch David Fincher`s PANIC ROOM today.Rating-9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Few movies in our lifetime really jolt you to the edge of your seat, makes you squirm and chills your pulse as effective as Panic Room.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest David Fincher thriller is dread-ridden and accomplished and is a major indication of his mood-altering brilliance of a director. His films seduce and punish you until you're as trapped as its desperate characters. Fincher invokes such a high level feeling of anxiety in his dark, near pitch black paranoid visions. The result of his new movie is a thriller that pushes all the right buttons on the audience. Jodie Foster plays the recently divorced Meg with a young daughter with diabetes named Sarah (Kristen Stewart). They are talked into purchasing a new triple-decker brownstone located on the better half of New York. As common in movies where the house is big and formidable like the Xanadu mansion in Citizen Kane and the Overlook Hotel in The Shining, the house in play here is an ominous character where it's large and expansive spatial diameters are practically ready to swallow up its timid inhabitants.Foster, however, has never been anyone's victim. When three burglars invade her house on the first night, she panics with little awareness of where to run but makes the right crucial decisions. She wakes her daughter and gets her to run with her to the high-tech secure shelter called the Panic Room (there is an exciting chase as the bad guys, led by Jared Leto, lunge after them). Harbored by steel walls, the discreet but claustrophobic room has a buried phone line that is (in)conveniently unconnected, its own ventilation system and a survivor aid box.The intruders have a serious, high-stakes agenda and nevertheless, the prize they have in quest is located in the very room that Meg and her daughter are occupying. The bad guys quarrel over the situation, with Forest Whitaker as the sympathetic crook and a third character (the actor is better off unrevealed until the closing credits) is the madman wild-card who spends the entire time hidden under a ski mask. The bad guys try to hammer their way into the room; they try to suffocate the ventilation system, and try to use every threatening method imaginable to get Meg and Sarah to leave the room. The men box up the entire house and threaten not to leave until they get what they want. Suspense is built as much negotiation goes on between parties, and occasional trips from the room are made as Meg tries to retrieve a cell phone that was on her bed side desktop before the incident began. Sarah has diabetes complications and needs her injection. Dirty and greedy maliciousness takes place as the bad guys narrow in on how to harm Meg's most vulnerable fears.Not until after the curtain lowers do all the script flaws come into question. Foster, at one point, does have an opportunity to bring in more outside help but reasons that it will trigger more danger. The ending has a false note with the invincible villain rising from impending death one more time. But this is a director's movie and the power of the images and intensity of the events make this one heart-pounding experience, and is not for the feint of heart - which is what we expect from Fincher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, that's the best film I've seen recently. (Not counting The Others, but that's another story.) And I just can't see the problem of some people. (Possible SPOILERS ahead.) I just start hating the world "cliché". Yes, I admit that there are many clichés in the world of films, and yes, some of them are REALLY annoying. But hey, wake up! People make films for 100+ years! That means a lot of films! Thus it gets harder and harder day by day to make a really original story of which no one can say it's "clichéd" (I think it is impossible). The most important thing - for me - is simple: Panic Room can stand on its own. And it has no real faults.I don't want to repeat others, but it seems that I have to for some. Yes, the burglars made some stupid mistakes, but hey, they aren't professionals and they are REAL men - not all criminals are "Die Hard"! And yes, Foster had to be a little bit "MacGyver" and yes, his daughter had to be diabetic, because we wanted an interesting and exciting film - if you would make Panic Room with my sister and her daughter, believe me, it wouldn't be near that entertaining! And the little things... Why is that ventillation system accessible from the inside? Because the panic room isn't a prison for God's sake, its designers were not thinking about cut phone lines and criminals just wanting to get in there! (But anyway, there were that other tube leading to fresh air.) And the cameras... So simple. At the start they were the only way of two-way communication. After that they just wanted to frighten the women so it made sense to let them see what they are up to. Maybe later it would be wiser to set them off but they just forget it (they aren't perfect and they were in a stress).All in all: Panic Room is a great film, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light on Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the movie came out, I was rolling my eyes thinking how could they make a movie like this. Two hours about being stuck in a room that is impenetrable, how much excitement could there be? But figuring David Fincher is going to direct it, I thought he might be able to make something out of it.The movie had the usual Fincher touches from Fight Club, and there were a few scenes where I could feel my heart beating. But I could not say the suspense held on long enough for it to be fully effective. It was basically many short break-out/break-in attempts in between rest periods. But the rest periods were not like a commercial break, since there were still a feeling of despair during those time. Also, I guess the writers threw in the diabetic daughter so that it would not just be a sleep-through for the women trapped in the safe roomThere were more than once where I keep thinking why those men did or did not do such and such (like take out the cameras or make a story up about getting access to the safe), I shouldn't have to come to those thoughts, especially when there are three of them there with at least one that has a brain. Even a thing or two that Jodie Foster's character did came into doubt in my mind. She could have bluffed about calling the police with a cell phone she had when they showed that they cut the phone line.It comes down to the weakness of the script. Lack of events to allow the director to do his stuff.Still, a decent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Thriller (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another great film by my favorite director, David Fincher. Although the film doesn't reach the brilliance of Fight Club and Se7en, it's a very enjoyable film with great performances by all the actors.The story is known, so I won't spend any time on it here. Koepp's script is no Academy Award winner, but surprisingly clever for a big-budget film. God knows we've seen enough (too) simple scripts turned into box-office smash-hits. And Fincher knows what to do with it. He lets the camera spin, fly, move through the house, ceilings, walls and floors. Very close to Fight Club, these camera-moves.Another great thing is that we never leave the house during the actual story. From the moment we take a look (with the characters) in the house, we stay there. That's also a good thing. We learn to know the house along with Meg and her daughter.The villains aren't the most clever people alive. One times, when Meg does something (won't say it here), Raoul says: "Why didn't we do that?" and that makes the character more human than the average Euro-terrorists who dominate action films so much. People I know said the burglars made stupid mistakes. Well, people make stupid mistakes.Minor things I liked: the opening credits. Brilliant. Perfect. The weaknesses of Meg and her daughter. They aren't perfect, just like the bad-guys and that makes them human and we can relate to them.One thing I didn't like (and now the spoiler comes): The final scene. We see Meg and her daughter on a bench in a park, looking for a new house. In my opinion it didn't add anything to the movie and we left the house. I'd like us to stay in the house until the very end.In general this is a great film, has its minor flaws, but they are compensated with a clever script, great performances, terrific camera work, perfect direction and the house itself, which I thought was one of the main characters. It might be a little bit of a safe bet for Fincher to do a big studio film. Personally I'd like to see him more risky projects, like Se7en and Fight Club, but he does a great job here and gives me confidence in Fincher doing Mission: Impossible 3, like the rumors are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could have happened to anyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie begins with nice images of an ordinary action of two people visiting a house they want to buy or rent. However from that moment on the sharp contrast of these apparently innocuous images with a sound track music full od ominous presage makes us to anticipate that something much more violent is going to happen soon. Well the images are not so innocent as that because as a matter of fact that house is heavily sinister and we don't understand why a young woman and her early teen-age daughter like it so much. So the inner view of the house combined with the sound track music make us shiver from the beginning. The foreseen danger materializes itself soon in the persons of 3 more or less awkward and somewhat human burglars that enter the house with the aim of finding a lot of money they know it's hidden in the panic room, a kind of inexpugnable bunker against burglars where the woman and the girl take refuge and close themselves in. Well I won't tell you the rest of the story of course which develops itself in a succession of events full of suspense until the final outcome which will rivet your attention until the end. On the negative side of this kind of movies there is always of course a certain amount of clichés but anyhow in this case not very unplausible. All the actors play their parts with talent but not with a special genius. Though not a masterwork this movie will not make you feel you have wasted your time by watching it providing you are a movie fan of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although many of my fellow users here have criticised this movie for not being another "Fight Club", I think this factor remains one of the strongest points in its favour. This is David Fincher's movie, no doubt about it. The performances are all superb, and the script is well paced and often witty; but this is a truly masterful film maker flexing his "mainstream" muscles. Wow.I loved every second of it, for one pure and simple reason; I had totally forgotten what it felt like to use the edge of my seat in a cinema. A "thriller" had become a reason to stay at home - as Hollywood is still consistently rewarding mediocre, and just plain untalented, film makers in the mainstream sector. The Hitchcock comparisons, I feel, are hugely apt; but for me this is Fincher's pure, unadulterated homage to his beloved "Jaws".And although it obviously doesn't scale the dizzy artistic heights of "Fight Club" or even "Se7en", it shows the auteur theory in all its bright, shining glory. "Panic Room" is quite simply the work of a master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice ride, tad predictable - spoiler!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really did have me on the edge of the seat - however the movie was not completely perfect.Some of the plot was predictable - such as when the three men kept arguing, and the fact that it seemed obvious it would lead in part to their downfall, and the ending was a tad trite - however in terms of a suspense movie, I think it really delivered.It has been accused of several flaws which I thought I would address in my own understanding of the movie:- that you could speak out of the panic room, but not in.. I don't remember anything being said about that, and when it did happen, Jodie Foster's character used an intercom which I thought was part of the security system in general.- that "Raoul" could not have gotten his hand stuck due to sensors being in the door. Yes there were sensors, in my understanding there was one at the head, one at the chest area and one at the feet - but these don't sweep the whole way down, therefore if his hand was not where a sensor was, it would get caught (which it did).One flaw that really was a flaw however was the gas cylinder scene - it was wishful thinking to believe that it would be possible to do that and not blow the whole place up or something equally drastic!!I find the movie visually was quite appealing, and the opening credits really set the scene, and made me think this movie was going to be something different than a movie about a panicky mum.As to Meg turning away the cops - well it's simple really.. if she let them in, the men would have killed her daughter for sure, but by not letting them in on anything, she could be sure that at least whilst inside that room, her daughter would be safe. As to why she didn't wink etc.. I'm not sure, it could be something to do with the fact that she was freshly divorced and wanted to prove she could stand on her own and be just as capable as any man.All in all, it's NOT a waste of money, it's a nice ride even though at some points a tad predictable - in general, I don't think David Fincher has let himself down with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see the panic room because I was wondering how David Fincher mannaged to translate this relative simple idea to a movie. Therefore I was a little bit sceptical about this movie. But after the first title screen was displayed, I knew this one was going to be OK. The title part is a verry nice piece of art wich sets the standard for the rest of the movie. David Fincher has done a great job on the camera movement through the house, with a camera flying through a coffee maker and through a light bulb as absolute highlights. The story is simple, but yet verry good translated to the white screen. In some way this movie makes me think of Hitchcock, without being a 'Hitchcock-copy'.All the actors display a good level of acting skills, (Jody Foster is good as always) and especially Forest Whitacker does a very good job, playing the 'not-so-bad-badguy'. The only negative part of the movie is the ending, wich, in many ways, does not fit the overal quality of this movie.So, the question rises: Ís this Fincher's best movie ever?' For me, the answer is yes, since he managed to create an even better atmosphere (mostely, because of te briliant camera movement) than in his other masterpiece, the fightclub.9.0/10</fullReview>

I'm a huge Jodie Foster fan anyway, so the movie gets points for that, and although it was pretty much by the numbers (no real twists) it did what it did very well.

		<shortDescription>Skilfull thriller, but disappointing for Fincher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Panic Room" is all in all a very thoroughly made thriller. The camera work is outstanding, the suspense is built up very professionally, and the whole thing comes across as quite believable, although there are of course some minor plot holes (for example, how is it possible that the ski mask guy got his hand stuck between the door?). The acting is good and especially Forest Whitacker's character is very likeable in spite of the fact that he's a bad guy. But still, seeing that this movie is directed by one of the most promising and brilliant directors of the past decade, having brought us movies like "Fight Club" and "Seven", it's simply way too standard: there's a happy end, there aren't any major plot twists etc.Very enjoyable, very high production standards, but ultimately a bit disappointing.*** out of **** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caution! Deflate expectations and don't compare it to most of Fincher's past work, and you'll be fine... (SPOILERS MARKED WITHIN)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the bad news. Barring "The Game", the spectacle and effect of which was utterly ruined by the ending, (see review) this is definitely David Fincher's worst film to date. This does not mean it is bad, though; it is indeed quite watchable. All the 'star power' and innovative direction in the world only JUST manages to overcome a fairly formulaic premise and a dull script. THAT is where this film's problem lies.I actually believe it would have been far more interesting to see the Meg Altman character as being destroyed by her divorce, and relying on the mental strength of her young daughter to get her through the resurgence of vulnerability that occurs when three men have the nerve to invade the sanctity of her home. There are little hints of this sort of direction in the script, but they were never pursued far enough for my liking.I understand it was originally going to be set up as I describe, until the script was tailored to suit Jodie Foster's participation after she replaced Nicole Kidman due to a knee injury. Whilst such a change undoubtedly suits Foster's style, it probably hurts the film. Young Kristen Stewart showed me that she was a more than capable enough actress to be able to handle more complex material like that, so it was a little disappointing to see the film descend into a fairly predictable tit-for-tat battle between the indignant homeowner and the burglars. Forest Whitaker is also another standout on the acting side, doing well with a clichéd role. I can't complain about Foster's performance, since I've never seen her be anything less than excellent. I just felt her character to be rather perfunctory. All of them are, in fact, with the already mentioned exception of the young daughter. On a completely base note, special mention must go to the person who recommended Jodie Foster wear such a low-cut top for the predominant part of the movie!(MAJOR SPOILER COMING UP!)After the fairly surprising death of one of the main characters, the script provides no more shocks for Fincher to buoy the material with, so the production design and cinematography are the only things left to help the actors keep us interested. Although that side of the movie is admittedly excellent, at this point there is still a sizable chunk of the movie left, and the 'gasp' factor is now virtually nil. The great visuals could seriously have used a bit more substance to back them up.(END OF SPOILER)As a result of this lack of depth, I found the villains to be much more interesting than our two heroines, because, despite being similarly simplistic, at least they were occasionally funny! This unusual development left the ending something of a moot point for me; which is perhaps just as well, because it's every bit as unsurprising as most of what came before it.Even after taking into consideration its flaws, it's still a good watch; I guess I just expected more from a Fincher film. To be fair though, just like in "The Game" only to a much lesser extent, he gets his part of the job right, but is let down by the quality of writing he's working with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>----POSSIBLE SPOILER----Panic Room is a thriller set in the NYC brownstone home of Meg Altman [Jody Foster] recently divorced with a young teenage daughter [Kristen Stewart]. The brownstone has a secret high tech `safe room'; legend has it the former owner left a fortune hidden in the building. It's Meg's first night in her new digs and she's just getting familiar with the phone and electronics system. Burnham, Raoul and Junior [Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, and Jared Leto, respectively] stop by looking for the money. Burnham installed the safe room system, Raoul nursed the former resident, and Junior is packing the heat. Meg and the kid head for the safe room, the intruder's breakout sledgehammers and other assorted goodies of mass destruction. A contest between brain and brawn ensues; in the end the bad guys are at least one `right-hand-man' short. [See the film to get the meaning of this last comment!]Panic Room is the best of the current litter of thriller / suspense films. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat [or maybe under it], without using Hollywood's dumb video tricks. The plot is focused and fast paced, the story is well scripted, and the acting sharp and expressive. Events are unpredictable leaving viewers to guess what's up next, even having seen the previews. All the action takes place within the brownstone, making the situation all the more focused. The exceptional cinematography starts with the rectilinear layout [squared angles] of the opening credits against NYC buildings; this is a clue of the photography yet to come.Nobody does feminine fear and rage better than Jody Foster, just ask Clarice Starling in Silence of The Lambs. Foster is at her prime in this film. The three stooges of break and enter, led by Forest Whitaker, are a case study of `honor among thieves' [or lack thereof] as they are foiled at each turn of events.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As suspense movies go, Panic Room was definitely watchable and holds your attention throughout. Beyond that, there is nothing outstanding about the movie, nor anything tragically flawed. There are frequent times during the movie when you inevitably ask, "Why didn't she just do this?" or "Why don't they simply do that?". But those errors do not detract much from the action and the story maintains a healthy amount of believability. Six out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old story, new look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At an early part of Panic Room, Jodie Foster's character remarks that the panic room is "very Poe", or something to this effect. This description is very apt for the film overall, as Panic Room is a very dark, gothic film in tradition with Edgar Allen Poe's work. However it can also be seen as a reference to the movie narrative - you've probably seen or heard it before.I couldn't really get into this film. The camera manipulation is very good with the house being fully explored by this floating point of view, but it feels like the camera replaces any real attempt at plot. Its nice to be able to see everything, but maybe that's the film's problem - it lets you see everything, where it may have been more effective to keep certain things hidden. The panic room is meant to be a closed, tiny space with minimal outside interaction, but instead we fly around the house, listen in on the criminals, go back to the room, watch the criminals some more, etc. The atmosphere is never really allowed to build. Foster's character (and her daughter) are never in any real danger except for the climax, and even then you can see what's coming. In the hands of a lesser director or cast, this would have been a really mediocre film, but Fincher does a fantastic job in setting the style and tone, with the cast putting in a really solid performance. It's a stretch for no-one, however, and isn't worth all the hype its been getting. Even ignoring all of the plot holes, Panic Room is really a see-once-and-forget film. *SPOILER* What really destroyed this film for me was that everyone seemed willing to help (police, neighbours, ex-husband) and yet Foster's character shut them out and went it alone. Again, the panic room is meant to be a small, shut-off area, yet every attempt at seeking help is successful but unwanted when it arrives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must for Jodie Foster fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very pleased with this flick. It has few 'idiot' devices (i.e. only an idiot would do that), something I abhor in a thriller/mystery. How do you trap someone in their panic room so that they can't alert the police? Do it the first night in their new home, before everything is hooked up. That's not giving away much, as it happens early in the film. Thus begins the series of problems for everyone: victims and criminals.The criminals have their own problems: they didn't know anyone had moved in yet, so their keys didn't work, and what they want is in the panic room. As they attempt to coax the victims out, they have internal conflicts about how to proceed. There's a fair amount of dithering by them as one thing after another goes awry, but they are human reactions, not just plot conventions.I've admired Jodie Foster movies for a long time, as she picks good scripts and portrays strong women. As a mother, trying to protect her daughter and to figure out how to get out of this dilemma, she's done it again. The character isn't perfect, but she doesn't panic and she uses her brain.The acting is excellent to very good. Worth seeing on the large screen so you can be fully absorbed in the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher goes Hitchcock or Fincher goes commercial?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Minor spoilersLet's get one thing out of the way first; David Fincher is my favorite director. He has a talent for using all tricks in the cinematic book in a way that perfectly marries the content. He also always makes the most out of every script, which means the comparative quality of the movie relies strongly on the quality of the script Fincher has to work from. Alien 3 was a false start for Fincher, a mangled and predictable script made watchable by excellent direction and some good acting. In the cases of Se7en and Fight Club the screenplays were brilliant and so are the movies. The Game has a script that's slightly more streamlined toward being a full-blown blockbuster, but contains enough subtext to be fascinating in its own right; so is the film. This brings us to his latest film and a strong contender for the worst screenplay Fincher has worked from (yes, that includes Alien 3 and his Madonna videos).I won't even begin summing up all the plot holes David Koepp has come up with (ripped off is more accurate). And the fact he's aware of some of them (a villain says `we could've done that' after Jodie Foster's Meg Altman smashes the cameras) doesn't make them any less dumb. There's a case to be made for characters not behaving completely rational in the circumstances the movie presents, but Panic Room frequently stretched my ability to suspend my disbelief. Fincher does a good job of masking some of them (apart from one particular and far too explosive sequence), but no amount of great directing could ever compensate for the script's inclination towards cheap thrills.Koepp's screenplay is conceptually quite strong but turns out to be not only a shelter for plot holes you could build a panic room in, but also a collection of ideas that you could call 'tried-and-tested'. I would rather call them tired-and-testing. You've heard the derogatory terms before; it's Die Hard in a house! or: it's a grown-up Home Alone! - although to be fair the Home Alone flicks are far more sadistically violent. There's truth to both labels, but it goes beyond that. A scene echoing Rear Window I can forgive, but does that cops-knocking-on-the-door sequence have to be lifted from Bound entirely? And is it just me or does the (in itself excellent) opening sequence merely update the one from North by Northwest? Then there's the use of plot devices so familiar you have trouble actually remembering in what film you've seen it before (because it's ten movies, not one). The best example may be the diabetic kid fitted as standard.Another thing I appreciate in Fincher's other films is the amount of depth he finds room for. One thing becomes clear when watching this film, it's Fincher's Hitchcock project, a thriller played straight with some technical wizardry supporting it (lots of CG camerawork and a reverse dolly zoom, a technique pioneered by Hitch in Vertigo, as the final shot), but a thriller which mainly goes for suspense. While Fincher's direction goes a long way in the suspense department (he cleverly bypasses the predictability of the screenplay) he doesn't seem to have applied any knowledge about why (certain) Hitchcock films are still interesting. Those films' main strength are the strong psychological themes throughout (Psycho, Rear Window and Vertigo). While Koepp makes some desperate resort to Altman's claustrophobia, it doesn't really go for that angle. In fact it doesn't seem to go for any psychological angle at all. As such, I found it too plot driven and lacking characters I really connected with. That lack of depth in any sense may not kill the movie, but it does reinforce my impression that this is Fincher's 'good-career-move' flick. A straight, stylish thriller with plenty box office potential but little substance. It feels somewhat like a film to rebound his career after cult hit Fight Club became a box office dud.BUT....like I said, while the writing on this film isn't anything to be proud of, in terms of bringing it to screen there are little errors. Fincher succeeds in drawing tension from the most trivial of scenes, using his trademark bag of tricks. He's helped by Howard Shore's fitting soundtrack as well. Again every one of his shots is interesting in itself while they still serve a function, which is atmosphere. It's not as doom-laden as Se7en but threat is always sustained throughout. Panic Room isn't simply stylistically satisfying the way most Hollywood movies are nowadays. It goes beyond that. Technically, this really is a masterpiece. Also, Fincher gets the best out of his cast. Foster has a few truly wonderful (short and emotional) beats, while also showing being capable of handling a physical role such as Meg's. And the triple act of the burglars works wonders, even if Dwight Yoakam goes far OTT by the end.So how to rate a film which I thoroughly enjoyed due to direction, acting and the excellent work by all technical departments (the set-design is absolutely brilliant, as is the cinematography), but rubbed me the wrong way it terms of writing? Hollywood High Concept filmmaking and Hitchcockian direction go head to head in this one (where they should have gone hand to hand), and I feel the first wins in the long run. Make no mistake, I DID have a good time watching this, but will I be talking about it in a week or so? No, and that's less than I expect from Fincher.Rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple but exciting concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ?panic room' of the film's title is a sealed off room designed as part of a house for refuge during an emergency situation. It is also equipped with screens which monitor activity in different locations inside the house.Jodie Foster plays a recently divorced mother who moves into a huge mansion in order to start afresh with her teenage daughter. Soon after mother and daughter move into their new home, three intruders break in with the intention of stealing and splitting the contents of a safe which resides in the house's panic room. This plan is foiled when they discover that the residents of the house have retreated into the same room.The break-in occurs soon after the scene is set: mother and daughter view the property and are introduced to the panic room concept; they move in and on their first night, the break-in occurs. The remainder of the action stays inside the house and because of this, the audience is able to become more involved in the events which occur. Tension is built up as the camera follows the movements of the intruders while the occupants sleep in their beds. Any woman who has ever slept in their home alone can surely relate to their vulnerability in this situation!Essentially the film is a ?cat and mouse' situation with the intruders who will try anything to get at their loot and the two heroines who will use unbelievably desperate and resourceful measures to escape and get rid of the bad guys. Although the situation is tense in the house, there is a surprising amount of humour in the film and this prevents the intruders from coming across as very menacing.It is also good to see Foster back on the screen ?like in ?Silence of the Lambs', she gives a convincing performance portraying a woman who is independent and strong enough to take matters in her own hands. The only thing I'm not convinced about the character is why on earth does she need such a big house for just herself and her daughter? ?Panic Room' does not have the impact of David Fincher's recent work ?Seven' and the ?Fight Club', being less dark and intense and more mainstream. My main concern before deciding to watch this film was whether such a simple concept would keep me interested for the full duration. I need not have been concerned ??Panic Room' is a very satisfactory thriller with enough exciting moments to keep you entertained for the full 1 hour 50 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I waited eager with anticipation for this film as I am a big fan of David Fincher, he is a great director, Seven was one of the best thrillers ever made and the Game and Fight Club were two eerie and surreal films that demand watching. The Panic Room is a great film, simply because the Direction is excellent and the acting top notch, these both combine to create a tense and exciting thriller. While the story is fairly simple and far more straight forward than Finchers other films, in particular the Game and Fight Club, the film sets out to keep us on the edge of our seats with suspense and successfully does that. Fincher directs with style and perfectly captures the dark and unsettling atmosphere the house provides, the cinematography in this is very good. There is some stylish camera movement that weaves through the house and this is used to good effect as the camera will smoothly drift from one floor of the house to another. The acting is great in particular from Jodie Foster, Kristen Stewart (as Fosters daughter) and the reluctant crook played by Forrest Whittaker. There are also some elements of humour incoperated in the film just to lighten the tone every now and again. Jodie Foster is at the top of her game and she also looks very good in this as the mother who turns at to be a pain in the ass for the three crooks as the film turns out as almost a very dark and errie Home Alone without the annoying blond kid who can't act (sorry Mackauly but you can't mate). They never try to make Foster so tough she turns into a Lara Croftesque action woman, just an intelligent woman doing her best to keep her daughter from harm. The film never drags and while this doesn't compare to some of Finchers other films it still has his trademark atmosphere and is certainly one of the best films that has come out in 2002 so far. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Testament to Fincher's Ongoing Legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst not quite the exception that was Fight Club and Seven, Fincher's latest masterpiece is certainly a lesson in the art of suspense; one that seems to have escaped other Directors since Hitchcock's time.From the outset, and the disorientating opening credits, Fincher litterally winds the audience up to a frenzy of paranoia with his obscure angles and rollercoaster camerawork. Blazing a trail through his house of terror, the Director performs stunning and inspirational shots of the kind we should expect to see many more of in the future.The acting too is first rate stuff with seasoned pro Jodie Foster slipping on her thriller guise to give an excellent performance as Meg Altman, distraught single mother. For someone who has been outside of the A-list for such a long time Jodie delivers a truly emotional character, complete with tear-jerking hurt. You FEEL her isolation, as well as seeing it in the low angled shots that make Fincher's location even larger and more looming.The Panic Room itself however, is another story. Once forced into the Panic Room, a safe house to rest and relax whilst the police come to your rescue, Fincher goes to work on the claustrophobia, downsizing the room in contrast to give Meg and her daughter Sarah's (Kristen Stewert)'panic' all the more believability.Forest Whitaker too proves that his soulful, deep characters don't stop with lone ninja assassins (Ghost Dog) as the haunted Burnham, one of the three thieves who breaks into Altman's home. Torn by inner conflicts Whitaker takes Burnham and gives him the sympathetic edge the audience needs. Dwight Yoakam performs marvelously as the masked psycho and Jared Leto's inept idiot provides the black humour rounding off an excellent cast.The script is not a big thinker, there's no philosophy in this Fincher flik, but the Director handles it well, considering the single location, single concept premise. In short this film comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic room is a first class thriller. It is a completely fresh idea. As stated above, the acting, script, and directing were all top notch. So far it is the best movie of 2002. Panic room wastes very little time setting up the story. After a brief intro, they get right down to business. After a while the camera work gets a little annoying, penetrating vents, pipes, and hoses, but it doesnt distract from the film. The movie possess some of the most heart pounding moments in recent time. Most of the intense moments, such as when Jodi Foster left the panic room to get her cell phone, were all done in slow motion, which increased one's pulse. If they had been done in real time they would not have been as effective.  The movie didnt allow itself to get too serious, presenting some comic relief scenes that were done perfectly, ie they were funny enough to get a laugh, yet not too funny to distract from the overall theme and feeling of the movie. This is the first movie I have seen in a while were I cannot add any suggestions to improve the movie. Listen for Panic rooms name at next year's oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In its own limited way, a work of genius.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler warning. Despite the plot flaws, the disappointing ending, the lapses in logic and sense, this is still, somehow, a wonderful thriller. It delivers crazy tension and laughs in equal measure, until you think you might just go insane. The set-up is ludicrously simple: Jodie and her kid move into a house which has a "Panic Room" and then bad guys show up so they get into the "Panic Room". And that's about it. Except of course that the bad guys are actually quite sympathetic and interesting characters, especially the dude played by the great Forrest Whitaker, about whom more later. There's some superb banter between these dolts, including the great exchange: "Who ARE you?" "I'm Raoul." You have to see it to appreciate it. The first ten minutes set up the relationship between Jodie and her daughter (who looks uncannily like McCauley Culkin, star of that other "Trapped-in-a-house-full-of-bad-guys" movie...) with great economy and should be seen by anyone who wants to see efficient film-writing in action. It's nothing fancy, but it works. Night falls and the bad guys show up. They could just be anonymous goons in balaclavas, but they're not. They're real people. They screw up and argue and are not particularly bright. This is both refreshing and annoying. The latter because we empathise with Whitaker's character but he's technically a baddie, so we know he's doomed. He has some bright ideas but they're half-hearted and don't amount to much. His sad, mournful face is as expressive here as in anything he's done, and it would have been interesting to make the whole film from his point of view: some guys break into a house that they think is deserted and find that someone's living there. He is torn between getting the money and not hurting the people. Instead, this dilemma is there in the film, but it doesn't amount to much. Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam are superb as the other two crims. Yoakam in particular as the super-cool Raoul is a delight to watch. Meanwhile, in the Panic Room, Foster and the kid are finding there are all sorts of ways they can get back at the intruders. Cue lots of flames, running around to get the cell phone, etc. Why didn't the baddies just wait outside the room until she was forced to come out? Which would have happened, as her kid has diabetes. Which is another handy plot point, is it not? It gives Forrest a chance to redeem himself by administering her injection later on. Which makes his fate all the more unfair. Why didn't Whitaker's character, who knows how these rooms are built, know there was a hole in the wall that led to the outside? Couldn't he have somehow pumped gas/bullets/whatever through there? Couldn't he just have stopped their air supply? Why didn't Jodie get burned when she lit the gas? While you're watching it, these points don't matter, as the film has you in its ultra-tight grip. Fincher's camera glides through the house, through key-holes, through light-bulbs, etc. etc. Presumably he's worked out that there's really not that much you can do to make a film like this exciting. Two people stuck in a room. Bad guys outside. Yawn. Somehow he has managed to turn a ludicrous premise into a gripping, hypnotic thriller. It would have been nice to see what happened to Whitaker's character at the end, as many critics have pointed out. Going from Jodie's frazzled, blood-stained features to a nice shot of her and the kid in Central Park discussing where to move to seems at first a little insulting. Maybe that's the point. "Nice" upper class folks like Jodie give not a f**k about anyone but themselves. They don't care what happened to the guys who threatened them, so why should we? And why SHOULD we? In her situation would we be sympathetic if they terrorised us but they really needed the money for their kids or whatever? So what? Get the hell out of my house. "Panic Room" in the end then becomes metaphor for the class war. The bad guys are out there. Some of them have needs and motives that are not necessarily bad in themselves, but drive them to do bad things. So what? Get the hell out of my house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait Until Panic Room.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher offers up an array of fancy camerawork in `Panic Room' that has probably made Dario Argento green with envy. Jodie Foster also turns in a solid performance, as she usually does, and Kristen Stewart really holds her own next to Foster while playing her slightly difficult daughter.The script, however, is strictly run-of-the-mill stuff dressed up in extravagant sets, so don't go into this expecting any outlandish surprises. The script is basically a rewrite of "Wait Until Dark", snipping out the blind element and making the spunky young girl the heroine's daughter. Just like that film (and a great many more), this movie gives us three villains: a sleazy creep with some ill-advised cornrows; a home-invader with a heart of gold; and of course the mandatory psychopath. In fact, I kept thinking of `Wait Until Dark' so much that when Jodie Foster started knocking out all of the lights in the house with a sledgehammer, I wasn't surprised.The premise is probably well-documented by now: mother and daughter buy an impossibly large `townstone' in Manhattan, then end up having to utilize it's well-stocked bunker on the very first night they are there, when they find themselves victimized by thugs after the hidden money that the house's former tenant left behind after his death.That's about it for plot. The movie wastes no time getting into its cat-and-mouse situation, and pretty soon the ball is rolling. The weird thing is that even though the movie works, it still feels a little empty. My initial reaction after it was over is that it wasn't as engaging as it could have been. Nothing happened in it that I did not expect.For instance, Forest Whitaker's character is the humanist crook. He doesn't want to hurt anybody, unlike Dwight Yoakam's Raoul, who wears an understated ski mask and who obviously intends to use the gun he brought along on the mission. Whitaker delivers the requisite moments of clemency, while Yoakam handles the terror efficiently. The remaining crook, played by Jared Leto, is so badly drawn that you know exactly what's going to happen to him when things start going wrong.Fincher does deliver some virtuoso set pieces, most of them involving those kinds of scenarios where movie characters only have moments to sprint to safety while the villains are hot on their tails. These scenes deliver the only real excitement in `Panic Room', while the rest of it (like the annoying bickering between the crooks) seems designed to create tension through aggravation. There were a couple of ridiculous things that happened, including a scene where Jodie sticks her arm in a vent to ignite some concentrated fumes and emerges from the experience without a burn, but I was mostly aggravated by the more obvious elements of the plot, which sort of defused a lot of the potential that the film had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best action-thrillers I have seen in a long time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? It's been almost 2 hours since I walked out of the preview screening... and I'm struggling to find a flaw in the whole film. The acting is top-notch, with the characters being believable and the talents sliding into these forms effortlessly. Jodie Foster stands out though as Meg, the lead character who has just gone through a divorce and is trying to settle down in a new house with her daughter. As a strong Fincher fan I was not at all disappointed with this film, as I knew before I saw it that there was no way it would be as good as Fight Club. It was better than The Game (starring Michael Douglas), which I thought was dragged out a bit too much and had an ending which, amongst my group of friends and myself, has been the target of many laughable conversations, although I guess there wasn't really any alternative... I can only pick on one part of Panic Room - the ending. I won't give anything away (coz that'd be nasty) but you do get out of your seat thinking "hmmm. I wish they'd at least done something better with the money than that..." Otherwise, all the other Fincherisms were there. The CG-assisted camera shots moving through walls etc (like in Fight Club) could be considered overkill, but I prefer to look at them as required art which raises the tension by portraying the proximity of the burglars to the females, whilst raising the sense of chlaustrophia in the Panic Room itself. With enough touches of humour to call this a part-comedy, this is a thriller that grabs you, throws you about a bit and doesn't let go until the final scene... and the action sequences themselves are pulled off with incredible stamina and energy. And boy, that bit with the cellphone, all in slow-mo and absolutely NO sound whatsoever... had me sweating! This is going straight on my 'to-buy' list...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never liked Jodie Foster, in fact the only movie of hers that I ever enjoyed was "Contact" (1997), and when walking into the theatre to see "Panic Room" I wasn't expecting much from her, but I knew that "Fight Club" director David Fincher was behind the camera and I had a feeling it would be good. Panic Room opens up introducing divorcee Jodie Foster and her daugther (whos father is rich, and is the only reason why Foster's character can afford such an expensive Brownstone, if it weren't for the daughter, Foster would most likeley be living in some cheap 2-bedroom apartment)and they move into a new home. The pacing picks up pretty quick and I enjoyed the camera angles and close ups and zoom-ins on such things as a key lock and a ventilationg system. The acting is top-notch for a crime/thriller/drama and Whittaker as the wise yet determined criminal, was perfect for this role. I give Panic Room 3 1/2 stars out of 4.Another one minor note, Nicole Kidman was originally going to play Foster's part and THANK GOD she didn't ( I dispise Kidman) though she does make a voice cameo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT. once again the stylish vision of david fincher gives us some heady visuals in his 2002 thriller, Panic Room, a film so effective at creating viewer tension that it handily surpasses its few glaring lapses into mundane cliche film making. from the very beginning with its surrealistic cityscape title sequence there isn't a doubt that fincher eye for the unusual is as keen as ever. once the paranoia soaked plot, of jody foster and her ill daughter trapped in a house w/ three seriously ruthless home invaders, gets underway, for a sustained hour and a half the viewer's breathing comes in "oh my god, what'll happen next!" gasps and veteran spookmeister screenwriter david koepp's plotting stylishly works itself through an impressive series of variations on the old cat and mouse routine. BUT STILL, a couple garish visual and plotting cliches and a few major logic faults in the final ten minutes hold this one back from the seamless excellence of Fincher's benchmark tour de force, Fight Club. maybe not a rare truly visionary classic like his last film, but Panic Room is easily the best pulse pounding thriller you'll likely runs into anytime soon. i just wish fincher hadn't given his unique New York vision such a worn-out Hollywood ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING *SPOILERS*Panic Room is better than one might expect. I had a hard time motivating myself to see a movie about a extremely wealthy woman who can afford a 3 story house in Manhattan which comes with the "panic room." However to my surprise, this movie was more about the three thieves who were to steal.Jody Foster played the divorced character well but the real fun of this movie was the interactions among the three thieves who must get her and her son out of the panic room so they can get the money hidden in the room.Two of the thieves turn out to be not that bad of guys (for thieves at least) while the third turns out to be a cruel sadistic killer. The three of them work on trying to get into the Panic Room while not trusting each other and not sure about the motives of the other two.This turns out to be quite interesting and suspenseful at parts. The movie has good dialogue and comes off as being believable. Panic Room does not try to be anything other than entertaining and suspenseful. It does not attempt to be a great movie but meets the goal it has set for itself.Panic room earns a strong 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've read plot summaries about this one and found yourself wondering how much suspense and thrill can you get from a movie whose entire storyline centres around one room, the answer is: "probably more than you think".This is a very good production with all the elements of a good thriller and will keep you on your toes throughout. Jodie Foster gives a splendidly controlled performance and David Fincher through excellent positioning of cameras always clearly defines the characters' positions in the house as well as in relation to each other. In addition he "sends" the camera through walls, keyholes and other unlikely places creating some very smooth footage that adds to suspense and is very enjoyable to watch.Again, this IS a tense movie, (probably just up there with "What Lies Beneath") and I fully recommend it as such.

		<shortDescription>Not altogether unsatisfying but ultimately unremarkable and forgettable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic Room comes from director Fincher whose body of work up until now can be characterized as refreshing and unconventional, even if not all of his efforts have been succesful. It is therefor surprising to see him turn out something that is relatively run-of-the-mill and unremarkable. Panic Room relies on the premise of a mother (Foster) and her child finding themselves trapped in their own house by criminals, having to retreat into a so-called panic room, their only safe haven. In this sense at least it fits into the paranoia-realm that Fincher made his own. Panic Room doesn't suffer from any obvious flaws. Stilistically, the film bears the Fincher-trademark: the sets are dark and gritty, a lot of attention has been spend on detail (especially on the dimly lit panic room itself). Also, the opening-credits sequence deserves special mention. Furthermore, Panic Room features many acrobatic camera-movement as previously seen in Fight Club, although i have to say i sometimes found it too distracting from the narrative. Whitaker is unremarkable as on of the criminals suffering from a morality-attack in the middle of his operation, his acting-range is basically reduced to looking really sad and troubled. Few can be said concerning Foster's acting: it is solid but lacks depth. This is probably not her fault as her role is underwritten; we constantly see her heavy-breathing with eyes bulging out of their sockets but there is relatively little dialogue for her to excell at and there is little complexity to her character. Twists are few and none of it made much of an impression on me. Panic Room is violent but not earthshocking in any way (as we have come to expect from Fincher, eventhough it may not be fair to compare this to his other work). The problem with Panic Room lies in it's subject matter or lack thereof. One of the strengths of Fight Club was it's tendency to cover a lot of ground, tying together many loose ends that didn't seem to add up. The same holds true for The Game, which is extremely cleverly constructed in retrospect. In Panic Room storytelling is chronological, restricted to one space and one (all-seeing) perspective, all of these restrictions add up to a film that isn't altogether unsatisfying but ultimately unremarkable and forgettable.</fullReview>

But seeing it at a cinema - WOW - it is incredible.From the funky opening credits to the amazing blue-flame scene in the "panic room" to an ending which actually makes you feel sorry for a criminal who broke into this poor lady's house, this movie has it all! Everything about this movie is great, especially Fincher's directing. CGI is used extensively, but not "overused" or made to seem too gimmicky like the new Star Wars films. Parts of it felt so much like a "true" sequel to Silence of the Lambs, especially when one of the crooks took of his mask and looked exactly like Buffalo Bill! Best movie of 2002.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe not "Wait Until Dark" but definitely an amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How funny. On the way home from seeing the movie my boyfriend says to me, "Do you remember 'Wait Until Dark' with Audrey Hepburn and Alan Arkin?" and I was nodding in total agreement. Yes, this movie totally reminded me of 'Wait Until Dark' and scrolling down I see a comment putting this movie down because of the connection (and now I'm convinced that there is a total connection). But is that a bad thing?? Movies are unbelievably unoriginal now-a-days but at least 'The Panic Room' takes the idea that the Hepburn movie had and used it well. Goodness, with Austin Powers 3, Charlie's Angles 2 (double unoriginal!), yet another Jason movie (just shoot me!), and a remake of 'The Warriors' coming soon, you would figure that at least they took an idea and made it really good, instead of ripping off one exact idea after another. I am shocked by the number of people that did not like this film. It was just such a good movie in my opinion. I'm always impressed with the cinematography of a film, and you can tell that the same director directed 'Fight Club'. Now, there are a lot of REALLY good shots in this film but that certainly didn't make it what it is. The story was just too cool. Now, don't think that everything about this movie is an A+. I thought Jared Leto was just over done a little, and the ending was a bit sloppy-ish. There was this here and there that will have you saying, "no no, you should have had her do this, or that" but its still okay...Hey we all want the girl to not go into the dark basement when the light is blown out and the suspense music is playing, but she does doesn't she?But there were just so many great scenes: **SPOILERS** When Jodie Foster had to run out for her cell phone and no music played, how unbelievably amazing! The continues shot of the house when the guys start breaking in. The scene where she comes out of the room for her daughters insulin and the ruffle that happens and the scenes after where she is just insane with determination to get her daughter well.I don't know...yes its a bit of a rip off from another movie, but you know what, its a good movie with a good idea, take it and make something with it. And, yes, it has its silly parts but all in all a must see and you must see it in the theaters. Its like a really good first date. When you think about the date over all, it was great, but I'm sure that not everything that came out of his mouth was perfect (especially the part where he still lives with his parents, yuck!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, claustrophobic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing about PANIC ROOM, which combines elements of STRAW DOGS and WAIT UNTIL DARK in its story, is not merely the intensity of the situation, but also how extremely claustrophobic it feels. This is the first time in a good long while that a film can make the viewer feel literally trapped. Jodie Foster and Kristin Stewart are a mother and daughter who move into a Manhattan townhouse with a "panic room", a virtual 21st century fallout shelter complete with TV monitors and emergency supplies. To their horror, however, they find out they have to use it when three burglars (Forrest Whittaker, Jared Leto, Dwight Yoakam) break in, looking for a multi-million dollar stash. Worst of all, that stash is hidden in a wall safe whose location just happens to be the Panic Room itself!Except for an excess of profanity in the screenplay, both director David Fincher (SEVEN) and screenwriter David Koepp (JURASSIC PARK) have concocted perhaps the best example of a home invasion horror/suspense film since STRAW DOGS. Foster is, not surprisingly, incredibly good in her role, and Whittaker, though he plays a heavy, actually elicits a modicum of sympathy while his two "partners" go off on psychotic tangents.If you can stand the claustrophobic feel of it, PANIC ROOM is well worth the price of a ticket. It is one of the best films of 2002.</fullReview>

This is no female Bruce Willis, (mild spoiler) as we discover in the dying moments when she becomes totally helpless.Nearly every scene is filled with suspense and almost doesnt let up until the end. Fincher proves once again you can take a light script and turn it into an excellent thriller.9 out of 10.(Mild spoilers follow)For those who thought the criminals were too dumb, it was even spelled out right from the start. You want a movie about hyper-intelligent gangsters? See Ocean's Eleven. So what if the bad guy who went down the stairs got back up again? You dont know how much damage he sustained. Remember, this is the same guy who had his hand squished so much he probably should have been unconscious for the rest of the movie. First you dont want predictability and now you do?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>watching the trailers of this movie on the net, made it pretty clear that the movie is not the sequel of fight club. no subversive messages, no identity questioning, no generation definers. however, not every film should be all the above. sometimes it's just better to have a thriller that encapsulates fear despite or maybe because (depends on the director) it mainly takes place in a room the size of a cubicle. basic plot: meg altman (Jodie Foster, welcome back to mainstream, you were missed) a divorced, wealthy and apparently very resourceful woman move with her diabetic daughter to a house that boasts a safe room with enough features to encounter any incursion. needless to say, that safe room turns out to be the midnight express for mother &amp; daughter when three felons set out to steal a valuable item in it (which you'll have to see to find out, i'm not a spoiler maker)the movie is directed masterfully. it doesn't have the "trampoline affect" (meaning you don't jump of your seat) like movies such as "the others" or "the truth that lies beneath" but it has a magnetic persona that leaves the audience wide-eyed and just plane and simply mesmerized.the only two substantial reservations from this film are: Meg turns out to be a VERY VERY resourceful woman with enough knowledge on electrical appliances, medical necessities and chemical warfare to award her "the ultimate 'survivor' contestant. somewhere along the line somebody should have told fincher to get real. it would have made the movie even better. the other thing is not a reservation per se but just a fact that both lead actress and director, have been in better films in the past. considering how the movie had turned out, it's the biggest compliment anyone can get.9 out of 10 i9n my FilmOmeter.</fullReview>

I really like what David Fincher has done in the past: Seven, Fight Club, The Game and I guess I am one of the few people that I know that really liked Alien 3. So, I expected to like Panic Room. And I did. The pacing was great, Jodi Foster was as brilliant as always, Jared Leto was cast perfectly, Dwight Yoakam seemed right; his character being close to, but a little more menacing than, Doyle from Sling Blade. Kristen Stewart did a note worthy job. She wasn't annoying to me at all, like so many movie children can be. The whole production was quite good. I had just one little problem with the Burnham character, played by Forrest Whitaker. His character was a little predictable, because it was played by Forrest Whitaker. You wouldn't expect Forrest Whitaker to be, or play, a REALLY, REALLY bad guy and true to form, his character is not. That aside the movie puts you into a very tense situation very quickly and keeps you there almost until the very end. I wont spoil a thing, but I kind of expected the end to be a very `Hollywood Ending' and it was a just a little bit `Hollywood', but not like it could have been. I'm glad my expectations weren't met. All in all, this was well worth the money paid to see it. Very entertaining. That's my take. What's yours?</fullReview>

In other words, if you're looking for some light entertainment to take your mind of your day to day problems, then this is a good way to kill a couple of hours. The main characters are well acted with great camera work and the director manages to keep the suspense going even though you can guess how its all going to end (I mean we've all seen Home Alone and we all know the dumb burglars are not going to get away with it). However, what spoils the film for me is the tedious sub plots: Foster coming to terms with her divorce and trying to build a relationship with her daughter. Okay, I realize its an unwritten rule in Hollywood that you can't have a convincing female lead who doesn't have some kind of emotional baggage.

		<fullReview>Some movies are easy to get into, easy to rate, leaving you with a definite sense one way or the other as to how much you liked or disliked it. Then there are films like this one. "Panic Room" revolves around an interesting idea: a safe room in a house where the occupants can go if evil enters uninvited. Of course, that's exactly what happens. Pitting the grit and fierce motherly protection of Jodie Foster against the evil intent of Forest Whitaker and Dwight Yoakum, the script has some genuinely intense moments. Dwight Yoakum? In one of the worst casting experiments in recent memory, Dwight does his best to separate the country singer from the country actor and (literally) falls flat on his face. There was so much unrealized potential in this roll that could have been filled with so many competent actors (Gary Oldman and Kevin Spacey come to mind). Then there is the script --- more full of holes than a donut factory (you will count at least three continuity errors and a few lapses in character motivation that must have been caused by some serious editing). But, thankfully, there is the strength and center of Jodie Foster to carry the movie....and carry it she does. She is a wonder to watch. I just wonder why I watched it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying that David Fincher is one of my favorite directors. Fight Club is by far the best movie to come out in the last 5 years (ok maybe Gladiator was up there). Seven was incredible and The Game was great too.I knew prior to seeing Panic Room that it would not be another Fight Club and was not expecting it to be up there with it. Nonetheless I still had to see it.I was not disappointed at all. From the opening credits that were so unique, to the photography that is classic Fincher style like he did in the credits of FC and through out the film it is a great thriller. Panic room had lots of scary and very dramatic moments. Possible spoiler.. I too was upset by the unrealistic response from the 911 operator, then I read another review that said that that really happens.I would recommend seeing this in the theatres, it's a great movie to sit through uninterrupted and on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****Mild Plot Spoilers Below*****When I saw the Preview for The Panic Room, I thought it looked like a domesticated version of the original Die Hard movie: a terrorist situation where much of the plot revolved around the fact that the setting was a controlled environment. That is, all the action was limited to the confines of a fixed setting without outside influence.When watching the film, I noticed minor plot devices which came right from Die Hard, such as the breaking of the glass in the bathroom to prevent a barefoot person from running through (a major plot point in Die Hard revolved around Bruce Willis being barefoot and his terrorist opponents shooting out all the windows in order to use the broken glass to limit his movement.) The other major similarity was the fact that in both films the loot was in the form of bearer bonds, and at the end of both films the bearer bonds were sent flying through the air, caught up in the wind current created by the rotor of a helicopter.Just curious as to whether anyone in common worked on both films or if Koepp or Fincher used these devices in the form of a tribute to one of the better action movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed Panic Room. Having seen the trailer beforehand, and being put off by its overbaring noir-ish tone, I nearly didn't go. However, being a fan of director David Fincher (and an even bigger fan of his last directorial effort, 'Fight Club') I decided to check it out. I'm glad I did. Jodie Foster gives an excellent performance as beleaguered mother Meg Altman, and newcomer Kristen Stewart is wonderful as Meg's daughter, Sarah. Forest Whitaker delivers a solid performance as Burnham, the burglar with a conscience, as does Jared Leto as the cocky young Junior.Panic Room is an effectively thrilling ride of a movie, utilizing some excellent performances, fantastic camera work, awesome special effects and an almost water-tight script. It's a much-abused cliche when discussing movies within its genre, but Panic Room really does leave you on the edge of your seat for the majority of its 112 minutes. My only real complaints with the film are uneven performances by two of the actors. Patrick Bauchau who plays Stephen Altman, the ex-husband of Jodie Foster's Meg Altman does not imbue his character with any sort of personality whatsoever, and as a result his character comes across as flat and one dimensional. Maybe it's partially because the Stephen Altman character is not (physically) introduced until around halfway through the film, but we are not really given any idea of what sort of character he is. (And consequently, you don't really care what happens to him.) Dwight Yokam's portrayal of Raoul, one of the burglars, seems to be a 'paint-by-numbers thug' role. He does no favours (to either movie or audience) by playing it as such. These instances where there is definite lack of character development are minor blemishes on what is ultimately an effective and engrossing thriller. Watch out for a cameo by ?Seven' scribe Andrew Kevin Walker as a clueless neighbour and a (vocal) cameo by Nicole Kidman as Stephen Altman's bitchy girlfriend. I'd recommend Panic Room as a good thriller movie - but if you're squeamish, you might be best to wait for this one on video so you can skip the yucky bits. ;)9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a professional thriller with some details, not common in American movies. And most of these details come from the camera work. It plays with you, and with the actors, but not that much that the story loses speed or thrill.This is a good composition. The script stresses at exactly timed points. You are not always surprised about the plot, but there are turnings sometimes, which aren't to be expected. And Jodie Foster is of course brilliant, although this is a mainstream character she is performing.This is better than the slightly overestimated "The Others". It is however another sort of excitement movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful, But Nowhere Near Fincher's Previous Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After delving into a different dimension with Fight Club, David Fincher has returned to the genre that helped realize his brilliance. Panic Room brings Fincher back into the suspense game, directing Jodie Foster in a thriller that finds her forced to retreat into the room of said title.David Koepp (Stir of Echoes) scripts this potboiler about a recently divorced mother (Foster) and her diabetic daughter (Kristen Stewart) move into a New York home whose previous owner had a panic room built in; basically it's a room surrounded by steel and filled with surveillance monitors, medical kits, and water to last for days. It's a good thing, too, since on their first night, three burglars (played well by Whitaker, Leto, and Yoakam) break in, attempting to find a fortune that's been hidden in, of course, the room.Foster is used to playing strong women roles, but she's never come off as being more resourceful as in Panic Room. She makes her character seem like less a victim than a force to be reckoned with, and instead ably matches her captors. Whitaker, Leto, and Yoakam all play their parts convincingly as the intelligent, strategic, and violent burglars, respectively. The only role that comes off as a plot device is the daughter, who seems to be there not as a character but more a hinderance to the film's heroine.Fincher is a master of suspense, and there are droves of it as Foster smartly and able participates in a game of cat-and-mouse with the thieves. She comes up with clever and effective ways of dealing with them, which I won't reveal here. Suffice to say there are many moments when the audience is riveted to the screen and also never feels as if the movie is becoming an implausible eye-roller. Panic Room isn't near Fincher's other work, but still is a tense, above average thriller. 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even with its rather simple plot David Fincher achieves making Panic Room a suspenseful thriller, which keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. Once started, it never slows down. Fincher uses the camera superbly and it certainly has excellent and memorable scenes, not only because of the camerawork, but also from the great acting by Jodie Foster and Dwight Yoakam who plays the extreme psychopath. The movie is quite claustrophobic since it takes place in a rather creepy house. Even though it doesn't live up to Finhcer's previous films, such as Se7en and Fight Club, I don't mind he's taking a break from his quite complex movies, e.g. The Game, he just prooved that that's not all he does. In overall it's a splendid movie, definitely worth watching.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room may not be David Fincher's best films, but it is certainly one of his more thrilling. The claustrophobia, the suspense, and the inevitable question of "How will they escape?" makes this film a must see.My only beef with the film is the cinematography in the second half of the film. Its obvious Darius Khondji put his mark on the first half,especially considering how pedestrian the rest of the film looks compares to the first half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Panic Room - 7 of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start, if you have seen the trailer you know the plot.. Lets be honest there isn't much to the movie in general as far as that goes.. Mother/Daughter stuck in a room burglars whom have broken into their new home want in that room..Simple..effective.. and while it doesn't have layer after layer of character development and can be understood at least in general by your average 3rd grader..it doesn't take away from the movie itself..That leaves the movie to ride on the cast, and action/flow itself..1st the cast.. Jodie Foster does gives a solid performance as expected, but I feel the role could have been portrayed better by someone such as Tea Leoni.. While Jodie Foster is probably the better actress I feel Tea Leoni would have fit the role a little better..or even Diane Lane.. Kirsten Stewart was excellent as the daughter.. Forest Whitaker (Burnham) helped to carry the movie with an excellent performance.. Jared Leto (Junior)..while the slapstick/neurotic bit has been done 100 times before there is no denying he did it pretty well.... Dwight Yoakam (Raoul).. I believe his character in general was a little weak but still more should have been expected in the performance..Raoul was executed poorly...2nd the action.. The movie starts fairly slow.. while the first half hour could have taken advantage of the prep time to promote character development, it instead trodged through to the main event.. once things start to roll tho there are a limited number of delays and has numerous moments of thrills and suspense .. you'll probably find yourself clenching your teeth a few times.. it keeps pace straight up to the end.. and while the end result of the climax doesn't come as a surprise it is done very well...Overall it is a good film, the character development left a little to be desired, but the movie in general is a worthy effort...My ratings (3 scales) : 7 of 10 / 3 of 4 / A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could have got an 10 had the last five minutes not been predictable, but it still is a very very solid 9. Ok, I know, I am a Jodie Foster fan, but aside from that this was an incredible film. Intense, well acted, and well written. Even from the beginning with the credits, the producers were doing something different. Camera angles, characters, the general story line... all made this movie an A. I can't say enough about the realistic acting. Kristen Stewart (plays the daughter) not only calms you at times, makes you laugh at others, and just terrifies you with her completely believable terror and acting. And then Jodie Foster, damn! She is just always on top of her game.To make a movie that solely takes place in one room, but yet keeps you on the edge of your seat, is a feat on its own. Paranoia and suspense keeps you guessing and gripping. In the end, I couldn't wait to sit through it all over again and I plan on locking myself up in the Panic Room many more times to come</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the hands of a lesser director, "Panic Room" could have been all too routine and conventional. But thanks to the directorial skills of David Fincher, it rises above the average thriller coming out of Hollywood these days. It might seem at times that Fincher's too concerned with things like the film's visual style and CGI-assisted "camera movement" (e.g. there is an incredible scene where the camera glides down from the second floor into the kitchen, and then *through* the handle of a coffee pot and straight *into* a keyhole--and back out!), but that's part of what I like about this film. It's by a director that really loves and is a master of the craft of filmmaking, and is willing to shoot scenes in a creative, unconventional way. The suspense, after the initial set-up, is pretty taught and it never really lets up until the end. All-in-all, although Fincher fans might be somewhat "disappointed" that "Panic Room" isn't up to the level of "Fight Club," I think Fincher's latest effort is still worth seeing. It doesn't break new grounds, but it's a lot better than most so-called "thrillers" in recent memory ("Memento" being a definite exception).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While his other movies have all silent thunderstorms, Panic Room has the media hype to match the brilliance of the film, for better or worse. I belieive worse. For people expecting some horror flick with a bit of a thrill you're mistaken. This film while it has its brilliant moments which will, shoot me for using this terribly over used cliche', have you sitting on the edge of your seat, is mainly a great film to watch, and watch again because of the mastery Fincher has over the camera, his ability to place the camera anywhere, and i use that in the exact sense, is spectacular. The film it self lacks the depth and creative flare commonly assosiated with this now, household name director. David Keopp, who also wrote Jurassic Park (screenplay)and number two and three doesn't handle the mood and tempo of the movie with the correct dialoge, perhaps his intention to make it comedic, however jokes in the wrong places never work. Overall a great film to watch but do not go into it expecting anything better than Fight Club, alas, perhaps i shall view it with these intentions myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK... but that's about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was just an ordinary movie in the "suspense" or "thriller" category. It does nothing new or extremely creative with itself. The script was predictable and mostly boring. What kind of twist can they put in these movies that makes them interesting throughout or worth spending an hour and a half watching them? There's no statement about anything. All of David Fincher's movies had this, in my opinion. It's obvious in Fight Club. There are messages in the other three, too. This movie was just... like, who cares about these people, really? These three thieves with the all too familiar character traits, er, faults. The wife of the rich dude who lives in this monsterous apartment with just her daughter, who is the only one worth caring about in the entire movie. Then there's the filmmaking itself to consider. Personally, I can't stand to have "impossible" camera shots in every other scene. It seemed that David Fincher used them tastefully in his past films, but in this one... it's CGI hell. I very much looked forward to seeing this movie, but wish I had chosen to see Blade II instead. Wait, as one last note, the acting is GREAT in this movie, seriously. Dwight Yoakam can play one MEAN character, I liked seeing more of Jaret Jeto and Forrest Whitaker is amazing, as usual. Jodie Foster and her daughter (sorry I didn't catch her name before I started this) were fantastic figuring they only had one room to work with for the majority of the movie. I guess really the main problem was I expected more out of the story. David Fincher has picked great scripts in the past, but he should have left this for Tony Scott or Remy Harlin or whoever directed Arnold Schwartzeneggar's last movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully obvious-a Fincher failure (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with Fincher's main style and aesthetic. His dark, depressing lighting has become very stale. Like Marilyn Manson, provoking art is turning into a novelty. Does everyone in his movies like dank, grey lighting and interior decorating and clothing? Hopefully he will explore another area of his interest next time. Now, I'm not a film freak. I don't write reviews of every movie I see. And I think Fincher is okay making this film. It's a movie meant to scare, disturb and shake up preppies and make a lot of money-which is apparently did well so far. Let's start with the script-it's painfully obvious! The backstory is literally thrown in your face, and Koepp's sharp humor between the main characters just doesn't seem real. Everyone in this movie seems out of their element. They all give mediocre performances. Foster's motivations for her actions never come through clearly enough. All of the thiefs are basically idiots, and you would think that putting stupid thiefs up against stupid, frightened preppies would somehow even it out and make a decent movie, but it almost turns comedic instead of frightening. Once they realize that there's people in the house, they start their loud whisper argument-pretty intelligent! Leto, Yoakam and Whitaker just don't seem to gel as they should in this situation. It's pretty obvious Yoakam will do whatever he has to to get the money, including killing others and his partners, but Leto and Whitaker can't see this? Looks like Keystone Kapers from here on out. Once locked in the room, we're again subjected to Fincher's flickering flourescent lighting, giving us that grey Fight Club pallor. But look, it's dark and raining outside! Not surprising, given his other movies. Yoakam doesn't learn his lesson when the propane trick backfires, and he continues to aimlessly make idiotic decisions. When your characters lose common sense, they become less human and in turn less believable. The slow motion trick doesn't work, either-it just draws out a boring movie. My favorite scene is when Yoakam gets the sledgehammer across the jaw, falls down two flights and then crawls back up to fight again. Come on, Fincher, what are you doing? This isn't Scream. And finally, at the end, Whitaker happens to have his hand on the bonds when the cops nab him. Who's going to do that? Only him, I guess, just in time to throw them into the air in a Platoon-like arm raise that reminds me of the Green Mile. Watch the goods float away into the obvious wind machine rain! Pretty darn bad. Fincher has made Seven and Fight Club, so he is allowed to make some mistakes, so better luck next time! This is just a really bad movie on so many levels. Mediocre all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director, David Fincher, doesn't care who you root for; doesn't care if the heroine's little girl dies of diabetic shock; doesn't care if the righteous black man gets away in the end; doesn't care if the kinda-bad ex-husband gets his bones broken. He frankly doesn't give a rat's fat ass about much of anything except keeping the images as dark and monochromatic as Gordon Willis in the halcyon days of Don Corleone. Which, in these dog days, is fine with me. The premise is simple: Jodie Foster and Little Daughter are trapped in the high-tech (or so it seems) "panic room" of a pricy Upper East Side "townstone" while a troika of hoodlums tries to get in and kill them. The blunt basicness of this conception allows Fincher time and space to focus on the things that mean a lot to him: like making Jodie's ten-year-old kiddie seem like a budding brainy lipstick lesbian. (Fincher's close study of the perverse snarkiness of John Schlesinger pays off here.) The movie peels away all the touchy-feely "humane" layers of Hollywood moviemaking to get to a highly formalized abstraction not seen much on cineplex walls since the first release of ZABRISKIE POINT. This can make the picture seem schematic, bloodless, and devoid of idiosyncrasy and warmth. And yet and still: in the words of Jerry Lewis' lawyer in THE KING OF COMEDY: "Who cayuhs? WHO CAYYYUUHS?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a masterpiece... David Fincher once again proves he is the best modern film maker we've got... While not quite up to par with Fight Club, Se7en, or The Game, Panic Room nonetheless is an achievement in film making. And when I say film making, I mean directing and cinematography. The writing sucks. David Koepp, who penned such notably horrible scripts as The Lost World: Jurassic Park 2 proves that he is completely incapable of brilliant screenwriting. However, Fincher takes this lackluster script and turns it into a work of staggering genius. Jodie Foster is perfect as Meg Altman, and Forest Whittaker steals away every scene as a do-gooder thief. But the real gem here is Jared Leto. In sharp contrast to his roles as "Angel Face" in Fight Club and a heroin junkie in Requiem for a Dream, his portrayal of high-strung Junior is Oscar-worthy. Overall, Panic Room is dark, moody, scary, and incredible. The way the camera captures every nook and cranny of this New York townhouse is mindblowing. The final moments are breathtaking - your heart might even stop beating for a few seconds. Fincher is god. Absolutely amazing...</fullReview>

Jodie Foster's new film, PANIC ROOM, was anything but an olive for me. Most films deal with conflict of one sort or another, good films take the movie goer to the next level referred to as "complication". Foster's character finds herself with her child in conflict when intruders invade her home and seek the safety of the panic room. The plot becomes an emotional complication when Foster's character becomes trapped outside the panic room with her child trapped inside with the intruders. That's good story telling with a twist. The film is edited especially well and does not lose the audience with a series of quick action scenes. So, here's my suggestion, stop sucking on olives and go see the PANIC ROOM.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Fincher's thriller, The Panic Room, was a forum for amazing visuals, if nothing else. The acting was first rate, and the dialogue was very believable. However, the plot had a few holes and left a bit to be desired. Fincher is known for his twist endings (Seven, The Game, Fight Club)and great material. This foray came up a bit lacking. With that unpleasantness out of the way however, it was an engrossing thriller that did deliver chills and spills. Fincher's use of computer animation and real shots made the viewer feel as if it was a ghost floating through the house, moving through keyholes and floorboards to be privy to all the action. If Ridley Scott is one of the most over-rated directors (besides Alien and Blade Runner) then David Fincher is probably the most underrated. Like Michael Mann, Fincher has a unique visual style and production design asthetics that are astounding. David Fincher is a God. But, even Gods make mediocre films occasionally. Lucas made Episode I didn't he? The Panic Room, while better than most of the Hollywood drivel that comes out every year, does not hold up well to Fincher's earlier work. But the dude's got shots, man. 3 out of 5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I see movies I expect nothing. I am there to be entertained, so if a petty detail might bug me I don't mention it until I see the movie in its entirety for myself, then if it's still an issue I analyze it. Well, I was not disappointed with this movie. When it started out slow at the very beginning I knew it was to establish some characterization, but I was worried about my older sister saying it was too slow. Well, she didn't say a word about it.WARNING, A SMALL SPOILERI wasn't disappointed in anything. I suppose that's because I didn't expect anything. Since I am legally blind I asked my sister to read who did the music, which is something I always look for in movies. When she read the name Howard Shore I couldn't help but say "Oh YES!" in a bit of a loud voice. I loved his score for Lord of the Rings, and I was not disappointed with this score.

For example I did not feel any emotion at all for any of the characters except, near the end, the girl and Jodie, and the "bad guy turned good guy." There was little room for that I suppose. Still I would have liked to have felt as if these people were "real" I think is how I want to say it. More than just your typical thriller characters. The best thrillers to convey that kind of emotion I suppose is "Don't Say A Word" and "The Skulls."Again, if you expect a lot, you probably won't get a lot.

		<fullReview>When I see movies I expect nothing. I am there to be entertained, so if a petty detail might bug me I don't mention it until I see the movie in its entirety for myself, then if it's still an issue I analyze it. Well, I was not disappointed with this movie. When it started out slow at the very beginning I knew it was to establish some characterization, but I was worried about my older sister saying it was too slow. Well, she didn't say a word about it.WARNING, A SMALL SPOILERI wasn't disappointed in anything. I suppose that's because I didn't expect anything. Since I am legally blind I asked my sister to read who did the music, which is something I always look for in movies. When she read the name Howard Shore I couldn't help but say "Oh YES!" in a bit of a loud voice. I loved his score for Lord of the Rings, and I was not disappointed with this score. The plot was dry, but there were some twists that kept me interested. Our mom is a diabetic, and I bet when she sees this movie and sees the girl into sugar shock, she won't want to watch anymore because it's too scary.

		<fullReview>My wife and I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for weeks now. On her night off, we went to the theater and paid our 20 dollars and grabbed a couple of good seats. The show starts with some incredible credits, very nice, and that's where the fun ended. How stupid does David Fincher think the movie going public is??? I'm not one to pick apart a movie on stupid technical stuff, but this was just plain bad. Time after time, one thing after another, we almost walked out of the theatre. And talk about predictable; my cousin's kindergarten play was more of an "edge of your seat" production than this movie. Before I close, I would like to apologize to the late Mr. Hitchcock for Mr. John Epstein's comment "David Fincher has mixed his own style with Alfred Hitchcock's!". Mr. Hitchcock was a master of suspense, David Fincher, however, should call my little cousin. In closing, I feel my wife and I would have enjoyed our 20 dollars better if we had watched it burn on our front lawn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was totally on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. Even if you've seen the trailer you don't exactly know what is going to happen ? and when. I don't want to give too much away but I will tell you the basic premise since it is pretty much common knowledge. And for all you wimps out there ? It isn't a scary movie but a suspenseful / creepy one.Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman, a newly single mother who buys a huge NY apartment. The realtor refers to it as a combination of brownstone &amp; townhouse. One of the bedrooms contains a safe room or PANIC ROOM where you can go if you're being robbed or attacked. The room is equipped with closed circuit cameras, emergency supplies and a buried phone line. Plus it is reinforced with 3 inch steel. Pretty impenetrable.Needless to say the first night in the apartment three intruders (Forrest Whitaker ? who's always excellent, Jared Leto ? sweet cornrows! and Dwight Yoakam ? almost unrecognizable with his choice of headwear) enter the apartment and the Altman women (Kristen Stewart plays the teenaged daughter, Sarah) find themselves running for their lives to the safety of the PANIC ROOM. What follows next is roughly an hour and a half of cat and mouse with a few twists thrown in for good measure. The director David Fincher (who also directed Se7en and Fight Club) uses some pretty cool techniques to keep you in suspense. I loved his use of sound and silence and how he takes you into the action with his use of strange camera angles and perspectives. Keep your eyes open for the long shot through the kitchen ? Very cool.4.5 buckets of popcorn out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PANIC FRIDGE, or Son of HOME ALONE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did I go see this? The only thing subtle about this movie was the fridge in the kid's bedroom, right beside her bed no less. When I first saw that I thought "that's unbelievable, ugh, what a spoiled brat, and what a lousy set decorator" but then later as things unfolded I got the picture loud and clear - ah ha! - and I became quite enamoured with the fridge.I liked the mom/daughter thing above anything else in the movie, not enough of that these days and those were my favourite parts in the movie. So if I were the KING OF HOLLYWOOD I would have decreed the script to include more of that mom/kid stuff (I'm a sentimentalist, why not?)and exclude...if I had a bottle or 2 of white out handy I'd blot out the villains, dab a few drops on the whole panic room idea itself. OK, maybe not get rid of it altogether, I'd keep it as the focus but shrink it down to something more compact...how about "Panic Refrigerator" (did I tell you that I thought the kid's fridge was a nice touch? The kid has a fridge in her bedroom, mom has a panic room, hmmm...anyone care enough about this movie to take this further?) I'd change the three robbers into a trio of Japanese concert pianists who sleepwalked into rich people's fridges to dip their fingers into tubs of cavier and whatnot the night before the big recital because this was their way of purging themselves of their pre-concert panic and post-concert anxiety over reviews. Critics these day can be so brutal y'know...whoops, that would have made this into a more interesting film, my mistake.David Fincher made Aliens 3 so maybe he wanted to do HOME ALONE 3 or something, because the girl does look like Macaulay Culkin (well maybe only for that scene where she raised her hands to her ears to block out a loud noise) but casting dept definitely should have gotten Joe Pesci to play one of the robbers. It would have been hilarious if it were Pesci who got his hand stuck in the door. I'd be rolling in the aisles to this day as they say. Bring in the Home Alone gang I say, bring in stunt co-ordinators too, to make the action sequences more like gags, more zany. Poke-you-in-the-eyes-if-I-don't-punch-you-in-the-belly. That kind of thing is pure gold. Keep it simple, smartguy.</fullReview>

In Panic Room visual beauty is all there is and it motivates all action, lighting and character development. Darius Khondjii- always the great cinematographer that he is- carries this whole effort on his shoulders. There is barely any decent acting, the story line is trivial, the characters are motivated by nothing but moving the plotline forward and any logic and/or reality are completely excluded.

		<fullReview>Before I went to watch The Panic Room, I was extremely psyched and eager to see it and felt like this could be a movie that is worth my $8.50 and that I could not wait 3 months for the DVD to come out.It fell short of my expectations. The psychological twists and turns did not impress me - I was searching for something more along the impact of The Sixth Sense or The Others. I did not find that in this movie. In addition, I have a big problem understanding movies that aim to cross genres and be both a thriller and a comedy.Comedy? Yes, Comedy.No fewer than two dozen times, the audience exploded into laughter as the thieves' characters were more like the stupid robbers in the Home Alone movies. I faught between telling myself that was the point of the movie, and that it was a goof-off on the part of the scriptwriters. As a result, I found it difficult to generally be scared or frightened or thrilled because each and every time, the suspense is interrupted by laughter and silliness.Is it dark humor? I don't think so. It's not so much dark humor as a totally misguided plot. Jodie Foster's character and her daughter's performance are great - they are genuinely scared, but I see no connection between their fright and the robber's silly behavior.To conclude, I felt like laughing and shaking my head at this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room starring Jodie Foster, is an action packed suspense thriller, that has an ending that will make you cheer. I saw this movie on the second day of its release and was surprised to see so many people in the theater for the Saturday matinee, especially on as nice of a day as it was.The movie is about a soon to be divorced mother and her daughter that move into this great townhouse in Manhattan. The Townhouse was formally owned by a paranoid rich guy who added some extra features to the house to make it more secure. One of the extra features is a panic room. A Panic room is a place where you can go in case someone breaks into your house. The room is totally secure surrounded in concrete and iron. They are made so that no one will ever be allowed in unless you want them to come in.Here is the problem 3 guys break into the townhouse looking for the missing money that belonged to the dead rich guy. They didn't know that the house had 2 people in it until it was to late. With some quick thinking the mother and daughter end up in the panic room. They should be all safe now right? Wrong the stuff that the thiefs are looking for is in the panic room and they will do anything they can to get in to it.The movie was pretty good, slow at times but picked up at the end. There is one scene in particular that is pretty good, and is worth mentioning. The 3 bad guys decided to draw them out by tainting there air supply, so that take a propane tank and feed the gas into the room. I won't tell you what happened, but lets just say it was a pretty big bang, with lots of cool special effects.All and all the movie was very good, and it kept you entertained until the very end, I only have one problem with the movie is that it should be about 5 minutes longer. They do a good job with the development of characters but they don't say what happens to them in the end. I give it a 9 out of 10 and I recommend that you see it while it is in theaters. I don't think it will be the same at home in the living room. The best part of seeing it at the theater was hearing and seeing everyones reactions for parts of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you first think about the premise of "Panic Room," you would think that it's just a cliche like most of the movies out there. However, with the exception of a typical burglars-break-into-house idea, I find the chemistry of this movie to be totally unique and elaborate with all of its modern era Alfred Hitchcockian-type camera work that director David Fincher uses quite often. Fincher is also able to make the story thrilling, yet quiet. It often makes you wonder what's going to pop out around the next corner.The story centers around Meg Altman (Jodie Foster), a recently divorced mother, and 11-year-old her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart). They are interested in buying a huge house in Manhattan, which the real estate agent gives them a tour, and introduces them to a safe room known as the panic room. This particular room is used as a hideout from burglars, it has its own phone line, video monitors, and the room is made of very strong steel so the bad guys can't get in. They won't be needing the panic room any time soon...or will they?Soon enough, we are introduced by three burglars who each have their own different personalities. There's Burnham (Forest Whittaker), the brains of the outfit, the designer of the panic room, Junior (Jared Leto), a foul-mouthed leader of the group, and Raoul (Dwight Yoakam), the deranged psychopath with a gun. When Meg notices the three men in the house, she quickly wakes up her daughter and rushes into the panic room. She asks the burglars why they are here, but what they want is inside the panic room, and they won't leave until they get it.</fullReview>

Decent little thriller, but director David Fincher (Fight Club, The Game, Se7en, Alien3) and Hollywood writer David Koepp again just miss offering up a masterpiece. The comparisons I have seen to Hitchcock make me cringe. The trio of bad guys is at times cartoonish. Jared Leto is almost unrecognizable as the ring leader. Forrest Whitaker is the burglar with a heart and Dwight Yoakam is cast as pure evil. His role is poorly written and we know what he is capable of from his stunning role in "Sling Blade". Jodie turns in another professional, believable role, but is let down by the script and direction. Her daughter played by Kristen Stewart is unable to create the sympathy from the audience necessary for her role.

		<fullReview>If you go into Panic Room knowing that its a david fincher film, you probably won't enjoy it as much as someone who is completely oblivious to finchers filmography. I expected great things from the man who gave us Se7en and Fight Club. Panic Room is a good thriller, butt not a great one. Jodie Foster acts as well as...jodie foster. Leto, Whitaker, and Yoakam are equally impressive. The camera work is great. I'm not entirely sure how fincher pulled off some of the shots...probably with some of the techniques he pioneered in fight club, good editing, and a great crew. My one complaint, why did he have the camera fly into the flashlight? Sure, it looked awsome, butt it wasn't really relevant to anything. Also, it starts off a little slow, butt that can be expected in movies of this genre, its almost an essential. In the end though, this film entertains, and even scares you a little. Theres also some comedic moments. Plus, the titles are just plain cool...almost as cool as fight club's titles...almost.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the intenstity of a modernized "Rear Window", but contrasted by the internal/external conflicts and self-doubt of "The Thin Red Line", "The Panic Room" manages to make almost two hours of anxiety worthwhile :)Without giving anything away, the film is well-paced, the dialog and scenes are believable, and Forrest Whittaker (sp?) and Jody Foster both provide superb performances - I strongly recommend this film, but don't go expecting to be frightend - it is NOT a horror movie - it's a tension generator!</fullReview>

Yet as I sat on the edge of my seat last night, I found there were several great laughs in this one! Not to mention all the suspense and action. This is an extremely well-written, original movie that will surely draw huge crowds. The ONLY thing I didn't like was that there were some bloody scenes that didn't need to be quite so gruesome.

		<shortDescription>A worthy addition to Fincher's body of work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic Room is not a masterpiece. That disclaimer should be taken not as a knock against the film, but merely as an advisory for those that are expecting this film to be a work of genius in the way that Fight Club was. This film is more akin to Fincher's The Game in that it takes a tried-and-true film genre and shows that a simple of story can generate incredible suspense. This isn't the type of film that will leave you mulling over the intricacies of its plot and meaning for days; it is 100 minutes of adrenaline. I am going to avoid going into great detail about the story and even the performances; this isn't the type of film that needs to be analyzed on every minute level. Quite simply, Panic Room is an excercize in the way that a great setting, coupled with superb acting (for the most part) and direction, can create a very enjoyable night at the movies for either thrill-seekers or students of film, even if many of the plot developments are heavily foreshadowed. The suspense isn't achieved in the ends, but in the execution, and Fincher's ability to continually create an engrossing and entertaining product across his body of work is what makes him one of Hollywood's best talents at the moment; this film is no exception. The casting, as was anticipated, was nearly perfect, though I found Jared Leto's character to be overly comical in a quite serious film. All gripes aside, this film is quality, and is one of the best nights at the movies you'll have in the annual spring lull. My rating: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Panic Room" is an odd duck of a movie, in that it is a potentially bad idea given to a good director who happened to make it bad anyway. "Seven" is a fantastic film from director David Fincher, and while I think "Fight Club" is woefully overrated, I understand that Fincher does indeed have talent. Unfortunately, "Panic Room" does not take advantage of the key elements of a suspense flick, even though a fine director is at the helm. Claustrophobia is barely even mentioned and does not come into play whatsoever even though the movie could have made the panic room tiny, therefore creating feverish suspense. On the contrary, the panic room seems rather spacious and quite enjoyable. Also, the second the "bad guys" enter the house (that's not giving anything away) they become comical cartoons. Jared Leto is especially annoying as comic relief in a film that needs none. Instead of being afraid of the bad guys, we can't be because they might as well be Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci (ironically, one character is referred to as Joe Pesci in the movie); they aren't scary, they're pathetic. I'll admit that there are some mildly suspenseful parts, but they are often rudely interrupted by a dumb joke or a hackneyed plot device that conveniently leads the characters into another ridiculous situation. The ending is weak at best, and I was ultimately disappointed because I thought David Fincher might have taken a giant step forward in the medium now that he can choose almost any project he likes, but alas, he has tripped and fallen backwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jodie Foster stars as a recent divorcee who moves in with her daughter to a "townstone" house on the Upper West Side of NYC. She quickly finds that the house has a hidden "panic room;" a fallout shelter for rich eccentrics. When three robbers look to find some hidden treasure, Foster, and daughter Kristen Stewart, have the room as their only means of survival. Foster is spectacular in her finest role since Nell, and Stewart is her match as her precocious daughter. Forest Whitaker, and, especially, Dwight Yoakam are standouts as, respectively, the conscientious and psychotic thieves, though Jared Leto is over-the-top. Fincher's direction towers over a weak script by David Koepp, creating real tension out of a contrived situation. A winner. ***1/2 out of four.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Se7en, I loved Fight Club. Panic Room is no different, why? because I love it. David Fincher is slowly becoming a new Hitchcock. Not to say he is replacing him, but the styles of the directors are similar, alot of imagery. Great camera work, haunting visuals, and a Pace that never drops. Alot of effects that were used in Fight Club are used here plus some new tricks.The characters are well developed for their purposes. The actors, all superb. I really enjoyed watching Jared Leto in this film, as well as Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart and Forest Whitaker.We become involved with both sides and nothing becomes unclear. We see how human all these characters can be and we see the leaps and bounds they will go to for survival.You might think that the film would get boring if everything takes place in a house. You quickly learn that you are wrong. Character chemistry comes into play and we don't want to miss a beat.I loved it, I gave it a 9. Do yourself a favor and see it.</fullReview>

His camerawork and visceral images are at work here like they were in his earlier movies. In lesser hands, Panic Room would have been lost as something simple and uninspired. Proof of this is the scene with the fire. His images tell the story in a way that could have otherwise been blase'.

		<shortDescription>Why this is the greatest film of 2002 (so far)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because most of the films released so far this year have been really dull and uninteresting, whereas this film actually engages the viewer for more than twenty minutes. Intense thrillers don't get much better than this. I suggest you go see this film with a large audience. If the audience has as much fun as mine did, you will be cheering and gasping with all the rest of 'em. Never in all my years have I ever witnessed a movie-going audience cheer and applaud at a particularly intense moment in any film. "Panic Room" actually makes you fear for the lives of Jodie Foster's Meg Altman and her daughter (who oddly enough is a bit of a tomboy--go fig).Speaking of Jodie Foster, she has never been better. It's a wonder why we never see more of her in film. After her two Oscar wins before she was thirty, one would think that she would be the most highly sought after actress in Hollywood. But, being the choosy woman she is, she only plays in the films that interest her. And it's no surprise what drew her to this role. On one hand, Meg Altman is a bit of a paranoid, borderline clautrophobe insistent on moving into a very large New York townhouse with a special "panic room" she can hide in if worse comes to worse (which it actually does--on the first night in the house!). On the other, she is a tough, resourceful woman who remarkably shines through the toughest binds, especially when attending to her diabetic daughter. This is not too much to give away, as the film manages to convey this highly suspenseful twist through a very subtle and implicit means. Very little of this film is out-right revealed. You have to pay attention, if you blink for just a minute you may miss something important.David Fincher does it again by taking a relatively simple story line (three burglars break into a large house to find a hidden stash of cash while the two inhabitants are inside) and weaves this brilliant thriller into a wonderful thrill ride. I'll even go so far to give Kudos to Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker, and the surprisingly convincing yet purely EVIL Dwight Yoakam for their ecstatic performances as the three burglars. Jared Leto is probably the most inept and ridiculous burglar out there and one cannot help but laugh at his banter with Dwight's Raoul and Forest's Burnham. That banter though quickly subsides (thankfully, as too much may have ruined the film) as the real action begins...I won't say much more to keep the fun from being wasted. Have some fun this Easter weekend and go to see this great film. You won't be sorry!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally a thriller that fully deserves that description. David Fincher's signature style makes this solid script into a gripping movie experience. No cheap scares here, but if you manage to sit still (not as easy as it sounds), you will feel your own accelerated heartbeat. Mercifully, relief from the ever-mounting feeling of claustrophobia comes in the form of a delightfully black humour, mostly at the expense of the somewhat inept robbers. All in all, a movie to remember - although you might be glad when it's over. There is only so much stress the human organism can take, after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I happened to catch a screening of David Fincher's new film "Panic Room" while I was on vacation in Los Angeles. Since 3 out of 4 of his movies have been disappointing for me, I wasn't to enthusiastic about it.It tells the story of Meg Altman and her daughter Sarah. Meg has been recently divorced and both of them are looking for new life after the rather unsuccessful marriage. So they settle down in the big city and find a nice, cozy, perfect house. Or is it...They learn of a safe or "panic" room in the house that has video screens, buried phone line, ventilation system, and a 1 foot thick steel wall. Why would a house need a room like this and when would they need to use it? They find out soon enough.One of their first nights in the house (You'll never guess) people break in. Meg and Sarah are able to get to the Panic Room quick enough, however, to hide from the intruders for a short time. So the first 2 questions on the 2 girls' minds are, of course: Who are you, and what are you doing in my house. They find out that the burglars want nothing other that what is in that room. In fact, they won't leave until they get it. So what is in the room that is soooo special. Are you just dying to know otherwise you won't see it because it looks too scary or something? Well I'm not going to tell you. It's against IMDB regulations.I will however say that this is a very VERY creepy film. If you get the heeby-jeebies already when you stay home alone, this movie will make you catatonic. Just because it takes place in a house doesn't mean there isn't room for fancy camera work. David Fincher can and does take the camera wherever he wants to. Whether it's through cracks in the wall, keyholes, or coffee pot handles, the camera will go there.So did I like it? Yes I did. It is my favorite movie of 2002 so far. (Keep in mind there haven't been many good ones) I loved pretty much everything about it. Do I recommend it? Yes, but only to people who loooooooove a good scare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the people involved in this film did a fine job, but none of that could save this awful screenplay. The entire plot is full of these little moments where the story would have ended if the character thought for a second or acted like a rational human being.The film starts with our villains breaking in and our protagonists hiding in the titular panic room. The burglars need money out of the safe in the panic room it can't get it while it's occupied. Now, the goals of all of these characters aren't really in conflict. The burglars aren't interested in harming anyone and Jodie Foster would probably be more than happy to let them have the contents of the safe especially since she didn't even know it was there. So it would make sense for the burglars to at least try to explain why they broke in, but instead they give some cryptic answer and try to break in to the panic room. Later in the film, the burglars try to smoke the main characters out with some propane. This at least sounds like a plan that makes sense, but the way our heroes escape this is so stupid and so implausible that it makes your brain hurt. After searching the supplies for like 10 seconds and not finding any gas masks, which seems like it should be standard for a panic room, Jodie Foster decides to light the propane on fire. If I were to make a list of ways I would deal with a room filling with propane, burning it would rank somewhere below trying to hold my breath for six hours. What's worse, is this actually works without murdering everyone like it would have in the real world.The movies full of little moments like this. There's no real tension because the villains are idiots and a normal person could have waited it out in that room no problem. The only reason there's any conflict is because Jodie Foster is also an idiot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are too many anomalies in the story for this to be considered realistic, and without realism the viewer will not believe the story and therefore quickly lose interest. I won't detail the errors in case you want to watch it and make up your own mind. Let's say, Meg demonstrates some intelligence, but it appears to be selective and geared towards creating dramatic film sequences - maybe she knew her story would be turned into a movie?! Stupid script aside, the performances are all quite good and the tension is aided by good lighting and camera work, albeit said tension is lost due to aforementioned errors. We do learn a lot about the characters and some credit is due for that.However, with the viewer having invested some interest in a character, it seems pointless to undo all that good work by skimping on a decent ending. It may be logical in terms of the way the film is constructed, but in terms of the story I found it unsatisfactory.If you can stand the frustration and disappointment, it's worth watching for the good points, but as a film overall it deserves a low rating for sheer stupidity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, I did like Panic Room. While it is not as good as Se7en or Fight Club, it is slick and efficient, and you can tell that David Fincher was making an effort to make this good. He is a good director, and he does do a decent job directing. Occasionally though, the breakneck camera work and unconventional angles get in the way of the storytelling and the action, so while Fincher succeeded in trying to impress, occasionally he tried too hard. The plot is also rather formulaic, the script is sometimes lacking and the film loses its way in the pacing towards the end.However, I loved the suspenseful atmosphere, there were occasions throughout the course of the film where it was claustrophobic, and the scenery and dark colour palette were well judged. When the dialogue was good, it was good, while Panic Room does start off wonderfully with a very innovative title sequence. Although it does lose its way, the pace is efficient enough to keep the plot afloat, and the acting is fine. Jodie Foster is very good as the gutsy heroine, while Forrest Whittaker is quite poignant as one of the intruders. I was also pleasantly surprised by Kristen Stewart, I personally have never considered her as much of an actress, but she is quite decent here.So overall, a slight disappointment but a slick and enjoyable flick. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am, since the age of 14, a huge Jodie fan; I began with several of her flicks (the Lecter flick, of course; and two other movies), that I still cherish above other Foster vehicles. And even in this thriller Jodie's role is strikingly sharp, intense and focused, beautifully crafted, and also amazingly delightful, likable; one of the greatest actresses. It's true that she's also highly sexy. As a matter of fact, Jodie is a terrific thriller actress. She's equally able in such physical roles. It's an enthralling good hostage thriller, rather akin to DESPERATE HOURS, and implicitly much better stuff than, say, the DIE HARD franchise. And it's the incomparable Jodie who makes this flick eminently worth watching. The pace is frenzied, and the suspense is genuine and enjoyable. Every Fincher flick, however well made, has nonetheless flaws and proofs of clumsiness. Jodie's role is far above the value of the movie. I mean, she's gold, she's incomparable and stunning. A great actress?and an especially great actress for thrillers. Jodie's roles are not only incomparably focused and clean, they're extremely lean as well?agility deprived of stuffing, of rubbish?hallmark no?nonsense roles. It's like for a long time we didn't have actors for the thrillers; and now, that we have the performers, we don't have thrillers to match them. Several varyingly annoying things in this flick:--the scene with the two policemen at the door (if the cops supposed they're all listened to by the aggressors, the plainly telling Mrs. Foster how to act wasn't such a good move; the girls; the ex?husband's (otherwise venerable) age; the 'Raoul' villain not being very messed up after he just got smashed with a hammer. In view of the ex's fortune, his age might be conceded.Otherwise, the movie's thrilling, suspenseful, nicely paced, and thin. Mrs. Foster is an awesome actress, and she makes a nice B. Willis/ McCulkin here.A reliable performance from Whitaker, who typecasts as a postmodern Afro?American Gabin , and 'Raoul' makes a stunning villain (Yoakam).</fullReview>

They put this film down a bit.Meg Altman, a newly divorced, moves into her new flat with her daughter Sarah. On their first night they get some uninvited guests and seek refuge in the "panic room", a bunker inside the house. Unfortunately what the thieves are looking for is inside the panic room as well.Panic Room has an original story with lot of potential. Unfortunately the characters don't live up to the story and there are some obvious holes and errors that pulls this whole movie down. The story, however, is well told and thrilling from beginning till end witch helps a lot, but David Koepp should have done some more work with the script.The cinematography and editing, however, is excellent. There are some nice long takes and beautiful moves. The composition of the shots, lightning and over all look and feel of the movie is good. The cinematographers does a good job in capturing the mood of the film and the feelings of characters. Jodie Foster delivers as Meg Altman and Kristen Stewart's kind of tomboy style works good as Sarah. The rest of the cast delivers a adequate performance, but still good enough. Dwight Yoakam, Jared Leto and Forest Whitaker makes a good cast for the thieves, but I didn't think Patrick Bauchau did too good as Stephen Altman. In my opinion the wrong man for the character.You don't really notice the score. It's just laying there, building up the mood and excitement. It's really not given that much focus, but it's a good classic score by Howard Shore.Panic Room is a good movie, by all means. I can recommend it because of good cinematography and an original story. It's well worth to watch and if you don't expect all too much you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Panic - It's just a room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic Room shows that just because you have a place of refuge in times of trouble does not mean it is always the safest place to go. After being left by her husband for another women Meg (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) move into an Upper West Side 3 story brownstone home which belonged to a deceased millionaire. There is a panic room off the master bedroom which is impossible to get in from the outside. Foster, who is claustrophobic and her daughter who is diabetic are forced to hide in the room when three intruders break in. The intruders are under the impression that the house is empty. Foster tries to drown her divorce feelings in the bath tub and with a bottle of wine on the first night. She wakes up in the middle of the night and notices the intruders on the monitor in the panic room. Foster is able to wake Stewart from an upper floor and make it back to the panic room before the intruders, after a few rides on the house's elevator. Burnham (Forest Whitaker) is a security expert who also builds panic rooms. Whitaker wants some fast cash that is stored in the panic room. Whitaker's partner Junior (Jared Leto) is the grandson of the deceased owner. The third intruder, Raoul (Dwight Yoakum) is a fight ready to happen. Foster and Whitaker do a wonderful job playing these roles. Whitaker who is usually the big hearted character is almost able to turn around, but in the end still shows the softness. Foster brings a little Clarice (Silence of the Lambs) out in the movie with her domineer. These are two great characters that help bring the darker version of Home Alone (1990) out. The elements used to emphasize the theme of Panic Room were the lighting and the music. Both of these elements add to the suspense and dangerous feelings in the movie. The lighting in the Panic Room was low key throughout most of the movie. The scene where Foster is on a mission to get her daughter released from the panic room and she is disabling all the cameras in the home one by one really shows how the low key makes the movie seem almost black. The music puts a twist on your typical horror film music. The Panic Room leaves me with the impressions that even a steel framed door and four walls of concrete cannot always keep you safe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie by Jodie Foster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great movie and i will definitely watch it again.Jodie foster was casted really well. I don't know who else could play her. I was really shocked that Nicole Kidman played Stephans girlfriend on the phone.This movie was so cool. I wish that we had a panic room at our house. they seem so fun and are a great idea for people who live in a city where they have a lot of burglaries. Having a panic room was such a good idea for a movie.It was cool how the panic room was so dark but i hated it when the lights kept flickering it really hurt my eyes.In conclusion this movie rocks and i will watch it next time its on TV even though i own the DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another involving thriller from director David Fincher...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic Room Meg Altman (Jodie Foster), a divorced woman in her 30's and her daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart), are caught up in a cat-and-mouse game inside their new New York brownstone when three burglars come looking for a hidden cache of cash. Mother and daughter hide in the "panic room," a secret room designed for just such a purpose, but still end up fighting for their lives.While not as taut as 'Fight Club' or 'Se7en', 'Panic Room' (written by David Koepp) is still another involving thriller from director David Fincher. Getting back to basics, the filmmaker seems to delight in making the house appear to be gigantic, but at the same time contained, creating a claustrophobic feeling of dread that really brings you into the house with the characters. Jodie Foster gives a solid performance, and it is one of her best yet. The ending is a little flat, but you'll be too busy gazing at your chewed-off fingernails to notice.~ 8/10 ~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic, seat-of-your-pants, thriller movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it was aired on national TV last night. I think Kristen Stewart (who played Sara)was brilliant in Cold Creek Manor, and seeing that she starred in this film, was what attracted me to it. The film is about a mother (Meg Altman) and her daughter (Sara Altman) who buy an enormous townhouse, complete with working elevator and a full security PANIC ROOM, in Manhatten. However on the first night in the house, three armed robbers break in an attempt to steal a fortune which they think is theirs by rights. Unfortunately, Meg wakes up and realises what is happening. She and Sara only have one chance to survive. So the claustrophobic mother, and the diabetic daughter take refuge in the panic room. Sure, with four concrete walls, a reinforced steel door between them and the robbers, as well as monitors that allow them to see every room of the house, they seem pretty safe. But when they realise that the robbers are staying put, things start to go wrong. The Panic Room is more of a Prison Room. It gripped me the entire way through, it seemed so real, so possible, that I had real trouble sleeping afterwards!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning choice of wardrobe for Jodie Foster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, I just had to get that in there before I started.'Panic Room' is essentially a basic cat-and-mouse thriller with a decent premise, typically over-stylised by director David Fincher. Fincher's work is mostly enjoyable, and the end result looks polished and pristine, but sometimes you have to ask yourself exactly why he does things the way he does.When Jodie Foster and her daughter move into a new house, they must spend their first night in the panic room, a specially reinforced room built into the house to protect you and your family in the event of a break-in, as that is exactly what has happened - burglars, in the form of Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker, and Dwight Yoakam, who, incidentally, have come for the hidden millions in the panic room.Like I said, it looks good throughout, Fincher's trademark camera-work and effects and tricks on show nearly the whole time (shots moving through cup handles and cross sections of flooring), but what sets it above being just another run-of-the-mill thriller are the lead performances. Foster is excellent, as always, and the three intruders play brilliantly off one another. Yoakam injects a real creepiness to Raoul, Whitaker always the strong, level-headed Burnham, and Leto in frantic mode with a little hint of Tyler Durden as Junior (although he looks like he got Forest Whitaker's hairstylist).There are some good action set pieces and a tense moment here and there, but nothing that's going to have you on the edge of your seat. The movies suffers a little from predictability and a lack of pace, but the dramatic finale rounds it off well enough. A salute to the fact that a movie can be good through good performances, so why does David Fincher insist on drawing it out so he can add more clever camera tricks? Is it for us or is it for him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is there something wrong with me because I don't hate this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmmmm, after reading the comments on this movie I'm thinking I've seen a completely different movie than all the other people on IMDb who wrote a review about it. Especially Jodie Foster's performance seems to be a point of discussion. Personally I liked what I saw. I'm not saying it is the best, most shocking thriller ever, but it sure was able to keep my attention from the first minute to the last.It's about a woman who left her rich husband because he cheated on her with a B-rank model. Because she wants to take revenge on him, she buys a very big, nice house with his money (of course, that's how angry women are! Hahaha), where she will live with her daughter. There is even a 'panic room', a room where they can hide as soon as they are in some kind of trouble. During the first night that they stay there, some burglars, who are convinced that the house is still empty, pay them a visit, because somewhere in the house the former owner had hidden a lot of money.Don't expect any special effects, explosions or other kinds of special things that they like to put in today's movies. This is a thriller like it could have been made 30 or 40 years ago. Perhaps that's what bothered some viewers, but does that mean that this movie can't be good? Not in my opinion. Something else that might have bothered some of the viewers may be the fact that you don't get any images of the city or the surroundings. All the action happens in the house, and the biggest part of it in the confined space of the panic room itself. I guess this may be a perfect movie for the people who loved Phone Booth. It's more or less the same principle, but this time in a house and with a woman that you don't love to hate. Anyway, I don't care what other people think about this movie. Personally I liked to see Jodie Foster play this role and I think all the actors did a fine job. The script was good, despite some minor flaws and the director did a very good job. What else could you possibly want? I give this movie a well deserved 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thought "Panic Room" was pretty good, overall, but one of Fincher's lesser films. I enjoyed the movie-but I didn't know what the director wanted us to get. Should I feel sorry for the security guard? He only did what he did out of necessity. Right? I liked some of the comic-relief, but found it very out of place. I also like the roving camera passing through walls, staircase railings and what not. But I still come back to the point of like or not-like. I never bonded with any of his characters-especially Ms. Foster. I never felt she made the full commitment as an actor into her role. I expect more from an actress of her caliber. I'm waiting for your next movie, Mr. Fincher-I want more than cardboard cut-outs and stereotypical bandits.End of line...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best it could have been but will never be a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher has to be one of the most consistent directors working today. Every film he has directed has made me say "wow!" and Panic Room is no different. With all the twists and turns flying around movies these days it made a refreshing change to watch a film that didn't need a huge revelation half-way through. The film was entirely shot in one location with most of the action taking place between two adjacent rooms so it took great acting and storytelling to keep the excitement levels high.David Fincher knows when to use clever visual tricks and that is one of his greatest strengths. He knows when to go into slow motion (and have me jumping up and down, shouting at Jodie Foster to "Run!!!"), he knows when to fly around the house showing the bad guys' attempts to break in in one beautifully long take. He is a master of the camera and all of his films show it.Casting can sometimes let a movie down but this film flourished because of it. Everyone was perfectly suited in the roles. From Forest Whitaker's nice-bad-guy all the way to the random cop who suspects something is happening. Perfect!It falls short of top marks, not because of any real problems with the film, but because this film could never have been a masterpiece. No director or cast could have made it better than it was.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time you see this movie you think your heart might burst out of your chest, but by the second time, since you've already seen it, it's not quite as bad. Jodie Foster finally makes a come back after what seems like an entire decade since she's made a box-office smash, and is actually good in it, not like she isn't in any other movie she's ever made. The girl that played her daughter was a good choice. Not only was she good in the character she played, but she also looked and sounded (and in some ways acted) like Jodie Foster. Forest W. was good as usual and had a sympathetic kindness to his role. And Jared Leto was also very good in his part. You hate him so much, and that's usually a good thing when it comes to movies. I loved the writing styles of the writer, and I think that the plot was really well thought out and the ending was just as good as the beginning and the middle half of the film. The last scene of the movie however, was a bit disappointing, considering that it's so laid back compared to the rest of the film. I think that it's one of the better of intense dramas in the past decade, and should have gotten more publicity than it did.I give this movie an 8.5 out of 10. A really good flick to rent if you're not doing anything, and if you don't like scary horror movies, but still wanna get your heart jumped, then check this one out for sure!That's the end of my review.</fullReview>

The film relies more on pop and flash than on story development (thank goodness, since the story is threadbare) and it's gimmickry pays off well. It does rivet one's attention to the screen, but there were moments when I really wouldn't have minded the bad guys getting Foster's annoying daughter. Mediocre material made into a passably, fun (and unintentionally funny) thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fincher almost outdoes himself here, yet I noticed he gets mostly criticism from IMDB users. I think the reason is mainly the lack of emphasis on the narrative here, as compared to Fight Club, for instance. The visual aspect has a bigger role here. It is the house which is the main character of the movie, not Meg.I am similarly surprised that Whitaker's character is described as the 'good guy' by some users. Short attention span perhaps?

		<fullReview>Suspense and white knuckle stress. This thriller is about a mother(Jodie Foster) and her daughter(Kristen Stewart)being forced to hide in a fortified "safe room" when thieves break into their new spacious home. The intruders are played by Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam. Foster did nothing out of the ordinary besides show fear. The scene I liked the least is where Foster goes into her "little girl" persona when talking to the police at the front door. I really got a kick out of Yoakam who once again plays a ruthless bad ass. At times a little sluggish; and you have to feel for the estranged husband(Patrick Bauchau)who ends up a bloody pulp of a mess strapped to a chair. You really need to be in a dark mood to survive this one.</fullReview>

In this day and age, it's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't rely on flashy action sequences and contrived "climaxes" to generate tension. This movie was one of the smartest I've seen in recent memory. Sure, it was a bit predictable (I never thought the two main heroines wouldn't come out alive), but the tension generated by the cinematography, directing, and performances of the actors (which were outstanding) was much higher and more satisfying than most "thrillers" filmed lately. For those of you who were confused/upset/bored by "Panic Room", I suggest you stick to watching movies more in your intellectual range...like "Pearl Harbor" or any other dreck produced by Michael Bay... "Panic Room" = 9/10....easily....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm very happy to see Jodie Foster in this great thriller called 'Panic Room' and not in that stupid 'Silence of the Lambs'-sequel 'Hannibal'. There is more psychological suspense in this thriller than even 'Hannibal' could contribute. Jodie Foster did an incredible job. 9.5 out of 10 for edge-of-your-seat action, suspense, fantastic performances, and the last minute addition of Jodie Foster to play Meg Altman. I really don't think Nicole Kidman has the muscle or strength to pull of the psychical requirements of a movie like this (She had to bow out due to an injury from 'Moulin Rouge'). David Fincher is possibly the best director on this planet. All in all I can say 'Panic Room' is one of my favorite movies. It's better than 'Alien 3' and 'The Game', but not as good as 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club').</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Panic Room: 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher's Panic Room begins with an uber-cool opening credit sequence with the credits being superimposed onto buildings. They even have reflections and shadows. In this stylized thriller, the rest of the movie is also slick.Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) is a recent divorcee who is looking for a new house with her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart). They find a giant house, complete with "panic room". What is a panic room, you ask? It is a room engulfed in steel where you can hide and there is not way you can be gotten to. Since this is a movie, theives have to come on the first night that Meg and Sarah are in. And, of course, what they are looking for is in the panic room.Panic Room cannot be mistaken for an arthouse movie, or anything of the type. It is a perfect example of a Hollywood movie. Bumbling crooks, main female characters who look weak but inside are strong, teens who are the opposite. In fact, we don't even know that Sarah has diabetes until halfway through the movie. If screenwriter David Koepp had had some more time to make characters, then maybe I wouldn't have been so aback when she suddenly starts to have an attack.Panic Room doesn't slack on tense situations. Anytime when Meg or anyone had to dart out of the room for a quick second (in slo-mo, of course), then you feel like your heart is about ready to jump out of your chest. Camera work by Conrad Hall and Darius Khondji was exceptional. When they panned throughout the house, it may be unnecessary, but it still looks wicked cool. It doesn't rely on split-screens or quick cuts or half-second scenes, it just is smooth and graceful.Foster was pretty good as Meg, but she wasn't anything Oscar-worthy. I thought that Stewart was uneven as her daughter, her feelings were mixed and changed at the drop of a hat. The three criminals (Jared Leto, Dwight Yoakam, Forest Whitaker) were pretty good and their bickering looked like it wasn't staged. Many people have complained about the ending. I'm one of them. It seemed abrupt and unlikely, but it's a Hollywood movie. It doesn't have to be original. And the last scene at the bench was unnecessary, two minutes of added time. It was long enough already. I wished that they could have had the entire movie take place in the house and only a couple characters, that would have made it a more inviting premise.All in all, Panic Room is a very tense movie that pales on characters but still makes you be creeped out of your mind.My rating: 8/10Rated R for language and some violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadistic Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps you saw Fight Club and could appreciate the visceral intensity but were put off by its muddled message. Or maybe you saw Se7en and noticed the slick and grainy visual style, but couldn't handle the more grotesque aspects of that film. Or maybe you (like me) love everything Fincher's ever done and cannot wait to be once again welcomed into his world of paranoia, pathos, and amazing visuals. Well, no matter who you are, you need to see Panic Room.In Panic Room, David Fincher pulls out all the directing stops, every trick in his magic black bag of film wizradry and delivers on a simple, solid suspense story with none of the concept or pretense of his previous films. This one goes straight for the gut, fiendishly manipulating every standard suspense contrivance, mercilessly playing with any jangly nerve, and keeping you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.There is not one sour note in the whole film (with the exception of the possibly too Hollywood ending, but it still works). Every aspect of Fincher's technical mastery is on full display. His camera moves gracefully across every square inch of the house which becomes a prison for Jodie Foster and her daughter, and the three men who break in one night in search of the former owners hidden riches. In one amazing shot, Fincher moves from the fourth floor of the house where Foster and her daughter are sleeping soundly, all the way down to the first floor where we see the intruders beginning their break-in, throught the handle of a coffee pot, and then all the way BACK UP to the fourth floor where they finally succeed in getting in without the shot breaking once and sliding the whole time with the cool, slow, impartial grace of a cat burglar.The premise is simple: Foster and her daughter are locked in an impenetrable room in their home, along with the loot that the 3 bad guys are looking for. The bad guys want in, the good guys want them out of the house. The plot is really as simple as that, but in Fincher's hands it turns into a beautifully paranoid battle of wits. No time is wasted on anywhere and the suspense is instantly in high gear. The performances are all perfect, with characters fully developed in their first moments of screen time. You know who everyone is right away, with no time wasted on extraneous details, so all that's necessary is to sit and wait while the tension builds to the breaking point. It is a terribly effective tactic as it leaves the audience totally open to watch the sparks fly without miring them in sentimentality.Essentially, if you like suspense, see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Fincher's previous film; "Fight Club" offered something new and exiting to its audience. It was a critique, a statement not only about consumerist society - but about the state of masculinity. "The Panic Room" seems to me to be more about the entertainment value a thriller creates and forgets about the "message" it transcends.The stereotyping of the different characters makes this film quite predictable - which is a shame. It is a good film when looking away from these issues but the ending spoils the film completely. I am not going to go into details in order to not reveal the plot - but it must be said that I would have expected better from Fincher..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room is a brilliant piece of film making. Fincher's unique camera shots build tension from the start and keep it going at a frenetic pace to the climax. Foster is very believable as Meg, the mom who really cares for her diabetic daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart). Jared Leto, Forrest Whitaker, and Dwight Yoakum give convincing performances as slightly inept bad guys after millions stashed in the house. One of the key shots is a seemless camera to computer graphics to camera shot that starts in the upstairs bedroom, pulls back, down two floors, zooms through a coffee pot handle, pans and zooms through a keyhole and pulls back to 2 shot of the bad guys trying to get in the house. Another interesting shot involves an Close Up on Foster in bed with one of the bad guys, out of focus, in the back ground. The camera rotates to show Foster vertical and the bad guy horizontal. I rate this one high on intensity and camera work. Overall - 8.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start off, the beginning credits are awesome alone. That started off the movie well. I like how it gets really quick into the story. There are hardly ever any slow parts except for the beginning a little. I loved the camera work. The best camera work I've seen in any movie. Acting from everyone was excellent. The end of the move was also neat too. Great job!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Finchers Fight Club and Se7en so I figured this one would be at least good. Boy was I wrong... It was great. Besides two short scenes on the street and a few exterior and outlooking of the house Fincher pulls it off with only one set Jodie Fosters newly purchased house. The House has a "Panic Room" an amazingly safe room with 3 inch steel walls and seperate phone and ventilation lines. Sure enough people break in on her first night in the house. She and her daughter Sarah narrowly make it into the room and a siege of three thieves who by a small escrow miscalculation find Foster asleep like Goldilocks. Unfortunetly everything they want is in the Panic Room Everything they want is in the Panic Room. Of Course the weakness of every secruity system is the man who built it(Forest Whitaker) and he is among the three men that break in. Fincher was smart not to make the thieves international thieves that just haven't counted on Foster. The thieves often miss smart things they could do and seam to be a bigger opposition to themselves than Foster. A well known virtue of this film, the camera work was great I heard "How the hell they do that?" more than once. I will not spoil the end but I will suggest this in the greatest way I can it was a true nail biter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Home Alone - for adults!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admire David Fincher's work, have always like Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker, am a fan of the scary movie...but THIS I'm afraid just doesn't work on any level - except the staggering cinematography which is almost sufficient reason to see the flick alone.The film simply leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I wasn't "scared," or worse, entertained. As many have correctly commented, so much about the film is just plain stupid. Yeah, why WOULD Foster need a 3-storey mini brownstone mansion for just her and her daughter? After the trio of totally unsuited burglars "break in"...they make so much noise dragging their gear around and arguing, ANYBODY would have heard them long before Foster does. The first half of the flick plays exactly like an adult version of HOME ALONE...relying on the occasional laugh to sustain audience interest. The flick was totally brought down for me when Foster ignites the gas. The worst digitised fx I've ever seen and so idiotic (as if the two of them wouldn't have been totally crisped!) Cliched to pieces, hopelessly predictable and with one of the all time weak endings to a flick ever seen.....THE PANIC ROOM is not one to chase after.I also found the violence totally over the top and gratuitous. Sorry but I don't get off watching little girls being punched in the mouth and one of the most prolongued beatings I've ever not wanted to see! Michael Myers can do what he likes,. so can Jason...they're nice guys, I'm comfortable with them. This was extremely insensitive. Gotta say though Kristen Stewart as Foster's daughter Sarah, is the best thing in the movie (except for the photography!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jodie and her diabetic daughter close themselves off in a panic room when a trio of hoodlums break in for a hidden fortune in a safe. The problem: the safe is in the panic room.It's well-acted (especially by Jodie Foster and Jared Leto), well-directed (Fincher achieves some incredible traveling shots and shots between floors and walls) and purposefully dark--but it's just average.The plot is original but, other than that, it goes through the same motions any other genre picture would go through. I saw every single plot twist coming and the constant darkness and dim lighting really gets depressing after a while. Also I never felt any urgency for the people and their situation--I was always aware I was watching a movie. And I don't like it when movies put an innocent little girl in danger.It is somewhat worth seeing for Jodie alone (with all due respect, she's a better actor than director) but she's done better movies. Ditto for director Fincher. So, I can't really recommend it, but you could do worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Thriller with fantastic Special FX</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie this weekend and was positively surprised. Jodie Foster hasn't been in anything fantastic since "Nell" and it sure was a pleasure to see her on the big screen. The cinematography in this movie is outstanding and I especially enjoyed the very well done special effects which were used in a very subtle way since the whole movie plays in real time inside one big house. Placing cameras in tight spaces is not very easy, hence the need for some "virtual cameras" places in some incredibly realistic looking environments. It was so well done that you couldn't distinguish between life action and animated scenes. For instance, you see a very normal angle of the kitchen, but suddenly the camera takes you straight through the room past appliances and counter tops so close impossible for a "real" camera, and on to a door that then opens and one of the bad guys enters. Good stuff, go check it out. I'd give it 3 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First thing's first: Again, the credits in a David Fincher movie were awesome. I love how he always sets the stage with the credits and his attention to details (except for the "rain on the windshield" scene in Se7en) are second to none. As far as the rest of the movie went, the story was mediocre (not the worst neither), and probably, in my opinion, on par with The Game, but not better than Se7en &amp; Fight Club. I don't know, however, which director out there could have pulled off what Fincher did in Panic Room with such a setting to work with i.e. one house, one night, small cast etc...David Fincher did it, and I am willing to bet that he allowed himself this movie, not because the story was so wonderful, but because it was a great challange for him. I hope nobody claims that he did not pull it off, because the dead-spots in the movie were close to none--a very difficult feat with what he had to work with (very much the same with Fight Club where Fincher had TOO MUCH to work with, and he ended up pulling that off, as well). Therefore, don't blame the director on this one if it did not strike your fancy, there are too many other variables. Having said that, I will not say much more, because a lot of my fellow IMDB users have said multifarious things already, and have brought up many good points. Nevertheless, I will say that Jodi Foster, besides being a great actress in Panic Room, was looking pretty HOT in this movie (and I have never really thought she was all THAT--perhaps it was the nerd glasses that made her look so good). Dwight, "The Cowboy Singer," must have taken some acting lessons, for the man was pretty root-n-toot-n good in this one (a far cry from his bland acting in When Trumpets Fade. Enuff Said! I will be getting this movie on DVD for its eye-candy alone. Just watch David Fincher go down in movie history one of these days for his vision and contribution to the industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Fincher can always be relied on for well paced, visually interesting, darkly tantalizing entertainment; and David Koepp is a fine and versatile writer. It's no surprise, then, that "Panic Room" doesn't disappoint, but it hardly ranks with their best efforts to date. As in "Fight Club", Fincher's wall-dissolving camera tricks are pretty impressive. But they actually work against the tension in this story by placing the audience beyond the claustrophobic reality of the house. Similarly, Koepp's story premise and dialogue are good enough to keep you watching, but his plot offers few real surprises. Ultimately, it's the performances which save the day. Leto, Whittaker and Yoakam strike the perfect balance between incompetence and menace; and Jodie Foster manages to be maternal, terrified and fearless ? all at the same time. No wonder she has two Oscars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that guides the viewer through the movie. You are shown enough to figure elements out on your own--without being treated as stupid. Jodie Foster is wonderful, her terror and her love and fear for her daughter (who is also a terrific actress, I look forward to seeing her in more movies) make for a wide range of emotions and attitudes.The movie shifts gears several times, so the viewer never gets too comfortable or bored with a situation. David Fincher gives a whirlwind two hours that is heart-pounding (I didn't check my watch once, which generally implies the greatness of the movie). But after "Fight Club" I expect that out of him. I rank it as one of the year's best so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher delivers the goods with yet another stylish and riveting thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who's familiar with Fincher's work ("Alien 3"; "Seven"; "The Game"; and "Fight Club"), knows that his films aren't well-known for their simplicity. However, his latest release, "Panic Room", isn't what most would expect from him. Unlike his previous films, the plot of this one is considerably straight-forward. Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman who, as a single mom having recently settled a divorce with her wealthy husband, moves into an expensive four-story brownstone in the Upper West Side of Manhattan along with her 11-year-old daughter, Sarah. The brownstone looks to them like the ideal place to live - equipped with all the modern-day conviences. It even has a "panic room" that encases you behind a steel door in the event someone were to break in. Now that's protection!What they didn't expect though was that three burglars - Junior, Burnham, and Raoul - had come prepared to rob the house that night. They're looking to find a safe, one that the original owner of the house had kept hidden in the floor somewhere, that contains millions in bonds. They break inside, surprised to find the the new owners had already moved in. Meg wakes up and finds there are thieves in the house, and immediately runs to wake up her little girl. The mother and daughter quickly lock themselves up inside the panic room, narrowly escaping capture. Unfortunate for them, even though they're safe, the emergency phone with which to call the police is dead. And of course, as you may have guessed, the safe that these crooks are looking for happens to be inside in the panic room.Burnham, the burgular whom Forest Whitaker plays, built the house and knows every niche and cranny of the place. He informs Junior and Raoul that it is impossible for them to penetrate the steel door. He says that in order for them to get inside the panic room, they have got to somehow get the woman to come out. This incites a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse between Meg and the men who threaten the lives of both her and her little girl. Its all very intense."Panic Room" is somewhat different from David Fincher's other movies. According to the director, the film is a popcorn flick. "There are no great, overriding implications," he claims. "It's simply about survival."Even so, Fincher still manages to deliver the goods as usual - displaying the same stylish cinematography he showed in "Fight Club", as well as his knack for keeping people on the edge of their seat as he did with "Alien 3" and "Seven". Not only that, but the film also features a terrific and energetic performance from screen veteran, Jodie Foster. Altogether, I recommend this film to suspense fans who are looking to see something different for a change. This one is definitely worth a look. Star Rating: ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher misunderstood once again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard about "Panic Room" I was quite intrigued as to how this movie was going to include one of the most important, and consistently overlooked, aspects of David Fincher films. What I am referring to is his devotion to sending a strong message, which is usually a societal critique, within almost every film he has created.Maybe it's because I generally agree with his critiques, but I am surprised to see so few reviewers, both amateur and professional, overlooking the message of this film, and even some of his others. The NY Times seems to have completely missed it, as have several other critics who have argued "Panic Room" "lacks substance." This is also funny because the complaints some had of "Fight Club" was that it was pretentious, over the top, and intent on sending a message to the audience. So what does Fincher do? Actually panders to the critics (whether it was intentional or not is almost irrelevant) by creating a subtle psychological thriller that also sends a clear message about American society and values. But then it seems that these same critics completely miss it, thinking that this is more of a classic "what you see is what you get" thiller.Based upon Fincher's history, I found this VERY hard to believe, when I read some reviews. Then I saw it with my own eyes and once I thought about what he might be saying for one moment after leaving the theater it hit me.I don't think it is anyone's place to tell anyone what that message is, but I suggest to all those who have seen it, or even haven't, to examine the primary themes of the film, the character relationships, and their values, which were all played out in some key scenes. One being, in particular, the last camera shot in the grand finale, which I read someone here argue meant nothing. Well, in my opinion, if you saw that and believed it to posses no meaning, then I think you missed David Fincher's message. Unfortunately, a lot of us will likely miss it because Fincher's style and entertainment value is what they are seeing the movie for. The problem is he has consistently gone beyond that, but it usually falls upon deaf ears with the audience he attracts.Hopefully one day he will be remembered for his attempt in bringing social criticism and thought provocating scripts covered by conventional and pop appearing Hollywood film making. Until then most will likely think of him as a Hitchock disciple who incorperates a lot of style and tricky camerawork (all of which are evident here, like his patented camera movement through walls and other solid objects) to gain his audience. There is more there...just look a little harder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Panic room is a really good film, but it could have been great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers Ahead (mostly minor)*I just went to see Panic Room, and I have mixed feelings about it. The trailer definitely caught my attention as something unique, and though only in one location, I knew that David Fincher, director of Fight Club and The Game would deliver. The good news is, on most levels, he does.First off is his incredible use of direction. I have never seen such fancy camera work in a film; the camera will squeak through tiny openings and snake around from one room of the house to another within a single shot. Definitely impressive, and definitely eye candy. Then we find Jodie Foster and her Daughter, both played very believably forced to seek refuge in the house's panic room when a trio of criminals show up. I thought that the criminals were the most interesting aspect of the film, though a tad underdeveloped and way cliched (The type of people you might know in real life that would actually be willing to rob a house, yet exagerated in an over the top kinda way). There were just too many times where they would do things that people in real life would never do. One of which is at the beginning when one of the three criminals, after establishing to the audience that they have had no prior past together until now, asks for Dwight Yoakam's handgun (the only one who brought one) and he nonchalantly hands it to him. Why would a professional hand over his gun to someone he doesn't know, let alone an obvious amateur? Yes, scenes like this really are irrelevant to the story, yet will bother the best of us to no end when we see them. Still, the criminals are played very well. Forest Whitaker was superb as Burnham, the conscientious safe cracker with a heart, and Dwight Yoakam was fantastic, as always, as the cold and mostly calm Raoul, a mysterious member of the trio whose screen presence expresses his adherence to violence and mayhem more than the limited dialogue he has at the beginning. Definitely the most interesting of the three. Jared Leto was good as Junior, yet his character got annoying very quickly (especially since he demanded that he be in charge and ended up making a complete idiot of himself on many occasions in the film). The suspense is there, not necessarily enough to make you scared, but enough to hold your attention. The ending though is very predictable and rather empty, in my opinion. I feel there could have been more to the ending, something profound to stick with you as you leave the theater (I was also hoping the exact opposite would have happened to Burnham that did. He did have a good side, you know). Overall, I enjoyed this film, it was good for what it was, but it could have been great. This is one of those films that doesn't receive a 9 or 10 for a bad script or bad acting since both were good, but because there is potential for so much more that just isn't there. A solid 8 for amazing camera work, great acting and for overall entertainment value. Go see it, you'll enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcockian thrill-ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director David Fincher (SE7EN, FIGHT CLUB) and screenwriter David Koepp (MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE and two of the JURASSIC PARK films) created this suspenseful thriller set in a brownstone in New York City, which brings to mind the films of Alfred Hitchcock (and reminiscent, in some scenes, of Stanley Kubrick). Jodie Foster shows brilliance in her role as recent divorcee Meg Altman, who moves into the 19th-century, four-story (with basement) townhouse with her teen daughter, Sarah (an impressive Kristen Stewart). Both are believable in their roles, and their relationship as mother and daughter is convincing, both simmering with hatred because of the straying Mr. (Stephen) Altman (Patrick Bauchau), a pharmaceutical industrialist.The first five to ten minutes are especially Hitchcockian. The credits are displayed as floating white letters before various New York City buildings and skyscrapers, and Ann Magnuson, as Meg's friend Lydia, who finds her the brownstone, and Ian Buchanan, as the realtor, ham it up to perfection in true Hitchcock ambiance. The house's previous owner was an eccentric millionaire; the house, though, is large enough for two families, and comes equipped with an elevator, a large staircase located in the center of the room, a fireplace on each floor, and, especially, a large steel-encased security room known as the "panic room," complete with a vault-like, motion-sensitive door, televisions for security cameras that observe every floor of the house, and food, water, and other supplies. Also in this room (unbeknownst to the audience for the first third of the film) is something--a *LOT* of something--that someone wants.[*SPOILERS* AHEAD]"Someone" comes in the form of three burglars, two of which have a history with the house's former occupant: a conniving, corn-rowed punk (and the millionaire's heir), Junior (Jared Leto, very late of TV's MY SO-CALLED LIFE); the designer of the panic room, a disillusioned man played with startling conviction by Forest Whitaker; and an oft-masked, mysterious psychopath named Raoul (in the film's best performance, country &amp; western crooner Dwight Yoakam). The film boasts much needed humor amid the suspense, and the CGI special effects by Fincher and crew (used previously in FIGHT CLUB) fit, especially with a super-long "single" shot that introduces the thieves of the night. You wonder halfway through the film just how can Meg and Sarah outwit the three men, and when they do (in various ways), it's all plausible. No details are left hanging, and when an obvious goof by the men (hint: involving the "eyes") is realized by the audience, it's mentioned (by Raoul of all people) in such a way that it's laughable.PANIC ROOM is definitely the suspense thriller of the year, if not THE FILM of the year. Much owed to Hitchcock for inspiring Fincher in this one, and to all the exceptional performances (yes, even the seemingly inept New York cops who stop by during the night, played by Paul Schulze and Mel Rodriguez, are credible and even memorable in their encounter with Meg). Look for SE7EN screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker as the "sleepy neighbor." 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing movie once again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew this movie was coming up in last night's sneak preview and I was eager to see it, knowing it was directed by David Fincher, whom has made beauties such as 'Se7en', 'The Game' and 'Fight Club'. And I must say: the movie didn't let me down! It is a solid story about a mother and daughter spending the first night in their new house. A house that isn't really something out of the ordinary except for one peculiar room: a panic room, used in cases of emergency to seek shelter in. It has everything on the inside to keep one alive: survival goods, cameras with views on every angle in the house, a separate phoneline and ventilation system, plus steel walls and a steel door. On that first night three men are breaking in and the mother and daughter seek refuge in the panic room with no means to get out.. The movie is basically a dark thriller which has its funny moments, set in just this one house, delivered by a well-chosen cast.The camerawork is simply fantastic once again: through floors, inside keyholes, etc. David Fincher is a true master when it comes to innovative handling of a camera. Plus his choice of colors, entourage and timing is superb.All in all: a very nice, straightforward thriller [no plot twists at the end or whatever] revolving around an intriguing concept: a room that no one can get in to or out of..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I loved this movie! Jodie Foster once again proved she is a very powerful actress, and the rest of the crew did great! I only had one complaint in this movie. I'll explain later.The cinematography in this movie was excellent. Conrad Hall does an excellent job of creating a moody atmosphere with the lighting and camera tricks. I especially liked how he made the camera "fly" in and around the house, very nice. (When you see the shot of the burglars first entering the house, you'll see what I mean.)Oscar worthy work, in my opinion.Again Howard Shore provides a great score, almost reminiscent of his work for "The Cell." No need to say more here.The screenplay by David Koepp was great. The story has been done before: a burglary that turns into a cat-and-mouse game with a twist: the use of a panic room. You'd think that with this tried format, the story would be rather boring, but with Hall's camera work, Shore's score (hey that rhymes!) and Koepp's script, this is a VERY intense piece of work. Which brings me to my complaint.The ads for the movie proclaim a movie that will make you jump out of your seat. I did not jump out of my seat; in fact, I didn't even jerk back in my seat. I was hyped for something that wasn't there. Don't get me wrong, the movie/story is great, but just not scary, and that was what I was looking from this movie: to be scared. Although, my heart was going pretty fast towards the end and a few moments in between.So if you're looking for a good movie to take your girlfriend/boyfriend/fiancee/wife/husband/best friend to, go see Panic Room. You will not be disappointed all that much. Just sit back and enjoy the ride!9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jodie Foster has done it again, a star role in another intense thriller. Dealing with her recent separation, Meg and her daughter purchase a plush home in New York. This four-story home is a complete package deal, combining the modern conveniences of its own elevator with the door prop locks of yester year. A panic room is another luxury, with TVs hooked up to the home security system, a phone that is not hooked to the main line of the house, and a steel door with motion sensors.Just before going to sleep, Meg disables her high tech security system, allowing the intruders easy access. She is able to get her daughter and flee to the panic room. And realizes she forgot to have the "other" phone line hooked up. After futile attempts via the intercom to convince the intruders to leave, they tell her the only thing they want is inside the panic room. The story unfolds, will the intruders find a way into the panic room, how long can the girls last in the panic room, what exactly is it the intruders want?This movie is edge of your seat, covering your eyes, peaking in-between your fingers, and not wanting to miss what will happen next. Simply put, not a horror flick but a great suspense movie. Go see it for yourself.</fullReview>

Forrest Whittaker is also great playing the more sympathetic of the criminals who break into the house.

The tracking shots are good and help build the psychological drama of the film.In the end, the movie failed for me because of one small point that it is hard to tell without giving away much of the film. The criminals fail to do one incredibly simple thing to make their lives easier simply to allow the criminals and the captives to communicate.I still give this movie 7 of 10 because of the fear that Fincher creates. If the criminals had been smarter, it could have been a 10, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not to lessen the quality of any other part of this film, but the best part is truly the directing by David Fincher. His unique camera use of one continuous shot, even when changing floors, helps make him one of todays more original directors. He creates his own identifiable style so you KNOW when you are watching a David Fincher film. The story does seem a little slow moving, but it really is necessary since their (the three men who break into the house) original plan was disrupted by the presence of Jodie Foster's character having moved into the house, so naturally they had to think as events occur. And of course Jodie's reaction wouldn't be planned so she wouldn't be prepared in three seconds. The casting was excellent. Dwight Yokam was very creepy and evil, while Forrest Whitaker draws some amounts of sympathy from you. Jared Leto plays off his part very well also, and the three together have a nice blend of chemistry and detestment for each other, that, at some point makes you laugh a little. It's filled with plenty of surprises that make it a great thriller. I saw it in a packed theatre which I think has the best effect so you can feel the tension of the audience in the air. And what an incredible house! Perfect setting for this film, which in itself is a great character, I'm sure that was the plan though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Panic Room is everything I watch movies for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Panic Room this weekend and I liked it. David Fincher rocks. I would even say he has a unique vision unto Hitchcock for the 21st century. His movies include Se7en, The Game, and Fight Club. All excellent movies.I almost hate to say this, but the opening titles to Panic Room are one of the best parts of the film. A revolutionary use of typography, computer generated graphics, and beautiful photography of Manhattan is used to create eye-popping, 3-D titles aligned to the photographic perspectives of New York buildings. After this, Fincher proceeds to make camera moves through a house that know no bounds. Some of the coolest camera shots I've ever seen.Panic Room is a tightly wound thriller that kept my undivded attention for the duration and made me jump, wince, and laught in several spots. Jody Foster's performance is excellent. Forest Whitaker plays a burglar one can almost sympathize with and you won't believe Dwight Yoakam as Raoul. Panic Room is everything I watch movies for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Panic Room" is a pretty good thriller, but disappointing as a David Fincher film. Any number of directors could have done this. I can't say that about Fincher's previous three films, which all seemed to need the dark and innovative visual style he brought to them. His latest has moments with the feel of a Fincher film, as if another director tried his hand at a Fincher film. But even sub-par work by Fincher is better than almost anything else out there. First-time DP Conrad W. Hall (Conrad L's son) shares cinematography credit with Fincher regular Darius Khondji, which might have been the difference.What makes "Panic Room" tick is the script by David Koepp. This is an example of a film that survives on its premise, in the way it makes use of its location and the situations that location puts the characters in. The script falls short, however, on characters. Meg (Jodie Foster) has feelings and a past life, seemingly, but never takes on more than your basic celluloid heroin/everywoman persona. Let's just say that Koepp tries hard with her, but doesn't succeed. The film should be her story but the film's construction doesn't allow it. For instance when she enters the panic room for the first time and is closed in, we find out that she has a phobia about small spaces (go figure). She's able to overcome that in order to battle her home's invaders-the only development her character gets. In a way, Burnham (Forest Whitaker), is the focus of this story. He's the one who has to make the tough choices, to do the thinking, to do the most changing. Whitaker's is also the finest performance in this. Not surprising. Even that cop who presses Meg to "give him a signal" seemed to contain more depth than Meg."Panic Room" has one of those great premises that begs to be utilized to its fullest. Koepp and Fincher go a long way toward succeeding. There was a great risk of having to rely too much on coincidence, but the script is cunning enough to get by this. Anyone who's seen the trailer (the known world, surely) knows that a woman and her daughter lock themselves into their new home's ?panic room' when some violent men break in, only to find that all these men came for is IN THERE. Making the panic room both the womens' safe haven AND the reason the burglars are there could make some kind of ?best movie ideas of all time' list. Wisely, the film's creators know enough to just let this be what kicks things off.Fincher and co. don't go in a direction that I thought they would, which probably just means they're smarter than I am: Eventually we know Meg and Sarah are going to have to leave the panic room. When they do, I thought the idea would be to give a heightened sense of their vulnerability-but turn the tables. The invaders finally get them out, only to find they wish they had not when the girls fight back. The film does play this card to a certain extent, but you never get a sense that over the course of the story, the panic room has begun to protect the invaders, not the tenants. What we end up seeing is your standard, overly violent, bloody, couldn't-think-of-something-better thriller ending.The major downfall of "Panic Room" is that it's not scary. There's a lot of nice cinematic tension, but no 'jolts' to make you clutch the elbow rest. But then, this is not horror. If you want scary, rent "Se7en."Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher finally gets it right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Am I the only guy that has really disliked every David Fincher film to date. I've seen them all. Alien 3- by far the worst of the series.(I loved Alien Resurrection.) Seven- not too bad, but so so bleak. The Game-worst Michael Douglas film ever. Fight Club- Never has a film begun so promising and ended up so terrible. Think I was loving the first half. Panic Room- From the terrific opening credits to the last frame, I loved it. Yeah it's one of those movies where the characters have to do a whole lot of implausible things to move it along, but man it moves. And credit must be given to Fincher as well as the terrific cast. Howard Shore's score is perfect. See it in the theatres if you get a chance. I think it will lose a lot of it's impact on the home screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room had almost everything David Fincher has in his movies. The cast did a great job and the writing was subtle,yet excellent, which is what you would expect from David Koepp. Jodie Foster portrayal of a nervous, quiet, almost paranoid mother, was very believable. She has always done a great job in her films and this one is no exception. Dwight Yoakam, Jared Leto, and Forest Whitaker all did a great job in the film. The lighting and photography for the flick was superb except that David Fincher is relying a little too much on his tricky motion camera work that was done so well in Fight Club. I felt this movie had a little too much of that. The movie was a simple thriller that kept me entertained. I was worried what the director was going to do next to keep the pace going but the story worked it out. The burglars kept the movie very entertaining because they seemed to be a bunch of bungling idiots who really didn't think this plan through. The ending didn't have David Fincher's twists and turns but it was good. All in all a very good movie to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been looking forward to this movie for sometime as I am a big David Fincher fan, and I was not disappointed. This movie is packed with suspense and is intense when it gets right down to it. Fincher wastes no time in getting the story moving and pulling you in. Jodie Foster does an outstanding job and really brings a lot to the movie. The movie itself doesn't sound like it would be enough of a story to last two hours, but it is carried out perfectly the way that only David could do. One of the best movies of the year, a must see.</fullReview>

The three buffoons want to get into the panic room, which Meg(Jodi Foster) and Sarah Altman(Kristen Stewart). One might think that premise would become dull after the first 20 minutes, but interesting camera shots due to the directing of David Fincher(also director of Fight Club), extremely good acting by Jodi Foster, and the comic relief of bad-guy criminals, the film remained interesting all the way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Characters in the movie especially Forest Whitaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts off with a house tour and then moves slowly up like the first hill of a roller coaster. Next it really gets moving. Jodie Foster ( "Contact", "Silence of the Lambs") and (Kristen Stewart) play mother and daughter. Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman a newly divorced parent. They seem to have a good relationship. The villains in the movie are Jared Leto ("Switchback", "American Psycho") and Dwight Yoakam (Sling Blade". Dwight Yoakam is a little psychotc to put it lightly and Jared Leto's character is a little over the top and crazy. When he panics it is sort of funny. Forest Whitaker "Ghost Dog: the Way of the Samarai" is part of the crew but he seems like the man with a "heart" throughout this thriller. The cinematography was great and even though this is classified as a thriller it had a sppoky vibe to it. It really almost gave the feel of a horror picture. There is some violent scenes but everything seemed pretty realistic. I would rank this as my third favorite David Fincher Picture . My favorite being "Fight Club" then Seven. I am also a fan of the game. So this being my third favorite is a good thing! Its very watchable and different from most movies i have watched lately. GO SEE IT!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable, if somewhat disappointing thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fincher's "Seven" and "Fight Club" were masterpieces in my opinion, so I was enthusiastic to see his latest, "Panic Room." Unfortunately, I am not so enthusiastic about recommending it to others. It is definitely signature style, David Fincher, but it appears as if Hollywood script doctors got ahold of this otherwise excellent movie.To start with, it has all the usual Fincher direction. As a telephone call is placed, you get the camera moving along with the 'pulse' through the phone wires. As a key is inserted in a lock, you are treated to the same perspective as the key. All of this is signature Fincher (see Fight Club's opening sequence if you don't know what I mean). Visually, it is an excellent film. Fincher deserves the usual credit for direction and casting. The actors portray real emotions on screen. Jodie Foster does an excellent job of emoting as a mother, and Forest Whitaker's concern for life comes across colorful conflict.Unfortunately, the writing withers. A sudden surprise illness of the daughter, Kristen Stewart, seems too scripted to be believable. Likewise with appearance of police officers, and the ludicrous dialogue in the '911' call for help. Why do script doctors, writers, and other Hollywood parasites continue to churn out carnage?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So far, David Fincher has made 5 movies.He started with Alien3, then moved on to the excellent 7even. With The Game he showed us a great story, but the ending was too happy to accompany the film.Fight Club brought us back to the gritty with an ending that wasn't happy, but wasn't sad.In Panic Room, he gives us nearly 2 hours of seat gripping, nearly over bearing, suspense, but the last two minutes makes us wonder who slapped it on there.Don't let that stop you from seeing it. It's not THAT bad. The movie twists and turns in directions that you'd not see coming, and better yet, while watching, you don't even TRY to think where it's going. It grabs you and takes you for a ride.The only negative comment I really have to make is the fairly ambiguous ending. It leaves things unanswered. Not in a good way like Fight Club where you want to know what will happen next, but in a way that makes you think... so what DID happen?Everyone is superb in this film, Foster, Whitiker, Leto, and yes, Dwight Yoakam. He portrays a character that you can't hate any more. It's just not possible.I give the film an 8/10 Better that what it needed to be to be a good suspense film, but lacking in how much story there is. The concept does limit us to minimal characters and only 1 setting. But, definitely a good film to see and enjoy.</fullReview>

When I did that and focused on just how the story developed I think I got more out of it. Jodie Foster is good, I don't think its the movie that allows her to show off her range of acting ability. Nonetheless, I can't complain. Forest Whittaker's character is so cliche as a mild hearted thief that I just couldn't even get mad at the writers, I let it go. Is Jared Leto supposed to be this stupid? Oh well, overall, I say acting was balanced out: certain weak moments were forgotten during the intense scenes. I gave it a 7 because I didn't feel that anxiety, that sense of doom, that uncomfortable feeling I associate with psychological thrillers. Or rather, that feeling was involuntary quite rarely. There were parts where I knew it was expected, where I knew what was the director's and writer's intended effect, but knowing and feeling are two different things. But I absolutely LOVED the way scenes were shot, the camera angles and movements, my praises for that. My recommendation, SEE IT, but leave your expectations at the door.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another success for David Fincher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic Room is a wonderful piece of film-making, a pure thriller. Almost the entire film takes place inside of one house, in a near real-time unfolding of events. Fincher takes us on a modern-day Hitchcock ride, building suspense at every turn. With obvious inspiration from "Rear Window", the film is a joy to watch, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acting is top-notch, Jodie Foster is great, Jared Leto turns in a performance above anything he's done to date. Forrest Whittaker is magnificent, building his character as much by his actions as by his silence. And Dwight Yoakam is the most surprising, entirely unrecognizable, and one of the most terrifying characters seen on screen in a while--pure coldness. All in all, the acting and directing make this movie subtly disturbing, unlike any suspense film we've seen in a while, from the visually stunning opening credits to the morally ambiguous ending. It all combines to more than make up for minor shortcomings in the script--tacked on developments to hastily add more suspense.In short, it's worth watching. Five characters, one house, two hours, and constant thrills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you suspense, you'll like this movie a lot. All of the characters were pretty credible. Perhaps the only aspect that didn't seem credible was that the burglars would choose to strike when they realized that Jodie Foster and daughter were home (as opposed to waiting for them go out the next morning, perhaps). In a way, I found this movie to be reminiscent of the 1967 Audrey Hepburn flick, "Wait Until Dark". The two movies share the following similarities: NYC setting; a trio of bad guys infiltrating the home of an arguably helpless woman; the trio of bad guys looking for something in the woman's home that the woman doesn't know is there; one of the trio of criminals appearing to be more sympathetic than the others (Richard Crenna as "Mike Tallman" and Forrest Whitaker as "Burnham"; and a young girl who helps the adult female main character. There are probably other similarities that I'm overlooking. Overall, this was a very good movie.</fullReview>

I'm not sure whether a moviegoer would get anything new out of it watching it twice. It's not that complicated. The acting by most is first-rate (we're talking Jodie Foster, Jared Leto, and Forest Whitaker here. Dwight, don't quit your day job). Kristen does a good job as Jodie's daughter. Most all of the plot "twists" are predictable. What holds the viewer is the skill of the actors and the director. Sometimes when a movie is put together well, it works, even if we're thinking 15 minutes ahead and guessing right every time. Should you see it? I would say it's worth a matinee ticket.

		<fullReview>I find it is so difficult to be entertained these days. However, this movie had me captivated for two hours. There was never a dull moment throughout the entire movie, which really impressed me. Usually, there's at least a momentary lull which I tend to use as a bathroom break. But Panic Room kept me in my seat throughout. Jodie Foster is marvelous in this movie. Nicole Kidman was originally cast for this role, and though I love her work, Jodie Foster was ideal as Meg Altman. She is as strong and powerful as she was in Silence of the Lambs, which is her definitive work. She empowers women in almost every role she takes and Panic Room is no different. Kristen Stewart plays her daughter, Sarah. Take watch of her - she's definately up and coming. I was convinced that she was Sarah Altman - stone on the outside, fragile inside and afflicted with life-threatening diabetes. Forrest Whitaker was also excellent as Burnham - the kind hearted safe-breaker. I was hoping it would turn out a little differently for him than we assume it had to. I haven't seen Jared Leto as a character I actually liked, and unfortunately, Panic Room was no different. Although he's attractive, he just doesn't have the skills as an actor that I would like to see in such a major box office movie. He plays Junior - the money-grubbing grandson of a very rich man who has died; also the mastermind behind the botched plot to rob a supposedly empty house. I will give him credit for playing this role very well - I just don't respect him as a serious actor.I was surprised that the movie started out so quickly - pulling us in almost immediately. I loved that they didn't drone on about who they were and what kind of lives they were leading. I don't know if it was the screenplay or the direction, but I felt it was an outstanding idea to just show the audience who they were through various objects (insulin in the tiny fridge) and short phrases (Sarah: "F-him. F-her." telling us her father has had an affair). This, I think, ensures that we pay attention to the characters' surroundings, which is very important. And also that we listen to what they say. Their facial expressions, body language and tone of voice lets the audience know exactly who they are - and that Jodie Foster is not going to let them win.In any case, Panic Room is a beautifully written and superbly performed movie and sure to be a major box office smash. I highly recommend Panic Room as a must-see for 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this at a sneak-preview. When the (very stylish) opening credits appeared I was hoping this to be yet another Fincher classic, not that it's a bad movie or anything, but I came out of the movie slightly disappointed. It is all photographed beautifully and Foster does a good job, but the problem is it's just not exciting, it's all very predictable and Forest Whitaker in the role of one of the the bad guys? I didn't buy that at all, Jared Leto plays the dumb crook and Dwight Yoakam is the only one that's remotely scary. This is I feel the main problem with the film: it's simply not very exciting and the ending is too predictableIt seems that Fincher wanted to make a film that would appeal to the general public and in that he has definitely succeeded: this is a film that seems to follow the Hollywood guidelines perfectly, there's nothing wrong with that, but It's a shame, because Fincher can do much better than this, but let's just hope that for his next film he goes experimental again like he did with Fight Club(to excellent results)*** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing to panic about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge David Fincher fan, and if you like his work, this movie doesn't disappoint. By no means flawless, Panic Room is a solid effort that's definitely worth checking out.The cast is fitting for the most part, I had my convictions against Jodie Foster in this role, but after viewing it I must say she did a good job. The three men who break into the house hold just as big a role also. They provide a good amount of humor at times (as do Jodie and Kristen Stewart, who plays the daughter role fairly well), and are easy to watch on screen. The movie itself moves along pretty quickly, and doesn't have very many dull moments.The standout point is by far David Fincher's incredible camera angles and techniques. If you were a fan of Fight Club's tracking shots that penetrate walls and buildings, and follow objects as they twist and turn (like the apartment explosion scene) then this movie will impress. Towards the beginning, it's absolutely full of them. This movie also holds some very intriguing action scenes that are executed well, though sometimes exaggerated in terms of reality (you'll see what I mean). As far as being suspenseful, at times Panic Room truly pulls of suspense.Overall, the acting is perfectly watchable, and the humor is actually very funny sometimes. If you can look past the mundane plot, the script is actually pretty refreshing in the way its handled. I personally think it falls apart near the end, and the ending itself left me kind of empty. But hey, you might like it. As a whole however, I'd say it's worth a look. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie a few hours ago and LOVED it. I go to the movies all the time and this was my favorite movie in years. It may be my favorite movie since American Beauty. David Fincher is a genius. His camera work is beautiful. There were "wow's" from the audience as the camera went through a keyhole or a coffee pot. The scenes in the elevator when the wall disappears is wonderful. The plot is not that complicated, but this is one instance where "the criminal with a heart" is successfully pulled off by Forrest Whitaker.Jodie Foster makes a triumphant return to the big screen in this movie. Being a Nicole Kidman fan, I was upset to hear of her departure from this movie. However, Jodie was wonderful. The entire cast was wonderful.ONE FINAL NOTE: COMIC RELIEF --- Some of you may remember this term from high school english and this film is a perfect example of it. It is used perfectly throughout to relieve tension. Without it, the film would have been overbearing.SEE IT AND BUY IT WHEN AVAILABLE!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much deeper than the previews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this mostly because its director did "Fight Club," which I thought was terrific. This film's previews made it look like a scare-you-to-death drama about expensive real estate: a multimillion dollar NYC townhouse. (Yawn) In fact it's about a lot more. It gives you time to think, and the script is great. This film's done tightly, intelligently, and totally grippingly. It's agonizing in places, and it's plenty violent, too. Like "Fight Club," the story asks some questions about violence, and about what hurts the most.Foster plays a soon-to-be-ex-wife - and there's plenty of food for thought right there. She has a daughter, around twelve, who's terrific in her role. Forrest Whittaker as usual is complex, in complete control - and utterly successful. The story is not what I expected. There are some shots that left me breathless, and they do not depend on violence to make their point. There were young teenagers in the theater with their parents, and they seemed to enjoy it, too. A smart, great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it is so difficult to be entertained these days. However, this movie had me captivated for two hours. There was never a dull moment throughout the entire movie, which really impressed me. Usually, there's at least a momentary lull which I tend to use as a bathroom break. But Panic Room kept me in my seat throughout. Jodie Foster is marvelous in this movie. Nicole Kidman was originally cast for this role, and though I love her work, Jodie Foster was ideal as Meg Altman. She is as strong and powerful as she was in Silence of the Lambs, which is her definitive work. She empowers women in almost every role she takes and Panic Room is no different. Kristen Stewart plays her daughter, Sarah. Take watch of her - she's definately up and coming. I was convinced that she was Sarah Altman - stone on the outside, fragile inside and afflicted with life-threatening diabetes. Forrest Whitaker was also excellent as Burnham - the kind hearted safe-breaker. I was hoping it would turn out a little differently for him than we assume it had to. I haven't seen Jared Leto as a character I actually liked, and unfortunately, Panic Room was no different. Although he's attractive, he just doesn't have the skills as an actor that I would like to see in such a major box office movie. He plays Junior - the money-grubbing grandson of a very rich man who has died; also the mastermind behind the botched plot to rob a supposedly empty house.

I had set my goals pretty high for The Panic Room and guess what, every goal was answered and then some. The camera work in this film is phenomenal. The camera takes us everywhere, through keyholes, coffee handles, stair banisters, etc. The acting was also very good. Jodie Foster shows she can still act with a very versatile performance. Her daughter, Kristen Stewart, is also good, which surprised me. Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam supply great characters outside of the panic room allowing the audience to really get a feel of who they are. All in all I recommend this movie to everyone. It's supposed to be a thriller and it definitely is.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taut action thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fincher has made for yet another reason to give pause while walking past the usually mundane action/thriller section at the video store. Certainly not as complex as Seven, and without the social commentary of Fight Club, Panic Room is just a good, old fashioned, tension filled game of thrilling cat and mouse. Most films of this sort have plot holes big enough to drive trucks through. You find yourself hating the protagonists for being so stupid as to miss the obvious way out of the situation, or the writer/director for thinking the audience is so stupid as to not see the obvious way out. Fincher and Koepp cover all their bases, at least that I saw. There is only one thing I saw that they didn't do at first, and it was completely understandable that they forgot about it in their panic...and they DO get to it, just not right off the bat. (Those who've seen the movie know what I mean, for the rest of you I won't clue you in)Don't look for subtext or deeper social significance, it's not there, though I did like the gradations of "badness" among the "bad guys" which lent a little bit of moral ambiguity to the proceedings. Fincher is unapologetic in his gleeful pursuit of the simple goal of scaring the pants off us. And when it's done this well, that's enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, how did it cost 48 million dollars to make this piece of garbage? I can only remember one or two movies in my life where I felt so uninterested and bored. Honestly the only thing that sticks in my mind about the movie is the opening credits - where the 1 star comes from. Drama: 0%, Suspense: 0%. The only emotional reaction I had in the movie was rolling my eyes a few times at how silly it was. I must admit that I like FW as an actor but even in this movie it seems he was miscast. The crooks are running around like the keystone cops - was this some kind of attempt at comedy? I really really wish I could have my 2 hours back to watch my lawn grow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Panic Room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director David Fincher (Alien?, Se7en, Fight Club) this is a chilling, suspenseful and quite gripping film about two people's struggle to get out of a room and the other people's struggle to get in. Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) have moved into a large new house with everything they need, an elevator, a lot of space, and what appears to be like a safe. This safe was known as the Panic Room to the previous owners, and right they were. Just a couple of days later some criminals lead by Burnham (the great Forest Whitaker) break into the house and have Meg and Sarah locking themselves in the Panic Room. Now they are trying everything they can to get help, and the criminals are trying everything they can to get to the Panic Room, for the money. It does slow slightly towards the concluding scenes, when Foster is out the Panic Room, but it is still a cool film. Good!</fullReview>

After all, it's Jodie Foster who I want to see. This is a kind of movie you only wish to see because of the leading character. The other roles weren't really interesting. This one really got me at the edge of my seat. I can't wait to see more of this. I give it a 10/10. It really gave me a claustrophobic feeling seen the fact that the entire story took place in the house. Jodie Foster still rules, that's for sure. I can't wait until her next movie comes out.Yes, this was a good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the years best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've already seen this movie twice because of how good it was. Jodie Foster has done it again. This movie wastes no time and quickly rushes into the main theme. By the end of the first ten minutes of the movie, the three intruders (Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam) are entering the house. When they do, Meg Altman (Foster) and her daughter (Kristen Stewart) head to their panic room for safety. But safe it is not, when they find out that what the three intruders want is hidden in that very room. And this leads to many problems. The only thing that bothered me was that both times I went and saw it, i had to sit in the second row from the screen. And as if that weren't bad enough, both times I had to be seated next to the two gabby eight-teen year olds who wouldn't shut up. And, I don't know why, but it got slightly annoying to hear some people laughing. I mean, yeah, there were some funny moments (not very many), but when people begin laughing at a guy screaming at a surveillance camera when he's extremelly p.o.'ed is just annoying. But, anyway, back to the movie itself. If you haven't seen this movie, yet, see it! See it while its still in theaters. Its definetly worth it. PANIC ROOM is one of the years best so far. The other one I'm looking forward to being FRAILTY. I will most definetly buy this movie when it comes out for sale. 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not quite as good as "Wait Until Dark," but it reminds me of that movie.Jodie Foster is good -- at least as good as this somewhat limited role permits. Forest Whitaker gives his usual excellent performance, although you've seen him play this same essential character elsewhere. The really interesting performance for a relative newcomer is from Kristen Stewart. Dwight Yoakum also makes a pretty doggone good bad guy.I give it a "5," but I think that is a pretty good grade for a movie that is entertaining but not enduring. (Only the very best get higher from me.) Overall, I think it is a pretty watchable firm, especially in view of the overall poor crop of films in 2002 to date. It is probably worth the extra $4 to $5 to see this one on the big screen -- lots of the filmmaker's work will likely be lost on videotape or DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An edge-of-your-seat thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Panic Room," directed by David Fincher ("Alien 3," "Se7en," "The Game," and "Fight Club"), works on so many levels that I don't know what to say. The story: Meg Altman (played by Jodie Foster), is a divorced mother looking for a new life with her daughter, Sarah (played by Kristen Stewart). They go to a new house and discover something they couldn't believe. A safe room-"The Panic Room"-that will protect them from any kind of robbery and explosions and all kinds of things. On the night they move in, three burglars, Burnham (played by Forest Whitaker), Junior (played by Jared Leto), and Raoul (played by Dwight Yokham), break in and look throughout the house and discover that there are people in the house, but, there were supposed to be nobody in the house. Then, Meg wakes up and hears noises downstairs and wakes up Sarah and run to the panic room. The only problem is that whatever the burglars want is in that room that Meg and Sarah are in. So, they have to think of ideas of getting them out and not kill them and try to break through the room. My thought for this movie. Leave the house and go see this movie. The cast were excellent, including Jodie Foster's performance. The best performance out of the burglars was Dwight Yokham. His performance was a mean person. He was cool. The script (written by "Jurassic Park," "The Lost World: Jurassic Park," "Mission: Impossible," and "Snake Eyes's" David Koepp), was excellent. What I was most interested by this movie were Howard Shore's music and David Fincher's directing. Howard's music really made the audience on the edge-of-their-seats (his best since his oscar win for "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"). But, David's directing steals it. His camera work will take you through places and things that no other director can do. In this one scene, when Meg falls asleep, the camera goes backwards, through the bars of the stairs, climbs down, then comes the burglars, then the camera goes through the lock from the door then comes back and all through the house following the burglars without going to a different scene. It was just brilliant. Plus, this movie made me jump a few times (that's scary, and that's a good movie for me) and made my heart jump several times through some realistic and unbelievable scenes. This is also Fincher's best work since "Se7en" (probably his best work right now). This movie is a keeper. One of the best movies of 2002, along with "Black Hawk Down" and "Blade 2." Also, screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker ("8MM," "Se7en," and "Sleepy Hollow"), makes a cameo appearance as the neighbor Meg and Sarah awake from across the building. If you like thrills and David Fincher's work, THEN GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! TRUST ME! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!A+ 13/13 ****** (out of ****** stars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like Jodie Foster, then see this movie. She's is still an excellent actress and, Kristen Stewart, who plays her 12 year old daughter, is just as good! This kid was remarkable in this film. It was fun, exciting, and tense on the whole but I was distracted by a few "holes" in the story. For example, it bugged me that she didn't tip off the police when they FINALLY arrived at her door. The premise being she couldn't say a word because she was being watched on a security camera by the "villians" but in actuality they couldn't "hear" her so she could have easily alerted the police that she was in trouble.Another scene which really didn't make sense was in the first 1/2 hour of the film when the thieves break into her home and realize someone has actually moved into the once vacant house and now lives there. Any good villian would know to leave and come back later when it is safer; namely, when no one was home. DAH! And I'm not even in the robbery business!! All in all, I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old-Fashioned Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the Mountain Dew commercial says, `been there, done that,' Panic Room is reminiscent of a movie from yesteryear. It is quite simply an old-fashioned thriller. The plot is simple, the characters are stereotypical, and of course all ends well. Panic Room is the new film from young director David Fincher. Fincher was a very successful music video director that went on to direct standout movies Se7en, The Game, and Fight Club. Panic Room, however, does not live up to his `hot' reputation. One thing that all of his previous movies have in common is that they all have surprising plot twists in the end. Panic Room does not delivery any such twists. It comes off as a simple thriller that does not take any chances. Panic Room is equipped with a very good cast: Jodie Foster, Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto (who was great in Requiem for a Dream), and the quirky Dwight Yoakum. They all turn in satisfactory performances, however, none standout playing the one-dimensional characters provided to them.Panic Room starts with an interesting premise, and it is has you on the edge of your seat in parts, however it will soon be forgotten. This is definitely a disappointed from Fincher. I expected a much more frightening thriller with an `edgy' quality, not this old-fashioned movie with some flashy camera shots. In this day and age, it takes a lot more to shock or scare me.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of David Fincher, so there wasn't really any chance for this movie to suck. Objectively, however, I saw some places where the film could have been a little better. In the beginning of the film, the audience is treated with shots that are reminiscent of Kieslowski's Red, almost giving the impression of an omniscient narrator who can go literally anywhere he wants (into keyholes, through coffee pot handles, through floors, etc.). This is very cool stuff.Once the action kicks in, however, all of this changes. Instead of gliding through the walls and maintaining the illusion that it could all be one steadily-flowing scene (not harsh breaks from one room or place to another, only intercutting within each locale), the narrator almost completely disappears.The movie is still very entertaining, but I think it could have been much eerier if David Fincher had kept the illusion that all of this was unfolding in front of one observer.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just read an interesting book titled Brave Dames and Wimpettes, in which novelist Susan Isaacs posits that most modern movie heroines still use old feminine wiles instead of brainpower to get what they want.Urgently recommended viewing for Ms. Isaacs would be Panic Room, one of the best thrillers I've seen in years.The movie's heroines are Meg Altman (Jodie Foster), a recent divorcee, and her young daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart). They've just moved into a three-story Manhattan home of the kind to be found more easily in movies than in Manhattan. The prime draw of this house is its "panic room." In the event of a burglary or similar emergency, the resident locks himself inside this room and uses its separate phone line to call the police.On their very first night in the house, Meg and Sarah find out just how good to be true this room is, when three unruly burglars break in. It happens that the house's previous owner left a few million dollars behind in the house, and wouldn't you know it, the money's in the same panic room where Meg and Sarah lock themselves. Oh, and for good measure, Meg didn't have a chance to get the separate phone line hooked up.Yeah, I know, this whole set-up could happen only in the movies. But before the thrills are unleashed, the movie takes the time to set up the relationship between Meg and Sarah, and it's nicely done. Because we get to know them for a while, we have a stake in their peril.And believe me, these are not two women who sit around screaming and waiting for some moronically written boogie-men to kill them. Simply because the marvelous screenplay by David Koepp (Jurassic Park) allows these women to think, they manage to stay one step ahead of the burglars, who eventually find themselves cowering as much as those wimpettes Isaacs writes about. You'll not have heard such cheering from a movie audience in quite a while.Except for some overly swooping camera movement at the beginning, direction by David Fincher--formerly known for such existential dreariness as Fight Club and The Game--is as perfectly taut as you could hope to find in a thriller.As for the lead actresses--what a wealth! According to The Internet Movie Database, Kristen Stewart is only *11 years old*. But with her interplay with Foster and her remarkable subtlety, she can only be described as...well, the next Jodie Foster.And what is there to say about Foster? I find her one of the most beautiful women in movies, simply because she makes intelligence sexy.Going to a seeming no-brainer like Panic Room is like expecting an ice-cream cone and getting a dinner at Four Seasons.Panic Room is rated R for much adult language,</fullReview>

All the characters are fantastic, and the story is awesome, plus Jodie Foster is simply amazing in this!. The setting just gave me the absolute creeps, and I loved how it was so atmospheric and pitch black a lot of the time, plus the relationship and chemistry between Foster and Kristen Stewart was just great!.Forest Whitaker,Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam are all great as the 3 intruders, and it remains unpredictable and surprising throughout for the most part, plus it's extremely well made and written as well. This is one of Jodie's best films and one of her best performances, and I thought the finale was especially awesome, plus one of my favorite moments in the film is when Jodie races out the door to get her cellphone, as I found that to be very tense. It grips the audience from beginning to end, and what especially impressed me was the direction by David Fincher, plus the ending was very satisfying. This is a top notch thriller, that's extremely suspenseful, with lots of creepy atmosphere and wonderful performances, and I say Go see it now!. The Direction is wonderful. David Fincher does a wonderful job here, with some outstanding camera work, fantastic angles, great zoom in's and zoom out's great use of blue and black, and adding plenty of creepy and tense atmosphere, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace!. The Acting is amazing!. Jodie Foster is amazing as always, and is amazing here, she is very likable, on top of things at all times, had really good chemistry with Kristen Stewart, played a really cool character, and didn't crumble under pressure, as i loved that!, she was amazing (Jodie Rules!!!!!!!). Kristen Stewart is excellent as the Daughter, she did a fantastic job for such a young age for this type of role I was really impressed. Forest Whitaker is fantastic as the Burglar, with a big heart, I really liked him, and it was so cool with what he did in the end. Jared Leto is great, and quite menacing as one of the other burglars, he was great. Dwight Yoakam is surprisingly good as the other Burglar, and was also quite menacing. Patrick Bauchau does what he has to do well as the Father. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall Go see it now!. ***** out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a reactionary piece of garbage. From David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club) you would expect so much more. Even the presence of the excellent Jodie Foster can't change the fact that this is a minimalistic, plodding mess. I could predict many of the developments many minutes in advance, which did nothing to maintain any level of suspense. The villains far too early became comic book numbskulls, which only served to highlight the severe limitations of setting the entire 112 minutes of film time in a 3 story house and a small box. How long can you watch people trying to scuttle from one room to the next? And what was the Forest Whitaker ending all about? Do good, and be punished for it? If he'd been Bruce Willis (like in say "The Whole Nine Yards"), he would have simply walked away. And that only goes to make the ending even more of a letdown - Jodie and her boyish looking daughter shopping for another apartment?Too bad, because for the production value, the directing and acting talent that went into this movie, something good should have come out. ** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Panic Room" is a foible fraught suspense flick in which Foster's character and her daughter play cat and mouse with a trio of intruders in their Manhattan mansion for the full run. Lousy character development and a implausibilities up the wazoo, this film requires some serious dumbing down. However, it's busy enough with cheap thrills and a slick enough shoot to make it an reasonably entertaining couch potato watch. Turn off brain, go with the flow, and enjoy. (B-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It may not be a perfect group of films, but you can rely on Fincher for distinction and style. This is exactly the same. You have a routine thriller, and some terrible acting from the crooks. However Fincher makes the film ooze class, and draws Foster's best performance for years. It'll keep you hooked.Also catch the finest opening titles since "North By Northwest". Saul Bass couldn't have done better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Fincher still rocks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly wasn't sure what to expect from Panic Room when I entered the theatre. I have been a fan of David Fincher since Alien 3 (forget the critics, it was a well directed film) but I was leery of David Koepp's screenplay; I like his work but his scripts usually aren't of that Se7en/Fight Club caliber. Needless to say, I was not disappointed.The film is steadily paced, given the idea that the character are trapped in a small space and it feels like forever, which is not bad at all. It made me more claustrophobic the longer it lasted. Of course, David Fincher was making the camera into a character all its own, going through floors, walls, keyholes, coffee pot handles, railing, you name it. The special effects are superb, but DO NOT have to make up for content, unlike many films appearing so often (Lord of the Rings). The special effects never enhance the story, just the presentation of Finch's visionary directing style. The cinematography was beautiful, giving the panic room itself an assaultingly dark overtone. Conrad Hall and Darius Khondji are definetly on their game. The dark, ominously large house is spooky almost to the point of being gothic. Also, you have to give credit to a film that makes Dwight Yoakam scary as hell. I can't go into dark rooms of my house without getting a chill thinking about "Raoul" jumping out at me. Any movie that scars me for life (Jaws, Taxi Driver) is, at least in my opinion, a good movie.All in all, go see Panic Room, it is worth every second and penny to say the very least. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the latest offering from director David Fincher (toning down his trademark visual style this time) and features Jodie Foster as a woman who buys a weird building after her divorce from her husband and moves in with her daughter. The building of course has this "panic room" which is supposedly this impenetrable place that no one can get in or out of.. though a trio of hoodlums (including Forest Whitaker and Jared Leto) decide to try anyway. This film has a number of chilling moments and ratchets up the suspense.. though they throw in a few too many cliches (such as the daughter needing an insulin injection at precisely the worst moment). Still, a fairly effective if unspectacular thriller. GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Safe Room ("Panic Room" sounds better!) cannot be breached by the three home invaders determined to get the millions stashed inside that room. The mother and her diabetic daughter, who just moved into the upscale Manhattan townhouse don't know it is there - and haven't even installed the phone system yet! They are trapped, with time running out and the daughter quickly heading for diabetic shock. The invaders will do whatever it takes to get into the Panic Room, or to find a way to get the frightened pair to come out. Such is the concept of "Panic Room" - and it works very well, although somehow I left thinking it could have been even better considering the cast.It is reminiscent of home invasion movies from "Wait Until Dark" to "Straw Dogs" - although there is no giant bear trap in this one. The three invaders do try some original stuff with propane gas and switching identities. At one point the situation is reversed with the mother outside with the gun, and the invaders in the Panic Room with her daughter. It all works very well to a claustrophobic, tension-filled effect. Jodie Foster nicely underplays the mother, and Forest Whitaker reprises his well-known "lovable bad guy" act to effect. Jared Leto is good as the whiny "brains" of the gang, and Dwight Yoakum correctly psychotic as the homicidal sadistic villain. Kristen Stewart is adequate as the generic kid.One of the more effective aspects of this film is the direction that well uses the architecture of the house; its sterile, scary atmosphere is heightened by the fact that there is almost no furniture or decor, they having just moved in. Very well directed.A good, entertaining movie. 8 out of 10! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Foster and Fincher - A Winning Combination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having set his tone and style with the breakthrough "Fight Club", David Fincher creates another cinematic masterpiece with "Panic Room". It's the story of a recently divorced woman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter (Kristen Stewart) looking for a home in New York. They find one and as an added bonus, it has a panic room, a steel lined room with tv monitors, seperate phone line and ventilation system and emergency supplies stocked in it. On the first or second night in the house, three intruders come in, not knowing anyone is living there. What follows is a stand-off of sorts between the intruders (Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam) and the residents of the house, laced with nail-biting, edge of your seat moments of suspense and action. Although not having as many speaking lines as normal, Jodie Foster is brilliant (as usual) and belivably carries the movie and the emotions in the film. Just her facial expressions are amazing. Another incredible force in the movie is newcomer Kristen Stewart, who plays Foster's smart-mouthed, tough but sweet, pre-teen daughter. This being Stewart's first time under the weight of a major role, she handles it with wonderful depth and realism. Not to be forgotten are Forest Whitaker as the oafish burglar, and Dwight Yoakam is a bad guy you love to hate. Both are memorable, along with Jared Leto as a wannabe thug. Fincher's inventive camera angles, x-ray vision style, and uniquely-lit sets really set the mood. He is a powerful director, who has been quite underrated. I loved this movie! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and I will definately be going to see it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher is Fantastic...and so is Foster!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not common to discover a Director in Hollywood who can consistently deliver a good film. Such is the case with the experimental and exceptional David Fincher. While he has created only a handful of films such as ?Fight Club', ?The Game' and ?Se7en', this is even more of a reason why such attention must be drawn to this ambitious and multi-faceted Director. In his latest film, ?Panic Room', Fincher creates a superbly suspenseful and eerie piece of entertainment all the while breaking new ground in terms of technological achievement. Jodie Foster stars as a newly divorced single mother who upon her first night in her spacious new Manhattan apartment battles against intruders. Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam portray these unorganized criminals who will stop at nothing to capture hidden money locked away in the apartment. Within this spacious apartment, there is a secret room that resembles something of a bomb shelter. Contained in the room is a bank of security monitors, extra food and supplies and no possible way in. That is until the trio of intruders break into the home and force Foster's character and her daughter to lock themselves into this claustrophic room. David Koepp's script is full of pulse-pounding moments and will certainly keep many at the edge of their seats. But as a discerning viewer will note, it is quite difficult to script a film that takes place entirely within a vast apartment. And so does ?Panic Room' retain a sense of excitement even though its locations are limited? Indeed. The script is tight and has even a sly dose of humor to relieve the tension some audience member's might experience throughout this taut film. This film can be known to be a great film by observing its' many elements that make it a good time at the movies. First and foremost, the opening credits say a lot about the film's artistic sense. The opening title sequence has the credits of the film displayed as though they are Marquis on high-rise buildings. While the sequence is short, it is succinct and creates a sense of excitement among the anxious crowd. Furthermore, ?American Beauty' Cinematographer Conrad W. Hall plasters this film with rich ambience in a dark undertone that reflects a sense of urgency with every passing frame. Hall and Fincher collaborate on an extraordinary level, as the film is a luscious example of poetic beauty conveyed through excitement, thrills and astonishing cinematography. In addition,, as mentioned earlier, the film breaks new ground in terms of 3-d compositing. If one has seen the film and does not recall these scenes - that is because they were so well done that they are almost naked to the human eye. Fincher embarks on a journey of discovery as he explores the wonder of Digital Animation within ?Panic Room'. One such example is how Fincher uses his camera to track through the whole house from moving the camera through the kitchen in one single take, or bringing the camera through floors and walls in order to maintain one single, fluid sequence of beauty within his film. And even though the film is dark, moody and very chilling at times, it is all done with a sense of class and achievement that catapults this film onto another level. If one has seen the film, they may recall this class conveyed on screen with the first intruder sequence. Fincher terrorizes the audience and will never make anyone completely secure about their home's personal safety when he films the intruder sequence. With one single take, Fincher travels the rampant apartment and makes the camera track from the front door, to the back door, through walls and through floors all in one take in what proves to be the film's most technologically memorable moment. And while this review seems to be centered upon the technological achievements of the film, that is because it is a wonder to watch. Yet, in terms of a well-built and solid suspense film, it is well worth the panic to see the film.Giancarlo's Rating: ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is like a "Die Hard "scenario: Hero can't get out, villains need something the hero has, they can communicate with each other, but not reach each other. If you do a movie like this, it is always risky. Because people tend to think what *they* would do in this situation and usually people come up with better ideas than the hero - or the heroine in this case. That's because they don't feel any stress, unlike the hero - does. But if the audience is smarter than the hero it soon will start to get annoyed or bored... They just don't care anymore and thoughts are no longer with the movie - the director loses the audience. The other risk is that it is too predictable. So the director and the author have to come up with something original AND they have to fill all the holes. This is the only way to keep the audience on the right side, identifying with the hero, feeling his slim chances of getting away, feeling his fear. But in Mr. Finchers film you just think: why do they act like this, so stupid? Why don't they do this or that? etc.Another rule is: the more dangerous / the better / the smarter the villain appears the more danger to the hero. And in the end - the bigger the victory will be.This is why "Die hard" worked (Alan Rickman as the fast thinking, strategic genius, Godunov as his extremely dangerous hit-man), and that is another reason why this movie fails - the villains act like the 3 Stooges...Macaulay J.

		<fullReview>David Fincher's "Panic Room" does everything right. Writing is excellent. The people seem to say things that would be natural in a situation like the on presented in the movie. Acting is pitch-perfect. Jodie Foster is fantastic. Kristen Stewart is a child actor that rivals Haley Joel Osment. And the thee crooks, Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam give memorable and fascinating portrayals of their complicated characters. Another extreme pro of "Panic Room" is the cinematography. From the opening credits to the end of the movie, each frame has its own unique, "artsy-craftsy" persona that can be sometimes subtle, or fantastic with computer animation. Fincher is a director I have admired for a long time and each of his movies are astounding both in material an visuals. Howard Shore's music sets the tone of the movie right. Another thing I loved about "Panic Room" is that although the robbers can be humourous, you still don't like them. Other movies have tried to make villains funny and gross at the same time and it ends up being excrement (John Travolta in "Broken Arrow", for one). It somehow worked here, something I thought would never happen in movies. "Fight Club" wasn't terrible, but making "Panic Room" has assured me that Fincher hasn't succumbed to the Dark Side. This one is on par with his other works- "The Game", "Se7en", and "Alien3". "Panic Room" is a colossal experience. See it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty simple. Meg and her daughter Sarah move into a beautiful old house in Manhattan, right after Meg and her husband get divorced. She notices that one of the rooms are smaller than it should be, and the realtor explains this "Panic Room". A room that is a "safe-haven" for anything that could go wrong. You then have the 3 burglars that break in and try to get something from the house. They are furious because they hadn't planned on Meg moving in yet, just a slight obstacle for them. The movies keeps you on the edge of your seat for most of the time, and has you jumping in some cases. The camera work of David Fincher is absolutely amazing. Anywhere he wanted the camera to go, it went; keyholes, through walls, through floors, anywhere. The only reason I gave the movie a 7 out of 10 is because I found it pretty predictable. Although, still good, I was able to determine what was going to happen long before it actually did. In general, a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a breath, don't panic? but it's only an anxiety hub!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A simple story that spins the feel of `Home Alone' no doubt, but effectively dramatic to uphold a sense of psychological infliction and suspense! The director has done a terrific job to keep the viewers' interest. It's not so much the character development, but the overwhelming acting expressions that have mesmerized me throughout. Definitely, this film focuses on the battle of wits? almost as if everyone involved is playing in a poker game! There's ample on-screen chemistry between characters to bring thrills to the screen. And the performances, of the major characters, are highly dramatic! Yep, I've enjoyed this movie tremendously.Okay, the historical background to the characters is lamely projected, and the bit about the eccentric landlord does little to trigger interest. But Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker's acting are solidly engaging. Kristen Stewart plays her `Sarah' role credibly, giving a fabulous demonstration of the enormity of diabetic conditions! And the rest of the characters work well to support the development of their traits and behavior. Although, sadly, Andrew Kevin Walker's `neighbor-across-the building' character does little to add to the suspense. Sure, just a few characters and little to entertain with respect to background scenes! But this `heist' thriller thrills! It's confining, no doubt. But the solid three-sided steel `closet' is, in itself, truly interesting? almost like a nuclear shelter, equipped with monitors, survival kits, and even a phone line! The camera shots and the lighting play a terrific and crucial part to make all the actions, events and characters come together in this film. Even the internal `tour' shots of the four-storied townhouse are mesmerizing? of course, it did enter my mind that Foster's Meg lacks common sense? well at least, before all the actions start!The dialogue is not fancy, nor presumptuous, but adequate for these type of dramas. It flows well with the fast paced events. And the scenes are not overwhelmed with bombastic actions to make the story messy and senseless. There's enough material in this film to capture the interest of viewers? even if the ending twist lightens my intrigue. Yet this is David Fincher's movie? and he does have his way of drawing out menacing excitement to panic the crowd!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The art of cinema is first and foremost a visual art. David Fincher brings this visual aspect to new heights every time, which makes him one of my favorites. His expert use of the camera can be matched to Christopher Nolan's mastery of editting.The idea of the movie is not really amazing: a mother (Foster) and her diabetic daughter (Kristen Stewart) move into a spacious townhouse, and on their first night there three burglars break in. Their only defense is the built-in panic room, which unfortunately is what the thieves are after. So far, nothing innovative.The story contains a few twists, and this is a suspense movie more than anything else. But to me, the real beauty of the movie is the cinematography. I've seen this movie on a big screen, and again on a TV screen, and both are remarkable. This is a rare quality in movies.The soundtrack dictates a suspense atmosphere very adequately, and the actors are quite good (though not amazing). After you've seen this movie once to enjoy the storyline, watch it again with the sound off, just to enjoy the breathtaking shots and the lighting of the scenes.For the excellence in filming, I gave this movie 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a sign of the times, that panic room. The enemies are all around us. They're smashing down our doors. They're coming through the bathroom window. They're all swarthy and have no taste in clothes. They wear black masks and have weird hair cuts like cartoons out of a 1945 Dick Tracy comic strip. We live on the Upper East Side of New York and they live in Newark. They hate us for our freedom. They're out to get us all right.The unlucky among us come equipped with our own panic rooms, surrounded in steel and concrete, where they can't get at us, but then, since the rooms are in our heads, they may hurt us more than they help us.Jody Foster and her young daughter, Kristin Stewart, have just moved into a jumbo brownstone in the right part of Manhattan. It has a panic room. On their first night in their new mansion, three ugly thugs break in, in pursuit of a $20 million fortune stashed away in a secret safe in that same panic room. When Foster and Stewart become aware of the intruders, they dash into the panic room, unaware that the thieves are determined to break in and grab that stash.I won't bother to describe the rest of the plot. The set-up does the job. You can practically figure out the rest without any help. This piece of dumbed-down paranoia was written by David Koepp, who really knows how to do these things -- "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," "Spider Man," "Zathura: A Space Adventure." This is hack work with a vengeance.No possible cliché is missing. You must have seen a thriller in which the helpless heroine, with the madman in hot pursuit, runs to the elevator, clicks and re-clicks the "close" button, and the door slides closed just as the villain runs up against and begins pounding on it from outside. Three times here -- one elevator and two sliding steel doors.And as you probably know, one of the captives of the thugs, or even the heroine herself, must have some sort of medical condition that needs medical treatment if she's not to go into shock and perhaps die. A blinking neon sign might as well appear on the screen: URGENT. Often it's asthma, as in "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle." On crippled airplanes, the kid needs a kidney transplant, quickly. Here it's diabetes. The writer and director gave us a touch of claustrophobia in Jody Foster at the beginning but decided to go with Kristin Stewart's diabetes instead. It was a good decision. Claustrophobia can only take the disability so far then it wears itself out, whereas diabetes can change its character from threat to impact over a much longer period, drawing out what little suspense is left in this hoary device.Of the three thugs, Forest Whitaker can act -- and does. Jared Ledo, in cornrows cannot and doesn't. He sounds exactly like a Hollywood actor. Dwight Yoakum as the taciturn, cold-blooded type who kills a partner in a fit of pique, doesn't have much to say, which is just as well. Paul Schulze, as a savvy city cop, gets the best lines and looks right.I didn't like the three thugs, but then I didn't like Foster or Stewart much either. (I thought Stewart was an effeminate boy until the last few minutes.) They're rich and I'm not, and that's why I disliked them. I want to live in a three-story brownstone on the upper East Side too. And I want my own real panic room. I'm exhausted from schlepping these cinder blocks and I beams around inside my head. Whew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay so the main reason I decided to watch this movie is because it's a David Fincher film. Now the plot is about a mother and daughter using the panic room inside there home as a tool for survival when criminals enter their home. The thing is, the movie didn't have the tension I thought it would have in this type of movie and nothing about it was really gripping or anything like that. For a David Fincher movie I expected more, on a positive note the camera work can be cool at times but that is basically the main positive aspect of this movie. The movie starts out okay but quickly loses it's flare after a while, the whole movie seemed like a game of tag inside a house. It's basically a thriller that does a okay job, but it just didn't meet my expectations for it and wasn't all that thrilling either. This film tries to be intelligent but the script just isn't that good and nothing about it really amazes. Most parts of this movie seemed a bit too narrow and predictable and does not pull any surprises. After a while the movie starts to drag mainly because of the tedious aspect of it all, I really wanted to like this movie but was left disappointed after it was finished. The main positive thing about this movie I can think of is the opening sequence(not the title sequence) and other scenes with flashy camera work.4.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Panic Plot" or "Did they have to be so... er, noisy at 2 am ?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>--- Minor spoilers --- A movie can tell an eerie/insane/absurd/unbelievable story and remain entertaining just as long as its inner logic and coherence are respected. We all love those "Indiana Jones" or "Terminator" franchises (among others) for they all carry some kind of a subtle inside process that keeps ticking as a clock while our heroes jump above pitfalls or defeat liquid robots. The audience is ready to follow these scripts anywhere as long as a tiny red thread is visible. No thread of this kind in Panic Room. Writing down the main plot lines is useless here, others reviewers did it perfectly well. How come so many acclaimed professional people (Fincher, Khondji, Foster, Whitaker, name them) could get involved in such a waste of talent ? Because waste it is. Waste of time, for the pointless plot develops no drama or suspense at all as everything has been seen before, so the audience could legitimately feel cheated on (actually... that's what happened). Waste of characters development, for they all act illogically the most absurd way, swapping behaviors from silent to noisy, bad to good, victim to aggressor, shy to fearless, negotiating to threatening ... and even from semi-dead to alive-and-kicking, all in an eye blink. Waste of money, since the set designers had this huge mansion built with no other purpose than offering to David Fincher the ability to prove his virtuosity in camera work or crazy zoom-in zoom-out shots, thanks to some CGI to help... where some viewers might have expected a chilling mouse/cat maze chase between aggressors and victims up and down the many stairs (there's even an elevator that is completely ignored... What a shame, we all know that elevators are an excellent way of making the audience sweat). Waste of acting, for no-one will buy the sadness of Jodie Foster who just got away from a divorce with a few million bucks in her pocket, the shy mother/strong daughter relationship, the obvious lack of tenderness between the mum and the kid who is just shown as some kind of partner, the stupid hate the 3 aggressors vow to each other... Well, you got it, I guess. Let's go 3 stars for the set and the lights, and the shadow of how great this movie could have been if directed by Brian De Palma or John McTiernan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far of of the best movie i've ever ever seen! My two favorites, Kristen bell and Jodie Foster. What a thriller! My heart is still pumping! 2 thumbs up! My favorite part was when the black guy shot the crazy white guy. I jumped out of my chair and almost cried. Lol. I don't recommend this movie for kids younger then 13 unless they are mature or not easily scared. This movie will surely get your heart pumping. Especially when the mom was trying to get her phone. Im not gonna say what happened but I will say I lost most of my fingernails chewing them off. I can see why people don't comment that much. Its so freaking long</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jodie Foster purchases a fancy new home, only to have thieves break in on her first night there. Luckily, the place comes equipped with an impenetrable "panic room" where she and her daughter can hide until the bad men go away. Of course, things don't end up being this straightforward.The actors do a great job, there is much suspense to be had, and much pleasure to be derived from the resourcefulness of the characters. There are also some clumsily handled contrivances to be dealt with, and a camera with attention deficit disorder. Maybe director David Fincher was trying to make up for the fact that the action takes place in a restricted space, or maybe he had some visual tics left over from Fight Club. Whatever the case, there is no excuse for pointless, distracting, nakedly pretentious shots such as the one in which the camera appears to pass through the handle of a coffee pot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked it. I really did. Not only because I am a big fan of Fincher's work (with the exception of Alien 3), and I thought that he really did a good job with this one. Even though the plot is not always as cohesive as it should be, there is brilliant camera work, visual tricks that are A-class Fincher, good acting, solid suspense, an interesting premise and decent dialog.It was hard for me to dislike those things. Were many people get irritated by some of the plot holes (which is some sort of thing Fincher makes mistakes in more often, i have to admit, if you look at The Game for example), I could hardly notice them because of all the excitement and tension the movie was building up to.Hard to dislike it's slick style. Period. I give this movie my fullest recommendation for everyone who wants a simple thriller with excellent camera-work, acting and directing. I give it a 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hard day's night that doesn't go as well as one originally hoped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jodie Foster and her diabetic daughter (Kristen Stewart) are stuck in a "Panic Room," in this 2002 film also starring Forrest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, Jared Leto and Jonathan Pryce. The robbery of a safe in an empty house runs into a few problems when the thieves (Whitaker, Yoakam, and Leto) find the house occupied and the occupants in the very room that has the safe - the panic room. How to get into the room or force the people out is the question, when the woman and girl prove pretty smart.This derivative film, a sort of 2002 version of "Wait Until Dark," seems to have been pretty much blasted from here to kingdom come here on IMDb. I didn't see it in the theater; I rented it, and I think often that makes a difference in how disappointed or cheated one feels. I found it suspenseful and exciting with good acting. The story is full of plot holes that others have listed, so I won't bother. It's easier to accept plot holes in comedy or in a caper film. It's annoying in drama or suspense, admittedly. Foster gives a strong performance, full of girl power and intelligence. She hits all the right notes as a desperate mother. Whitaker is excellent as the weak link who works for the security company that has a contract for the house and doesn't want any violence. Kristen Stewart is perfect casting as Foster's daughter Sarah - she looks so much like Foster it's amazing, though I admit for the first few scenes I thought Sarah was a boy.Someone in a previous post asks if anyone sits down and looks at a script in Hollywood and works on the plot holes. Obviously the answer to that one is no, and here's why - films are greenlit on the basis of their business plan and who's attached. Hello, no one looks at the script or a treatment. And once the script is in production, 8 or 9 writers work on it. And you wonder why there are holes. The answer is, because there are holes in lots of heads.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I became obsessed with this film when I first saw it. Not only was it wonderfully casted (gotta love Whitaker) and had great acting, but the progression of the film was actually awesome for such a simple plot.Sure, it's nowhere near as good as Fincher's earlier work, but as an individual movie, it's damn refreshing. It takes a cliché, boring story and makes it work. If you ignore the bland ideas and focus more on the characters, acting, action, and film techniques, you will enjoy this movie.It may be a stretch for some people, and I can understand why, but I guess for a movie like this, you just have to let your guard down and enjoy it. Thats what I did, and damn did I love it.So try this movie out. It may or may not work for you, but if it does work, you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, I have to say that there is a real trade off in watching edited movies on TV. If they stink, you got them free and if they're good, you can always hit the one-click option on Amazon. I'm not sure with Panic Room, an exciting and suspenseful story of an innocent family attacked by a pack of home invaders in Manhattan that kept me interested during the film, but left me cold at the frenetic ending credits on CBS last Saturday.It's all in the math, I guess. The movie runs 112 minutes, but figuring 44 minutes per hour of broadcasting goes to the actual show, CBS hacked out 24 minutes. I'm not too worried about the language and violence--I know when the baddies are cussing from the dubbing sounds and I don't really need to see one character being tortured or another taking a slug in the back of the head--but I wonder if the stuff CBS left out was the connecting tissue of the movie, the back story I think was there that might have made Jodie Foster and her kid, Kristen Stewart more sympathetic.As it stood, I enjoyed Panic Room. It had enough chills and differing levels of characterization to keep me interested. On a purely prurient level, Foster in her little muscle shirt was enough to keep the lizard at the bottom of my brain pan purring. The baddies ranged from Forest Whitaker's pathetic desperation and Jared Leto's coke-snorting weasel to Dwight Yoakam's sociopathic career criminal. None of these guys seemed fleshed-out enough, and neither was Foster or Stewart, an intense young actress, but David Fincher keeps the story moving along at a brisk clip, despite the fragmentation of a network broadcast.My question is whether or not to spend my time renting the flick to see what CBS hacked out. I already know the basics and I pretty much liked the movie. Is it worth it? Okay, I'm a pig. I'll rent it just to see Foster in the muscle shirt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a Good Game of Chess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm reluctant to make lengthy comments about films that hundreds of others have already posted about because it seems like a waste of time, so I will just make a few observations about "Panic Room".The most important thing was that it instantly pulled me in and took me for a ride for the entire two hours. That does not happen often, particularly for a film that I was late seeing and therefore had tons of preconceived notions. I was pleased with how well they established the basic premise of the film at the beginning as, something that had seemed silly in the trailers was perfectly credible in the actual film. The $95 Million U.S. box office must have happened from word-of-mouth because the trailer simply does not do the film justice.There were only minor plot holes, although the lame way that Meg and her daughter initially got into the panic room almost derailed the whole thing. And I still find it inconceivable that $48 Million had to be spent on what is really a very small film. Since so little of the budget ever makes it onto the screen they would have been better served with the creative incentive of a smaller budget.Nicole Kidman was originally cast to play Meg but hurt her knee and had to drop out. I don't think they lost anything by bringing in Jodie Foster, I can't imagine Kidman doing any better, Meg's kind of brainy stubborn scrapper is Foster's specialty. And she is much better from a physical casting perspective as Kristen Stewart looks like she could actually be Foster's daughter. In fact, there were more that a few times when I momentarily got the two of them confused. This was very appropriate because "Panic Room's" heroines are not the usual film-fare mother and daughter (one strong and one weak), but rather a like mother-like daughter situation. I think Stewart has a great future in films (see "Speak" for a example of her ability to carry a whole feature) and it was nice that she got a chance so early in her career to work closely with Foster. I was particularly impressed with the pacing of this story and its similarity to chess masters hiding one line of attack inside another. The battle progresses much like a chess match, as pieces are lost the layout becomes less familiar and the alternatives fewer. As the two sides use up resources and get sucked in deeper, their earlier choices limit the choices that are available to them. This chess-like process holds until the very end of the film.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jodie Foster and her kid have just bought a new house, and it happens to have a high-security panic room in it. One day, the house gets robbed and Jodie Foster rushes herself and her kid into the panic room. What follows is nearly two hours of edge-of-your-seat close calls and situations that threaten Jodie Foster's life (and the kid). The movie's ending isn't very surprising, considering the basic formula has been used in at least 50 Hollywood movies by now.The film is a satisfying popcorn flick, nothing more. Don't expect action sequences, plot twists (besides the predictable ending), or anything that requires you to think.

		<fullReview>Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart play well off of each other as mother and daughter in Panic Room, the sleek thriller that proves to be director David Fincher's most promising work.Recently divorced, Foster plays a woman who purchases and proceeds to move into a large brownstone house in Manhattan with her daughter. All seems well at first. The house is enormous and beautiful, and the main attraction is the "Panic Room", a room hidden in Jodie's bedroom. Layered into the wall with thick concrete and steel, there's no way into the Panic Room once the metal door has swung shut.And how convenient that Panic Room proves to be when three men invade their house on their first night moving in. Foster and Stewart lock themselves away in the room, without a phone connection and without any means of help. All they have is the few supplies stocked in the room and the advantage of seeing what the burglars are doing, for the house is rigged with video cameras and several monitors on the wall display each room to our heroines.Once inside, a tense and original game of cat and mouse plays out as the burglars reveal that they need to get into the Panic Room for a hidden treasure. But Foster, turning in an intense and strong performance, decides to take matters into her own hands. "Panic Room" is beautifully photographed and relentlessly suspenseful, hands down one of the best thrillers you'll see in a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now i had big hopes for this thing, but it showed to be a little disappointing. Now the story is a great idea but it's hard to make a film long 2 h and keep it interesting when it's a one place film. They should make it shorter for at least 15-20 min and keep us on the edge of our seat. Some scenes are too long, and u get bored. But still it's a pretty good film whit good acting, nice camera movement and a interesting story.Panic room is about a divorced mother who moves in to a new house whit her daughter. It's a big house whit a room called the panic room. The room is used when the owner is in danger and can not get out of the house. And it happens that the first night of their stay some people brake in. They tough it was empty but it showed it wasn't. But since they are hear there is no point of going back since there is a lot of money in the house. The problem is the money is in the panic room, and mom has been able to get in whit her daughter...As i sad this hat a lot of potential but it kinda lets u down whit some slow moments and some typical h'wood cheese. The best performance comes from Forrest Whitaker who i think has a good future. The rest of the cast puts on a good performance too. Now i very much liked the camera movement. Yes some were made whit fx but still looked cool. Also a very nice direction by Fincher.So overall i liked the movie but hoped for a little bit more. Now Fincher is no Hitchcock but still did a great job of keeping us interested of how it ends. Koepp is a good writer but has some faults. But the script is good but as said before way to long for a thriller of this kind. I'll give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room is one of those rare movies that features less than 10 actors and a set piece acting as a character in the film. While thin on story, there is plenty of action that helps sustain the movie from start to finish. Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman, a newly single mother who moves into a posh Manhatten home with her daughter Sarah, played by Kristen Stewart. The first night they live in their new home, a team of robbers (Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, and Jared Leto) attempts to extract contents from the previous owners of the home late at night, setting in motion the cat and mouse game that supplies action throughout the movie. The house is outfitted with a "Panic Room," a solitary fortress that allows the home's owners to lock themselves in, the bad people stay out. It's a great plan, except the out-going telephone service has not been hooked up yet, so the Altmans are locked in the room, and the robbers have to wait from them to get out--what they are looking for, millions of dollars in stocks and bonds are located inside the room. For every move the crooks make, the two ladies have to make a counter-move, each time you think the girls have come up with a brilliant idea to get them out of their problem, something else goes wrong. There is a truly scary moment when gas is used to try to suffocate Meg and Sarah out, you can imagine yourself trying to gasp for breath. Beyond that, there are tense moments, but nothing groundbreaking. It's a solid suspense thriller, and it looks really good. Forest Whitaker plays the role of the crook who has some morals, he doesn't want to hurt anyone, he just wants the money, very very well, by far the best performance in the movie. There is a remarkable camera pan from the bottom floor of the house to the roof, the camera had to pass through a window to finish the shot. But overall, it's not a movie that really stays with you forever, but is good for about 2 hours of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple, yet powerful performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PANIC ROOM (2002) Jodie Foster stars in Panic Room, written by David Kroepp and directed by David Fincher. The movie tells the story about Meg (Foster) who inhabits an apartment in Manhattan. The Realtor explains to her that this house contains a 'panic room', which is used to ward off any intruders.Unfortunately, the Panic Room is something Meg and her daughter Sarah are forced to use on their first night there: three burglars enter her house searching for something. Unfortunately, what they need is in the Panic Room! The burglars stop at nothing to get her out, while Meg tries to defend herself from their attempts.The story is pretty simple, and all plays in one day (and night). There are only two locations used in this film: a bench in NY City and of course the house Meg and Sarah live in. The story takes a simple approach to a not very original plot.However, David Fincher manages to make this in to a thrilling experience, which makes Meg twist and turn to get her out of the Panic Room. The film is nowhere scary, but the thrill is there; and how! The minimum cast (mainly consisting of 6 people) sets an experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Furthermore, Kristen Stewart does an excellent performance as Sarah; the diabetes-daughter.Then why not give this film a 10/10? Because it fails to add any originality or story twists. From the moment you start, you can pretty much expect what's going to happen. Furthermore, the CG Title Sequence seems to hi-tech to compare with the simplicity of the film. The long takes, which take the viewer from the top floor, all the way to the third are (although beautifully shot) again a total difference from the style of the movie. It seems that these things were included to make sure the audience would not write this off as a independent film of some sort.On a total view, the film is certainly not bad and is definitely worth viewing. If you're a fan of very thrilling, yet not complicated films: watch this. If you like clever story lines and plot twists, you might want to leave this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie - a response to the message board filling up with stupid comments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I watched this movie from start to finish without any storyline discrepancies. I'm amazed at some of the things people have come up with to complain about. The intruders could not simply leave the house even for a short time because that leaves Meg (Jodie Foster) and daughter Sarah free to wander the house. One could remain in the panic room, eyes on the criminals now outside (thanks to the outside cameras) while another gets a mobile phone, shout across to neighbours, hell even make an escape by taking as long as is needed to undo the barricades previously set ? so long as there is ample warning time if the criminals decide to come back in, which the person in the panic room could provide. The situation goes in favor of our heroes once the criminals take the defensive ? any lengthy amount of time can be used to their advantage to do whatever they want in the house, including calling the cops, which would defuse the entire situation. The criminals therefore must stay on the offensive; thinking of ways to get them out or lingering nearby the panic room entrance. The also could NOT have waited for them to 'starve to death', which would take weeks given the food supply (they did not know about Sarah's condition), as somebody somewhere would have noticed. As you mention there are cameras in most places but not everywhere. I can guarantee there would be cameras at each entrance/exit, so the "we escaped (but are actually hiding)" trick would have no effect. Even more ridiculous is the user review on this movie that states the robbers could leave he premises and return when they Meg goes "to work". That would be a great idea, because there would be ample time to call the entire state police department the guard the area. Sigh. Think before you write stupid things. The single mother and daughter were able to afford it, as touched on, hmm?. many times during the film, the husband was rich and, as stated in the first five minutes of this film, "He could afford it". The SWAT team arrived as a result of gunshots and general loud noises. They had been called before that morning so a second call from multiple people (probably different ones too) would have a greater effect. Anyway, enough bashing people's stupid ideas. I thought it was an ace movie and just how a panic room should be portrayed. A safe as can be humanly created, but once the slightest thing goes wrong in the most intense situation, you can kiss your panic room mentality goodbye. From start to end I enjoyed this flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering that this is the work of David Fincher, the man who brought us Se7en, it's pretty ordinary. That doesn't mean it's bad, though. It's OK. It just doesn't reach the heights of Fincher's other work. The plot is pretty good, and somewhat original. The actors all perform very well, every single major character shines through. The characters are believable and their actions are mostly understandable. The special effects are very good. The cinematography is great. The movie has some exceptional thrills at several points, and has a good atmosphere throughout the run time. The last scene especially had me at the edge of my seat in excitement, right up until the end. For being relatively mainstream, I think this movie does stand out a bit, from the average thriller. It's not a masterpiece, but it's not bad either. It's thoroughly entertaining, which is exactly what we want from movies. I'd recommend it to pretty much any fan of thrillers, David Fincher, or any of the head actors involved in this. You probably won't be disappointed, as long as you don't expect too much. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Ado About Very Little</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are acres of atmosphere in this thriller, generated by the polished visuals of Fincher, and an unrelenting original score by Shore. But why? The film jumps straight to the premise, with economical characterizations of the few players populating it and the house break-in in under 15 minutes. There just doesn't seem to be much of a point.Fincher has developed an unmistakable feel in all his movies, used to a lesser extent in The Game, with a gritty, underlit, urban grime suffusing the visuals. He also has developed a signature effects-laden, pullback and zoom technique, with long camera swoops. In Panic Room, the camera drifts through spindles on a balcony railing, zooms into keylocks, passes through floors, and ultimately--with successive iterations--distracts from the film.Dwight Yoakam plays Raoul, a Chucky-esque baddie in a ski mask who manages to upstage Forrest Whitaker and Jodie Foster in this thinly scripted Fincher showcase. There is not much movie here to digest, but it plays well, builds genuine tension, and benefits from Fincher's wit and skill, Shore's driving score, and, perhaps most surprisingly, Jodie Foster's skimpy tank top.7/10</fullReview>

Fincher proves he is the new master of suspence. I think his first choice, Nicole Kidman, would have been excellent. Foster is Ok, but Whitaker is the absolute star. As for Jared Leto, he proves he can take on any role. As I watched this movie in a theater a few months ago, I must admit the audience was very quiet. That is an absolute proof of Fincher's directorial skills. Can't hardly wait for MI3. Another kind of movie, could Fincher become the King of the 21th century-thriller?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Fincher has done it! He has brought the film world one heck of a suspense thriller. This film is top notch. It grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go once. It's nearly everyones worst nightmare brought to film. If you haven't seen it...CHECK IT OUT NOW! The cast is top notch and they deliver this film right to the center of the target. I have to admit that I've never been a big fan of Jodie Foster. But she has finally won me over with her powerful performance in this 2002 smash hit. The Panic Room is excellent all the way. And if you watch this film at night, you just might check your whole house before you go to bed. Check out, and sweet dreams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Fincher has done it again!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I first heard about this film, I thought to myself "How on earth are they going to do a two hour movie about some people trapped in a room?" Well, my question was answered when I saw the film! I have loved all of David Fincher's films so far (Alien 3, The Game, Seven, Fight Club), so I had some high hopes for this film. I can safely say that I was not let down! I thought the movie had an EXCELLENT story, very original and very interesting.As for the cast, I thought the cast was incredible! Jodie Foster did a great job with her role as always. Forest Whitaker did a great job as well. Jared Leto was a surprise hit with me. I've seen Jared in other films, but never really thought he was anything special, but I thought he did a really good job in this film. And finally Dwight Yoakam, for a country singer, he sure is a surprisingly good actor! Dwight does a great job in this film, and does a fantastic job in "Sling Blade". So you may want to check that film out too, if you haven't already.One other thing that I have to mention that really caught my eye was the lettering in the very beginning of the film. I think it's such a weird thing to appreciate, but I really liked the beginning credits (it's not often that you can say that!) When you see the film, you'll know what I'm talking about.I would definitely recommend seeing this movie! David Fincher is a master at making intense and thrilling movies! And while you're at it, if you haven't seen his other films that I mentioned above, you should rent those too. I really hope you enjoy the film as much as I did. Thanks for reading.-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie with Good Actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was really cool. The acting is superb, and the plot is very cool. The movie follows Jodie Foster, a recently divorced mother, who just moves into an apartment with her daughter, Kristen Stewart. Well just their luck, three burglars break into the place the first night. The three burglars, played by Forest Whitaker,Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakem. The first two questions are obviously, "Who are you?" and "What do you want?" Well I'm not going to tell you anything more because I might spoil it. What we did learn is that Forest Whitaker is a burglar with a heart of gold, Jared Leto plays an idiot, and Dwight Yoakem is not a happy camper.Overall this movie is a good cat and mouse and the acting was over the top excellent. Rating 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two occupants of a home vs. three bad dudes up to no good.This is a premise we have seen before,although the numbers were different in "Home Alone".This film,however,is no comedy.It is a very well done suspense thriller.Jodie Foster never fails to disappoint,and certainly not this time,as a mother of a young child,trying to thwart off these three bad individuals,whom it appears they are not as safe from in this "panic room" as they thought they would be.They appear to know more about the house than your everyday average burglars.Very good villainous work by Forest Whitaker,Jared Leto,and Dwight Yoakam (whom you would never think would be a good actor,but he never fails to surprise).The only drawback to this film is a possible overuse of special effects,when they could have made the film work without them.This is my first viewing of a 2002 theatrical release,and while it may not be the best among suspense thrillers,it certainly is top notch.Thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get Ready To Panic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent thriller starring Jody Foster, Forrest Whittaker, Jared Leto and a Mystery Masked Man. I bet you'll never guess who that masked man is (nobody tell). I have to admit I was a bit apprehensive about seeing this film because how much panic or thrill could occur in a movie about a room. But I was pleasantly surprised once the film got going (the beginning they are buying and adjusting to their new home) on a non-stop roller coaster ride of suspense right to the end. There is one scene in the film that goes to slow motion with no sound and I found myself suddenly panicking along with the characters on film. The director does an excellent job to show every aspect of the house and the confrontation between victims and perpetrators. My one beef about the film is with the ending which I feel was left totally open for viewer interpretation. I like closure and this had none. Anybody who saw this film and can explain to me the ending, please message me privately, do not write it here to ruin for other people. Basic Plot: Foster and her daughter (yes, thats a female) buy a new house in which one of the rooms is a Panic Room complete with video monitor system, separate phone line and emergency supplies. They lock themselves in the Panic Room when Leto, Whittaker and Masked Man break in. However, these thieves want something inside the room. A thrilling cat and mouse game ensue. Mr.Uxo's Take 4/4 stars. One Big Thrill in the Panic Room!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I would agree that it was not top-quality work from Fincher, or at least not on the level as his previous films, it is one of the best suspense films i've ever seen. The storyline was rather straight-foward but it did not take away from the greatness in being a great movie. At times i could actually feel my heart naturally beating faster at numerous times.

		<fullReview>Thanks, Jodie Foster, for reassuring my confidence in you! In Panic Room, Foster gives a performance worthy of praise as a single mother in a terrifying situation. Moving in to a NY brownstone with her daughter, it's not long before she (Foster) must utilize the "panic room", a steel walled saferoom for paranoid rich people. The burgulars (Whitaker, Leto, and Yoakam) are there just to get-- you guessed it-- in that room. Whitaker plays to perfection a good guy in a bad situation once the power hungry Yoakam is brought in by the hysteria-prone Leto. Foster and her daughter (Stewart) must fend for themselves as the burgulars resort to devious methods to get them out. This movie thrilled me to the very bone, provoking true emotions out of me as I rooted for Foster. It's a frustrating, gritty, terrifying movie-- and if it's violent at times, it's because it should be. Go see it-- although don't be surprised if you find your legs jelly- like afterwards!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have walked in to see Panic Room with thinking its going to be another sleeper. Little did I know that the director of this movie is David Fincher. You might remember that he did some awesome movies like Fight Club and Se7en. Anyway as soon as the movie starts you feel confused by the unique way of the beginning credits. As the movie progresses we see some awesome effects such as the camera moving between walls, going across the house in a very very unique manner and seeing a fair amount of slow motion shots to create a great sense of suspense. Overall I was amazed by the directing. The acting was was very good. The move did kind of start slow but there were fair amounts of twists and small humor. So if you liked David Fincher previous movies you should enjoy Panic Room. I give it 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Panic Room is THE most edge of the seat thriller I've seen in a long time. Gory horror movies don't scare or enthrall me. But movies like this and Speed do.In recent years, thrillers have relied less on suspense and tried to outdo themselves with over-the-top endings and plot twists like Se7en, Usual Suspects, Spanish Prisoner, Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable.Writer David Koepp spent the most of the 90's successfully adapting other thrillers like Jurassic Park, the first Mission: Impossible, Carlito's Way, and Stir of Echoes. While his originals, Trigger Effect and Snake Eyes, were just so so. Here, he sets up a wild premise, intriguing characters, and some very funny moments.By now, director David Fincher has proven that he is by the best thriller director period. Se7en is by far the creepiest film of the 90's. The Game is a great ride and that just keeps on twisiting and keeps you guessing.Panic Room's key moments are when the viewer is kept waiting for what will happen next. The filmmakers have set the film with some terrific rules. The burglars aren't going on anywhere and there is no outside communication. Then, they add on the complications.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic Room is a excellent thriller directed by cinematic genius David Fincher. Not only does the movie have its well developed plot but great humor and most importantly the dark suspense. In fact the characters were so well played that the audience clapped and cheered when the bad guy got hit with a sledge hammer by Jodie Foster.The movie has nice cinematography along with the lighting and atmosphere. The shots and angles are so unique that the movie couldn't have done without them. David Fincher manages to capture that thrill suspense by making situations so spellbinding that you regret even blinking. Maybe I'm giving it to much credit. But i don't think i am. The dramatic irony in the movie makes all the more fun to watch. Stop by your theater and see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly where was the suspense supposed to be?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like any other true movie buff, I'm a big David Fincher fan. Regardless of what the academy may think, Fight Club was one of the best movies of all time. However, in Fincher's lasted film (Panic Room) I felt that it lacked a certain edge to it. With this genre, the quality of the film is defined by its ability to take the audience into the eyes of the victim and feel his/her terror. All I really ended up getting out of this film was a soar bum from the theater's seats and a nauxious feeling from the vain attempts at suspense. My advice to anyone going to see this movie is this: We've seen Fincher do suspense before, it was a little mishap called "Alien 3", I'd recomend learning from history and save myself the six bucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`Panic Room' is a good `B' movie that makes you glad you don't live in a mansion in the heart of NYC.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New York City has become the outpost of terror, certified from the skies on 9/11 and renewed in the `Home Alone' half-brother, `Panic Room.' Being beset upon by larcenous strangers in New York has been a pervasive fear of visitors as well as brownstone owners. This film brings home that fear in a frightfully large house Jodi Foster and her daughter buy after her divorce from a wealthy financier.Mom and daughter hide from intruders in the panic room, a bomb-shelter like fortress built for just such intrusions. Although it would seem a claustrophobic setup, Director David Fincher (`Seven' and `Fight Club') moves everyone as smoothly as his careening camera up and down staircases and through partially opened doors.The three goons have varying degrees of wit and humanity, most of which belongs to Forest Whitaker, who best expresses the difficulties that come from not being committed to taking all or nothing. He has too many issues besides just robbery to distract him from the ruthlessness his partners come to so easily.Jodi Foster is her usually intelligent agent of righteousness, a Clarice Starling with divorce and diabetic kid as baggage. Although Nicole Kidman was to have this role, Foster has the edge on tough and Kidman had her scare-fest in `The Others' a year ago.`Panic Room' is a good `B' movie that makes you glad you don't live in a mansion in the heart of NYC. It also subtly comments on the dangers almost always accompanying young divorcees and their children. The film has updated the `Home Alone' family situation and added some terrifying effects, so just enjoy an old-fashioned scary-mansion story. In this film, there is nothing new to learn about women, children, and homes besieged by modern terror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense thriller that'll keep you on the edge of the seat every time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That Panic Room is a suspense thriller that retains its suspense in repeat viewings, a very rare occurrence for the genre, is a sign of its quality.David Fincher directs the film to create a real feeling of utter isolation in the middle of Manhattan and realistic touches, not needed for plot, convince the audience that Meg is a real woman in a real predicament. The thriller works due to an insular plot of a mother and daughter trapped inside the panic room of their new house when three men break in, who want what is hidden in that panic room. It doesn't feel the need to branch out or become over the top, and it is a situation the audience can relate to on a basic level ? intruders in the home.Its few flaws are that at the start of the film when Meg and Sarah move in, it is too quiet, with too much ominous music to emphasise this woman and her daughter are in trouble, feeling a little heavy handed. Why do Meg and her daughter need such an enormous labyrinthine house anyway? The fancy camera-work is impressive on a first viewing, but distracting on re-watches and the ending is slightly too abrupt.As for the characters, the film cuts between Meg and Sarah on the inside, and Junior, Burnham and Raoul on the outside, letting the audience get to know all the characters equally. If there is a problem here, it is that Junior's inconceivable stupidity is unfortunately inconceivable, but he and Burnham remain likable throughout, he for sweetness due to his dumbness and Burnham for being the nice one, while the faceless Raoul is suitably despicable.Panic Room is one of the best examples of the suspense thriller, taut and terrifying, exhilarating and entertaining, viewing after viewing, a talented ability for a film set in one house during one night. Highly recommended for a thrill, but not for a relaxing night in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On their first night in a new home, a newly-divorced woman and her feisty daughter are terrorised by burglars.A simple, 'old-as-the-hills' plot is given some nail-biting new twists in this hugely atmospheric, extraordinarily shot thriller from Mr. Fincher. Foster is superb as ever, creating a deeply believable mix of vulnerability, bewilderment and toughness in Meg Altman (Kidman's loss was our gain, methinks), and she's matched at every turn by Stewart as her disapproving and resourceful 12 year old daughter. Whittacker and Yoakam add rich layers of pathetic good and menacing evil (although Yoakam is a little self-serving in the 3 DVD set commentary, if you ask me). Only Leto hits a wrong note, giving a deeply overplayed and caricatured illustration of over-acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I decided to watch Panic Room, I didn't think I would get much enjoyment out of it. Mainly because of the mixed reviews I've read on IMDb. But having watched this film, I realise that some people don't recognise a great, clever and personal film when they see one.The dialog in Panic Room is fantastic, especially the conversations between the three intruders. Characters where great and never veered off track - Raoul was the icing on the cake, being a socially retarded, violence buff.The only criticism I have with Panic Room are three things: One being that no-one can possibly walk on broken glass with bare feet (Jodie Foster) and two being that no-one would survive in igniting a room full of gas with a lighter. And finally third... NOBODY can survive a sledge hammer to the head... yes I'm looking at you Raoul.But that aside; Panic Room is a really suspenseful thriller and clever in it's logistics of story telling.Bernard: "Man, who the f@ck is he?" Raoul: "I'm Raoul..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A claustrophobic but effective little thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In PANIC ROOM, Oscar winner Jodie Foster manages to channel her undeniably strong on screen charisma into what is basically a damsel in distress drama. Foster plays a divorced mom of a teenager, who has just moved into a new house, who becomes terrorized by a trio of thieves looking for some booty left by the previous owner of the house in the panic room, a large steel-enclosed room that once it is entered and the door is closed, it is completely impenetrable, which becomes a problem when Foster and her daughter choose to hide from the intruders in said panic room. Also factoring in the drama is the fact that the daughter is diabetic and requires periodic shots of insulin. The film has a real claustrophobic feel to it since the action pretty much stays inside the house and a good deal of the action plays out in that one room, but the cat and mouse game between Foster and the thieves works, primarily due to Foster, who brings so much more to the role than written and Forrest Whitaker, solid as always, as one of the thieves who does appear to have some semblance of a conscience. It's not terribly original, but it is watchable, thanks to the performances of Foster and Whitaker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of all my favorite movies, this has to be around #3. True, it does start out kind of slow to introduce the characters and how they act/are. As soon as the killers are in, it's a question of what to do next? This movie really makes you want to lock your doors at night. I really like the choice of criminals: the true-Mofia guy (Raoul), the one who wants the money (Junior) and the one that needs the money (Vernom/Bernom). It was a shame how the last part of the movie was, since we never really did get to see what happened with Vernom (or Bernom, I never could tell). He didn't get the money, had to kill a guy to save a life, and then go to jail.. that is, if Meg didn't tell them he was a good guy. It makes you wonder what she would say, though. "He's my body guard," or "He's a friend of mine," doesn't seem like a cop would believe. I really question what Meg did that made the cops come back. Nonetheless, this whole movie is about 'What comes next?' A lot of questions are left unanswered, but sometimes that makes a great movie. It made this one even more awesome. Jodie Foster, Dwight Yokam, Jared Leto, and Forest Whitaker should get a standing ovation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meg is in the middle of a divorce with her husband Stephen. Meg's friend Lydia has found Meg and her daughter a new home, only just coming onto the market. The house is a massive four story house, that has everything they need and more. On inspection of the house, Evan Kurlander the estate agent shows them a secret room the house holds; a panic room. Used for home protection, the panic room is an isolated room which no one can enter once you are inside. The night that Meg and Sarah move in, three men break into the house, after a valuable that the house holds. Once Meg and Sarah lock themselves inside the panic room, things go from bad to worse. The object the three men; Junior, Burnham and Raoul, are after resides in the panic room, stopping at nothing to get inside the panic room.Panic Room is another highly crafted film, adding into David Fincher's great arsenal of films. Tightly constructed and moving at a face pace, Panic Room grabs a hold of you from the get go, and doesn't relinquish. The room itself is a small, claustrophobic area, creating a wonderfully tight atmosphere. While the house itself is a massive area, it also holds a claustrophobic feel, creating even more tension, as for the predominant part of Panic Room, we don't leave its walls.David Fincher's direction has such grace and elegance, from all the seamless tracking shots around the house. They move so smoothly, and are perfectly integrated with the computer generated shots, when shifting between rooms through the walls and ceilings. Fincher is a meticulous director, and it does show. Every shot has this perfection, using the surroundings and actor to their ultimate limit.Character development has been kept at a minimal from David Koepp's script. Your not given a lot of depth to them through verbal conversations, yet you are given so much from the actors performances, creating idiosyncrasies which tell you more about the character than the verbal inclinations. Jodie Foster has such a strong presence on the screen. While Meg is fragile on the outside, Foster gives her such inner strength. Kristen Stewart is the opposite to Foster, Sarah has real outer strength, yet fragile on the inside, which Kristen Stewart captures perfectly. Jared Leto is great as the hot headed Junior. Forest Whitaker does well as Burnham, also Dwight Yoakam as the twisted Raoul.Panic Room is a wonderfully, tightly constructed thriller from one of our modern day great directors.</fullReview>

From the moment Meg (Jodie Foster) and Sarah (Kristen Stewart) got into hiding, I thought to myself, "Don't let anything bad happen to them! Please!" I also took quite a few deep breaths to prevent myself from screaming any more than I already had. On the bright side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious.

		<shortDescription>An outstanding, intelligent thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Panic Room" is based on a spec screenplay written by powerhouse writer (and sometimes director) David Koepp. Finished in early 2000, the script was reportedly purchased for the astronomical sum of $4 million, which is a little less surprising when you consider some of Koepp's credits (Jurassic Park, Mission Impossible, the Lost World). The script is available to read on line. To me, the spec script comes across as a moderately interesting concept, reasonably well-executed --unlikely to set the world on fire.For whatever reason, David Fincher decided to follow his mind-blowing masterpiece "Fight Club" by directing "Panic Room." Based on the script alone, I had low expectations for the movie. But I should have known to have more faith in Fincher. His greatest brilliance lies in cinematography (lighting and framing shots, camera movement and placement) and editing, and those aspects of course cannot be captured on paper. Fincher has taken the opportunity with this movie to go hog-wild with interesting camera angles and movements that greatly enliven the fairly mundane story and make this movie a feast for the eyes.In particular, Fincher showed with this film and Fight Club that he has a far different concept of the use of CGI than most current Hollywood directors. He uses it not to create "special effects" as much as "camera effects" -- not to create things (explosions, spaceships, monsters or creatures) that don't really exist in life but rather to show us things that do really exist but an ordinary camera could not possibly capture (such as the inside of a keyhole, a flashlight, a four-inch ventilation pipe). In this movie the camera moves in ways I have never seen before, peering around impossibly narrow doorway openings, moving between the rails of a banister, dropping down a three story staircase in seconds, moving through the handle of a coffee maker. Remember the shot in Hitchcock's "Notorious," where the camera started atop a grand staircase and gradually craned down to a close-up on a key clutched in Ingrid Bergman's hand on the floor below? That shot is legendary in film history. Well, this movie has at least a dozen, probably far more, shots like that, all realized through the utterly seamless use of digital effects technology.It's not only through technical means, however, that Fincher has enhanced Koepp's script. The movie is exceedingly well-cast and acted, with Forest Whitaker, Jodie Foster, and Dwight Yoakam all giving excellent performances. Kristen Stewart is solid and believable as the daughter. Jared Leto is at times annoying and over-the-top, but his character is meant to be so. Subtle shadings and nuances have enhanced the script at every turn, deepening the characters, sharpening the action, and improving the sometimes shaky logic of the situation.It is in the third act (the last half-hour or so) that the film most widely deviates from Koepp's original blueprint, and it is this part of the movie that is most gripping and remarkable. Visually Fincher seems to be channeling Kubrick (as well as Hitchcock) for much of the final act, with some very strong echoes of "The Shining" (and a few frames that strongly recall "Dial M for Murder"). Of course Fincher's haunting, powerhouse visual style, while evocative of Kubrick and Hitchcock, is all his own, and it achieves maximum effect in these scenes.The final five minutes of the movie display a stunning level of moral and emotional ambiguity, particularly involving Forest Whitaker's character. "Panic Room"s most obvious antecedent in movie history is probably "Rear Window." Unlike "Rear Window," the basic story of "Panic Room" has no deeper resonance beyond the thrills of the moment. On the other hand, however, the resolution of "Rear Window" (IMO, at least) has little resonance, other than to tie up the story. The ending of "Panic Room," on the other hand, is fascinatingly open-ended, and left me tantalizingly uncertain as to what to feel. It was just a great, great ending.Howard Shore's score is outstanding, and the technical credits, as usual in a Fincher film, are excellent across the board. As always, Fincher has gotten the most out of everyone, from the supporting members and all of the crew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Panic room is a nicely done film. The concept is really interesting because the Panic Room was supposed to be the safest room, and after all it turns out to be the most dangerous one. Many nice camera techniques are used in this film and it looks very good. The director obviously paid a lot of attention to detail. From the credits to the final scenes the cinematography is top notch. Jodie Foster was just amazing and her character was a very intriguing one because Meg seemed often confused, vulnerable, and strong at the same time. Forest Whitaker did a great job with his character. The character of Burnham is an interesting one because he was a paradox between good and evil. Overall this film is worth watching, so take a look inside the panic room and you'll be sure to have a thrilling experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PANIC ROOM Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSWhen their New York brownstone is invaded by three men intent on robbery, a mother (Jodie Foster) and her young daughter (Kristen Stewart) take refuge in an impregnable 'Panic Room' which contains the very item the thieves have come to steal...David Fincher's follow-up to his much-acclaimed FIGHT CLUB (1999) is an exercise in cinematic excess, recalling Brian De Palma at his most visually audacious. David Koepp's taut screenplay unfolds within a single set, sparsely furnished and lit with noirish intensity, where Foster and Stewart play a game of cat and mouse with their enigmatic assailants: Forest Whitaker plays a safe-cracker determined to do his job without hurting anyone, Dwight Yoakam is the trigger-happy psycho who believes violence is the solution to all their problems, and Jared Leto acts up a storm as the ringleader, a cocky young buck whose loudmouthed bluster masks an absence of common sense.Notable set-pieces include an attempt by Whitaker and co. to flush Foster and Stewart out of the panic room by pumping gas through the ventilation system, with spectacular consequences; Foster's desperate attempts to secure a telephone line to the outside world before the villains can foil her plan; a terrifying episode in which she's forced to leave the panic room in search of a cell phone; and the climactic face-off, which - not unexpectedly - ends in bloodshed and tears. The film's visual gymnastics are a joy to behold, combining graceful cinematography (by ace craftsmen Conrad Hall and Darius Khondji) and CGI trickery which propels the camera through doors, windows, vents and openings of every conceivable description, and Fincher uses every trick in the book to tighten the screws for his terrified protagonists. Gripping, stylised and hugely rewarding, this ranks among the director's best work to date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was it the giant plot holes or the physically impossible scenarios or the overacting or the bad writing that made me hate this film? Can't decide. What I can decide is that if you think about this movie at all, you'll hate it. If you just watch it and accept all it's lapses in realism and reason, you might enjoy it.But what bothers me the most is why does it seem so impossible to make a credible thriller anymore. Silence Of The Lambs was great. Seven was good (despite Brad Pitt). Fight Club was decent (despite the ending). But unless you've got a premise that allows your perception of reality to be suspended (as in The Matrix) you really can't get away with plot holes and defying the laws of physics without becoming ridiculous. Then you have to resort to bull**** like showing off the actress's bod.Two stars for Jodie's rack and Dwight Yoakam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Fincher at his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would first like to point out that this movie is the perfect example of the genius that is David Fincher. No other director that I can think of of the top of my head, except perhaps Ridley Scott, could have successfully adapted this type of a story to the silver-screen, let alone make it as GOOD as he did. This is, to put it short, the most suspenseful film I have ever watched. Upon leaving the theater I was so tense that I felt like yelling as loud as I could to vest the feeling. And I loved ever second of it. From the first five minutes, until the credits began to roll, not a single sound came from the audience witnessing the spectacle. Not one. Not a cough, not a laugh, not a clearing of a throat. The entire crowd was caught in Fincher's brilliance. He has, perhaps, out done himself. I cannot possible imagine how he will ever be able to top this movie. But, I pray he does. He seems, with every movie he has released, to improved on aspects from the one before. Se7en was much better than Alien3, The Game, though not better in my opinion, showed him experimenting and trying to make it better. Fight Club was a major improvement cinematography wise(and to some, plot wise) from all predecessor's, and now, Panic Room, in my opinion, has topped them all in every aspect. My recommendation is that you watch it. Then watch it again. You'll like it even more the second time. Trust me. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fantastic cat-and-mouse thriller that delivers with the sortof steely, intelligent gusto not seen since DePalma and Polanski'sgreat work of the 70's. This movie is chilling, smart, formidablyacted, directed with muscle, and above all else entertaining, acorker and a half of a popcorn flick. What's more, while "Panic Room" is primarily a ripping action yarn,it also happens to possess a significant amount of weight as amultifacted satire of class, security, family, and surveillance. Thiselement is delicate and subtle, just as the social commentary wasin Fincher's not altogether dissimilar "The Game," but it is sincereand effective without ever overwhelming the fascinating plot or -more importantly - the tension at large. Keep your eyes open -Fincher isn't simply an empty stylist, but as he's proven in all of hisfilms to date, he's a keen observer and possessed of a sly, darkwit that goes beyond his camera pyrotechnics.But I'm reading too much into it already, or at least missing thepoint of its real qualities - the fact that it more or less kicks ass.Suffice it to say, "Panic Room" is a great ride, and highlyrecommended to anyone looking for a genuinely tense andexciting thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to Panic Room last night with two of my girlfriends and several times we were clawing at each other in suspense. Fincher's attention to detail is just amazing -- how he takes us through every keyhole, everywhere you didn't know a camera could go and still can't figure out how they did it. What a great movie, I strongly recommend it. I think we've all learned an important lesson after watching this movie about the importance of having a panic room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly done, as if I expected anything else from Fincher.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As David Fincher is one of my favorite directors (next to Kubrick, Scorsese, and Coppola), I was anticipating this movie's release for months. I saw it tonight and was absolutely blown off my feet. Now, let me assure you that this is not your typical "thriller", as I knew it wouldnt be. This was not a movie theater teen slash movie that you'd go to with a girlfriend or boyfriend, with little stupid suspenseful scenes where the person hears something and turns around and its just their little brother coming downstairs for a drink of water. No, its not like that. With even a plot as simply thought as Panic Room's, Fincher refuses to give in and sign the teen slasher cheesy directing paper. He scared me with simply the theme of the movie. He constantly reminded me what was going on in the film, and how petrified I know I'd be if I were in Meg's (Jodie Foster) position. I guarantee all of you reading this that this movie would not be as scary as it is if it wasnt Fincher in the director's chair. The fear he puts on the characters' faces, the way he set up the whole story through the camera, and especially his camera placement and movement. He throws in all of his unique directing trademarks, most of which will remind you of Fight Club, and does them all the right times. The camera placement and movement alone scared me. I will now say that Fincher is one of the most thought provoking directors in the movie world. He makes his movies come alive, and with simply his angles, timing, and movement of the camera in coordination with the characters makes you think. Perhaps I'm speaking a little too deeply here. Fincher fans should understand what I'm talking about, especially after you see this, unless you already havent. This movie is strongly strongly recommended. I'd definately pay another 8.50 to see it again... in fact I'm considering going again tomorrow with a friend who wants to see it. David Fincher will one day be recognized as one of our greatest filmmakers, as long as he keeps making films like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After making three bonafide masterpieces in a row -- Se7en, The Game, and his best, Fight Club; Fincher returns with Panic Room. Admittedly, I wanted my butt kicked full throttle like the previous outings. While Panic Room is far and away better then the typical Hollywood thriller, this is still very much so a studio film. Panic Room doesn't have the menacing feel or the hell with it attitude of his previous films, but that doesn't mean it isn't any good. Panic Room is a VERY entertaining movie, and not to mention pretty on a visual sense. The cast is all good, but Dwight Yoakam in particular shines as the psychotic heavy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Foster, Fincher Take Suspense To A Higher Level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone likes to think that they'd know what they would do-- without hesitation, yet-- if suddenly and unexpectedly confronted with a perilous, even life-threatening, situation. It's human nature; we all want to feel, or at least believe, that we are always in control of everything that happens in our lives. But, upon reflection, if that IS, in fact, what you think, then you're probably not being entirely honest with yourself. Because unless you're Dirty Harry, or someone of that ilk (and take note, the key word here is `are,' not `think' you are), you're not really going to know how you'd react to any such situation until the moment of truth is actually upon you. And it's that moment that director David Fincher enables you to experience, albeit vicariously, in `Panic Room,' a suspense/thriller that very quickly takes you to a very dark place-- a place few have actually ever been or would care to go, if given the choice. But, of course, when it comes to a situation like the one depicted in this film, that's the rub: You simply do not get to choose whether or not you want to participate. And when you really think about it, it's a concept that is more than a bit disconcerting, to say the least. Because whether or not you want it, if it happens, you are going to be confronted with that moment of truth; and in that moment, you will probably learn more about yourself than you've ever known before. As the film begins, recently divorced New Yorker Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) is being shown a property, a spacious Brownstone Townhouse, which she ultimately decides upon and secures for herself and her teenage daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart). They move in, and prepare for their first night in the new house. What Meg cannot know, however, is that someone else has an eye on her house, but it has nothing to do with wanting to live there. His name is Junior (Jared Leto), whom, as it happens, knew the previous tenant-- a wealthy, and apparently paranoid recluse-- more than just a bit. He also knows (or at least thinks he does) that there is something extremely valuable hidden in that house. And now that the previous owner has passed on, Junior wants it. Toward that end, he recruits a couple of acquaintances, Burnham and Raoul (Forest Whitaker and Dwight Yoakam) to help him get it. But as fate would have it, Junior makes his move on the very night that Meg and Sarah move into the house, which as far as Junior knows, is still vacant. They break in successfully, but it all goes south quickly when they discover the house is occupied, a situation for which Junior and his gang have no contingency plans; and their hesitation enables Meg and Sarah to make it to a safe room-- the `Panic Room' of the title-- a virtually impregnable room built by the previous owner as a safeguard against intruders. And with the aid of a closed-circuit video surveillance/security system, Meg is able to monitor the movements of the trespassers throughout the house from inside her fortress, and she has no intention of emerging until they are gone. But Junior is adamant; and he's not about to leave until he has what he came for. And at that point, the standoff begins. In his previous films (especially `Se7en') Fincher has established his use of a dark, brooding atmosphere-- pregnant with foreboding-- to enhance the suspense and drama of his story, and this film is no exception. Night falls, and Fincher uses the oncoming darkness and the stillness of the house to create a sense of isolation that is the subtle beginning of the tension he will continue to build and maintain throughout the film. He also uses some imaginative camera work, slowly exploring the house from the audience's point-of-view, which-- combined with Meg's initial apparent trepidation upon entering the panic room itself-- gives it all a pointedly claustrophobic feeling. Those with difficulties in that regard, in fact, may experience some uneasiness during a good portion of this film because of it; and it simply demonstrates what a good job Fincher did in creating the setting he wanted, and which he uses so effectively here to keep you on the edge of your seat.  The plot is fairly basic, with an inherently narrow framework within which Fincher must work; but he sets a perfect pace and has an inventive touch both visually and psychologically that enables him to take an average screenplay (by David Koepp) to a higher level in the finished product. Considering the storyline, some of what happens is-- some would say predictable-- though I prefer to call it inevitable (granted, a thin line differentiates the two; in this case, however, I feel `inevitable' is more accurate), and there are some surprises, which Fincher uses to great advantage. It's no surprise, however, that what really elevates this film is the totally convincing performance by Jodie Foster as Meg. Long one of the best actors around, she has the talent and ability to turn any material she's given into so much more than any writer or director could possibly hope to expect. What makes her so remarkable-- as she is in this film-- is not only the fact that she can create such a believable character, but that she can do it with such intelligence and resourcefulness. You have but to look into Foster's eyes to realize how much is going on constantly behind them; this is one savvy lady whom you can readily believe is always one step ahead of everyone else in the room. And she goes a long way in proving that true beauty is, indeed, more than skin deep; she's attractive to begin with, but in a pair of black, horn-rimmed glasses, she looks ravishing. In the final analysis, `Panic Room' is Foster's film; and she makes it a satisfying cinematic experience for her audience. 9/10.     </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie the other night with high expectations. David Fincher has directed 2 of my fav. films, Fight Club and Seven. Jodie Foster is one of my fav. actresses. She has yet to give a bad performance in a movie.Now, usually when expectations are high, the film doesn't deliver. This film delivers.Foster plays Meg Altman, who is buying a new home for her and her daughter after the break up of her marriage.The new house has a 'panic room', a room that is secure and can not be broken into. It has it's own phone line, security cameras monitoring the whole house and basicly everything you would need to survive if you had to hide there. The house is broken into, and what the bad guys want is in the panic room.And so starts the fun! Jodie is great, as is the girl who plays her daughter. The relationship between them seems real. The bad guys are bad, but they are human which is great. They aren't two dimensional characters, which most bad guys in the movies are these days.Any one who likes thrillers, which are few and far between these days, should see this film. It is definitely one of the very few thrillers that thrills!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jodie Foster (Silence of the lambs) stars in David Fincher's claustrophobic thriller as Meg, a mother who, along with her daughter Sarah, get trapped inside a panic room whilst robbers invade their house.I'm a big fan of the claustrophobic thriller genre, having scene great films like Air force one and Die Hard, which are both set in just the one main place are excellent viewing and very gripping. This 2002 picture is fairly exciting, but doesn't match the excitement of those other thrillers.Taking a while to get going, Panic room centres around, well a panic room in Meg's new house. The setting is very cold, with horrible grey walls and little supplies to get a feel of claustrophobia. Though the setting is there, by the end of the film I felt it could have been executed so much better, as could have the performances.By far the worst performances I have seen Foster and Whitaker (Last King of Scotland) give in their careers, though in fairness, it does come down to a poorly scripted plot.The dialogue between all the characters is so poor I wanted to rewrite it for myself. Given the intense situations encoded, there could have been much sharper and intense speaking involved giving a feel of the emotional and stressful situations that the characters found themselves in.Fincher's direction is very bizarre, with one shot trailing from floor to floor I was wondering what mood he was trying to achieve by using that particular shot. Though it improved, his other films including fight club were so much better.Despite its faults, I still couldn't tear myself away with the situations and settings the best bits of the film.The situations are excellent as is the setting but had there been a better written plot and more intense dialogue, it would have been up there with the best thrillers, but unfortunately it isn't and only makes it into the mediocre category</fullReview>

All the actors portrayed their characters pretty good, not letting them stand out and they also developed through the story. Some little flaws as are the situations the characters find themselves are a bit out of the frame but let go of it and you'll get a good one. There's also some suspense and moments where the second matters. Those moments make you rush...

		<fullReview>Panic Room is set in New York City where recently divorced Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) &amp; her young daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) move into a new house which has a panic room built in which is designed for the owners of the house to hide in if the house is broken into. It just so happens that three thieves break into the house that very night in search of twenty odd million dollars hidden in safe by the previous owner who died, both Meg &amp; Sarah make it into the panic room which is impossible to breach from the outside but unfortunately what the thieves want is actually inside the panic room &amp; as such there is stand off as the thieves want to get in while Meg &amp; Sarah want to get out...Directed by David Fincher this decent thriller is alright but nothing that special. The script by David Koepp has a pretty solid base story with Meg &amp; her daughter trapped inside the panic room with three thieves wanting to get in &amp; no way of getting outside help, unfortunately the film drags badly &amp; becomes quite repetitive as we get lots of scenes of the thieves arguing &amp; trying to come up with ways of making Meg &amp; Sarah come out. Yawn. Having said that towards the end there's a neat twist in which the roles are reversed as the thieves become trapped in the panic room with Meg outside with a gun waiting to shoot them when they come out. Overall I thought it was alright, I didn't like the character's that much, the dialogue is forgettable &amp; one could say it's far fetched at times but at least it kept me watching. I wouldn't say I was glued to the screen but it did keep me interested although I wouldn't call it brilliant or anything like that &amp; I will have probably completely forgotten all about it by the end of the week. Panic Room also uses the standard Hollywood plot device of diabetes for putting someone is immediate danger of dying, I have diabetes &amp; while what happens in Panic Room is theoretically possible it's very unlikely that Meg would suffer a life threatening hypo 'out of the blue' like she does (she is seen eating earlier that night) &amp; Panic Room like many other films gives the impression that us diabetics will suddenly collapse &amp; die if we don't inject ourselves every two minutes with insulin which is complete crap.Director Fincher does OK, he films everything in very muted colours as is the trend for these sorts of films. There's a surprising amount of CGI computer effects in a film that you would initially have thought wouldn't need many, Fincher has his camera travel up along inside pipes &amp; through 'solid' floors &amp; wall. Some of the effects are OK while other's look fake. The violence is minimal, there are a few gunshot wounds including a couple to the head &amp; someone is beaten up. I wouldn't call it scary or that atmospheric but there are a few scenes which manage to raise some tension. The film reminds me of Phone Booth (2002) made the same year since it's stars are trapped in a single location with some bad guy's keeping them there but while Phone Booth tried to say something &amp; only lasted 80 odd minutes Panic Room doesn't &amp; didn't. According to the IMDb's 'Trivia' section the opening credit sequence of Panic Room took a year to complete, after having seen them yesterday all I can say is why?With a supposed budget of about $48,000,000 one has to say that sounds like a lot of money considering it's set almost entirely within one location with only six people in the thing although Foster apparently go paid $12,000,000. Nicole Kidman was originally cast as Meg &amp; started shooting the film but had to pull out after a recurring knee injury sustained on Moulin Rouge! (2002) so Foster was then cast, I don't think any of the Kidman footage has ever surfaced but I would have probably preferred her in the role since I don't really like Foster. The acting is general is alright but nothing special.Panic Room is an OK thriller that I liked on a basic level but didn't think it was any sort of classic, I thought it was too repetitive &amp; I didn't like anyone in it that much.</fullReview>

And let's not forget that is has been directed by the very talented David Fincher.Okay, if you have read the plot of this film, you expect it to be realistic, no? Well, you're wrong. On the contrary, it's unrealistic, in an encouraging and maybe disappointing way. If you want to watch this film just to find advice to help you when your house has been broken in, then the only thing you'll get is: Lock yourself in a room and call the police. There's nothing else. Seriously.But that doesn't drive me nuts. I really like it that the fact that it's unrealistic because it will actually be interesting. Come on, if the film was realistic, it would have been tedious and boring. I like the outlandish situations the characters get themselves into and I know that you would like to see how they get out of them, by using their INTELLIGENCE.That's what makes this film so great. You have a point of view on the goodies and baddies (surprisingly the baddies aren't clichéd) and you see them playing a chess game with each other. The cinematography is great and so is the score.The performance by Jodie Foster is really good, as always. Forest Whitaker gives us a sympathetic (unnatural characteristic for a baddie) and sometimes dangerous performance and Dwight Yoakam is down right sinister and ugly, in a good way.This is a well crafted thriller that will get your attention. It doesn't linger or goes out of steam. Instead, it keeps throwing you more original ideas after another until the movie finishes. The performances are great, the look really great, and the script is good. Want to watch a well made thriller? Watch this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very scary thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first looked at the DVD cover, I saw Jodie Foster lying in the bed with a man in the doorway. I assumed the movie will be about a man locking a woman in a closet and she panic as she tries to find a way out. I was wrong. It's about a burglary, and a mother and daughter seek safety inside a vault-like room called the panic room. You may think this movie as boring, just about a family panicking inside a room. Actually, this is a very scary movie, and will knock you off your chair as you see it. The performances are overachieving, (always expect that from Jodie Foster). But to let you know it's just not about people waiting inside the panic room. Meg, the mother, leaves the panic room because she has to get medicine for her daughter, Sarah. i thought the action is very good, everything just fits. I say its a horror/action/drama. There are some flaws, they are usually minor, but sometimes very easy to point out. David Fincher doesn't make this movie to thrill you, he makes this movie to scare the heck out of you. Although this movie could be a really bad film because the plot is really simple: (2 people stuck in a room and 3 people try to break in.), but is a very simple but thrilling film. A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't a film that will appeal to everyone, but it certainly appealed to me. It's a movie everything fits into a closed space - literally and figuratively- and every move by one character directly impacts the others. Others have likened it to a chess game, and the analogy is apt.I wouldn't call the characters particularly deep, but that's not really the point in a film like this. We see just enough background of each character so we know what motivates each of their moves. It's more like a short story than a novel in this way.The only disappointment I had was that the nature of the plot requires an ending that is sort of tacked on. I didn't think it was a terrible way to finish the film, just not particularly satisfying.Definitely worth a video rental if you're looking for something kind of interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, effective thriller, kept above average by a skilled director and a committed cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout the '90s David Fincher emerged as one of the most talented and interesting American directors of his generation, delivering four bold, fascinating films, two of which (Se7en and Fight Club) stand out as decade-defining (alongside the likes of Pulp Fiction, Magnolia and other gems). This is why his fifth feature, Panic Room, may seem an odd choice at first: a straightforward thriller with none of the director's typical shocks and twists, it is as close to mainstream as Fincher has got thus far. But in his hands even a conventional story manages to rise above the standard level, so while it isn't a genre classic, the movie is professionally executed and very likely to please most viewers.The film gets its title from a bunker located in a New York apartment. Once you enter this bunker, you are completely safe from any external threats. But what if the burglars who break into the apartment are actually looking for something that is inside that room? And what if they are led by the guy (Forest Whitaker) who designed the whole security system? These are the questions Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) will have to answer as they embark on a cat-and-mice game with Burnham (Whitaker) and his associates, the edgy Junior (Jared Leto) and the cold, gun-carrying Raoul (Dwight Yoakam).If handed to another director, David Koepp's script would probably have been turned into something overly contrived and unconvincing. Fincher, on the other hand, embraced the realistic aspects of the concept and manages to get most of the tension out of a believable scenario, with the exception of a few set-pieces (the burning propane especially) which, as superbly achieved as they may be (Fincher is a real camera virtuoso), simply are hard to buy in this kind of film. The other key element is the characters, who, thanks to the actors portraying them, manage to convince despite being fairly archetypal (this is particularly true in the case of Foster and Whitaker: they manage to save roles that could have been awful if miscast), and the tension between victims and crooks (and within the latter group as well, thanks to terrific work from Leto) is consistently palpable and real.As for the trickiest aspect of a film like this (how to end it), that is actually the only point where both writer and director fail to deliver, the conclusion being too flat and unsatisfactory if compared to the premise. Prior to that, however, there isn't a dull moment in the whole film, proving that even when he's going mainstream Fincher is capable of doing something a little bit more interesting than the usual Hollywood production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want wanna those rooms in my house</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie started off great, even the opening scenes were very eye catching. With a combination of special effects and good camera work, we saw burglars attempting to break into the huge loft Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) lived in. We even got a shot of the burglars through the fine crevices of the keyhole in a door.The movie then became an exciting game of cat and mouse. That game is always more intriguing when humans are involved. The panic room was the safe haven for Meg and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart), but obviously the movie would have been very boring if they just ran into the panic room and stayed there until help arrived. Many other variables were cleverly introduced to add suspense, and Jodie is good at playing the anxious suspense role.The movie ended kind of weakly though. Usually when you hit someone with a sledge hammer and knock them down a flight of stairs they die, or are severely injured. Ramon, on the other hand, was still able to climb back up the flight of stairs he was knocked down and pose a viable threat. Just a tad thick on the villain aspect of this flick, but still good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has got to be a classic suspense/thriller movie. From the very beginning your mind will began to wonder about the "panic room". You will definitely be on the edge of your seat once the story line completely opens up. It doesn't drag out, about 10 minutes into the movie and it gets right to the action. All actors did a great job and the movie was well shot. The colors in this movie, which a mostly dark, gives it a very eerie feel. Which is probably what the director intended. The ending is one of the best that i have seen in a suspense/ thriller movie. Be sure to have this one in your collection. You will be satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but ultimately memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many movies do you know where the movie takes place entirely inside ONE location, and where there are two stories taking place, interdependent but almost totally cut off from one another as well? The robbers and the mom and daughter have very few means of communicating, yet the story rests on their interplay. It's a very tough job to stretch a story like that into an hour and a half.It almost manages to do it. Sure, it gets pretty contrived at times, and the characters tend to go a little off from time to time to suit the labyrinthine plot, but all in all, it works.David Fincher is adept at claustrophobic feels in his movies, so he was a natural choice. The fancy camera moves are a little "lookit meee!" and have aged a little (moviegoers nowadays are too adept at spotting CGI, and it's a little too easy to see it here), but I like David Fincher before this movie and I still do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film4 is showing a weekend season dedicated to David Fincher , a director who is held in high regard but one who I've been keen on . In fact when people describe him as the best director of his generation my eyes roll over . Regardless I sat down to watch PANIC ROOM mainly because there was nothing else on The first thing to strike you about the film is the cinematography . It has a well shot murky quality to it , perhaps better than the film deserves . If there's a bad point to this then it perhaps belongs to a different movie . If anyone is looking for cinematographers to shoot a gloom laden post apocalyptic drama then give Conrad Hall or Daruis Khondji a call Of course cinematography can only carry a film so far and it's storytelling that's important and this is where the film collapses .The first half hour plays out like one of these daytime TV shows where someone inspects a house they want to buy which makes for an uninvolving start but once the story properly starts so do the serious problems . Like so many other thrillers PANIC ROOM has an idiot plot where if someone stops being an idiot the film will end . Some films get away with this due to the excitement levels where as PANIC ROOM doesn't . Imgine if you were in the same predicament as the female protagonist here and you briefly had access to a mobile phone . Who would you phone , the police or your ex-husband ? see what I mean by idiot plot ? Once again we see Hollywood coming up with a very good premise and it being sabotaged by the way the screenplay develops . What could have and should have been a tightly claustrophobic similar to the original ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 where the suspension of disbelief is upheld ends up becoming a rather unengaging film featuring complete idiots . It also illustrates that no matter who the director is he needs a good screenplay to make a good film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Domestic Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The conceit sounds too good to be true: a mother and her diabetic daughter move into a chic Manhattan townhouse which has a panic room made expressly for emergencies. It so happens, it also contains bonds worth in excess of millions. Three thieves are after these bonds and will stop at nothing to get their hands on them. They break into the apartment, forcing mother and daughter to hide in the panic room while the daughter's medication is still on the outside. A progressively tense chess game between her, her daughter, and her captors ensues during the course of one long night.David Fincher hits the right note once more with this domestic thriller. Pointing as a reference to WAIT UNTIL DARK, he makes the narration as sparse as possible to get into the meat of the story. As written by David Koepp, nothing is laid to waste and no sooner than Meg Altman is in her apartment that her own security and that of her daughter's is put on the line and the mundane becomes more and more nail-biting as the situations become tense and threaten to veer out of control. Jodie Foster plays Meg with the perfect balance of femininity and steel this kind of role requires her to and Forest Whittaker is a great foil, a man caught on the wrong side of the tracks, who has a good soul.PANIC ROOM is one of those instant classics that asks for repeated views because even when there is the requisite moment of violence late in the film, it is believable and serves as an emotional outlet because of the anguish Meg and her daughter are subjected to. With one of those Hitchcock endings where things are best left to the viewer to determine just how events played themselves out, this is the thinking man's thriller, tight, compact, beautifully constructed. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The majority of people who have seen 'Panic Room' have given it positive feedback. I've just bought it on DVD and have watched it previously. It's a film that you can watch and enjoy through out. Great performances from Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart strengthen the story and creates that 'close your eyes suspense'. Never boring and always exciting to watch, 'Panic Room' is a universal film that appeals to the action/thriller genre fanatic. The camera-work is a CSI esquire 'zoom in' 'zoom out' style. Excellent and realistic subtle special effects draws you deeper and is not over the top like other films. 10/10 because throughly enjoyed it to the end and is one of my favourite films.

		<fullReview>On paper, "Panic Room" (2002) doesn't seem as powerful as David Fincher's three previous movies: Se7en (1995), the Game (1997) and Fight Club (1999). The originality of these three movies that contributed to develop Fincher's image as a unique author is, here, largely absent. It is even a little difficult to believe that he has made this thriller because we don't really recognize his stamp in spite of a few clues (the tracking shots that zoom inside keyholes). Be that as it may, I don't question Fincher's making because "Panic Room" is a thriller which doesn't disappoint too much.Very inspired by Alfred "hitch" Hitchcock (certain movements of camera evoke certain great sequence shots from the master of suspense), the movie is shrouded in a tense and oppressive atmosphere as soon as the burglars break into the apartment. As for the famous "panic room", it is basically a safe place but Fincher does very well by turning it into a threatening room, nearly a vault. Its disturbing aspect is perfectly rendered by the light which badly shines.The script is well designed but it doesn't exclude a few faults. One can underline a lack of inventiveness from the starting idea (the reversal of situation after about 80 minutes of movie is a good example) and the ending disappoints because conventional and cosy. Something tells me that Hollywood passed through that. But the scriptwriter David Koepp did very well very his job for that kind of story: to be suspenseful as much as possible. The proof: it is nearly impossible not to feel stress, shivers and anxiety. One can also thank him for having introduced a certain humor in such a story.At last, 2 actors lead without problems the cast: Jodie Foster who is excellent as usual and I would grant a mention to Forest Whitaker, the best of the three gangsters.At the end of this critic, it is true that Fincher's opus can't hold a candle to his previous movies but it remains a well-crafted thriller.</fullReview>

The young girl is a punk with an attitude that is fostered by her too-liberal mother. The film in general is just a little too politically-correct, too, as there are three criminals all breaking into Foster's house and the black guy is the only one shown with a heart. The two white guys, of course, are heartless. Dwight Yokum plays an ultra-profane pig, but that's a normal role for him in films. Jodie Foster isn't real likable here, either, as the mom.The camera-work and David Fincher's direction is very good, especially with the low-angle shots in which the camera roams around the house at about floor level. That's very cool. His direction, along with a suspenseful story, makes this film intriguing.In summary: a mean-edged film that works.</fullReview>

In "Panic Room", she and her daughter (Kristen Stewart) have to hide in an impenetrable room to escape some thieves (Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, Jared Leto). Probably the best thing about the movie is how each side seems to have a way to outdo the other. But it's also likely to make you suspicious of your own house; just what IS inside a given house.So, even if this is escapism, it's done well. It's always good to know that Jodie Foster isn't afraid to take gritty roles, and that David Fincher ("Se7en", "The Game", "Fight Club") is turning out such interesting movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does exactly what is says on the tin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher's 'Panic Room' is a tense, efficient movie rather in the manner of Spielberg's 'Duel', a thriller that does exactly what it says on the tin. The similarities include the fact that both films feature a trade-off between protagonists who cannot communicate with each other: in Spielberg's movie, two drivers locked in their vehicles and in this film, a wealthy divorcée and her child who buy a house with a "panic room" (a place to hide from intruders) who promptly have to use it when their home is burgled. However, whereas Fincher's previous movies - 'Alien3', 'Se7en', 'The Game' (my own favourite) and 'Fight Club' were all at some level intellectually interesting, the same cannot be said of 'Panic Room', which follows all the rules of its genre and contains several scenes of purest corn that you can see coming from twenty miles off. In spite of that, you can't deny that Fincher is good at this sort of stuff; clichéd or not, it's still highly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly Fincher's best film yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every so often a an off-the-wall director plays it straight. Sometimes it blunts their edge, like Robert Altman's Grisham-by-numbers adaptation of The Gingerbread Man. Sometimes it produces an entrancing oddity, like David Lynch's The Straight Story. However it sometimes brings out the best of the director, and Panic Room is a massive example of this, showing David Fincher's class through and through. The story revolves around Meg, a recent divorcee who moves into a cavernous property in Manhattan that looks for all the world like the dream property to take care of her daughter. However on their first night in the house a trio of burglars break in and a stand-off ensues with Meg and daughter trapped in an impenetrable bunker in the middle of the house (the titular Panic Room) and whilst the burglars trying to get in to access a hidden safe. It is the greatest credit to the cast, writer and director that a stock genre situtation is shown in such a fresh and vital light throughout. From Forrest Whittaker's compromised morality to Jared Leto's drug addicted craziness each role seems so real it would be an injustice to attempt to describe them in a few lines. These are not characters, these are people and people can only be defined in a few sentences by a great artist, and here there is definate evidence of greatness at work. However where the film finds real depth is in the character of Meg. After Nicole Kidman withdrew because of injuries sustained during Moulin Rouge, Jodie Foster was brought in and the character of Meg toughened up and made less glamourous. This change in the character opens up completely different areas of the film. With the absent husband / father having left for a young model, Kidman would have lent the film an air of rejected fragile beauty being slowly crushed before finding her inner strength. A classic tale of having to reach the bottom to find a way up. However with Foster's tougher screen personna we have a battle of the rejected woman trying to re-assert her ability to function in the world alone as stronger as she did before and determined to lose no diginity along the way. The trio of intruders become like phantoms of her husband whilst her claustrophic fear of the Panic Room mirrors her fear of this strange and new world closing in around her. Given the trust of writer and director, Foster lets her body do all the acting and gives a master class in showing how dialogue should illustrate everything the character isn't saying. Fincher's visual style builds on Fight Club, even from a credit sequence that recalls North By Northwest but stands on its own in invention and execution. The whole film seems to be shot in a new form of 3D where every object seems perfectly natural, but with heightened depths, as if you were admiring the craftsmanship of a perfectly rendered computer simulation, but without being able to see any flaws. This works perfectly in the claustrophobic confines of Panic Room where the viewer is drawn into each room of the house and left standing next to the protaganists. Despite featuring a couple of scenes which will have you screaming at the screen because of the characters stupidity to do the sensible thing, it is hard to find fault with David Koepp's taught script. However without Fincher's obsessively bleak vision to give it an edge Panic Room would have been another slick forgetable thriller, instead it is classic film-making that truly deserves the title of 21st century Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panic Room (2002, Dir. David Fincher)Recently divorced Meg Altman and her daughter Sarah have bought a new home in New York. On their tour around the mansion, they come across the panic room. A room so secure, that no one can get in. When three burglars break in, Meg makes a move to the panic room. But all her troubles don't stop there. The criminals know where she is, and what they require the most in the house is in that very room.Good thrillers are hard to come across these days. You get mostly bad movies with the occasional good flicks. 'Panic Room' isn't the worst thriller film, but isn't the greatest, but it is definitely still a wonderful ride for those who enjoy thriller films. The cast is perfect with some great dialogue coming from everyone, especially Forest Whitaker. The story is fairly basic. She's stuck in the panic room and can't escape. But the different ways in which he tries to achieve this are interesting, and you really start to wonder what is going through her mind and what you would do in the same situation. If you want a good night fright, then watch this, as there is a good chance you would enjoy it."Say "F***"." - Sarah (Kristen Stewart) "F***" - Meg (Jodie Foster)"No. Say "F*** Off"." - Sarah (Kristen Stewart) "F*** Off." - Meg (Jodie Foster)</fullReview>
