		<shortDescription>The charming social construction of history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be a charming film and very engaging on both a personal and a social level. The story is drawn from the lives of an East Berlin family struggling to cope with the changing world as their way of life is challenged. The father, having reportedly left the family for the West years before, is not present and the mother replaces her spousal needs with the love of her country and its way of life.The premise of the film centers on the frail mother, who falls into a coma mere weeks before the fall of the Berlin wall. Eight months later, she regains consciousness, and her children are told not to excite her, lest she have another episode.Bound by their love of their mother, the son and daughter seek to shield her from the changes in her culture. In their apartment, they recreate the conditions of the world she remembers, right down to the labels on the food they serve her. As the mother comes into contact with the inevitable disparities between her new world and the one she remembers, the son compounds the deception, eventually creating false newscasts to explain the phenomena she witnesses in a manner more consistent with her core assumptions of life.The film is touching, tender, funny and dramatic. However, the elements that really drew me in were the historical construction and the plot device of deception. The historical construction was the way in which the son, through his efforts to explain the increasingly Westernized elements of German society his mother observes, recreates East Germany as the country he could have faith in. As he recreates history to incorporate current events, he softens the harshness of the party rhetoric, reforming the socialistic ideal closer to the compassion for the masses and the acceptance of the 'enemy' capitalists. The film makes ample use of actual news footage in his narrative, footage that adds sharp contrast to Alex's version.This contrast is a striking reminder about how much of our social conscience is constructed through the lenses we choose to observe reality and recall history. Alex had quickly come to give up his socialist devotion (though the film does make it clear form the beginning that the adult Alex was already disenchanted with it). But as Alex fabricates news reports and artifacts for the illusion he's providing his mother, he actually appears to be inventing a system of socialism that he can feel proud of. It's almost as if in trying to console his mother, he connects to her by reinterpreting her world into something he can interface with, building common ground.How much of our own social history is constructed in this manner? We champion our own system of free market democracy as the 'city on the hill' for other nations. We raise up the virtues of our freedom and individuality (and there are indisputably many virtues), while ignoring some of the more sorted historical results it has yielded. We choose which portions of our history we celebrate, and which portions we condemn to academic obscurity.Americans use history to construct our national mythology. Like Homer and Virgil before us, we compose idealized stories of virtue and create narratives that resound with the language of legendary epics. And because of this mythology building exercise, we often fail to see our own cultural reality for the flawed imperfect collection of group effort that it is. That's why we feel so betrayed when our leaders make simple human mistakes or we see representatives of our culture participating in a manner that runs counter to our values.No where is this phenomenon so pronounced as when it comes to our national leaders. We look back on our founding fathers and through our myth building, elevate them to superhuman stature. Our high school students may not remember what wars Washington fought in or what political initiatives he took but they remember that he cut down a (fictional) cherry tree and refused to lie about it.We remember the elegant words that our predecessors crafted without remembering the pain and suffering their efforts exacted from other people. We remember that Thomas Jefferson advocated 'Equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political ?' while conveniently forgetting that he was ambivalent at best to the degree that freedom extended to those in a state of slavery. We forget that founding father quarreled, that at times they misrepresented each other's interest to foreign leaders and that on occasion may have even tried to kill one another.The founding fathers we remembered were well educated, civil and wise.Against this tapestry of myth we watch contemporary politics play out, trying desperately to spin events into frameworks that reinforce our desires for justice and virtue.We are all Alex, trying to reconstruct a new view of history that makes us more proud of where we come from. We invent and reinvent history to suit our needs and like Alex, do so in the name of providing a safe environment (or better way of life) for others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hello, Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The destruction of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was a historically significant event not just for the people of Germany, but also for much of the rest of the world. Aside from reuniting two vastly different political systems, this remarkable incident marked a turning point for the capitalist uprising occurring within many of the other socialist states. Filmmakers worldwide have since explored the causes and effects of the German Reunification, and even today, they continue to bring new insight and a fresh perspective to an event that occurred nearly fifteen years ago. Wolfgang Becker's GOOD BYE, LENIN! is among the most recent of such films, and probably among the best of them as well.Rather than charging head-on at a specific political standing, GOOD BYE, LENIN! uses carefully controlled satire to poke fun at the absurdities of both communist and capitalist societies. And despite criticism from gung-ho supporters of either system, Becker is careful not to take sides or appear sympathetic toward any political institution. Instead of concentrating exclusively on the governmental changes of the newly reunified Germany, he wisely opts to narrow his focus on the effects that these changes have on one particular Berlin family. By doing this, Becker is able to show the challenges of adapting to a new, unfamiliar way of life in a context that is much more personal and easier for the viewer to identify with.The humor in GOOD BYE, LENIN! is plentiful, and Becker takes advantage of every possible opportunity to fit in a comedic moment. Even during the most somber parts of the story, the film never lets go of its astute sense of humor; and because the humor is always thought-provoking and cleverly executed, it never feels forced or gratuitous. The running joke about Alex's unremitting quest for Spreewald pickle jars and the scene where Alex's bedridden mother is perplexed by the Coca-Cola banner hanging from the building across from hers' are brilliant examples of the movie's sharp, yet sensitive wit. Aside from just being funny in themselves, these bits work doubly well because of their uses of symbolism and metaphor. The Spreewald pickles, now impossible to find because of the fall of the GDR, are representative of the `good old days' when Alex was familiar with the ways of his country and when his mother was in good health. His almost frantic search for them shows his longing to return to the way things used to be. Likewise, the unfurling of the Coca-Cola banner is the perfect embodiment of all the capitalist changes occurring within the new Germany. Once you begin to see the Coca-Cola and Burger King logos, you know that capitalism has truly grabbed hold and that there is now no escaping its embrace, for better or for worse.GOOD BYE, LENIN! makes great use of this type of imagery to emphasize the country's transformation and to provide insight to the emotions of the main characters. A most notable instance of this is the scene where Alex's mother, a staunch supporter of socialism, finally leaves her home to a very different East Germany than the one she remembered. She then looks to the sky and sees a helicopter airlifting a statue of Lenin off the top of a building. As Lenin is being hauled away, his outstretched arm seems to be reaching out to her, as if he's calling out for her to rescue him and his ideals, and restore her beloved country.Alex's complex lies and meticulous attempts at preserving the past for his mother are innocent enough at first, but eventually they begin to take on a life of their own. The lengths he goes through to maintain the atmosphere of a bygone era and keep his mother happy are indeed funny, but they are also very tragic as well. Though the lies do work temporarily to keep his mother oblivious to the events outside of her apartment, they also plunge Alex and his family into such a deep pool of deception that they eventually lose their closeness with one another. The stress of keeping up the façade becomes unbearable for Alex, and at one point he even wishes his mother were dead.Other humor was purely cultural, and probably only appreciable by people who have actually experienced the Reunification. I noticed this only because of the native German family sitting in front of me at the theater, laughing in unison at dialogue and images that didn't look to me like they were meant to be interpreted as humorous. But still, even though the older generations of German people are likely to get more out of this movie, it is still a hilarious, heartfelt, and incredibly rewarding experience for people of all cultures and ethnicities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a good film, and I think it needed to be made. A way of life disappeared in Europe, perhaps forever, and it seems appropriate that the fall of Communism has thus been documented.The basic premise of "Goodbye Lenin" is that the young man's mother is in a coma over the months when the Berlin Wall is coming down. She wakes up (oblivious) in united Germany, but as she is so fragile she cannot be allowed to know that everything she held dear has collapsed. What ensues is a comic and moving scenario - her son does his best to pretend that nothing has changed.Yes, the movie is a little drawn-out. And most of the comedy is lost on non-Germans, or those unaware of the political climate in the region. However, there are clear universal issues to be considered; idealism, hope, family. There is one particular scene which I thought encompassed exactly how the main protagonist feels - he is at a bank trying to change his mother's old East German currency into Deutschmarks but the deadline has passed. He becomes aggravated by the sheep-like behaviour of his peers. After all, this is their culture being crushed by McCapitalism, but their individual vaunting ambition blinds them from doing something about it. Very refreshing to see this on the big screen.All in all, "Goodbye Lenin" is a nicely-rounded statement of where the European film industry is heading, and it will appeal to most independent-minded people on both an artistic and political level. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Socially conscious black comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Good Bye, Lenin!' is a fascinating German film that was for unclear reasons denied a best foreign film nomination in the recent Oscars, but I consider it one of the best films I've seen this year. 'Good Bye, Lenin!' is an entertaining and surreal black comedy, that doesn't really stand the test of logic and reality, but beneath the surface it's really a very socially conscious film, that gets across very well the atmosphere and problems of the post-communist East Germany.The story is of Alex, whose mother, a devoted member of the Communist Party, suffers a heart attack which sends her into a coma - through which she sleeps throughout the months of revolution and the fall of the communist regime. When she awakes, the doctors warn Alex not to cause his mother any anxiety or excitement; therefore, he goes to ludicrously immense lengths to keep her convinced that communism in East Berlin is still alive. Not much of it, once again, stands the test of reason, but it's incredibly witty and entertaining, and manages, throughout, to get across some powerful statements.'Good Bye, Lenin!' is both fun and important, a film which I recommend to everyone. Don't be afraid of European cinema; even though the film might be difficult to come by, it's very rewarding and well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't have too many expectations for this film. My partner pitched it to me as a comedy, and I hadn't seen the trailer in a while so I went into thinking that's all it would be. Instead, it really was a sublimely sophisticated film. I had the good fortune to see East Berlin first in July 1989 (there was *ZERO* hint that the wall would be down in 4 months) and then in February 1990. It was an amazing before and after, and I thought this film captured this very well. As a visitor to the East for several months that year, this film really brought back to me the East European Quiet Revolution when everything really did change. The characters going through that change are of course an allegory for the changes all around them- '40 years gone! They sold us up river!' says an old man who represents those who 'lost' in the reunification contrasted to those who won-the youth. Similarly, the contrast of personal re-unification (the children and their father) vs that of the east and west is a wonderfully treated theme through the film?. And of course lies. Lies to comfort us, lies to deal with other lies. A very, very touching film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>clever and amusing comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as Rip Van Winkle slept through the American Revolution and woke up twenty years later to find himself a citizen of a brand new country, so Kathrin Sass, an East German woman, slips into a coma on the eve of the fall of the Berlin Wall only to wake up eight months later a member of a capitalist society. This is the premise of 'Good Bye Lenin,' a clever and affectionate tale about truth, love and family ties that transcends all national borders and boundaries.Kathrin, a woman who has dedicated her life to the perpetuation of Communist Party ideology, suffers a major heart attack that plunges her into a comatose state a few months prior to the dissolution of the land she knows as East Germany. While she is 'asleep,' governments tumble, barriers crumble and a whole new tide of Western goods and values comes flooding eastwards to a ravenous, eagerly awaiting public. Then she wakes up. Fearing that the shock of finding such a radically changed world will lead to a second heart attack, her loving son, Alex, devises an elaborate scheme to shield her from the truth and to make her believe that the world she lives in now is the same world she knew eight months before (the basic premise is not that different from the one in 'Jacob the Liar').'Good Bye Lenin!' is an amusing regional comedy that derives its laughs from two basic sources: the near-slapstick nature of the charade Alex is attempting to perpetrate, and the script's satirical view of a society rushing madly to embrace the joys of unbridled consumerism they have been so long denied. Given its gimmicky premise, 'Good Bye Lenin!' could have emerged as a one-joke comedy were it not for the fine sense of irony and absurdity that writer/director Wolfgang Becker (working with co-writer Bernd Lichtenberg) has brought to the project. In addition, young Daniel Bruhl as Alex and Katrin Sab as Kathrin deliver expert, moving performances that go to the very essence of the mother/child relationship. I must confess that this film, despite its generally upbeat tone, brings with it a certain rueful sadness that the filmmakers may not exactly have intended. Could it really have been a mere fifteen years ago that the events depicted in this film actually happened - a mere fifteen years ago that the future of the human race seemed so full of joy, hope and promise? Now, in a post 9/11 world - where sectarian hatred and international terrorism rule the day - this image of people coming together to cast off the shackles of bondage and embrace freedom seems already like a quaint memory from the long distant past. In a strange way, the film has become something of a relic in its own time, outstripped by a world that has long since moved on to bigger and more dire concerns. 'Good Bye Lenin' reminds us of just how long ago and far away the Cold War really was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small but perfectly formed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I watched it for the second time. I'd seen it at the cinema two years ago, then last night my boyfriend, who hadn't seen it, decided to rent it. I loved it first time round, I loved it second time round, maybe even a tad more than I did originally. With wonderfully engaging characters all round, the film is endowed with a great sense of humour, both visual and verbal (and those Europhobic old Brits keep going on about how the Germans have no sense of humour!), it's socially relevant yet easier to watch than a straight comedy. The script is intelligent yet accessible to anyone, even a shallow teenager with no attention span whatsoever... yet IT is never shallow. And most of all, it's a deeply moving little gem of a film which however never abuses its secure grip on the heart-strings. I could see even my boyfriend was dewy-eyed at some points! And so was I, even more than two years ago. A small but perfectly formed film, it's actually not as small as one might think at first impact. Love (specifically, filial love) is its main theme, treated in a schmaltz-free, fresh, non-superficial and a non-clichéd manner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful portrayal of family and politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of this movie, which is that a young man has to do all in his power to stop his mother who is recovering from a heart attack learning of what's happened to Germany while she was in a coma, is absolutely delicious, but it's a premise that could easily go wrong. However, I'm pleased to report that it certainly didn't go wrong, and through interesting characterisation, a great script and some thought-provoking ideas; Good Bye, Lenin! is a winner all the way! An excellent ensemble gives way to a story that has a lot of heart, and one that makes it's points - both politically and otherwise - without the use of a sledgehammer. Good Bye, Lenin! is one of those films that is what you make of it; on the one hand, it's a touching and entertaining story of a boy's journey into adulthood and his love for his mother, but on the other hand; it's a biting political satire that intertwines themes of how our perception of certain truths can impact our lives.Daniel Brühl, a young Spanish talent, takes the lead role as 'Alex', the young man at the centre of the tale. Through his subtle acting, Daniel is able to capture the determination and adoration that epitomise his character wonderfully. He is joined by the beautiful Chulpan Khamatova, Maria Simon and Alexander Beyer, who lend support to Brühl, as his girlfriend, sister and sister's boyfriend respectively, along with Kathrin Sass, who takes the central role of the mother recovering from a heart attack. I can't pick a single fault with any one of them. The setting of the fall of the Berlin Wall serves as a great place to set this story, as it allows the film to give a commentary on the changes of Germany's political landscape at the same time as allowing us to take in themes of family, love and the perception of truth that are abundantly clear. There aren't many bad things that I can say about it, and the only one really is that it can be a bit over sentimental at times. On the whole, however, Good Bye, Lenin! is an absolute treat and most certainly one of the better movies to have been released so far this decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today there is no more die Deutsche Demokratische Republik, there's no People's Republic of Bulgaria, no Yugoslavia, no Czeskoslovenska Socialisticka Republika, no USSR... The entire "Progressive World", apparently having reached the final stage of political and social self-actualization, decided there's no more place for it to develop into the material existence, and went altogether into Nirvana. They left a political vacuum, a socio-economic crisis, wars, misery, and all else that many of you remember, while others have just seen on TV.I am born during the last years of communism, but don't remember much of it. What I clearly remember was the downfall of the system. The crowds, the demonstrations, the blue flags, people crying, singing "Freedom! Freedom! Time is ours! 45 years is enough!". My grandmother took me into her hands, so that two polish photographers took a picture of us (she later on told me), and yes, the day after tomorrow we would live like in a wonderful Hollywood film. We didn't. And my entire generation passed its childhood into a lingering crisis, which broke down the society, the values, the morals, people fled the country, as if it was infected with plague.Today in the place of die Deutsche Demokratische Republik is Ost-Deutschland. A country, where entire buildings are empty, people having moved to the West. Investors don't chose the Ost for their capitals, they'd rather invest into Czech or Poland, where the workers are as qualified and several times cheaper. Today Bulgaria is slowly improving, and maybe in the next 200 years it will catch up the economic standard of the EU. Yugoslavia was torn by war after war, the Soviet Union collapsed into different countries, which had never been independent, Slovakia broke off from the Czech Republc, in search of its own Moravian identity.And a dream that came to replace the slavery of oppression and Nazism, and that was meant to continue for a thousand years at least, collapsed under its corruption.But the memory was fresh. The evils of corruption and concentration camps for political prisoners faded away, and only romanticism remained. Memories of a past that never was, or never should have been, or was, and had to be. Red t-shirts with yellow CCCP written on them became fashionable, referring to communism became a sort of a common identity for Eastern European students in western universities, nostalgia filled the hearts of many, and this was also expressed into the arts.It was a very sad film. I recommend it to all of you, who remember, and don't remember, who know, and don't know, or would like to know, or don't care about, or whatever. It is not a Hollywood high-budgeted blockbuster. It's far from that, but it's touching, true, amusing, and sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story has it all : family tragedy, growth (from child to adult and even growth as an adult), dealing with political and social change, and romance. I think the story gives one a good idea of just how much change occurred when the Iron Curtain fell over Eastern Europe and the difficulties and opportunities it brought. The story revolves around Alex, his sister and their mother. Their mother has a heart attack and then goes into a coma. During her coma, communism fell and then she wakes up. Advised by her doctor that she cannot take any form of excitement, Alex goes about creating the illusion that communism is alive and well. This often takes a comical twist on the differences between the communist east and capitalist west. There is also the subtle hint of discrimination by both sides against the other. In the end the story is about family and loved ones and what we are willing to do to make those around us happy. Go out and rent this movie.-Celluloid Rehab</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly wonderful film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was admittedly skeptical - figuring yet another typical German dramatic comedy (and 'German' and 'funny' are two words that don't mix well...) but WOW it was MUCH better than I thought.The political background remains in the background. This film sets itself historically into a tumultuous time in Germany - Especially East Germany - but the film allows politics to remain on the sidelines. This film is NOT about politics. This film is about love and respect. The love is a love of a son for his mother. A love and respect so deep that he tries to hide the fact that the wall fell, and Germany reunited, from her! Not exactly an easy feat - and he and his aspiring filmmaker friend cleverly fake telecasts (and they are INCREDIBLY clever and funny) to explain some of the 'anomalies' his mother encounters.This film also explores the relationship between East and West; uses an intensely amusing sense of irony to show a form of reverse capitalism - from the cravings of East German pickles and the hunt for East German groceries, to the story Alex concocts about West German refugees, oppressed under capitalism, fleeing the West and seeking refuge in the comfortable communist East.Finally, the film explores the growing relationship between Alex and Lara, as they each try to keep the relationship, and each other, in perspective. While Alex would do ANYTHING to protect his mother from harm, Lara is the glue that hold his sanity together,A WONDERFUL film, I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Good-bye, Lenin!" is the best film I've seen in years. The script is excellent, the cast &amp; performance are superb, and some scenes really shake you up, especially if you personally experienced the fall of the system. Remember that mighty episode when Mother finally manages to make her way into the street and sees the Lenin monument being carried away by a helicopter? Jesus, when the huge Lenin turned his face and pleading hand to her as if seeking help it gave me creeps. What a finding! I wouldn't say the film is neutral. Not with the first (and only) German cosmonaut toiling as a lowly cab driver, the main character's sister having to leave university to sell burgers, the governmental money-changing swindle, pensioners' tears, and the above Lenin monument scene in the movie. Personally, I find this film sad and thought-provoking. Would strongly recommend it to anyone except hopeless hard core right-wingers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say, people who haven't lived in one of the socialist countries can watch this movie, but they will never really understand it. Who hasn't personally experienced the fall of socialism, will never understand the mixed emotions that this film reminds viewers from Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and other ex-socialist countries of Eastern and Central Europe - the euphoria of freedom (but also the hardships our countries had to - and still have to - face) and the nostalgia for some aspects of life back then before 1989... So, I must say, I just loved the movie, but not because it is a particularly good one, but because it evokes such powerful emotions out of me. In the end, the protagonist comments, that he will always associate the memory of his mother with the memory of an era and a country that no longer exists. I exactly know what he means... I was 9 when socialism fell in my home country, so I belong to the last age group that experienced life in the socialist era. I am one of the last ones who remember what was life like then - and I don't regret that at all. In fact, that is a really emotional memory that I have, and I am proud that my country helped to remove the first brick from the Wall... Finally, let me recommend a similar film from Hungary - Moszkva tér (Moscow square)...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very clever film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend gave me this film to watch on DVD about a year ago, and I have also seen it since on television. I have now bought the DVD and I think it is an absolutely brilliant film.A loyal East German mother falls into a coma at a time when there are major rumblings of discontent in the DDR. When she comes out of the coma the wall is down and East and West Germany are heading towards reunification. Sadly any major shock could kill her and her devoted son has to pretend that the DDR is still alive and well, and his efforts to do this are the main story of the film.This is one of the most refreshing, amusing and well made films that I have ever seen. The idea for the film is extremely original, the script is spot on and so are all the actors, and it is a very clever film indeed.For me the most amusing and touching part of the film is when the son and his friend 'doctor' a piece of newsreel to make it look to the dying mother as if it were the West Berliners were trying to escape across the wall into East Berlin! When they later sent her ashes up in a home made rocket I was reaching for my handkerchief because it was so touching.The film does not go hugely overboard in criticising the former East Germany and that was good. I visited the DDR a number of times in the 1970's (I am a socialist by the way) and the East Germany that I saw was not the same that is often lambasted by the capitalist west and right wing historians.I would earnestly and strongly recommend this film to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many reviewers here have already given this movie its due. It IS funny, excellent, touching - and some more. I saw it twice - the second time I took my 13-year old daughter along. It was an excellent way of giving her a feel of what the division of Europe really felt like and what happened after the fall of the wall. She loved the movie, laughed, cried and sighed and afterwards we did actually talk quite a bit about this period of history: So - if you would like to stuff a little bit of history into your kids head, without the kid realizing that he or she is actually having a history lesson, this movie is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Goodbye Lenin" begins about a decade before the fall of the Berlin Wall. A family of four lives in East Germany. When the father goes on a business trip, he doesn't return--he's defected to the West. The mother, in reaction to this, becomes a super-communist--devoting all her energy in working with kids and indoctrinating them about the wonders of East Germany. She is so devoted, that she is even given a major award--she's a hero of the nation.A decade passes. Just before the Wall falls, the lady has a heart attack and is in a coma for eight months. During this time, HUGE social upheaval occurs when the Wall falls. No longer communist, East Germans clamor to keep up with the changes. And then, the mother awakens. But, her family (in particular her son) is afraid to tell her about the changes, as they've been told she is on borrowed time and will probably soon die--and a scare could easily kill her. So, they decide to hide the fall of their nation from her and pretend it's all the same old East Germany when she awakens. But how long can they keep up this crazy pretense?! I won't tell you what's next, but I will say that this film is exceptional BUT is also hard to really categorize. While parts of funny, it really isn't a comedy (particularly when the mother divulges a HUGE secret). It can be funny at times but also quite sad as well. It's unusual to say the least--but not in a bad way. See this film, as I really think we should encourage and embrace films that have plots that aren't just derivative or mindless. This film is highly creative, complex and well made throughout. See this film.My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that I think the film is a bit over-long. It's hard to maintain its momentum and the film loses a tiny bit of its punch because of this. But, as I said this is a VERY small complaint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb tragicomedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both sad and funny, perfectly blended together in this brilliant dark comedy. Often stuff that I laugh at are the same that also seem kind of sad. But it's never in any awkward feeling kind of way, it always works fine and is really clever. I'm interested in history and even if this is about a emotional story the settings and some of the events that the plot progresses through gives a glimpse of Eastern bloc life, realistic feeling scenes of the fall of the wall and the quick changes in the former GDR. Actually more than just a glimpse. I must state something of what I think of these aspects of it. Very well done in creating a good feel and a believable presentation. Is this film pro-western? No according to me. I definitely feel it's a objective representation, not intentionally taking any stand. Even if I like it because of my interest in the history in which this takes place that doesn't mean that viewers not interested in those aspects will find it dull, absolutely not. Because the central think of this movie is an emotionally deep story about caring. The sad emotional points take a bigger part than I had thought, these thing are actually the biggest parts of it. Not criticism in any way, I just had thought that there would be more of a comedy. Not meaning that it's lacking in funny scenes, there are plenty and enough. This story is a emotional one mainly and the plot is unproblematic to follow. The characters really grip you. The stuff they are going through gets to one, to the level that you are at full attention to see where this is taking them. However even if like stated the deep stuff that I feel are the thing that takes it so high the plot line is pretty clever thought out. To the level of being unique? Maybe not but still brilliant in a way that some the ideas never feels overused. The acting is just as great as the rest which naturally was necessary for it to have the brilliant sentimental depth. Some films with a emotional tone, kind of a message can feel like a watch once film, not bad but kind of like it hits you once and it can't be the same the next time. Not so with Goodbye Lenin! cause it is not just an emotional journey but a amazingly entertaining piece of film overall. Goodbye Lenin is pretty close to the brilliant. Is it a masterpiece? Well no but I still can't really find anything to call a flaw. See this film and then you will want to see it again. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching, engaging and profound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are comedies which are touching. There are comedies which are thought-provoking. But there are few that manage to achieve both. "Good bye, Lenin!" is in this ultra-rare class--a comedy which can only be called profound.The only film I can imagine to compare this to is another European tale of well-intentioned deception: "Life is Beautiful." Though neither as funny nor as wrenching as Roberto Benini's Holocaust fairy-tale, "Good bye, Lenin!" is perhaps more thoughtful and mature.This film is a story of upheaval, about a people surprised and intimidated by the force and gaudiness of their new freedom. For the first time in any film I have seen, I have been able to witness the onslaught of a new way of life through the eyes of those on the other side of the Wall. Crimson Coca-Cola banners unfurl on East German buildings like the flag of a conqueror--their presence seems unsettling and profane. A heroic cosmonaut is reduced to driving a taxi. The comfortable socialist products that once lined the shelves of the shabby local store are replaced by a garishly colored sea of choices that bewilder the customers searching for their familiar state-produced pickles. All around them, the vivid goals of profit and acquisition replace their failed goals of egalitarianism and brotherhood.Amidst all this, protagonist Alex makes a choice for his proudly socialist mother as she awakens from an eight-month coma--he will shield her from this new way of life through an elaborate series of white lies and fabrication. In doing so, in his own words, he creates for her the East Germany that he had always wished for--a triumph rather than a failure. Ultimately, what Alex is truly protecting is a part of himself--the child who sang East German anthems and looked skyward with dreams of representing his tiny but proud country in the cosmos. Even as he successfully sells satellite TV to his countrymen, Alex is able to keep the ideals of socialism alive within him."Good bye, Lenin!" is a fitting and unapologetic eulogy to an impossible human dream of equality, unity and dignity--a dream which through the eyes of Alex and his mother is no less beautiful for all its horrific flaws, or its spectacular failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An achievement not just in film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it is most certainly not a masterpiece of a film if you consider it on a purely artistic level, it has great relevance that goes far beyond what films normally achieve.Good Bye Lenin works on many levels: comedy, drama, even as a political and historical film. And despite what is specific about it - German history - the film has a core that can be understood universally: the love of a son for his mother. In this sense, "Good bye Lenin" transcends language, culture or politics.However, people unfamiliar with Germany history may not understand the other very important film´s achievement, namely its political dimension.It is true that East Germans wanted to get rid of the communist regime back in 1989 but no-one gave any thought to would happen once the wall was down. West Germany was thought of as some sort of huge shopping mall. In those days of euphoria no-one heeded the harsh face that a capitalist society may put on from time to time.Overnight everyone´s life in East Germany was turned upside down. What you had been taught at school was not applicable in the new world. What you had believed in, was no longer the proper school of thinking. Streets were re-named, monuments torn down, factories closed down. East Germans had to re-write their biographies.Clichés of the know-it-all arrogant West-German ("Wessi") and the naive and obedient East German ("Ossi") developed soon.Today with an unemployment rate of 20 % in the East as opposed to 9 % in West Germany, East Germans tend to glorify their socialist past, forgetting the hardships and oppression they were put to.One phrase to sum it all up: the wall still exists in some people´s heads be they from the East or the West. But along came "Good Bye Lenin". Maybe I am giving the film too much credit but it appears to have managed the impossible feat of unifying Germany at long last - a union in laughter. It was great timing, I suppose, but nevertheless, it struck a chord with East Germans and West Germans alike. West Germans got their history lesson and accepted that it was possible to uphold one´s dignity under a totalitarian regime.And East Germans finally got the funeral they were not granted in 1990. They got the opportunity to "bury" their former home country. Germany did reunify in 1990 but East German input was negligible. However, some signatures on a treaty do not make a country disappear, it lives on in people´s memories, in people´s dreams, in people´s illusions. And deserves recognition. And Good Bye Lenin gave that long waited for recognition.All that achieved by one little film? I may overestimate its impact but even if I do, I am pretty close to the truth, nonetheless. Let s hope so, anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teutonic Excellence in Cinema?? (a pleasing paradox indeed)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is rarely that my partner and I come out of the cinema and walk quietly. We usually try and deconstruct the film and analyse it to smithereens.This was one of those occasions where one just wanted to savour the feeling of comprehension and satisfaction that one gets by being in total harmony with a raconteur. Another example of this was after watching the excellent Bowling for Columbine...Getting to the point, there really isn't much that I can say about Good Bye Lenin that will convey the excellence and well-roundedness of the film. I am also going to avoid discussing the subject of the film as this has been done on most of the other reviews. All I can really say is that it manages to tenderly combine the multi-faceted elements of our everyday lives without being sanctimonious, political, or over-sentimental.There is no attempts to eke any cheap laughs (the potential for goofy humour and uber heart-tugging was there aplenty and would have been maximised were this the usual Hollywood summer fare). In this case, the "rarely-used-these-days" principle of less-is-more was applied throughout the film.All I can truly say is rustle up the cinema fare (any cinema opting to screen this in favour of more lucrative "Legally Dumb Terminator's Pie" deserves the thinking person's support) and give yourself a treat."Glückwünsche" to the people behind this.Good Bye Lenin...Welcome excellent films!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The End of a Dream of an Old Generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1990, in East Germany, the devoted socialist mother (Katrin Saß) of Alex (Daniel Brühl) and Ariane (Maria Simon) has an infarct and stays in coma for eight months. When she wakes, her doctor advises the family that her heart is weak and any problem could kill her. With a debilitated heath, her son understands that she would not support to acknowledge the end of her ideology and dream. Alex decides to hide the fall of the Berlin Wall and simulates in her bedroom that life has not changed in the recently integrated nation. The situations are dramatic and funny at the same time. This movie is simply wonderful! The screenplay uses drama, comedy, history and politics, supported by a fantastic direction and an outstanding cast, to show the situation of a generation who fought for and believed in the socialism, in their leaders and in the party, and suddenly sees the end of their dreams, and the next generation, avid for consumption. One of the most important point of 'Good Bye Lenin!' is the neutrality of the director, never defending or criticizing the socialism or the capitalism. Therefore, there is no manipulation along the story, trying to defend a system against the other. The dichotomy between the former and the new economical system is presented by the character Ariane, 'who left the university to sell hamburgers', as per the definition of Alex. Another great attraction of this film are the footages of that period of our contemporary history. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'Adeus Lenin' ('Good Bye Lenin')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More drama than comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie takes place in East Berlin just prior to and after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In reading some basic history of the German Democratic Republic (the GDR) I learned facts about how it was created in the Soviet Zone of occupation after WWII, about the Berlin airlift, the rule of the Communists, and the uprisings that ultimately resulted in German reunification in 1990. But all of this never gave me a feeling for what it was like to live in the country. Often it is a work of art that can best do that and "Goodbye, Lenin!" did not disappoint me in that context. Unless you were there, in watching a movie like this you have to trust the sincerity of the effort, and this movie seemed to be honest in its intentions and execution. It appeared that great care was taken to recreate the time period. But again, someone who lived through that era would have to be the final judge. The plot concentrates on the lives of Alex (Daniel Brühl), and his mother Christiane (Kathrin Sass). Christiane is a Communist Party member, but not really a party stooge. She spends much of her time writing letters to the authorities about how small things could be improved, like dress sizing and colors. At one point she says that it was the biggest mistake in her life not to have followed her husband after he defected to the West, so her devotion to the Communist Party was not all that firm.From the way that Christiane and Alex were living it looked to me like you could have a life in the GDR as long as you did not stray too far from the party line. You could have friends, be employed at a meaningful job (Christiane was a teacher, admired by her students), and have a family life. It was no paradise--it was noted that you could have to wait for years to buy a mediocre auto or get a phone. And the living quarters were small with drab views. But still, a life. This film was much of a history lesson for me. It is interesting to compare this movie with the excellent "The Lives of Others," where the background living conditions presented there are more sinister. But in that film you had artists and intellectuals pushing the envelop of approved behavior.When Christiane sees Alex participating in a protest she suffers a serious heart attack and lapses into a coma for eight months. When she comes around her doctor advises Alex that she must not be subjected to any significant shocks lest she suffer another attack. However, during Christiane's coma the Berlin Wall fell and the two German countries were united. Since Alex thinks this change would be too much for his mom to digest without prompting another heart attack, he tries to present the world to her as it was before her coma, figuring this would not be too hard since she will be bedridden. This sets up the circumstance for humorous situations as it becomes increasingly more difficult for Alex to maintain the charade, what with all of the West German products flooding in and the old products fading out. And, once Chrisiane starts watching TV, Alex has to fake news programs. A lot of this amounts to replaying old news clips, since the news never changed in the old regime, just reports on productivity quotas and the evils of capitalism. At such moments I was conflicted about whether to view such commentary on the GDR with humor or sadness. Director Becker probably identified with Alex, since it must have been a challenge for him to obtain the necessary props and settings to recreate the time period.I thought the actors were all top notch. Brühl is excellent and Chulpan Khamatova (as Laura, his love interest) is quite lovely. The relationship that blossoms between Alex and Laura is one of the most tender and believably developed that I have seen. On one level you can view this movie as love stories: between Alex and his mom, and between Alex and Laura. In fact there are many levels to the story. The friendship that develops between Alex and his cohort from the West is sincere and can be taken as a symbol for the new relationships between the East and West. It is interesting to note that the young people were mostly upbeat about the reunification, whereas the older people had some problems with it--converting from a regimented view of life that you have grown up with forever to a whole new way of living is not easy I suppose. The scene that has the helicopter removing the statue of Lenin is fantastic, not only as a beautifully filmed piece of cinema, but also as a symbol of the changing times. Becker presents a nuanced view, without apparent bias, of the impacts of reunification on the lives of ordinary people.The score fluctuates between rather delicate themes and more upbeat tempos, reflecting the conflicting moods. It is never intrusive and adds much to the experience.Altogether I feel this is a clever, insightful, and entertaining film.I wish there were more people who lived in East Berlin during the time period of this film who would comment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PEOPLE, THE MOVIE IS UNBIASED!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm reading these comments about communism X capitalism and I think they're totally out of context when discussing this movie, which is unbiased! It doesn't take any sides, it just shows the changes in the people's lives after the fall of the wall. I thought it was very cool because as a person who never lived in a communist country I couldn't imagine what it would be like to go through these enormous changes in my day to day life. It was funny to see what Coca Cola and Burger King mean to these people. I'm not saying that they were so unlucky not to have those things, the movie doesn't show it that way at all, it was just so interesting to me. I also thought that their mother's love to the party and her country was beautiful because it shows why they would go through all that trouble, I mean, I would if my mother were like that. Another thought to prove my point of the irrelevance of this discussion is that each person in the film thinks differently of the new regime: the young people think it's cool because they can travel, buy things etc, but the older ones don't feel comfortable with it, because it brings an instability to the economy and they feel threatened by it. Exactly what my Polish friend had told me way before I saw this movie. She said she prefers the capitalist regime because she can travel but her parents prefer the communist one.Anyway, I thought this movie was incredibly sweet and educational, and it should be shown to students in a history class...but for me the political part was a backdrop to a beautiful love story!!!!P.S. How 'bout the microphone that constantly appears on the top of the screen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the finest mother son stories on the celluloid.How far can you go, to save your mother? How much do you love your mother? These questions are inadvertently asked in this film all throughout and by the end our love only increases to our mother as well as the film. To recreate a whole setup as it was 10 years ago, is certainly a humongous task and boy it was done so very believably, thanks to the director Wolfgang Becker who paid attention to the detail and built up the whole film so very believably.Daniel Bruhl as Alex, gave an incredible performance, it was subtle with the mother, he held her so tenderly as if she were a little kid. Katrin Sab, as other Christiane too complemented the performance well. It was a well acted film apart from being a superbly written one. But I loved Daniel Bruhl as Alex in this one more than anyone else. The art direction combined with itself has a humane touch amidst all the details of creating first a period of 1989-1990 and then Alex has to recreate the pre-merged Germany of 1978- 19879 and wow, all was done superbly. When the mother realises that his son has to gone to every extent to make her believe that it was all the same as it was, the son Alex remains unaware and that's when the tears rolled for me. Christiane tells him that she is already aware of what has been happening for past few months, I was moist and numb then. It struck me, deep I say.The cinematography is good, I wish a blu-ray is released for this film, as it deserves a better watch than a mere DVD. Also, to note that this film was an inspiration to many films world over, and in my own place, a blockbuster 'Dookudu' was made out of this. It is a must watch film for many reasons apart from the mother son relationship, even the way Lara (Chuplan Khamatova) and Alex just have a love story as subplot and how good people are, for those with good intentions. When heart is good, all men come to help us. Good intentions are loved by good humans.I loved this film that is made with honest and good intentions. Thanks Wolfgang Becker for this. A 4/5 for sure. Just not yet perfect though, as it slows down at places, despite being extremely interesting for most part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This German film is both light- hearted and serious. It was filmed in 2001 and is set in 1989 to 1990 during East Germany's collapse of Communism especially the fall of the infamous Berlin Wall and the end of Checkpoint Charlie. Alexander Lerner is a young East German man who lives with his mother, Kristiane, and his sister, Ariane, and Ariane's infant daughter, Paula, in an East Berlin apartment. Alex is young and taking part in the revolution against Communism. His mother is a devout comrade and dedicated to Communism ever since her husband left for the West. When his mother suffers a heart attack, Alex takes extreme measures to allow his mother to think that East Germany still exists even though Germany has reunited. This movie parallels German's separation and reunification. There are several light moments in the film. The actress who plays the mother has done a splendid job in the role and so does Daniel Bruhl playing her son. This film is definitely worth watching even if you don't know German. It's a film you have to see. This film shows the power of film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1990, to protect his fragile mother from a fatal shock after a long coma, a young man (Daniel Bruhl) must keep her from learning that her beloved nation of East Germany as she knew it has disappeared.While the humor of this film is the deception these people present for the benefit of one woman, it actually has a much deeper message than that. We see here the difficulty of switching systems, especially with such a messy bureaucracy. The mother may have a hard emotional switch, but everyone else has to make their own adjustments, sometimes with greater or lesser success.I did appreciate using Burger King to represent the evils of capitalism ("monetary circulation"). I wonder if that is one of the few companies they received clearance for, because it certainly is not the first fast food chain I think of. I can see the Coca-Cola part, and very much appreciated the reference to that classic James Cagney film...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Bye Lenin is one of the most inventive film titles seen in recent times.This is not the only reason to praise this film.As Tom Tykwer's film "Run Lola Run" made German cinema popular after a long period of inactivity,Good Bye Lenin must also be hailed as it is another German film which accelerated the growth of German cinema in international film festivals and cinema markets.Although it talks of a political theme(German reunification)it is not a political film by nature.It is a film which just talks of a failed system that caused more misery than happiness.As there is not much of a hefty discussion on politics it can be said that "Good Bye Lenin" can also be classified as a family film.It is a film for which German director Wolfgang Becker has showed a couple of honest sentiments by portraying what troubles an obedient son took for achieving the well being of his mother.This noble gesture is achieved by giving a humorous touch to German reunification.It is really nice that this film fared extremely well at box offices all over the world but what is shocking is that Wolfgang Becker has not been able to capitalize on this film's success.He has not directed any other major box office success after this film.His case brings to mind a similar incident involving Hungarian filmmaker Makk Karoly who did not make any other great film after having made his masterpiece Szerelem (Love)This is strange as human life is full of such contradictions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This German movie is a touching tale about a mother who has a heart attack just before the Berlin Wall comes down. When she wakes up from her coma months later, the wall has come down, and Germany is about to unite East and West Germany into one country. After being warned that any shocks could make his mother suffer a second more fateful heart attack, her son resolves to keep the illusion of East Germany's continued existence, until she gets better.The DVD box for this movie claims that the resulting efforts of the son to keep up the pretence lead to hilarious consequences. The movie isn't as funny as that, but it does have a lot of humour in it. In fact it's a rather touching tale of the relationship between mother and son.The performances of Daniel Bruhl, as Alex the son and Kathrin Sass as the mother are very impressive. And the script by Wolfgang Becker and Bernd Lichtenberg is funny, and touching with some imaginative touches, as the increasingly desperate Alex comes up with some bizarre and inventive ways of keeping the illusion going.Wolfgang Becker directs with some nice touches, yet never lets the story get ridiculous. By focusing on the relationship between son and mother, he keeps the story tight and avoids it getting too sentimental.As mentioned, the movie is touching yet the humour that runs through it keeps a smile on your face, and the ending is moving. On the whole though, while I enjoyed it immensely I don't think it's the masterpiece some critics have suggested. It's slightly too long, and the story does run out of steam towards the end, but overall it's definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong indictment against paternalism packed in bittersweet satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself lucky in a way to have been to East Germany in 1988. The wall still standing, different kinds of local cola (!) served in restaurants, our German tour guide falling silent when the rotating TV tower restaurant turned from facing the blank darkness of East Berlin to the shiny neon lights of Western Berlin and all that. Oh, and really sorry for that father who desperately asked where we managed to get hold of an Antonov An-24 airplane model kit, only to hear from us that we took the last one off the shelf where we bought it. Thinking back, we were a bit like those wanna-see-the-dark-side-of-other-peoples'-lives tourists who go pay and see the DMZ in the Koreas, or the former supply tunnel under the former siege line in Sarajevo and stuff like that. But it's not a perfect comparison, to do justice to ourselves, for we were there in East Berlin from socialist Hungary. We, in Hungary, already since decades had that most famous brand of cola that I won't name in order not to turn this comment into a commercial, and we were permitted without much bureaucratic fuss to travel to the West. Going to East Germany at the time was like traveling back to the past, but not to an entirely by-gone past.That feeling was important for me to remember even as the movie did evoke some feeling of nostalgia for a time of fake security in the old system, as it recreated the atmosphere of the era. The 'Spreewald cucumber' sort of fake security. Important, for so I could perfectly agree with the film's eventual message that I characterize in the title of my comment as a 'strong indictment against paternalism', with any nostalgia I have not telling me to resist to accepting the truth of it.While some standard reviews of this film only concentrate on Alex, the son, desperately trying to maintain an illusion for the sake of his mother, you'll find that even his mother is doing just that in a way that the film will reveal. And of course the old regime used to do the same thing on the macro-level, so-to-say, managing to convince a minority and managing to silence or co-opt a passive majority.Good Bye Lenin is one of the best films to deal with the Eastern bloc heritage. Resonates just as well here in Hungary as in former East Germany, even if East Germany did feel a bit like a museum for us Hungarians, already in 1988.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disinformation in Good Bye Lenin!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Wolfgang Becker's film Good Bye Lenin! several characters seek to protect each other from knowledge that they feel may harm them. Alex, the film's protagonist, believes that his father left his mother for a woman in West Berlin. In reality, Alex's father had to flee the country and wished more than anything to see his family once more. Fearing for the safety of her family, Christiane (Alex's mother) does not join her husband in the West. When Christiane falls into an 8-month coma due to a heart attack, the dividing line between East and West Berlin falls, and Western ideals flow into the socialist city. When she wakes up, Alex decides to hide this knowledge from her in order to avoid another heart attack. The process proves exhausting; Alex must hide the commercial products that have inundated the city from his mother by disguising them as state-sponsored items like "Mocha-Fix" coffee and "Spreewell" pickles. As capitalism expands, so too must Alex's ruse. In order to explain what Christiane has already seen, Alex begins, with the help of a friend, to produce false television news reports. Alex's campaign of misinformation tends to resemble the actions of the GDR,and he creates a representation of old East Berlin in the form of his mother's room. The door to her bedroom becomes a sort of Berlin Wall as Burger King uniforms hang just outside. Furthermore, his efforts come to resemble those of his own mother to keep knowledge of his father from him and his sister. Christiane kept letters from her husband hidden from her children. In seeking to protect her children from the lure of the West, she drastically alters the idea that her son has of his father. Alex imagines him as a disgustingly fat man lounging next to a pool and biting ravenously into a cheeseburger. As it turns out, his father, like all the characters in the film, only wanted the best for his family. The way in which the film treats this desire is problematic: though Alex wants to protect his mother, he may be harming her just as much by misleading her. Similarly, by protecting Alex from the memory of his father, Christiane destroyed his image. When Alex's girlfriend, Lara, finally tell Christiane the truth, she cannot chastise him for his actions. Rather, she realizes that she has done the same thing herself out of love. Knowing that the ruse is an expression of Alex's love for her, she decides to let him keep on thinking she is ignorant to the reunification of Berlin. Though the ending seems happy, it is problematic as well. Though Alex believes his mother died blissfully unaware of the triumph of the West-knowledge has still been kept from him. In reality, Christiane did know the truth and died blissfully aware of her son's devoted love. However, the problem of characters depriving one another of knowledge is still perpetuated in this ending.*This was written as a short response to the film for a comparative world literature class that I took on a whim in my final semester at the University of Illinois. Composed on the fly, it probably contains some errors, but lemme know what you think in terms of theme and interpretation!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Try, Becker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film resemblances the Socialist ideology that forms the core of its story in that it's a good idea that eventually goes awry and struggles on long after it should have come to a natural and dignified end. The idea, a kind of Rip van Winkle variation, is a good one, and is efficiently handled at first, but loses its way badly in the last third and begins to look exceedingly ordinary and somewhat melodramatic as it searches for a way to tie up all its loose ends.Daniel Bruhl plays Alex, a young boy growing into manhood in the last days of the Socialist regime of East Germany. His mother (Kathrin Sass), who has brought Alex and his sister up alone since their father defected to the west, has embraced the country's socialist message as a result of his leaving. Shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall, she suffers a massive heart attack after seeing Alex arrested during a protest march, and falls into a coma. Eight months later, and with the old socialist regime nothing more than a memory, she miraculously awakens and, warned that any excitement might prompt another attack, Alex goes to extraordinary lengths to prevent her from discovering that the way of life she loved no longer exists.The movie's summary sounds like it could be the plot of a farcical comedy, but Goodbye, Lenin is more of a drama with some humorous moments along the way, and it sometimes feels like writer/director Wolfgang Becker himself isn't sure in which direction the story should be heading. The central premise of the story, while intriguing, is pretty much the stuff of fairy tales and bears no close examination, so Becker, like his film's hero, must conjure up something special to distract and compel and paper over all those cracks. Sadly, despite a game try, he fails to do so; too often the storyline moves too slowly, giving us too much time to ponder the situation and reflect on the slightly creepy behaviour of Alex. After all, he's deceiving his mother and essentially keeping her imprisoned in her bedroom. He's doing it out of love for her, but that doesn't make it right and, for me, his charade grows increasingly disturbing once his mother escapes the confines of her room and wonders out into the brave new world to be confronted with western cars and adverts and a statue of Lenin suspended from a helicopter flying overhead. If a shock like that doesn't kill her then why continue with the charade? It is at this point, when Alex's deception becomes increasingly pointless, that the film really should have ended because all that comes afterwards serves only to diminish what came before. But instead of an ending we are shown Alex tracking down his father, who appears, visits his ex-wife then promptly disappears again. We are never made privy to the conversation the briefly reunited couple have and it is never mentioned. So why bother? And why have Alex's sister Ariane (Maria Simon) hunting for their estranged father's letters while her mother is being rushed to hospital? Does she think the letters will disappear if her mother dies?Despite these glaring faults and inconsistencies there's much to admire in Becker's film, especially in the way he portrays the effect the demise of the socialist republic has on those who were happy living under its wing. The situation sort of turns around on Alex after his girlfriend (Chulpan Khamatova) fills his mother in on what has been going on and the charade continues for his sake rather than her's; it's a nice touch but by then it's too late for the film to recover from its self-inflicted wounds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an achievement! Goodbye Lenin is a complex and very interesting film!It shows life not as a tragedy or a comedy but a mixture of both.As a rule mixing the genres is rarely successful but here it works.The film puts everything in its historical context and in this way it is very realistic.It shows that what matters in life ultimately is the basic truths-family,sacrifice,love.And how transient and unstable political situations and beliefs are.The first part is a comedy.But not a stupid one.At the same time it does not refrain from showing the ex-GDR as it really was-with its brutality and paranoia.The second half of the film is more serious and moving as we see the difficult struggle of the family to come to terms with the dynamism of the change.Not everything is what it seems-the reality is complex and it defies easy judgment and categorization.I like very much the humanistic approach of the film and the deep understanding of historical events and the way they influence the lives of ordinary people.I think that after many years this film will be shown as a document of what happened in Germany in 1989/90. I rate it 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goodbye Lenin! is a triumph on so many levels, with the main - and most important - one being a complete surprise; the film, by the end, delivers an emotional wallop in the most subtle of ways, thanks to the brilliant screenplay, excellent direction and the perfectly nuanced performances from the two main characters, the son (the superb Daniel Bruhl, who reminded me of Jake Gyllenhaal) and the mother (the sublime Kathrin Sass, who reminded me of Patricia Clarkson). The entire movie is inspired, and I especially liked how the mother is never depicted as a victim, although she spends nearly the entire movie bed-ridden. This is yet another coup, in a movie that is literally filled with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A foreign masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSI'm not what could be considered a massive fan of foreign language films. In my life there are one or two which I can remember fondly. "La Reine Margot" (1994) and "Les Vacances de M. Hulot" (or "Monsieur Hulot's Holiday" - 1953) are two which spring to mind and which I can say I've seen and loved. With this limitation to my foreign catalogue therefore, I'd found myself very surprised by my desire to see "Goodbye, Lenin!" In the long run though, I'm glad I had a passion since this film is a beautiful piece of cinema.In "Goodbye, Lenin!", Alex Kerner is a young man in East Germany. Suddenly a few days before the eventual collapse of the Berlin Wall, Alex's life is thrown into disarray when his mother Christiane has a heart attack. As the German landscape changed around her, Christiane lay in a vegetative state. As her son matures and her daughter Ariane has a child, Christiane has no knowledge of the world. This is until one day when she awakens. This places Alex in the role of caring for his ill mother who is a proud socialist and who remains ignorant of the new reunifed Germany. Told that any major drama could cause his mother to relapse and die, Alex finds himself placed in the tricky situation of caring for his mother and coming up with more and more obscure ways to keep her from discovering the truth."Goodbye Lenin!" is a heartwarming tale of a boy's devotion for his mother and the lengths he will go to for her health. As Alex Kerner, Daniel Bruhl is excellent, and he is well supported by an equally strong cast of Germans. I don't know how well known the actors in this film are, I confess. Despite the obvious French actors like Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, Julie Delpy and Daniel Auteuil, I'm not particularly versed in European actors. Therefore when I watch a french film, it's often due to the area which the plot covers. With "Goodbye Lenin!" I was pleased to discover that the actors do a good job portraying their characters in a world of suffering.One scene in particular springs to mind about this film which touch the heart. During the entire feature, I found myself following Alex's efforts to keep his mother in the socialist way and the events turned his life upside down. Alex's one wish was for his mother to recover, yet he was aware that the truth would cause her harm. It is this desire to help her that causes him to even film fake news broadcasts as he created his own ending to the East German days of socialism. Alex's mum does eventually find out the truth, but in a way, it is the way Alex remains ignorant of this which is so beautiful. As Alex shows his mother his own ending to the East and West divide, his mother looks at him with a sense of love and we realise that she will play along with Alex's charade, not because she is unaware, but now because she sees how much it means to him."Goodbye Lenin!" is also beautiful because it reminds us of the poverty in Eastern Germany. Whilst never visiting myself, I've heard people tell me on many occasions that even in 2004, 15 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the divide in wealth between the West and the East is still considerable in size. Alex's sister leaving college to work at McDonalds demonstrates this to a degree (although perhaps more it points at capitalistic dominance in the world today), but most notably of all is the point where Alex discovers a large ammount of money, but the currency is no longer worth anything and he is unable to convert it to Marks. The look of frustration on Alex's face as he realises the irrelevance of the exstinct currency is painful to view, simply because it reminds us that in every major change in the world, there are always those that are left behind and who suffer because of this evolution.I guess that all that can really be said about "Goodbye Lenin!" is that it is a beautiful masterpiece. The film will make you cry, it will open your eyes to suffering, and at times it will make you laugh out loud. When Wolfgang Becker and Bernd Lichtenberg wrote this film, they were creating an aweinspiring piece of cinema. If someone was to ask me what foreign film they should watch, no longer will I say "La Reine Margot", now I'll tell them to go to the shop and buy "Goodbye, Lenin!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a comedy at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a deep and touching film. I would warn people thinking that this is a funny film about the fall of the Wall. It is not a comedy at all!It is a film about a family broken by the political system. About tragedy of a couple torn apart by the Wall. It is about a mother and a wife who had to choose either to go West after her beloved husband and possibly to loose her children (regime would have taken them away), or to stay on the East side with her kids, but to loose the person she loved. She chose the later.In many reviews I have seen, she was depicted as an active socialist. No, she wasn't. She was dedicated to kids. She substituted her grief and pain with social activities with school children. She also was helping to write complaints and petitions, so she was a little revolter in that society!She slipped into coma in GDR and woke up in united Germany, but because even minor stress could kill her, her son decides to keep her in the world she used to live. The situation itself and what her son does to keep that world alive, is what an average moviegoer will see. There are funny moments of course. But please look deeper and you understand that behind this there is a deep tragedy of generation of people, whose life was literally wasted by politicians and their games.</fullReview>

Goodbye Lenin is a great and funny movie, but beneath the comedic surface I found a interesting and very humanly wonderful movie about how a big historical incident effected a small east-german family. Watch how an 'untouched' country suddenly is overwhelmed by western ideoligies, expensive cars and lots of Coca Cola. This is one of those movie that will drag you through an orgy of laughter, but once you leave the cinema the movie will stick to you many days after.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie recently on DVD. It was hard on me since there were only a German language track as well as only German subtitles. But it was easier than i thought understanding everything. And this movie was certainly worth it.This is a movie about Alex and his mother. At the end of the communist era in DDR, before the reunification, Alex is walking in a demonstration. His communist mother sees him and is so shocked at his participation in something like this that she has a stroke. She falls into a coma and stays that way for eight months. And when she wakes up there is no more Berlin wall and no more DDR. But Alex fears she could never stand hearing this so he recreates the DDR in a bedroom in the family's apartment and upholds the illusion of DDR for his mother.This movie is incredibly funny. I might start by saying that i have never been to Germany (East nor West) and that my knowledge of Germany comes mostly from TV, books and the German-classes in school. So the enjoyment of this film doesn't demand that you know everything about Germany, but of course some basic knowledge of history is required.When i first saw it i was expecting a very light comedy. Something that would be very funny in a light and care-free way. But that is not what we are served here, what is served though is even better. As much as this movie is funny it is also sad. In a way it mourns for the things lost when DDR fell, but it is nostalgia that doesn't wish a way back. Rather it's just appreciating that there were good things in the DDR too. Which is a nice thing to hear since much of what has been reported here has been very one-sided.Daniel Brühl is excellent as the main character Alex. I don't know how good his English is, but my guess is that he will be seen in Hollywood soon enough if that is his wish. Katrin Saß is also excellent as his mother. This movie is well directed, well made and well acted. It promises well for the German film industry. And it is certainly a recommended viewing.I rate this 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Good Bye Lenin!" is a German film from 12 years ago that runs pretty much exactly 2 hours and features some of Germany's most known actors back then and today: Daniel Brühl, Katrin Saß, Maria Simon, Florian Lukas, Christine Schorn, Michael Gwisdek and Burghart Klaußner. A lot of these also received quite some awards recognition for their work here and this movie in general is among the most famous German films abroad as well, especially looking at movies made in the 21st century. I would say that only "Lives of Others" and "Downfall" are more famous from recent German films. So "Good Bye Lenin!" also scored a Golden Globe nomination and BAFTA nomination as well as tons of wins at the European Film Awards, German Film Awards and other ceremonies all around the globe.The story is a bit absurd, but as a whole they made it work I guess. A woman (devoted socialist) is in a coma and misses the Fall of the Berlin Wall and the German Reunification. When she wakes up, her children are instructed from the doctor that they have to keep any drama and tension away from her, so what is their plan? They act as if nothing happened and re-enact the GDR for her. When she leaves the apartment one day, they just make it look as if it was all the other way around: People from the FRG fleeing into the GDR so that she does not start to have doubts in her political ideals. And in the end, the fall of the Berlin Wall upside down as well. I think this is a good movie and the script is certainly the biggest strength. Well-written and as no less than 5 people worked on the script, this is finally not a case of too many cooks. Besides writer and director Wolfgang Becker, the most crucial one may be Bernd Lichtenberg and I am really surprised to see that he did not make any other scripts for movies in the last 12 years.Anyway, there are moments in terms of comedy and drama in this film that did not entirely convince me, but I don't think it was bad enough to leave a sour note on the film overall. All in all, I guess Becker found the right mixture between these 2 genres. Still I must say that I didn't feel that the acting was as outstanding in here that it would have justified all these awards. Then again, I am far from being a great Daniel Brühl fan. Still, I like some of his works, for example "Das Weiße Rauschen" or "Rush", which almost got him Oscar-nominated. My favorite scene was probably the one with him at his father's party. Great fan of Burghart Klaußner here and he was brilliant in this couple minutes. The ending with the mother's death and what they showed her finally was very good too. The film could maybe have been a bit more essential if they had done without some of the insignificant scenes. As a summary, I would say that it's a good movie, not a great one, but very much worth watching for everybody with an interest in German history. Recommended.However, I have to finish this review on a negative note. Becker and Brühl reunited recently for a new film and I read about an interview where Brühl compares their longtime collaboration with the one between Herzog and Kinski. All I can say about this is that Herzog has made brilliant films for decades and I cannot see anything in Becker's filmography that comes close to the genius if Herzog's finest works. And Brühl to Kinski is goldfish to whale. No need to further elaborate on that. Looks like his awards recognition really cost Brühl his sanity. Shame, he shows glimpses of talent in some of his works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout the entirety of the film it's clear that Wolfgang Becker is trying to express a very satirical view on the situation of East Germany at this time, yet he strays away from the real issues a bit too much and ends up making the film about the issues within a family. Perhaps this is Becker's way of adding an element of realism to the somewhat surreal situation, showing that amidst the issues that plagued an entire nation or even an entire continent, that every household, every person has their own issues. The comedic take on the issue in itself would make the film seem like a straight-up satire, yet the concept is so absurd that it almost takes away from the satirical aspects, making the film feel like a regular old comedy. Though Becker does express some of these aspects well. One of the most humorous and effective things I remember from the film was the connection between capitalist ideals and the ones of socialism. The main character's sister has a job at Burger King, which to Americans seems like a very normal job for someone struggling by to get, yet it seems very out of place here. Perhaps it's trying to make a statement on the assimilation of western capitalist ideas into a society that was plagued by socialism for so long, and how things can seem so normal to one culture, yet so foreign to another. Another thing, probably the thing Becker did the best, was how people went to such extremes to hide the western aspects of life that were quickly being introduced into their society from the mother. This is one of the best statements Becker makes, satirizing the way that the government tried to block information and censor aspects of culture and life from citizens by having Alex and his group of friends do everything in their power to make sure that the mother does not find out about the reunification. Making fake news programs, getting everyone on board, physically hiding advertisements and any thing that would hint towards a western lifestyle; this is one of the things that Becker did best. Overall, the movie did a pretty good job at expressing the environment of East Germany right before and right after the unification.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is one of my favourites of all time, and is the best film I've seen that best conveyed why people, despite the repression of USSR and its economic failures, still look back fondly on the Soviet republic and remain committed to the ideals of socialism.The main character, played by Daniel Bruhl, captures quite well the inner struggles of what I would imagine the then GDR citizen. On the one hand, fed up with a system that no longer works and skeptical of the party leadership, and on the other, resiliently holding the hope that the ideals of socialism materialise. Through his journey with his family, I seem to understand how the raft of changes affected the citizens of the GDR. At the end, when that familiar tune takes over, and Arianne show some surprising emotions, it's hard to resist a sense of sorrow that way of life, that system of beliefs, could very much be a relic of history.Overall, a well-executed film worth watching, with characters that you could empathise with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The soundtrack written by Yann Tiersen is perfect. The soundtrack is the first thing you notice when you start to watch this film.The film isn't complicated and simple enough, so everyone can understand it, even the dumbest persons. What is the main scene of the film? This is probably when they go at the Datsche, the mother's monologue. (or probably it's when the mother sees Lenin flying bound to a helicopter?)It simply shows the aspects of the life in a socialistic state and the aspects of being an Ossi, the notions of an Ossi. And of course the problems of that time.I wouldn't say it's a comedy, I think it's a tragical movie. It develops the aspect of belief of the Ossis in their state, of the bigotry of the socialistic states, of the belief that their socialistic(communistic) system is superior to capitalistic countries, though it also shows that far not all of the Ossis were really such communistic fanatics and most even didn't care of the crash of their state. There is even a quasi-triumph of the DDR shown in the end.Of all three movies showing the life in the DDR I have watched this one is the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I must say I had no idea that life behind the wall during East Germany's existence was so restrictive. No Western companies allowed, (Coca Cola, etc) rubbish TV, mandatory conformation and if you tried to escape this hellhole, you were shot on sight. It almost makes North Korea sound appealing. Thank goodness all that is behind us... mind you, to be a complete nation again they had to tolerate David Hasselhoff's attempt at singing, which is almost enough to make you want to rebuild the structure just to keep the damn fool out...Into this situation are thrown a mother and her two teenage children, who she's raised to be devoted to the ethics and beliefs of the East. Her husband has long since fled to the cosseted bosom of the West, leaving her to raise the kids alone. This was just before the wall was about to collapse though, so she's holding onto a failing ideology. Just before the big event however, she suffers from a massive heart attack which puts her in a long coma, forcing her to miss Germany's reunification and subsequent corruption of her children by outside influences(!) When she wakes up months later, her son is informed by her doctor that any shock could kill her, and finding out the world as she knew it has changed would certainly fall into that category. So he is forced to begin an elaborate facade, involving VCRs, old clothes and pickles. Sounds complicated? Well, it is.It's also very moving, funny and poignant as the ever-inventive screenplay keeps throwing up new problems for the ever-industrious son to navigate, and the way he enlists the help of those around him and his utilisation of ancient products scavenged from the skip is a pleasure to behold. The true heart of the film though, is in the relationship between the stricken mother and her offspring, and through their efforts at keeping her breathing which disrupts their everyday lives, you know they truly love her. Even when she reveals the sorry truth about her husband's departure late on, they still forgive her with unconditional love. My favourite part is just before she passes on, she discovers the ruse... but frankly, she doesn't care. Watching the children she loves going to all this trouble to preserve her life is better than any send-off... you can tell by the look in her eyes.Beautiful. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An original creation that places you in the middle of the debate between Communism and Capitalism without rhetorical slant. Daniel Brühl portrays the caring son who believes protecting his mothers' fragile health includes recreating her bedroom as the older East Germany, an island to modern day. His mission is honorable and his insight is charming in a film that cannot be categorized (and isn't that great to be able to say?). The narrative is both comedic and sad and portrayed against history in a neighborhood that can't help but fall prey to the modern world. The deeper story line weaves in and out and that heart of the film is strongly and sweetly felt. This German film is on a par with the French film "Amelie" for its ability to make us friends with a young character from childhood to young adult in a personal crisis and aided by the same songwriter/pianist with the perfect touch. Complicated story should be even more enjoyable with a deserved second viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodbye "Goodbye Lenin!"?: The Longevity of Criticism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the occasion of the passing of America's greatest film critic and Hollywood's greatest cheerleader, Roger Ebert, I wanted to reflect on whether his writing will stand the test of time. We often ask whether a given film will hold up, but what about a given review?My most recent screening had been of "Goodbye, Lenin!" (2004), Wolfgang Becker's historical- comical-tragical (as Polonius would have called it) story of a GDR loyalist whose son, once she emerges from a coma during which the Berlin Wall has fallen, doesn't dare break the news to her. Sure enough, Ebert had reviewed the German film. And so two extra layers of translation in which the message might be lost stacked with the one of interest to me: from the setting (1989) to the filming (2003), and from the filmmaker's audience (Germany) to Ebert's (the United States).Perhaps for the latter reason, the review is not among Ebert's longest or strongest. His wit is at its most inspired and devastating when fulminating over a train-wreck like Sex and the City 2: "I don't know a whole lot about fashion, but I know something about taste . . . ." With Lenin!, on the other hand, he admits being on his heels: "it is no doubt filled with references and in-jokes we do not quite understand." (More: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/goodbye-lenin-2004)But I think the most important thing that Ebert's review doesn't understand -- or, to be more fair, doesn't acknowledge -- is the thematic role of Christiane's (Kartis Sass) deception regarding her family's history and her relationship with the socialist party. Summing his criticism, Ebert writes: "What 'Goodbye, Lenin!' never quite deals with is the wrongheadedness of its heroine. . . . How many of us lie to our parents, pretending a world still exists that they believe in but we have long since moved away from?" But has Christiane's son Alex (Daniel Bruhl) really moved away? It seems rather credulous to believe that the extreme lengths he goes to to freeze his mom in historical stasis (even enlisting an ex-cosmonaut to create fake news broadcasts, as Ebert notes) are really for his mom's health (the doctor has admonished that she must have no surprises). Peering a bit beneath the surface, we surmise that all this play-acting is for Alex's own benefit, at least in part. Hence his concession that "the GDR I created for her increasingly became the one I dreamed of."If so, then it's congruent that it turns out not to be the case that her love affair with the party is the result of his with some Western strumpet (as we were led to believe), but rather that her husband's flight was the result of the party's betrayal of him -- and, by extension, her. On that reading, her loyalty is not just "emotional compensation" for his desertion, as Ebert suggests, but rather an outright charade, thus making her son's cocooning of her from the Good News all the more tragic. Thus, Becker's central theme is less about the folly of patronizing our parents in their antiquation, and more about the folly of catering to anyone when we don't actually know what they want.Even if I'm wrong, and Alex really is just trying to follow doctor's orders, the point still stands: he's trying to avoid giving her a negative shock, but it turns out that she might not take the news of the end of the GDR so negatively after all. Indeed, when he unspools to her his fabrication of the reunification -- replete with tales of West German refugees from capitalism flooding into their very neighborhood -- her concern seems less around the triumph of socialism and more around being helpful herself. (On that score, she's kindred spirits with Ebert, who drew strength and joy from his prolific writing for others' benefit, tweeted with abandon in spite of himself, and was known to scribble notes during screenings and rip them, page by page, from his notebook, to be gathered during the closing credits and assembled into his always- anticipated reviews.) One of her best punchlines -- "Coca Cola was a socialist invention?" -- sounds more in amazement than party pride.But, returning to my project, does this alleged missing of the mark have anything to do with the 9 years since Ebert's review? I don't think so. Whether Becker's point is better captured by Ebert's read or mine, the intervening period neither adds to nor subtracts from the audience's ability to find it. By choosing to film (Becker) and write about (Ebert) such enduring cultural touchstones as Coca Cola and Burger King, the two maximize the likelihood that they'll remain recognizable for future audiences. And, more importantly, by anchoring even more firmly on timeless themes (family more than fast food; "taste" more than "fashion"), the two maximize the likelihood that they'll remain relevant for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodbye Lenin! Interpretation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of "Goodbye Lenin" is more than a movie that outlines a mother-son relationship, or a coming of age plot; it represents an era in East Germany where change in life was mandatory. There are many opinions about the East and West merger, but it is easy to overlook the emotions of the people living in East Germany. This film outlines a personal experience about a young man who is at the threshold of abandoning his past or keeping it for his mother's sake. For a lot of citizens it was the only way of life they have ever known, and it represented their own identity. After Alex's mother awakens from an eight-month coma, he tries to save her of the realities of their "new" country. So much had change during her coma and GDR was no more. His mother represented an East German, and all the nostalgia that came along with his memories. Alex decides that he would recreate the world of East Germany for his mother because he was worried the excitement of finding out the truth would be too much for her to handleWhether this decision is for himself or his mother, it is interpretable. Alex's own world was beginning to crumble after his mother went into a coma. Then soon after, the Berlin Wall came down, changing his last pieces of identity forever. His sister even starts changing things around the house. Everything for Alex was different?from the food he ate to his clothes. Alex was living in a new world entirely. When his mother awakens from her coma, there was a possible opportunity for him to regain his past. (It is important to note that Alex's mother was his sole caregiver. When Alex was young his father had escaped to the West?this past strengthens the relationship that the two have together).Once Alex brings his mother home from the hospital, he tries his best to re-create East Germany. He goes out to find the old food brands only known in the East and even gets a friend to help make news show of East Germany so that his mother could live in their own reality and accept that nothing has changed since before her coma. He also forces everyone to wear the old style of clothing that was worn in the GDR. It might seem like an extreme tactic just to preserve a world for his mother, but his motives also speak for himself. Alex's character represents the desire to keep memories current. He struggles with the idea of letting go throughout the movie. It is not necessarily that he wanted to stay at a standstill or not move on, he just wanted something to hold on to that represented his identity?which was East Germany. As an American viewer watching "Goodbye Lenin", there are some moments that are confusing and do not make sense, especially if you are unfamiliar with The East German culture/history. There is a universal message that is received however and that is the need to identify with one's own reality. In Alex's case, he made his own reality for his mother but it also helped him keep the memory of his past alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Bye Lenin! is a remarkable film that makes you laugh and leaves you thinking. A young Berliner (Daniel Bruhl), whose mother (Katrin Sass) has just awakened from a coma in 1989, pretends that her beloved East Germany still exists to protect her from the shock.The film is an appealingly bittersweet satire about the German inclination towards 'Ostalgie' - a kind of sentimental longing for its communist past. The re-creations of decor and even fake news broadcasts, all to conserve a mother's delicate health, raise a lot of smiles. Most of the scenes were shot at the Karl-Marx-Allee in Berlin and around Plattenbauten near Alexanderplatz.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I stumbled upon this film by browsing through the films of Daniel . I had just skimmed through his other movie "The Edukators" . A great movie i must say. Anyway this movie was mostly marketed as a comedy. Various people had just said it was a comedy and nothing more. I needed a laugh so I looked it up and began seeing it.I am very glad I did. The story is set around 1991 , just before the unification of Germany. The story is told from the point of view of Alex played by Daniel and it is a story not only of politics but also about love, family and yes there are a few clever jokes along the way.The soundtrack to the movie is amazing. It really gives the movie an amazing feel. This special kind of sad feeling.Throughout the movie many interesting questions are raised. "what is a lie?" "Is a lie to protect someone really justified?" " Do people in west Germany miss their past?" and so on.The movie doesn't answer all of them It's a test to the viewer. He has to decide. However the movie accomplishes the goal of being a great movie very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wolfgang Becker's 2003 film, Good Bye Lenin!, is not a great film, but it is far better than the usual Hollywood tripe, as well as being a cut above most independent films released by filmmakers not named John Sayles. The two hour long film was written by Becker, Bernd Lichtenberg, Hendrik Handloegten, Christoph Silber, and Achim von Borries, and has a unique, if strained premise- that as the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 a devout East German Communist flunky, Christiane Kerner (Katrin Saß), who lived in East Berlin fell into a coma after a heart attack and when she woke eight months later, her whole world changed, but her devoted son decides to recreate the fallen state so as to not be such a great shock to his mother's system.While the machinations that the son, Alex Kerner (Daniel Brühl- a better looking Ashton Kutcher), his girlfriend Lara (Chulpan Khamatova)- a Russian nurse who was tending to Christiane, sister Ariane (Maria Simon), brother-in-law Rainer (Alexander Beyer), and neighbors go to reveal an occasional chuckle, the film could really have been something special- and great, had it played the drama closer to reality. This is not to say that there are not sweet and funny moments, but they cannot compare with such a great premise and the potential for a real exploration into the human psyche and politics' place within it could have provided. That said, the film, as is, is a very good one, and the acting is stellar. So is how the film deftly avoids falling into being a screed or one dimensional propaganda piece against Communism. We can see the failings of that system when we see how Alex struggles to get a certain type of pickle brand, Spreewald pickles, so his mother will not know the difference. When we see him and his friend Denis (Florian Lukas) ridiculously try to simulate old East German TV newscasts we see how self-defeating a system that denies ingenuity and individuality is. To wave that about as a club is bastardizing the art of the film. If only more artists would learn what Becker's film knows. What makes Good Bye Lenin! work as a film is not its political implications, nor the political setup, but the human moments, and it is the relative lack of them vis-?-vis the film's length that make the film both a joy and bit of a disappointment, for it seems to be a mix of the old television movie of the week formula from the 1970s and a European arts film, and does not fully succeed either way. The film's lack of poesy is its greatest flaw. But, taken as it is, Good Bye Lenin! is a most worthwhile film and a good chronicle of a clan in an era now passed, long passed, it seems. If other films failed as well as this one does, well, would not success really be a thing?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see brilliant piece of history and fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is only the second German film I have seen, The Edukators being the first and I must say I was blown away with it from the very start. I normally can't concentrate threw films but with this I was paying attention threw the whole thing. I love Deutchland and everything about Deutschland and this made my passion even stronger.The whole idea of Alex's mother not knowing about the fall of the Berlin wall and the ideas she has come to believe in so strongly and how he loves her so much that he hid the truth from her to protect her is pure genius. Daniel Bruhl is an amazing actor and threw this whole film, he made me cry and laugh and kept my attention and wanting to know every little detail. What I loved the most was the whole idea that the how much he went to protect his mother was brilliant. I loved how he went back and remodeled her bedroom to the way it was before she had the heart attack, how he scum-aged threw the rubbish bins to get the old jars so she wouldn't see what had happened. I loved the whole idea that he would do anything for his mother even though she had a secret of her own is just great. I was really moved threw this film and I love how fact and fiction go together so well with a comic twist. This is by far the best film I have seen as of yet so I rate it 10. Brilliant plot line, fantastic actors, amazing chemistry between the actors, so much so that you could really believe this could actually happen. Makes me want to go back to Deutschland (I rarely put it in English!!) for a 5th time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a really hot October?Good Bye Lenin!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is quite interesting that I have been privy to three movies dealing with amateur film-making within a very short span this year. While Be Kind Rewind and Son of Rambow utilized the form for comedic purposes, the German film from 2003, Good Bye Lenin! differs slightly, even though humor is the main result. With a pretty creative premise, a pro-East German woman falls into a coma during the eight months of the fall of the Berlin Wall and her son and daughter must try to keep her calm by pretending the delineation still exists, director Wolfgang Becker lets his characters make up their own news in order to explain some of the craziness that is occurring, (the Coke banner being the funniest cause we all know the drink was created by the Communists). The plot is very unique and never feels like a gimmick, but instead a way to show the evolution of this broken and politically divided family. All that they have grown to know, the freedoms that the fall has brought, must be pushed aside in order to keep the matriarch from slipping back into a coma or worse. It is a painstaking process and one that needs the entire neighborhood's help. What could have become a farce or depressing melodrama actually straddles the line perfectly, creating a heartwarming piece of work about understanding one another and the power of love.I guess beginning this review with the fact of amateur film-making is a tad misleading. The process is a very small part of the proceedings, however, those moments are my favorite. Florian Lukas, a West German young man who is paired with the East German lead, Alex, played by Daniel Brühl, in their satellite TV job, is brilliant as the burgeoning filmmaker. He even says how the fake news is the best stuff he has ever cut and Alex's mother is the only person who will ever see it. The laughs are big during the sequences of videos as live news, but I think the final scene is the true masterpiece. While watching the last news segment at the end of the film, knowing what every character knows and doesn't know pertaining to each other, we as an audience are treated to the most powerful non-verbal moment of the entire work. Seeing his mother look at Alex holds so much meaning and emotion, those short glances are a culmination of everything that has happened previously.Despite the laughs sprinkled throughout, this film is really a drama containing many political ideas both on the governmental scale and in the home. You don't learn at the start about how much strife was caused by Christiane's, (Alex's mother portrayed by Katrin Sass), political slant. Raising her son and daughter after her husband has run off to the West becomes her mission only after her petitions and work for the Republic are done. She doesn't realize that her own son starts harboring opposite ideals nor that her country is holding back any source of progression. Her political affiliation has caused a lot of hardship in the Kerner family and her coma actually began to relieve some of it. Her daughter Ariane, (Maria Simon), finds a new boyfriend from the West, a job at Burger King, and the energy to live rather than stew in college when she didn't want to. Alex spends his days at her bedside, much like he did during her breakdown after their father left, finding a relationship with her nurse, a new job for a Western company, and a friendship with his crazy film-making partner. When she wakes up?commencing the meticulous system of hiding everything Western?is where the wheels fall off, everyone needing to stop their lives to keep her healthy. But, in the end, it is this standstill that allows each one to stop and take a look at where they are in life, and to decide what to do with what's left.While the acting is superb across the board and the story is intriguing, the visuals definitely add a layer of expertise. A lot of coincidence is infused in the story, allowing different things to be in the background so that they can eventually be found. From Alex's girlfriend, first seen at a protest and then again at his mother's hospital bed; the jar of pickles being searched for throughout to finally be seen as a water jar for painting; and the subtle moments like a red dot sticker and the last time to convert Eastern currency coming back later on, Becker really makes you pay attention to all that happens on the periphery. And some sequences are just shot beautifully, like the aforementioned Coke banner drop and the helicopter moving of a Lenin statue through the sky?fantastic to watch, very surreal.</fullReview>

The movie in a way or a nother have not escaped form the trend of western movies of putting the former social system and heavy criticize and showing it as corrupted system that don't have any bright side. but at the same time demonstrate that there is a lot of values the person and the community will lose when throwing it self in the lap of capitalism.The movie is great, take you in a small journey in the past with small family during the collapsing of the former eastern German social system.</fullReview>

The story just touches you everywhere, most very easy to relate to your life on some level, the relationships and the characters are immensely real, the emotion beyond intense, the historical value over the roof etc. etc. In my humble opinion, the German is incredibly lyrical and beautiful to listen to. Even though you cant understand it and you have to read the sub-titles instead, just hearing it brings you heart to tears. It's almost like reading No-Fear Shakespeare, with an emphasis on both sides of the page. As a side note, i think the movie would be even better if some of the deleted scenes with him and his girlfriend at the house would have been included. I always watch them, you should too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie in one word is just Extraordinary; A German picture with English subtitle isn't that kind of stuff to get me inspired but this one did and did it well.The story happens in the last days of communist parties in East Germany and the legendary fall of the wall. Alex's mom had a heart attack as she saw her own son beaten up by the communist troops distracting protesters; she was a member of the party herself and believed in the great goals of the leaders. Now she's in coma while the wall collapsed and came down so she's not gonna realize the revolution outside: The fact that her daughter ran into a misery and even she, herself had a heart attack and now the downward rush of unemployment and curse is pouring on people and Alex is now working for a X-TV.The only way to keep the mother alive is to keep her away from the reality taking place outside and about the truth that there's no East or West anymore, it's too much for her so Alex isolates her from outside and covers every leak of information by clever lies. She's got to live in the past to survive, that's a tough deal. Keeping the curtains down all the time, hiding from old fellows and even making up fake NEWS to pretend nothing's going on is a really genius idea to make a movie I guess.Alex makes another Germany for her mom that she was dreaming of every moment; it's no surprise that this fake one is way better than the real one.The scene with Lenin statue flying about and IKEA poster on the wall which leaves mom in a total bewilderment is just so great and clever. The scene with Alex facing his dad for the first time in adolescence is nice too. The scene with fake cosmonaut Sigmund's speech about communist when he goes "Socialism doesn't mean living behind the walls , it means reaching out to others" and the Ariane's dilemma of laughter and cry is so great, at last the scene with Alex pouring his mom's ashes instead of the dull chamber is another clever idea of this director. The idea that she dies happily in oblivion is like a sentimental bomb, be careful of that when you touch it, this thing has no safety switch ;) She's happy because she doesn't know what's going on, because she already has what she wants. What she believed in was well earned in her fantasy world made by Alex.This movie reminds me of "Amelie Poulain" because of its exclusive color arrangement, close ups and also dissolves; the music is really great and it's no surprise because it's another "Yann Tiersen"'s works. (Check out his music for "Amelie Poulain" it's a pure piece of art)You can also find this page in my weblog:http://rushville.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fall of the Berlin Wall and the years before that, already seems to be a sort of forgotten piece of history. Even though it all occurred no more then 17 years ago it already seems like ancient history to the rest of the world, although it still affects German people in several ways to this very day and East and West are still two sort of divided group of people. It's an important part of the 20th century history that we perhaps don't hear or learn enough about.It seems like a hard task to make a movie involving around the fall of the Berlin wall. "Good Bye Lenin!" however manages to the story from a very original point of view and gives the story some original twists. It makes the story interesting and entertaining to watch as well. "Good Bye Lenin!" manages to create its own style and atmosphere which makes the movie a one of a kind movie about set around an important event in recent history. The movie and especially it's story, that just seemed 'silly' at first sight, surpassed my expectations.The movie its both unusual and original take on the events set around the fall of the Berlin Wall make this movie a perfect mix of subtle comedy and drama. The movie becomes nowhere too heavy and nowhere too hilarious. It always manages to stay somewhere in the middle with as a result a well balanced movie that works on both levels, also thanks to the fine characters in the movie and the actors that portray them.The movie is visually good looking and it uses some nice costumes and settings. It perfectly knows to capture the feeling and look of '80's/'90's East-Berlin. The movie has some nimble editing and features some memorable sequences. Perhaps the story goes a bit wrong at moments but it doesn't really make the movie any less pleasant to watch.German cinema is getting better and better the last couple of years, with this movie as a perfect example of this.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

And before you say there goes the neighborhood, West Germans are moving into East Berlin.Mom has one wish to meet one last time her ex-husband who defected to the West many years ago.

It was funny without being slap-stick or full of lewd comments about bodily functions. It seems like so many movies claiming to be comedies only aspire to see how often they can be just plain sophomoric.'Goodbye Lenin' is funny in an intelligent way. Its humor is subtle. For example there is Alex's (the son and main character) never ending quest for a particular brand of pickles and various other foods long since out of production.It is funny in its portrayal of the lengths families will go to care for their own. We have all pretended to try to make someone's day better. In this film they just take it to more of an extreme.A definite 'keeper' for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fall of the Wall in 1989 was an important change not only in the political situation of Germany at that time, but also in the social situation of the inhabitants of the Eastern side. Having lived 40 years under the regime of communism, the sudden change to capitalism was a strong cultural shock. "Good Bye Lenin!" is a light hearted comedy with a strong and meaningful message, it is a movie that explores the social changes after the reunification, and its effects on a small family. This movie is that and more.Daniel Brühl is Alex, a young man in East Germany who was raised along with his older sister Ariane (Maria Simon) by his mother (Katrin Saß) after his father left home when they were children. One night, his mother has a heart attack that puts her in a coma; eight months later, the Wall has fall, capitalism is the new system and she just awoke.His mother has always been a loyal supporter of communism, and truly believes that the government is doing the best for the citizens; so Alex decides to not tell her that the government she admired so much has fallen and that everything is still the same as before the fall of the wall in order to avoid a second heart attack.The plot is quite original, and it is well handled as well, the movie is not only about Alex trying to make his mother believe that everything is normal, but also about Alex facing the new world by himself. Without getting compromised between political views, "Good Bye Lenin!" makes a great criticism to BOTH communism and capitalism, as Alex soon discovers the dark side of both economic systems.That is probably the strongest point of the movie, using light hearted comedy it raises interesting points about both systems and the movie never gets tiresome or boring. While it falls at times on sentimentalism, it always keep its intelligence and never relies too much on it.The acting is really good, particularly Daniel Brühl, who makes an excellent lead actor. His character, Alex, goes through a change reflecting the changing society of his time. Is he doing the charade to benefit his mother or to benefit himself? The answer is in the air as he is torn between the past and the future of his country, and the fake present he is building for his mother.A very thought-provoking comedy, that is truly worth a laugh. Don't expect typical slapstick or fart jokes, this is intelligent comedy and brilliant film-making. 8/10. Very Recommended.</fullReview>

The strength of the film is in the idea and the script. It really mines the comedy and pathetic ideas as the otherwise simple premise works itself out. I am particularly fond of the enterprise and technical proficiency Alex and his colleague show in creating contemporaneous TV bulletins - only to execute them with a hilarious lack of panache, totally in keeping with the GDR model they try to recreate.Bruhl and Sass are excellent as mother and son; Maria Simon also impressive as Alex's sister, Arianne. Surprisingly other roles are less well taken, with the exception of Alex's SatTV sales partner Denis (Florian Lukas). The drama's the thing though: I was particularly haunted by the very original coup as Alex's girlfriend Lara throws in a note of ambiguity towards the end, making a straightforwardly touching family drama something more profound (like in the denouement of Manon des Sources). Carefully, made, thoroughly good-humoured, but it'll put you through the wringer ? 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first heard of this movie late at night, listening to NPR, when a song from the soundtrack played. That one song stuck in my memory, but unfortunately the title did not, so about four months later I awoke in the middle of the night and remembered "Good Bye Lenin!" The modern history of Russia, seen through the eyes of these young people, really touched me as I learned more about the changes that became in the early 90s. I was too young to remember the Berlin Wall falling, so this was a new experience for me. Wolfgang Becker did an excellent job with the whole direction and feel of the movie. The cast is amazing, especially those who play Alex and Lara. And Yann Tiersen's score is in perfect harmony with the movie. This is truly a modern masterpiece, and a film for everyone, yes, everyone, to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good bye, Lenin! is a heartwarming tale of a boy's devotion for his mother and the lengths he will go to for her health. As Alex Kerner, Daniel Bruhl is excellent, and he is well supported by an equally strong cast of Germans. During the entire feature, I found myself following everyone's efforts to keep Alex's mother out of the loop and the ultimate events that turned Alex's life upside down. Good bye Lenin! is also beautiful because it reminds us of the lack of wealth that plaques Eastern Germany. Alex's sister leaving college to work at McDonalds demonstrates sadly this to a degree, but most it is closer revealed when Alex finds his mother's "hidden stash" of cash that is worthless because he did not get it to the exchange commission in time. The look of frustration on Alex's face as he realizes the irrelevance of the extinct currency is painful to view, simply because it reminds us that in every major change in the world, there are always those that are left behind and those that suffer because of this evolution.Good bye, Lenin! is a beautiful masterpiece. The power of the characters coupled with the amazing direction of Wolfgang Beckner will fill your hearts with a love for your family and a passion for your nation.Grade: **** out of *****</fullReview>

The boy makes up several strategies and situations not to let her mother to notice the deep changes in her daily life as a result of the end of the communism. I would like to stress Daniel Brühl'work, very well built. Also the direction very secure and concentrated.

Not to provide any sort of spoiler, the last 8 minutes of the film brought this movie up to a professional standard which is so hard to experience in the film industry today. There was no reveal, no surprise, appreciate what just happened and let it lie.

Despite that, I would recommend it to anyone as a fabulous feel-good movie. On the surface it is incredibly funny, but it has subtle undertones of sensitivity. Who else out there would go to such lengths to disguise a complete political upheaval from their loved one? At times it was quite touching to see the lengths the children went to, especially Alex. Just one tip- Do remember to mute it when the 'Unsere Heimat' song comes on or you won't stop singing it for weeks!

		<fullReview>GOOD BYE LENIN! is a comedy of a bittersweet kind. It showed the complexity of life amid the weightlessness of freedom, enticement of westernization, and the burden of abrupt change. Set against the historic collapse of the Berlin Wall, the movie pleasantly integrates comedy of situation, irony of fate, and the quarreling alliance between reality and the heart's decree, hence picturing a fundamental tale of being. Famed German caliber of production, affecting cinematography, soundtrack, and leading/supporting performances all chip in to the reaching of tender moments of connection between wordless language and feeling, the visual and sensory, love and life. Indeed, one of the most remarkable contributions in the European artistic cinema, a beautiful and heartwarming movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Good bye, Lenin!" is one of those films that really stand out for their unique idea and style. The story is about Christiane Kerner (Sass), a woman in East Germany, who after her husband abandons her and their two children to defect to the West, she devotes herself wholeheartedly to the Party. However, when she sees her son Alex (Bruhl) get arrested by the police, she suffers a heart attack and falls into a coma. The timing couldn't be more peculiar, as it is now year 1989, and during her coma Germany and the world go through a historic transformation: The Wall is down, DDR ceases to exist, and East and West Germany are re-unified. Everybody is excited by these historic events, but Christiane is completely unaware of these dramatic changes; when she wakes up after eight months, she thinks DDR continues to exist as before. On top of that, the doctors inform Alex and his sister Ariane (Simon), that due to her critical health condition, Christiane must by no means become excited or upset, for she faces grave danger for her life. As a result, Alex, with the reluctant approval of Ariane, and the help of his friends and neighbours, tries to "reconstruct" an image of the now defunct DDR, in an attempt to fool his beloved mother into believing that life carries on as before, and thus prolong her life as much as possible. However, it is inevitable that this implausible lie is extremely difficult to maintain, and on the other hand, Christiane has a secret on her own...Although the story may sound somewhat impossible, it is so nicely and reasonably represented that the flow of events seems very natural to the viewer. Moreover, beneath this interesting and unique story, lies the struggle of a young man, who within an environment of radical and historical transformations, tries to save the life of his adored mother against all odds. In fact, this struggle is actually his own: Despite the help he gets from the people around him, it is obvious that it is his own strong will that makes this impossible lie become truth in the eyes of his fragile mother. Both Sass and Bruhl give exceptional performances as mother and son, but this should not mean that the other members of the cast are not good; on the contrary, despite the fact that they are not widely known to the global general public, they can easily stand beside famous, class A, actors.Becker also does a great job in directing this excellent film, as he interwinds artfully this human story with the world-shaping events that take place around these people.In brief, a must-not-miss movie. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good bye, Lenin!: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many different plots that can be used for movies. Many of them are quite funny, but fizzle soon throughout the movie. Others have plots that sound funny but turn out not to really be comedies themselves (see also: The Cooler). Good bye, Lenin! is one of the latter. There haven't been that many movies based around the fall of the Berlin Wall, nor the aftereffects of it.Alex (Daniel Bruhl) is a young man living with his mother and sister in East Germany shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall. He protests against the communism as his proudly socialist mother Christiane (Kathrin Sass) watched and promptly has a heart attack and goes into a coma. Eight months later (which is after the Wall falls), she wakes up, but any excitement will give her another heart attack and kill her. In order to save his mother the shock of a capatalistic government, Alex tries to make her believe that her country is still communist by any means necessary.The general concept of this is very intriguing-a concept that could be bound for hilarity. It isn't, however. Instead, it goes onto a completely different path, one that works pretty well. The lengths that Alex goes to in able to keep his mother alive is pretty extraordinary. However, making this movie into a drama obviously leads to overdramatic acting, which is unfortunately what we get here. However, Sass's acting (especially when she doesn't even speak) is amazing. Good bye, Lenin! is a good movie when it doesn't try to be overly dramatic.My rating: 7/10Rated R for brief language and sexuality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good bye, Lenin! (2003), directed and co-written by Wolfgang Becker, is a film that has an interesting premise, but somehow fails to come together in a cohesive fashion.The basic plot involves Alex, a young man in East Berlin. Alex must prevent his mother from learning that the Berlin Wall--and, by extension, German socialism--has fallen. Daniel Brühl, the actor who plays Alex, looks like a cross between Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal. You can't help but hope that he can somehow succeed in this incredible deception.Unfortunately, there are several subplots in the film--involving Alex's sister and her husband, Alex's missing father, and Alex's romance with a Russian nurse--that don't really move the plot forward. It's as if the director didn't trust his main story, and had to fill out the film using whatever was at hand. Katrin Saß, who portrays Alex's mother, was 47 when the movie was made, and therefore could reasonably be expected to have children in their 20's. However, as an actor, Ms. Saß looks far too young for the role. She also looks far too healthy for a woman whose life will be endangered by the smallest shock.So, suspend disbelief, and see this movie for the main plot and the excellent acting. Don't expect a masterpiece; expect to be entertained by an interesting and unusual film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I was thunderstruck. The idea itself seemed so crazy, and yet so intelligent and appealing. Not often do you get to see an eighteen year old son fabricate an entire world just to spare his mother from suffering a heart attack. The director does an excellent job in presenting the trauma of Alex,Ariane and their mother, as they have to adapt to a new, "de-segragated" Berlin. The main emphasis is on the adaptation of each character. Alex struggles to make his mother believe that Berlin is still the same, that the Wall has not fallen, while his sister tries to keep up with his crazy ideas. The mother is suspicious, and yet she follows along Alex's attempt of making her happy. This movie deserves the best praise, because of its unique style and I have to say that it is by far better than any Hollywood gig about aliens, vampires or mutant superheroes. Goodbye Lenin is definetly a must see! 10/10</fullReview>

It ends with a fictional broadcast of the (fictional) cosmonaut announcing an end to a divided Germany.The boy grew into a young man who created a fictional world to protect his idealistic socialist mother (as he saw her) from suffering a second, fatal heart attack.The film examines the deep fear of political reprisal during the Soviet regimes, the painful dislocation of flight to the West, and reveals how secrets and lies have shaped both the government and this small family.Alex's efforts to shield his ailing mother from any hint of change, including finding discarded jars with familiar labels and creating bogus TV news, provide a wild and heart-warming humor to the middle part of the story. The ending brings back the long-absent father as well as insights and resolutions for everyone. The final celebratory sky rocket serves as the perfect exclamation point to a film full of surprises and the expectation of surprises.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pickles and other cravings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a standard joke about pregnant women that they have bizarre cravings for unusual foods, such as pickles. But in "Goodbye Lenin", a jar of pickles represents more than a craving. It symbolizes three of the noblest longings of the human soul: nostalgia for a bygone era; love of home, family and friends; and, above all, devotion to one's country.Alex's fondest childhood memory is his mother's active involvement in the socialist society of East Berlin. One day, she slips into a coma for several months and, during that time, her world changes overnight. The Berlin Wall falls; Western ideas and commercial goods flood in. When Alex's mother awakes, the doctor warns Alex that she must not become overexcited for any reason. Alex sets out to shield her from the earth-shattering news that socialist East Germany is no more.Alex enlists the help of a filmmaker friend to produce bogus newscasts and create the illusion that socialism is not dead. But politics is only one element of the fabric of a society. It is the details of everyday life that weave our memories of the past, our images of the present, our hopes for the future. (The most famous example is Marcel Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past", where the author's memories are unlocked by merely dunking a piece of cake in a cup of tea.)Something as simple as a jar of pickles satisfies our need for familiarity and stability in our lives. When a loved and remembered brand name is no longer available, we mourn the absence of the world and the worldview it represents.I can personally vouch for this. I can see, as if it were yesterday, the labels of the baking supplies my mother used, like the yellow-and-red canister of Fry's Cocoa. I remember the pale blue box, with an alp outlined in white, that contained the alum block my father used when shaving. These are but two instances among many.When we look back at times past, it is not so much the daily news or major political events we remember. Rather, we ask ourselves: What did we wear? What car did we drive? What music did we hear on the radio? What did Mother serve for family dinner?These are the kinds of details Alex must recreate to reassure his mother that time has stood still and her world survives. The ensuing effort to maintain the fantasy is at once comic and tragic. The poignant story moves us to both laughter and tears."Goodbye Lenin" is not just about the reunification of East and West Germany. It is also about the reunification of a family divided by human history and the human heart. "Goodbye Lenin" transcends the drama of the end of communism in a specific time and place. It ultimately becomes the universal tale of the sacrifices we make for those we love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Film About Germany's Reunification</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Good-bye, Lenin!" is a funny film about Germany's reunification. The performances are engaging, and Alexander's (Daniel Brühl) attempts to fool his mother Christiane (Katrin Saß) into believing the DDR still exists are oftentimes hilarious. Florian Lukas as Denis has especially good comic timing, I wish he was in some American films. This is a comedy, but not the laugh-out loud kind. Wolfgang Becker's and Hendrik Handloegten's script is very original.The film makes two good points. First, the DDR that Alexander creates for his mother is the DDR they both wished they'd lived in, rather than the one they actually lived in. Second, Alexander makes the observation that creating a fake DDR for his mom "takes a life of its own", and this is true. Becker's directing made me believe that if I'd started up a project like Alexander's, I would have gotten caught up in it too. The ongoing joke with the Spreeworld pickles is really clever.I don't think this movie will do well with American audiences (prove me wrong, please!) because most of them wont understand what the DDR was, or where it was, or where it went, even if you call it East Germany. But that's not important. What is important is this movie had the right mixture of entertainment and ideas, and is a joy to watch, and that's what movies are all about, right?</fullReview>

The film captured the atmosphere wonderfully, made you feel transported. I have been to Berlin twice previously, both in 1995 and Good bye, Lenin gave the sense of the history (if it can be called that) which even only nine years ago was so much more recent. The acting, too was flawless. The shots were great and the story was touching.

I learned more about Soviet Bloc folks might have perceived their countries and their government than I have in all the stuff I've read in the past 20 years.

		<fullReview>I saw this film today, and would happily see it a few more times. It was full of stuff and so wonderful that I'll be constantly thinking about moments and seeing more into all of them for days to come.I love German movies, being a German student, and I found the German was quite clear a lot of the time. There were several missing subtitles, but I could get the gist of what was being said anyway. There are some classic moments in this film that are very memorable, and others that build up the tension incredibly. One such example being that of the "Go West" blimp (I won't say any more for fear of spoiling such a moment!) I wouldn't place this movie under the comedy genre, unless it was ironical comedy, or satire, merely because comedy is a genre that immediately brings tacky humour and shallowness to mind (well mine at least). This movie is a political irony possibly, and is in no way shallow or tacky.See the movie, it is worth it and will teach everyone a lot about the differences between the DDR and the GDR, and the opinions of people who were strongly attached to the Socialist regime. I say again, SEE THIS MOVIE, whether you find it boring or whatever, you are bound to get something out of it....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been suggested that `German comedy' is an oxymoron but `Goodbye Lenin' gives the lie to that. Alexander's efforts to protect his pro-regime mother (Kathrine Sass) from the shock of discovering that East Germany (the DDR) and the Berlin Wall have vanished during the six months she has been in a coma are genuinely funny. It seems that the production values of DDR state television were so bad the forgeries produced by Alex (Daniel Bruehl) and his aspiring film maker friend Denis (Florian Lukas) are quite convincing. Alex re-writes history for his mother's benefit, giving socialism another chance.The angle taken here is that many citizens of the DDR `workers paradise' were actually happy with the way things were and found reunification and its effects very hard to take. I don't think the film makers were pushing the line that things were rosy under communism, but here is a group of people who suddenly lose their sense of security along with their jobs. The rather melancholy fact is that most people don't want to be free, as Luis Bunuel pointed out in `The Phantom of Liberty' (1974).Daniel Bruehl puts in a stunning performance as Alex. Wide-eyed, driven, nothing is too difficult to protect his mother, yet he makes it look like what any decent son would do. Kathrine Sass is also good as his ailing mother - we are never quite sure how much she actually knows.I happened to see this film the day after the last East German party leader, Egon Krenz was released from prison, after serving a 10 year sentence for ordering border shootings. A pleasant little film like this is not going to obliterate the true nastiness of the DDR regime but does help us to understand why not all the citizens cheered when the wall came down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a nice movie this is! The plot is pretty good and it's treated perfectly. I am surprised what a good movie can the Germans do (hope some will follow).However I can't agree with the director of this movie. He said it was mainly about family relationships - yes, there is this aspect, but the main thing is the regime. Non of those things could ever have happened to that family if SED didn't reign over the GDR.So what did I like? You can laugh and you can cry when you're watching it. I love how the communist regime is depicted. Possibly you can't enjoy this movie enough, if you don't live in a former socialist country. The TV news that those two guys create in the movie seem so realistic, but they are so extremely unreal!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see "Good Bye, Lenin!" expecting to see a good film.Was I wrong!This film isn't just good: it's a masterpiece! It's full of ideas, starting from the quirky plot. It's funny, but it makes you laugh in unexpected ways. It's also a film full of nostalgia and sadness, but sadness and fun are so intertwined that one is left dazed. It manages to tell a deep story in a light, unassuming way.This film is chiefly about how the great events of history have an impact on ordinary individuals. It's about the feeling that many must have experienced in the Soviet bloc when their repressive regimes crumbled, leaving everyone in need to think of their everyday lives in a way that was completely new and different.But it's also a film about the way a repressive, authoritarian regimes can disrupt people's lives, forcing them to lead lives full of lies and deceptions.Greatly recommended. One of the best films I've seen in years.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers I suppose one way of dividing moviegoers into two groups is those who like to know something about the movie before seeing it and those who don't. I belong to the first category. In a majority of cases, I find that knowing something in advance helps to enhance my enjoyment of the movie. In some cases, however, it works the opposite way. Goodbye Lenin is an example.The reason is simple. The clever (not particularly brilliant, mind you) plot is the main selling point of the movie. If you don't know anything about the plot, you'll find out about it 20 minutes into the movie. A loyal and idealistic Communist mother of two in East Berlin falls into a coma from a heart attack just before the Berlin wall comes down, and wakes up to a drastically changed world. For fear of a relapse of the heart attack, her devoted son is prepared to go to any length to shield her from reality. If you don't know the plot in advance, you wouldn't have much time to anticipate developments, and will therefore just follow and be immersed in the course of events.In my case, earlier special screenings of this movie has given it considerable publicity, to a small population of movie enthusiasts, if not the general public. Before walking into the cinema, therefore, I have already gone through in my mind, even if subconsciously, various scenarios that this plot can possibly give rise to. As a result, this main selling point, which is a sort of a distant cousin of Jim Currey's Truman Show, did not quite impress me. Fortunately, there is more to Goodbye Lenin than a sitcom, as my summary line has suggested. The theme of family value comes out quite late, but quite clearly, at the appearance of the estranged father. Everything comes together quite well in the permutation of relationships of father, mother, son, daughter and the latters' respective spouses. Portrayed by a cast of solid actors, these characters are welded into a good movie, although not a masterpiece as some would have you believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple, wonderful film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This bitter sweet film has all the ingredients for big success, both critically and with the wide audiences. It has a great, touching, memorable story, sublime acting, wonderful musical score. Everything fits perfectly.It's East Germany, 1989. Christiane Kerner (Katrin Sass), a tenacious communistic partisan, comrade, partial to its idealism, sees how her son Alexander (Daniel Brühl) is arrested and get's a heart attack. She falls into a coma. In the 8 months she's been away, much has changed. The biggest change - GDR doesn't exist anymore. The doctors don't give her much time to live, but Alexander insists to make her last days as beautiful and as satisfying as she remembered them prior to her accident. Because she should not get upset, there will be enormous trouble for Alex to arrange things how they were in the communistic country.It's a rare film, that makes you smile even in the bitter times the family is going through. Its easy way of story telling, the screenplay playing with us and the actor providing incredible climax will make your day. Good Bye, Lenin! is a remarkable piece of art. It's nostalgia, retro - to all the nations that were ever in the communistic block. It really brings back memories. Alex created Germany as he remembers it. (to make his mother feel she's still living in the good old times). It shows the genuine son's love and brings miracles to the screen.If Nowhere In Africa won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, there's nothing to stop Germany to win again this year. Lenin is not only better, it's definitelly a refreshment and simply fun to watch. And the images of Lenin's sculpture flying above Katrin Sass, are memorable and visually stun you!****1/2</fullReview>

It is set during a crucial period of history, it tells us (Westerners) a bit about life in the East and more importantly, it is a beautiful and very moving love story between a son and his mother. You probably smile more than you actually laugh but it doesn't matter. The story is very strong and you can relate to the characters, first among them is Alex (the son).

		<shortDescription>1989</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1989 was definitely one of the most important years in recent history. Does anyone remember the Berlin Wall falling, how everyone was talking about the world that was changing, the end of history and all that? Anyone remembers two years later when the Soviet Union collapsed, the Cold War ended and we all knew something very important was happening to the world and we were all hoping things would get better. Well most of our hopes didn't come true, but that's not what this film discusses.A family lives in East Berlin in 1989, a mother and her 2 children (the father had gone to West Berlin 9 years ago and never came back). One day the mother will see her son protesting against the government and she will fall into a coma. A coma she will wake up from after 8 months. In the meantime Germany has changed. The wall has fallen. Coca Cola has intruded East Berlin, people are losing their jobs everywhere, the eastern german monetary unit isn't valid anymore and astronauts who were once national heroes drive a taxi to make a living. And all that in one night. When the mother wakes up from the coma the doctors warn her children that she should not go under stressful situations otherwise her situation will get worse. But can there be a bigger shock than the fall of the Wall and everything else that followed? Her kids with the help of some friends and neighbours try to make everything like it was for their mother. They never tell her about the Berlin Wall and they try to convince her that nothing has changed and the only reason they do that is because they love her. Goodbye Lenin is a beautiful film about love and about a world that changes so quick around us that sometimes we don't even have time to cope with the changes. Yann Tiersen's (who was also responsible for the Amelie soundtrack) soundtrack is excellent and it makes the film even more beautiful. The best film of the year so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. It treats the subject of reality manipulation in a fresh and touching way: The author even uses real images and speeches to illustrate the exact opposite of what really happened. Confrontation between words and images, between reality distortion and the big and small hypocrisies we all indulge ourselves lead the intelligent (or any average) homo sapiens to a questioning of our own interpretation of often taken for granted social facts.The form chosen: A powerful narrative between the delightfully nostalgic (or Ostalgic) and the joyfully deep. A sensitive yet comic drama, a witty outlook on human nature yet based on the ingenuity of a young man's determination to ignore, within a shell, the waves of a bigger sea. Reality, as incurred by the characters is tragic, in it's essence. Yet, this is not just a tragic moaning movie. It is very pleasant to see and hear.

		<fullReview>A very enjoyable movie ...... for those who are familiar with the former German Democratic Republic. It is no surprise that this movie did very well in Germany.Good bye, Lenin! provides us with an excellent picture of the artificial GDR-state. A society definitely gone by now, but remembered well by those who knew it. The tongue-in-cheek humor throughout this movie serves as a background for the displayed tragedy following the GDR's collapse in 1989. Tragedy for its elderly citizens, well moulded and taught in its Communist ways, not able to adapt themselves to the rules of a free enterprise-society.For those who are not familiar with the former GDR, I guess Good bye, Lenin! is no more than just another movie. A well-shot and well-acted movie, certainly, but one without any special significance. However, some effects in GL! are probably lent from other movies. For instance, the helicopter carrying Lenin's statue through the Berlin skies reminds me of 'La Dolce Vita', by Fellini in 1960. There a statue of Jesus Christ is transported in the same way over the city of Rome. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>You might assume that a German film about recent German history would not appeal to people from outside the Bundesrepulik, but this film will make you think again. The demolition of the Berlin Wall was not just the freeing of the East, but also a display of Eastern life to the West. Those from within the Wall had to learn to integrate with their newly unified neighbours.Fourteen years on and 'Good Bye Lenin!' allows viewers to reflect on the difficulties Berliners faced with the newly discovered liberties. For the Westerners, this involved sharing their wealth with their long lost siblings; this aspect has been very well documented from the outset. But for 'the other half', emergence from Communism presented challenges which the previous political system evaded, where a lifestyle was certain, if somewhat dull; it is only now, thanks to presentations such as this film, that the West is being to appreciate the pitfalls of overnight liberation.Whether your background relates to 'the West' or the Soviet Bloc, you'll learn a lot from 'Good Bye Lenin!'. And not without a smile too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Startling and unusual black comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Bye Lenin is a startling and unusual German black comedy, directed by Wolfgang Becker. Before the fall of the Berlin wall, East German pro-Communist Christiane Kerner (Katrin Sass), has an accident that leaves her in a coma. Before she wakes up, the Berlin wall falls. Her son Alex (Daniel Bruhl) is warned that any kind of shock could kill her. Therefore, when she recovers, he pretends nothing has changed in East Berlin and undertakes an elaborate deception to prevent her thinking otherwise.This is a hilarious film, which manages to be political without being preachy and poignant without being sentimental. The plot provides a fascinating inside look at German reunification using historic touchstones such as the 1990 world cup to good effect.SPOILER AHEAD:Most interesting however, are the lengths Alex goes to keeping up the facade. He even creates fake news broadcasts with his wannabe film director friend, in which the fall of the Berlin wall is reversed, saying refugees from West Germany are fleeing to the East to escape the excesses of Capitalism.Politically, the film is wonderfully even handed. The fake East Germany Alex creates is far better than the corrupt, oppressive Communist regime that actually existed. At the same time Capitalism is seen as no better than Communism, with the onslaught soulless consumerism destroying the hopes and dreams of many, including a former East German cosmonaut reduced to driving a taxi for a living. The films many bitter ironies are handled with great delicacy. The emotional undercurrents are beautifully understated with exquisite performances by the entire cast.Good Bye Lenin gently echoes the ideas of other films such as The Truman Show and Life is Beautiful, whilst remaining a completely unique experience in itself. I strongly recommend you make the effort and see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happens when you sleep through the biggest event of the last 40 years? How would you react when you find out? And what if you have a heart condition???This is the angle adopted by 'Good Bye, Lenin!', a funny and enjoyable movie set in East Berlin as the wall falls and East and West are reunited.It's 1989, and Alexander Kerner's mother has recently collapsed, and fallen into a coma. After 8 months, she regains consciousness and, although weak, seems to be recovering well. There are two problems however - her condition will not stand another heart attack, meaning she must avoid stressful or shocking situations. Unfortunately while she was unconscious, the old divisions began to come to an end, and her home is no longer the divided city she knew. With so much radical change, can her children keep the truth from her, and act as though all is as it was?This intelligent and touching film explores the love a family can have for a parent laid low by illness, and the way ordinary people come to terms with radical social change.Although Alex and his sister Ariane are primarily concerned with shielding their mother from the news of reunification, in many ways the film is just as much about the effect on them of the changes they've lived through. As Alex in particular battles to keep up the deception (organising a traditional East German birthday party, searching high and low for a particular brand of pickles now rendered elusive by free-market choice and imported alternatives), he grows increasingly frustrated by the easy acceptance of Western values and attitudes, and the automatic assumption that the old ways must be entirely abandoned for new.Great performances from all the principals lend the movie a believability and warmth not often seen in movies these days - we're all going to be faced with our parents' mortality, and in time our own as well. Through Alex and Ariane we examine these issues, and hopefully realise that by showing patience and compassion we can get along a bit better.Many might be put off by the fact that the film is in German with subtitles, but that would be a shame because this movie deserves an audience. In general, if a foreign-language film is good enough, I soon forget that the subtitles are there (while still making use of them), and become drawn into the story - 'Good Bye, Lenin!' certainly falls into that category, and I recommend it to just about anyone.</fullReview>

Does one ask Germans according to its opinion to this movie, he usually get negative criticisms of West German ones however positive criticisms of the Germans from the former GDR. Why is it like that? Many of the West Germans are going into the movie, without having any conception of the life in the GDR. It's is not clear to them that one could live also in the east of Germany without continuous fear. That one could love. Could have fun. They do not understand the fact that also the East German had fun alive and not they are not only sitting and crying in their chambers.The film is ingenious! It creates the balance between the good memories and the negative sides. Also the mix from Drama and Comedy, that often one criticizes stands for the film very well to face. How can one criticize such a combination? Most of the best comedies have also tragic sides.Clearly 10 points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film. It's odd, because it's billed as a comedy, "The DDR lives on - in 79sq m", but overall, the tone is much more serious. Although the premise is a bit far-fetched - A very patriotic woman in the DDR falls into a coma in October 1989, and when she wakes up, the whole world seems to have changed. To try to protect her from the shock, her grown son is determined to keep her in the dark about what has happened, 'resurrecting' the DDR in the apartment the family shares. This leads to a lot of comical situations, such as searching for the old DDR brands of food products and creating news from the DDR, to things that would be funny if they weren't so tragic, such as shredding old DDR banknotes in frustration after missing the deadline for trading them in.The entire cast was great, Daniel Brühl did a great job as Alex, the main character, and I was very impressed with Chulpan Khamatova as Lara, the young nurse-in-training from the USSR that Alex falls in love with, and with Maria Simon as Ariane, Alex's sister who is a single mother trying to survive, trading in her studies for "Thank You for choosing Burger King today". As a type of comic relief, Florian Lukas does a great job as Denis, Alex' co-worker and friend, helping Alex reconstruct a little corner of the DDR.But how long can this fantasy last? And will Alex be willing to keep up the charade, even if it means straining the relationships he has with others. And in the end, Alex may not be the only one keeping secrets of elephantine proportions.</fullReview>

It's a brilliant character study, not a historical documentary. The dialogue feels like a diary, with Alex subtitling all the events with varying humility, sensitivity, hilarity and sadness. This film will bring you all of the same emotions. It will make you laugh, cry, and often feel unsure of which to do. Never mind that it's a film about something specific to Germany. As you watch it, you will a part of what's happening. It's about change, the modern world, a clash of cultures and the passing of time. It's an astonishing film, full of clever lines and events which are referred to and ends which are tied up later. It feels perfectly cyclical, profound and well-thought out. I'll never forget the scene of the helicopter carrying the statue of Lenin away: probably one of the most moving scenes i've seen in cinema.See it!</fullReview>

The story line attracted my attention, but the cover design was so unattractive. I almost put it back on the shelf again. I am glad that I rented this movie. It is the best.One problem is that the mother doesn't look so sick; she doesn't look like a person who can have two heart attacks. She reminds me of the mother in Titanic. I especially like how she looked at her son at the end of the movie when she already knew what happened to the outside world.This story is sad and funny. Now looking back for what happened at that time, it just seems to be sad that the East German people have to suffer for so long. And it is tragically funny how the son showed through his fake news of an idealized East German.At first, I thought that two hours movie is just too long. But at the end, I kept hoping that movie will last for just a little longer. And I kept hoping that the mother will recover. What a great son that she has, and it also reminds me about my own aging parents, one day, I will also have to face their inevitable death. This movie just completely hit me in many emotional levels, I don't usually give a film a total 10, but this one deserves a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Although I had every intention of seeing this one during its theatrical run, I found myself planning my evening schedule around the start time on the Encore movie channel.The trailer for "Lenin" had lead me to believe that this would be a serio-comedy, while in fact it turned out to be very much a drama placed during one of the most active historical periods of the past 100 years. Centering on the fall of communism in Berlin, young Alex (played wonderfully by Daniel Bruhl) works feverishly to prevent his fresh from a coma mom (also played wonderfully by Kathrin Sass) from realizing that her beloved socialist society had been ripped apart during her 8 months of silence.The TV newscasts the mom witnesses are pure brilliance as is the birthday tradition that is continued in her honor. However, this one is much more about drama and human emotion that comedy. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but again, the trailer was somewhat misleading.Watching the family unite for mom's sake and seeing the impact this woman had on her kids - both positive and negative - is quite enlightening and heartfelt.Director Wolfgang Becker does a nice job showing the country and family in turmoil, but I believe so much more could have been done with the script. This is what prevents this one from becoming an instant classic.</fullReview>

The fact that it is in German is a great plus, the action seems more vivid.The whole plot is quite interesting, the fact that his mother woke up from a long lasting coma is considered to be a miracle. So, to avoid any strong emotions, the boy hides her from the truth...eventually she dies in a communistic country, a "country that she believed in". The simple thought of living in a world of lies is disturbing, but that meant the survival of his mom for a longer time. Times change, but you are frozen in time, you may not adapt.

		<fullReview>[ s p o i l e r s ]The story of a boy who tries to pretend to his sick mother that the Berlin wall is still up and Germany is not reunifying, `Goodbye, Lenin!' is full of offhand affection for the rinky-dink idealism, the complaints and self-criticism, the general incompetence and stagnation of the old communist world, which are seen in humorous retrospect as peaceful and safe. Capitalism is rapacious and cruelly materialistic and progress ain't all that great when you think about it, co-writer-director Wolfgang Becker seems to be saying.Young Alex Kerner is trying to shield his mother from what's going on. She has had a heart attack and slipped into an eight-month coma. During that time the Berlin wall has fallen and the Eastern sector where the Kerners live has changed rapidly and forever. He's been led to believe that when she awakens, any shock can cause another attack. So Alex (the pretty, virginal-looking Daniel Brühl) goes to any lengths to hide from his mother, Christiane (Katrin Sass) the day-to-day facts of life in the new, changed East Berlin.Charming but a bit saccharine, this Rip van Winkle saga is a story of nostalgia, resistance to change, family devotion, and above all, the most touching filial love. But perhaps its main subject, which has made it immensely popular in Germany itself, is the rediscovered appeal of the old communist world. Viewed with 'Ostalgie' -- in rose-tinted retrospect -- that world now looks to Germans as if it was at least motivated by wise and pleasant dreams. The new world is comfy, but has underpinnings of nastiness and greed. And look what the collapse of the Communist Block has got us: "endless war" and American empire.Early flashbacks show us that Christiane had became an ultra-zealous party loyalist after her doctor husband fled to the West, seemingly to unite with another woman. Her reaction to this trauma was to lose herself in socialist volunteer work. In fact, her heart attack and coma were actually brought on by seeing Alex in a demonstration against the Wall, but happily she has no memory of that. A lot of the movie consists of blissful recreations of the old East Berlin world either in narrated travelogue-style flashbacks or pale yellow-tinted shots of Alex's makeshift fakery. There is a briskness and good humor about all this that is infectious and fun.During mama's coma Alex has acquired a girlfriend and a job selling satellite disks, and his sister, who also lives at home, has had a baby and quit school to work at Burger King. Alex arranges to have his mother brought home but beforehand he restores her room to its pre-perestroika dinginess. He searches out containers for food products from the old days (all of them out of use now) to decant new replacements into; bullies family, friends, and neighbors into cooperating; and gets his coworker in the new job, an aspiring moviemaker, to edit old TV news footage and play news anchorman in concocted films they feed via VCR into a TV his mom watches - all to hide any glimpse of westernization. All this makes for much funny, frenetic, and affectionate action.Alex's ingenuity knows no bounds. When a huge Coca Cola poster appears out mom's window, he and his pal concoct a news story showing that the beverage was really an East German invention and the West has just lost a patent struggle. They even alter video clips of the Wall's collapse so it looks like the Wessis - maddened by their own shallow capitalist lives and thirsting for socialism - are pouring into the East. Alex finds a cosmonaut retired into taxi driving and uses him as a fake new East German president in films for Christiane.Basing the whole story on the need for family and the attempt to save a fragile, beatific mom was a wise move for the filmmakers. As Alex struggles toward manhood, his attempts to preserve a vanished world for just a little longer have poignancy. A resonant message of the film is that change, even when it brings material improvement and a fuller life, can be disturbing and hard to endure.`Good bye, Lenin!' has many genuinely heartwarming moments in its first half. Towards the end the mother reveals to the son and daughter that their father really didn't defect to join another woman. He just sought a better life and wanted them to join him; but mom was too afraid of change and hid his letters. The comedic elements are swamped by heaviness when Alex goes to find his dad, and the final segments seem clumsily thrown together (there were five writers on the project). The finale in which mom's ashes are scattered over the reunited city by means of a toy rocket and fireworks is flashy but signals an abandonment of the profundities hinted at earlier, as well as of the wise humor.Alex's project reminds us that the communists in fact were always devotees of fake window dressing, mimicking a façade of prosperity and progress and hiding their inadequacies from visiting dignitaries and their own citizens. The Bulgarian-born artist Christo Javacheff, for example, got his start dressing up landscapes to deceive party bosses on tour. For all its sentimentality, which grows intense and pointless when the lost father is returned, `Good bye, Lenin!' has thought-provoking and perceptive elements at its core. It's aware that Eastern Europe was itself a façade and that Alex's loving recreations are a fake improvement on a fake thing - and thus that the 'Ostalgie' East Germans may feel now is itself an illusion. As Alex puts it, summing up the film and perhaps defining its internal weaknesses, `The DDR I created for her became the one I would have wished for." By the same token, fake nostalgia can be a cover for wasted lives. Though this film may not quite know where to go with its ideas, it has them, and that's more than can be said for most products on our capitalist market.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect film about the dreams that soviet people lost.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think only the people who touched somewhen the Soviet regime can understand what does that film wants to tell you about. Really it's full of tears and laugh. You can think good or bad about the Soviet Government, but after 1990 many people have lost practically everything they believed at; after 1990 the social chaos came instead of the social protectability. In the film you can see how the Western Berlin changed from 'the city for citizens' to 'the city for advertisment'. Yes, people were not very rich, but they were socially protected and there were no social disparity. The person felt himself much more better even without much money. The soviet government taught the children at school not how to sell or buy, not how to cheat or trick someone as now; but it taught them how to be kind, how to be honest. And children dreamt to become scientists and engineers or cosmonauts, and there were practically no people who wanted to become commercial or even speculator. But the socialism remains to be a great dream. It can be realized inside the mind of one person or even group of the people. And maybe on the whole planet in future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughter and tears in Germany's recent past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I strongly recommend this film to everybody in this world.Set in 1989 and 1990 Germany, the main character's mother falls into coma on the 40th anniversary of GDR. Unconsciously lying in hospital for 8 months, she misses the fall of the Berlin Wall and what comes beyond, capitalism entering the communist east.Finally awaking, she (deeply rooted in GDR) is strongly endangered of dying if not being kept free from any excitement, which is why her son faces the quest to hide capitalism from her and pretend that GDR would still exist.Whereas there are many very funny scenes in this film, and also nostalgic scenes for those from East and West Germany who remember these days of change very well, it is also, maybe even mainly, an intense and sad study of what love and fear of loss can make us do, trying to overcome any obstacle there is at any cost. We may succeed, we may fail. But it is trying that counts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the regime change that ends well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what the film's title would suggest this is a film not about politics of the state, but about the politics of the family. Although the lengths that Alex (the always likable Daniel Brühl) goes to in order to keep the Communist illusion alive for his dying mother often induce laughs from their sheer farce, these never betray the film's emotional heart: Alex is always endearingly earnest in his efforts, never failing to be touchingly genuine even when filming a mock-newscast starring his fake-moustached, trouserless friend Denis (Lukas) in order to further the deception.Outside of the key central characters of Alex and his mother,the supporting characters provide the film with an interesting variety. Further emotional substance is provided by the relationships between the Kerner family and (arguably underused)seemingly estranged-patriarch, his deployment gives us an interesting side-story in itself as well as helping to flesh out the central character's emotional background. Onhand to provide comic relief are Alex's brother-in-law Rainer, who's somewhat more liberal Western lifestyle often threatens to derail Alex's plans; as well as Alex's best friend Denis, who brings warmth and a dry humour to most scenes in which he features.The film's unique setting never fails to intrigue. This is a region where a way of life has died and been replaced by new ideologies, a new society. The worthlessness of old East German money as well as the fall from grace of Sigmund Jähn from once heroic cosmonaut to taxi driver illustrate this. Through such a setting, it is believable that a staunch socialist such as Alex's mother could very well be in real danger of suffering a fatal second heart attack should she appreciate these developments. The threat is palpable, the emotion is genuine. This is a film of real warmth with some great and natural comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the reason why I love foreign movies. A very intelligent and funny story that has tragic moments and moments of romance as well. A laugh and a cry, what more does a movie need? The acting was awesome. Daniel Brühl gave an excellent performance, as well as Katrin Saß and the other actors.I'm not German and I don't know much about this subject. I still liked this movie, although I think people who know more about this subject or people who actually experienced this period of German history, will understand more of it.Anyway, experienced it or not, see this movie!

		<shortDescription>A must-see (especially for Eastern Europeans).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I completely agree with the opinion that this movie is an intelligent, humorous and moving (though, luckily, not in a mushy manner) masterpiece. I am glad to know, what I have recently found out, that it might be amusing and entertaining even for people who had not had the opportunity to get a good insight into the problems of people living in DDR or other formerly communist countries, experienced during and shortly after the crucial events connected with the change of the political system. However, what makes me greatly appreciate this movie, apart from its universal value which I guess is quite obvious to everybody who has seen it, is also a thought, which has been glimmering in my mind while I watched Becker's picture. A reflection, caused by the fact that I live in a country where something similar to the changes presented in the movie took place, and intensified by the so-called "cultural humor" which is an inherent part of the film (and is in fact comprehensible not only to Germans), an idea, that what happened to the main character and its family could have happened to someone in my neighborhood as well. What I am trying to say, is that the cultural and historical background in some cases might have a grand significance for people watching "Good bye Lenin", and therefore I recommend it especially to those, who will be able to understand its historical context (though it does not mean the others will not enjoy it!). Thank you, goodnight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With "Goodbye Lenin!" (2003), German cinema is very well and by showing that it can deliver a true gem from time to time, it still reserves us good surprises. Besides, the commercial triumph of the film abroad was precisely a surprise. True, it filled with enthusiasm about 6 million of German spectators which is nearly normal since the action unfolds during a key-date of their history: 1990 but one didn't expect that the movie would ride high in the box-offices of numerous countries in the world. I think this success is witness of a comforting thing: there are still many people in the world with a taste for a cinema of quality.I noticed that for a while, German cinema has the gift to reject hackneyed topics or to renew them through an unexpected treatment as the frenzied "Lola Rennt" (1998) showed. Or otherwise, it can favor new ideas. "Goodbye Lenin!" definitely ranks in the second category.Basically, there's an original idea that we have never seen treated on the screen: to tell on a comic mode the reunification of Germany and Berlin in 1990. This idea is very well exploited and gives a watertight screenplay which constitutes the main strength of the film. The heart of the movie begins in October 1989. Because she saw her son beaten as he was demonstrating in the street to demand more liberties, Christiane Kerner had a coronary and went into a deep coma for several months. In the meantime, wall of Berlin fell down. When she awoke, communist system has disappeared and left place for a gigantic capitalist economy with, among others Coca-Cola and Burger King as its symbols. Eager not to cause her a second coronary that could kill her, her son Alex, with the help of his friends and close relatives decides to reconstitute in her mother's bedroom, life as it was during the communist system.On the paper, "Goodbye Lenin!" is, first, to be taken as an inventive situation comedy which from a fragile topic unlikely to hold well water, increases the sudden new developments and continually revives the spectator's attention. It is sufficient to read the end of the previous paragraph to have an overall idea of the situation and to begin to smile. Just try to imagine this: a bedroom decorated and furnished like during the communist time in the middle of Berlin that is converted to the capitalist rules with in the background significant events which happen to Germany in 1990 like its victory at the World Cup or the day it celebrated its reunification on 03 October 1990. So, this bedroom was conceived by Alex and unlike his friends and close relatives who try to "rock (in their own way) in the newly free world", he isn't really touched by the wonders but also the excess of the capitalist world. Her mother's frail health is much more on his mind and he fully devotes himself to take care of her and not to reveal her the truth about Berlin since the 09 November 1989. One must recognize that the process (hare-brained if they are) designed to avoid a deadly shock to her mother are of an impressive ingenuity like the false television news and it works for Christiane can't see anything. Although "Goodbye Lenin!" belongs to the register of the comedy, the director Wofgang Becker is a real master of the suspense and brilliantly handles the delaying effect. Indeed: to which extent, Alex can invent or find tricks likely not to shock her mother? And to which extent can the latter accept to be well treated until she gets tired of comforting but boring words like "You can't go out Mum. You've got to rest"? If she fully recovers, will Alex have to tell her that Berlin is under the capitalist influence? I don't want to reveal much of the film but go and see for yourself.On a second degree, "Goodbye Lenin!" can also be read as a satire of the former communist system. The bedroom can be considered as a metonymy of East Berlin, even of the whole communist world. Beside this satire, Wolfgang Becker describes with a touch of irony, wonders but also exaggerations of the capitalist universe and reactions of the former inhabitants of East Berlin are always pertinent, either it is wonder (customers in a video shop hypnotized by a porn movie) or nostalgia (Alex's old neighbor who regrets the former communist system).Overrall, "Goodbye Lenin!" is a refreshing and witty work from start to finish that cleverly and skilfully exploits an original idea. Tinged with a huge tenderness for its characters, especially Christiane, it contains sequences which would deserve to go down in the history of cinema because they are true anthology moments. Those who have seen the movie may know which sequences I am thinking of. A movie which strikes right at the heart just like Yann Tiersen's simple but efficient original soundtrack which should delight numerous piano players.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a thoroughly enjoyable, completely charming film--one of those rare movies that successfully manage to blend drama and comedy! The actors do a great job, the characters are totally endearing (even the mother, a staunch communist, is portrayed sympathetically), and the dialogue was well-written; the plot, which is fascinating in and of itself, is executed wonderfully and to its full potential. I guess that it could have been done better, but I for one don't see how. Goodbye, Lenin! focuses on an incredible period in history, gives it a human face, and then manages to include a story so interesting that anybody with a brain would enjoy it.

		<shortDescription>Comedy or drama?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of a socialist mother in East Germany who falls into coma while watching a demonstration in October 1989 and waking up eight months later. In the meantime the German Democratic Republic and everything which was typical for it has ceased to exist. To not endanger her life, her son fools her into believing the old GDR still exists.Good idea, but the filmmakers couldn't decide whether to make this a comedy or a drama. The result is, at times it is quite funny, but overall - hmmm - I would not consider it boring, but I didn't find it exciting either. On TV it would have been okay, but not on the big screen.It was quite interesting though to see the differences which had existed between East and West Germany and how everything has changed in East Germany after the reunification.It was also fun to see to what lengths the caring son goes to explain to his mother all those changes during the reunification which he could not hide from her (like advertisement, fugitives in the Prague embassy, West European cars in the streets...) to make her believe she still lives in the German Democratic Republic. He even fakes the news on TV.But at times, especially near the end, the pacing is too slow and after a while there are no new ideas left. They could easily have cut it by 10 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Good Bye, Lenin!" is a 2003 comedy starring Daniel Bruhl, Katrin Sass, and Maria Simon, directed by Wolfgang Becker, who co-wrote the script.Bruhl, who has since done films such as Inglorious Bastards and The Fifth Estate, plays a young man, Alex Kerner, in an East Berlin family consisting of his mother (Sass), his sister (Simon), and later her husband and child. His father went to West Berlin on business and found love with another woman, and never returned, according to their mother.Alex's mother becomes catatonic after her husband leaves and is committed to a mental institution. She comes home some time later, back to her old self. She becomes a social activist and does work with children, including directing a choir. She even receives a special government award.During a government protest, in which Alex is arrested, his mother, trying to get somewhere, has a heart attack. She goes into a coma. Alex sees on television that Honecker, one of his mother's idols, has resigned. Then the wall comes down. His mother is comatose through it.Alex feels that his mother is too fragile to receive any of this dramatic news, so once she wakes up, he keeps up the illusion that it is still the same old East Germany. He has his aspiring filmmaker friend (Florian Lukas), who now sells satellite systems door to door, produce fake newscasts, which he then puts into a VCR and shows as the current news. Since the supermarkets now contain new food, he has to dig old pickle bottles out of the garbage, disinfect them, put in pickles, and relabel the bottles so she won't know they're no longer available. It's a lot of work, but the doctors aren't sure that his mother will survive, even though she is awake. In the meantime, Alex falls in love with a nurse at the hospital, Lara (Chulpan Khamatova).Really interesting, sometimes dramatic, sometimes poignant, sometimes funny film about all the changes that went on in East Berlin after the wall fell, and the westernization. At one point, when neighbors tell Alex's mother that they are from Wuppertal (in the west), Alex explains that the west is a mess and that many people are emigrating to the east.All the acting is very good, especially from Katrin Sass, who gives a wonderful performance as Alex's mother. Daniel Bruhl as Alex is very earnest as the caring son.All in all, a warm, original story and quite fascinating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Bye Lenin!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I obviously recognised the title of this German film from the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I wondered what the meaning of it was, but either way I was going to watch it and hope for the best. Basically, in East Berlin, Christiane Kerner (Katrin Saß) had two traumatic events affect her life, the first in 1978 was her husband Robert (Burghart Klaußner) running away with another woman, leaving her with her adolescent children Ariane (Maria Simon) and Alexander 'Alex' (Daniel Brühl), and in 1989 Alex marching in protest against the Berlin Wall is arrested and Christiane suffers a heart attack and goes into a coma, the country drastically changes, including the Wall being taken down. Before this incident she was angry for a long time with the husband who disappeared, and the life of her family changes due to their home being infiltrated by the capitalist world, and eight months later when she recovers from the coma her health is still weak. Christiane is told that if she experiences another shock it could mean her suffering another heart attack and perhaps even certain death, so to protect her Alex avoids talking about their new living environment, and he makes sure she is not exposed to anything damaging. Ariane and Alex's Russian immigrant girlfriend and the mother's nurse Lara (Chulpan Khamatova) do not support Alex's idea, and the recreation of East Germany is an extreme measure that go along with, but it is unclear how far they will go to stop Christiane from suffering another attack, but in the end she dies peacefully, and her ashes are scattered in both East and West Germany. Also starring Florian Lukas as Denis Domaschke, Alexander Beyer as Rainer and Michael Gwisdek as Principal Dr. Klapprath. The acting I suppose was fine, and the story of before and after historical events in alright, the fall of the Berlin Wall was obviously a significant event in history, I will be honest I did not find myself laughing at whatever humour was meant to be portrayed, but it was a near interesting enough comedy drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perceptive and ambiguous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The time of the fall of the Berlin Wall must have been both exhilarating and disorienting for East Germans; though many might have dreamed of such a day, the speed and totality with which their former lives were erased must have been hard for many to come to terms with. 'Goodbye Lenin' is a lightweight but perceptive comedy, the story of a boy whose communist mother spends the key events comatose, and who protects her, when she wakes, from the shock of the change by creating an illusory world where nothing has altered, save for the arrival of refugees from the west, a conceit imagined to explain the apparent westernisation of East German society. Strangely, the film ducks its own natural conclusion, leaving us to guess at what the hero's mother really would have made of the truth; but it's still a worthwhile exploration of the ambiguous feelings that many would have had in this period of turmoil and change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodbye Berlin Wall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sad/funny film by the talented but under-employed director Wolfgang Becker is a sombre history lesson in the form of a hilarious farce. The film necessarily means much more to the Germans themselves than to the rest of us, because it deals with their 'Vaterland' issues, und so wieder, nicht wahr? But we can deeply appreciate it as outsiders looking in. An amazing performance by the actress Katrin Sass gives the unlikely tale its credibility, as does the deep earnestness of the actor who plays her son, Daniel Bruehl, who has gone from strength to strength in the continental cinema world since then, appearing all over the place in the unlikeliest films. The film also has a delightful Tatar girl from Kazan named Chulpan Khamatova playing a Russian nurse working in an East Berlin hospital, named Lara. She tells Bruehl that she was named Lara by her parents after the heroine of 'Doctor Zhivago'. The irony is that the actress herself played the character Lara in a Russian TV mini-series of 'Doctor Zhivago' in 2006 (a prophecy fulfilled?). This comedy deals with the problem of keeping the truth about the fall of the Berlin Wall from a woman who has had a serious heart attack and gone into a coma before the event, but who wakes up after the event. Because she is a passionately devoted Communist, she must not know that her beloved world of the DDR (East Germany) has ended, as doctors say the shock could kill her. Her two children have to hide this from her, which means retrieving all the decrepit old furniture from a dump to re-decorate her flat when she leaves hospital to recover in bed at home. Her son is constantly rooting in dustbins to find old jars and bottles of discontinued brands of food and drink, re-filling them with the contents of new jars and bottles, and presenting them to his mother on a tray as if the old brands still existed. Naturally, there are many such hilarious episodes. But there are sad and tragic elements to this tale. The woman's husband who had fled to the West becomes an issue, and countless complications keep arising. At one point, because she sees a Coca-Cola ad from her window, the woman has to be convinced that Coca-Cola was really invented in East Germany in the 1950s, and was stolen by the Americans, so it is OK to advertise it without betraying the principles of Lenin. The film is made with a light touch and excellent good humour, and does not strain the limits of comedic plausibility too much to be acceptable viewing, which was quite a feat. However, as the story progresses, we get the deeper message: with the new freedom came overwhelming consumerism, greed, and many other nasties. The fake DDR news broadcasts concocted by the son on video tape and shown to his mother on her TV via a secret cable connection gradually portray a reformist DDR which tears down the Wall, 'throws open the borders', forces Honneker into retirement, and creates a 'new world', which as the son says to his friend is 'the DDR as he would have liked it'. The fantasy that never happened but should have happened slowly takes over and becomes a reality which becomes increasingly convincing. This film then changes from being slapstick to being profound and reflective of all the deep issues involved, while remaining a comedy. For Germans, this film presses all the buttons and touches all the raw nerves, whereas for us Untermenschen who do not have photos of Angela Merkel on our walls, it is a source of much deep thought in between the guffaws.</fullReview>

I was only two when it happened and three when Germany officially reunited as one. About 12 or 13 years later, the Berlin Wall event entered into my History textbook.It's 1980s East Germany. The communist East had sent one of their comrades (as that was the common word in those times under communism regime) Sigmund Jahn into space. At the same time in an apartment in East Berlin, the secret police Stasi came searching for someone. Mrs. Christiane Kerner (Katrin Sass), a teacher, told the police she had no idea on her husband's whereabouts. She actually knew her husband Robert had fled to West Germany. Alexander and his sister Ariane saw what was going on from where they were in the living room watching the news broadcast of the space launch.Fast forward to October 7, 1989. A group of East Germans took to the streets of East Berlin. Alexander (Daniel Bruhl) is a young man by now. He joined the peaceful protest which later became violent. He was being arrested and his mother could not take in what happened and went into a coma.Later in a prison, Alexander received news of which hospital his mother was at. He managed to leave the prison since. The doctor warned him of his mother's condition. While Mrs. Kerner was still in coma at the hospital, a swift of events happened in East Germany. The Berlin Wall fell and TV images of Germans from the both sides coming together was shown all around the world. Western ideals slowly crept into the former communist regime. Ariane (Maria Simon) quitted school and worked at Burger King. She even had a daughter Paula with her husband. Alexander fell for the student nurse Lara who had been taking care of his mother. He had even took on a new job after the TV repair shop he once worked was closed down.Months later, Mrs. Kerner awoke. There was debate of whether to bring her home given life had changed since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Mrs. Kerner might not even able to take it; she had been living under communism ideals till her coma. So Alexander went all the way to make sure life was still as it is in the former East Germany for his mother in the apartment, or so he tried his best.Around those times (it was already in the year of 1990), East Germans could exchange the former roubles to the German Mark, the football (or soccer, in American-speak) World Cup was going on in Italy at that time and the West German team had been making progress (they eventually won, which did happened back then). But Mrs. Kerner was oblivious to all these, given her grown-up children tried their best to hide it all from their mother. There had been slip-ups along the way which made Mrs. Kerner suspicious.On an outing, Mrs. Kerner revealed the real reason why she never brought her kids along with her after their father had escaped to West Germany. Alexander later found out where his father was residing and tried to acknowledge the man who once left them for a better life (Mr. Kerner had remarried and had two young kids). Luckily, Mr. Robert Kerner recognised his own son and went to visit his ailing wife for the last time before she died.From a young man who lived through the former communist regime in the former East Germany, we can see how the country was really like, in the eyes of Alexander himself. Learning to understand how the world around him had changed since the collapse of the wall which had separated his country apart for years, Alexander also realised that it's also best that his mother left for the nether world without knowing how much had changed since her coma.And in the eyes of a former History student, I began to understand why the Berlin Wall event became one of the most enduring events of the previous century. Overall, the movie is just so poignant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being from the East (exUSSR), this film was, for me, especially, and surprisingly, touching.The acting is wonderful, so is the direction (the shot of Alex and Lara in the half-demolished building is impeccable). Over all the movie is very well made.However, what concerned me the most was that it manages to talk about a very complicated and convoluted subject (East European society in general and the Fall in particular), in a way very accessible to westerners. Here all the contradictions are laid out like a road map leading you into the hearts and minds of the last Eastern generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Alex's mother falls into coma and he decides to fake Eastern Germany for her, we discover with the eyes of an "Ozzie" to realise that suddenly their whole world was destroyed. Things that improved and things that did not and were regretted. The gradual change Eastern Europe is going through now happened there in such a short time for the plot to be realistic.On this layer, another for the relationship with his mum and in his heart too, the wish to recreate Eastern Germany, as the final words of the film say too well "a country I associate forever with my mother".The German language is an essential part of the film. A magnificent film, moving, deep, funny. Buy it and keep it and watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic East German comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A East German mother of two (the father deserted to the West years ago) devoted to the regime falls into a coma when she sees her son protesting against the communists and being packed off in a police van. She has suffered a massive heart-attack. Fortunately she comes out of her coma eight months later not knowing that the whole world has changed. The doctors tell her son that the mother can not be excited because she could suffer another heart attack from which she may not recover. Thus starts a charade to hide the fact that the two Germany's are one country and the West won the battle.This is a brilliant comedy. True, it flags in parts but the director has quite a few bright ideas up his sleeve. He is obviously a Kubrick fan and you'll see reference to 2001 and Clockwork Orange - take the lead actors name Alex for instance.I don't know too many German movies that I like and I've seen a few, but I rank this as the best in the recent crop and its worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bittersweet Memoir of German family and Unification</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another great foreign film, this one German, telling the bittersweet tale of family and memory of what once was - in this case the divided Germany and its the Unification as well as a divided and re-unified East German family. I enjoyed the soundtrack, characters, and efforts to bring back settings of over 15 years earlier. The filmmakers do well in conveying the memoirs of Alexander - his associations with East Germany and his mother, politics and individual spirits. Alexander's commentary was revealing and witty, and the narration was excellent keeping good focus. While the antics were pretty funny and clever, the film works better dramatically. There is quite a bit of social commentary on change and capitalism as well. The film has a bit of a melancholy, pensive undertone - something well placed for the matters at hand. A strong foreign drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One son's love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from the clever premise and the history lessons involved in the movie, it seemed mostly to be a movie about one son's lonely battle for his mother's life. He had no father to speak of, he is still young, and now he may lose his mother.However, his mother may be a lot stronger than he thinks. We are never really told if the mother has figured out the truth of GDR's nearly extinct system or not. One begins to suspect that the mother may be playing along with her son's game out of her love for him. But then again, maybe no. In any case, whether it's the son's concern for his mother or the other way around, what it amounts to is that, some things go better unsaid, and not necessarily as a way of copping out.The mother would not embarrass her son if she knew the truth. The son on the other hand would rather keep his mother in a world where she had been somebody important. There is some sublime undercurrent of love at work in this film; something that people raised in a culture where everything has to be put out in the open could well learn. The actress playing the mother was a seasoned veteran who kept you guessing, while also keeping you in the belief that you might be seeing something as it is really happened.As an afterthought, the situation in the movie reminded me of how I hear Japan was after the surrender of WW2. Suddenly, the enemies became boss, and the men who sent your sons and brothers to be killed in a war with them were suddenly grinning and shaking hands with them. That must have been very traumatic, requiring decades for the Japanese psyche to heal. East Germany too will likely not be "all better" overnight either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective and moving film about personal and political change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a German film about a young East German man in the late 1980s whose mother suffers a stroke. While she is unconscious the Berlin Wall is knocked down and Germany is re-unified. When his mother starts to recover, he is desperate not to shock her into a relapse by revealing the truth, and constructs an elaborate fantasy in which East Germany still exists.Throughout the film, he persists in his efforts to keep his carefully constructed fiction alive in the mind of his mother, and goes to ever more extreme lengths to maintain the illusion. He enlists the help of a friend to construct some fake news footage, and their combined efforts are a success, but the lie is now too big to allow them to turn back, and it seems as if the truth must come out eventually. When it does, will it be too big a shock for his mother to take?One of the most telling sequences in the film is when his mother is shown TV pictures of West Germans flooding into the East. He tells her that the westerners have come because they finally realised the emptiness of consumerism, and have sought sanctuary in the communist East. Because this was such an attractive lie his mother was taken in. As well as showing how people can become blinkered to reality when it becomes too painful, this scene makes you think about all the East Germans who didn't celebrate when the wall came down. This point is subtly made, and is all the more effective for it.Goodbye Lenin is a very effective and moving film, which explores how people deal with all kinds of change, whether just affecting a few, or the entire population of a country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tender and heartwarming satire about the former GDR.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Goodbye, Lenin! is a cinematic instance of "Ostalgie" - a play on the word "nostalgia," "ost" meaning "East" - which is a fond remembrance of the way things were in the former German Democratic Republic prior to its unification with West Germany. The film is both personal and allegorical in that the family's biography mirrors the changes that swept through the GDR after die Wende. Yet not only does does the director Wolfgang Becker sublimate the events of 1989-1990 to a more personal - and consequently more intimate - level, but he also situates the political, economic and cultural changes of the period within the context of male and female dynamics.The most telling line in the film is uttered at the end when Alex's voice informs the audience that East Germany is a country that he will forever associate with his mother. That the director associated the former GDR with the female protagonist is no accident since the fate that befalls Mrs. Kerner precisely mirrors history. It is more interesting to note though, that the association came about through a process of emasculation (rather than feminization at the outset): in the early part of the film, East Germany is depicted and described as a potent male symbol, yet as reunification nears, it becomes weaker = feminine.That Goodbye, Lenin!looks at the past with sentimentality cannot be doubted, and it is a sentimentality tempered with a humor straddling satire and slapstick that is the core of the film's appeal. Yet between bouts of laughter, Becker manages to slip in a few sly digs at the former GDR - hardly surprising since the director is a Wessie. Which raises the question: what is the business of a West German making a film about East Germany? Answer: who cares as long as it isn't DEFA that's making it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea is already original, the mother of Alex regains consciousness after "die Wende" in 1989 but the doctors say any shock can harm her. So the children create a fake world in her bedroom. Meanwhile they are busy finding tin cans, and other original food packages from the DDR, make their own newsflashes where a real hilarious one is where they claim Coca Cola is a DDR invention, while being harassed by security guards the reporter says hey, you're hindering the free DDR-press.For dramatic reasons, Lenin has a very special role in the movie, but the locations are quite well chosen, still Eastern European, but slowly becoming the West. And what's never revealed is whether Alex's mother knows what Alex does for her. Her expression seems to say yes but that, as another charm of the movie, is never revealed.Before seeing it, take a look at some nostalgic, or Ost-algic websites to get to know the "Sandmannchen" etc. and watching it will be a lot more rewarding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Goodbye Lenin!' directed by Wolfgang Becker involves a mother in a coma and a son who constructs an entirely new 'old' world for her. It is 1989 in East Germany, and Alex's (Daniel Bruhl) mom 'Mutter' (Kathrin Sass) is an active member of the Socialist party. Right before the Berlin Wall comes down, Mutter witnesses Alex being arrested protesting the current regime, and collapses in the street from a heart attack. In a coma, she misses the Wall's collapse and the unification of Germany. When she wakes up eight months later, the doctor tells Alex and his sister that the next few weeks are going to be crucial to her health, and that she cannot have any kind of trauma or surprises. Knowing that the events of the past eight months would upset his mother, Alex brings her home and recreates the world that she lived in before she went into the hospital. From small things like wearing non-westernized clothing again and replacing their new and flashy furnishings with their old, drab items to creating fake newscasts and enlisting the help of friends and neighbors, Alex attempts to carry on this ruse until his mother becomes healthy again, and can handle the news.I had first heard about this film on NPR months ago and the story was so compelling and different that I knew I would have to see it. I'm not entirely sure what gave me the idea that this was primarily a comedy, but 'Goodbye Lenin!' is actually a solid drama that is both intriguing and emotional. Alex's devotion, even after he discovers some life-changing information about his past, is equal parts absurd and heart-warming. Becker presents the audience with a fairly straightforward film, so much so that the couple of times he utilizes MTV-esque cinematography it seems out of place and jarring. Other than these moments, however the film is very solid and the story is original and richly told. 'Goodbye Lenin!' is an easy film to recommend, and I do so confidently to most. It is yet another excellent foreign film that has not gotten a lot of press, but hopefully through word of mouth can be enjoyed.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Political Than Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enormously popular in Germany, 'Good Bye Lenin' may be the most stirring evocation of a unification celebration than has been promulgated in that post-Cold War country. A sometimes bittersweet reflection on what was and to some degree what is now, this funny and at times serious study is a far more remarkable film than American audiences appreciate; judged only by box office receipts, this is a dismal commercial (in the U.S.) failure but an important political statement.The topic ? how to avoid revealing to a woman that lay comatose through the unraveling of the East German Communist political system (the fall of the Wall) that the world has changed ? is a marvelous manner in which to illustrate the dramatic change which occurred in relatively short order. Having suffered a heart attack, Mutter (Katrin Saß) must avoid all shocks, or so her physician advises her son. An active and totally bought-in East German, it is up to her family ? primarily son Alex (Daniel Brühl) to provide a safe harbor for her recovery. The mother is totally consumed in her active role in Communist Germany. Her dedication to causes socialist is established; she even once won a 'gold award' for 'extraordinary contributions to our socialist society'. Perhaps by way of compensation for own failed marriage, she has thrown herself into the system. So it is quite difficult for her family and friends to adopt the façade that things have not changed. And herein lies the basis for most of the humor we observe. Acting is one of the lesser facets we evaluate in this film, although we will eventually tumble to the work of all involved. Each family member and friend is allowed to display some flaws and certainly some strength. There are so many rapid-fire images of Germany injected into the slipstream of the narrative that we are often riveted by images of an East Germany that not long ago was a model of how Communism didn't work. In the film's most laugh-out-loud moments we see how the son spins newscasts (actually video constructed by him and a friend) into a fable solely for his mother's comfort.Since this film bridges a period in history which exemplified rapid change, and therefore getting the 'look' correct took some doing. In an interesting (if short) interview by the BBC with director Wolfgang Becker (http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/07/16/wolfgang_becker_good_bye_lenin_interview.shtml) we learn that in filming:It was very demanding because the original locations in Berlin changed very fast after the fall of the Wall, and although we only had to take them back ten years, there's a big difference. There weren't any satellite dishes in East Berlin; there were no telephone booths; and, of course, there were only cars built up to 1989.The not-so-obvious outcome of the film is pretty satisfying. As we require, a number of plot threads are tied up and better yet a surprise or two amuse us. So somehow director and writer Becker fashions a rueful yet light-hearted look at lives touched politically, economically and personally by a brave new world.Rating: Three and a half stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting; different; worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie obviously is most enjoyable to those who lived in Germany (either East or West) before the time of reunification. To many of us outside that -- like me, a non-European -- the film gives us a fascinating look at the differences in living between the two systems and what a shock the change must've been.It would have been far more poignant to me if it had dealt a little more realistically or dramatically with the family emotional reactions that would have had to have taken place as the two children made various discoveries about their parents.The film works on several levels although, to my taste, a little better on the symbolic political level than on the human, family level.On the first, the mother can represent the idealistic goals and propaganda of the former East German Democratic Republic -- built on lies, false pretenses, etc. And her children's efforts are its citizens ultimately failing attempts to extend the pretense of the facade.On the latter (family) level, perhaps it shows the destructiveness and futility of building lie upon lie, pretense upon pretense, and the enormous prices that are paid by everyone for very little gain? What I missed seeing dealt with was the bone shaking anger and pain at their losses by the mother's two children.Excellent acting. Interesting story. No cast of thousands. No perilous chase scenes. No big explosions (except some celebratory fireworks). But it's worthwhile to see and worthwhile to think about, as in filling in the missing blanks of what could also have been handled. And it's a gain, isn't it?, to be incited to discuss and think about those missing pieces?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's such a pleasure after so much junk American cinema pounds out to see a movie like Goodbye Lenin. The movie is mostly very quiet, but is generally successful at making East Berlin look like a "worker's paradise" (at least early in the movie). The basic premise sounds a little like "Life is Beautiful" - a person goes to wild lengths to prevent a family member from learning the truth about their situation. In this case, the devoted son of a middle aged woman who spent the early months after the Berlin wall fell in a coma decides to prevent his mother from learning the truth - that East Germany is no more.As the son, Daniel Bruhl has the strength of character to attempt the impossible. He's making a movie now called "Ladies in Lavender-" I expect he could have quite a career in English-language cinema. Katrin Saß may be the Joan Allen of German cinema; she both looked and acted eerily like Allen (they're also almost the same age).If you'd like a movie without a lot of noise or special effects, this is definitely one to savor.</fullReview>

And the son fears that when his mother awakes from her Rip Van Winkle slumber, the shock of events will kill her.

		<fullReview>This is one of those rare films where comedy and drama manage to successfully co-exist. In the initial stages we are shown the repressive nature of the regime - the Stasi visits mum to find out why dad hasn't returned from the west, and then fastforward to the demonstrations against the regime in October 1989 which the police violently subdue, despite banners saying "Kein Gewalt" (no violence) and "Gorbi" (i.e. Gorbichev the Soviet President generally credited for telling Honecker that his time was up). After that, however, things become lighter as the regime collapses, and Ossies experience the delights of western pleasures hitherto denied them - including the visit to the porn shop, American fast food, satellite TV and of course, those West German cars! Of course for the two kids in this family all that is tempered by Mum being in hospital in a coma. Later they discover that dad, who departed 12 years before, isn't very far away. There is a lot that the film touches on subtly which will probably be lost on those not aware of German life as it was on both sides of the wall, but regardless of that there's plenty that any viewer is sure to find both funny and sad.

		<shortDescription>A Touching Comedy of Politics, Economics, and Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Goodbye, Lenin!" is a delightful and touching play on what must be a German parlor game: "How would someone waking up from a coma react to the incredible changes since The Wall came down?" But writer/director Wolfgang Becker has a lot more on his mind than the punch line to one joke, as funny as that alone is. Yes, the basic premise is the clever, devoted son trying to keep his fragile mother from another heart attack by swathing her in the cocoon of an East Germany that still existed just before she went into a coma.And, yes, the increasingly extreme lengths he traverses to maintain the fiction by hunting down the inferior products of the people's utopia are hilarious--such as getting distracted from a sexy rendezvous with his girlfriend when he finds a closet full of what he's been searching for, the detritus of the discredited economic and social system. First, what sets this above an easy comedy are the complex characters, played by a marvelous cast. No one is a stick figure, all have very individual, complicated lives and hopes you can root for and reasons for the choices they made, both under the Stasi and now under capitalism. Their personal interrelations are believable and involving, as the growing-up and maturity of the family members parallels the complicated changes around them. It is because they are such humans that they start to chafe under and manipulate the son's fictional dictatorship of the proletariat, even if it exists in just one bedroom, as much as they did under the real one, as it starts to crumble under the power of truth. This particularly comes out as he has to create his own propaganda that is both trenchantly satirical and scarily efficient to put an hilarious spin on the real world as it starts to intrude on his worker's paradise island, both from the politics and economics to the intensely and very movingly personal uncovering of lies. There is one minor plot point near the end that was either confusing or intended to add yet another layer of complexity to the mother/son relationship. I don't know if Becker had to go to great expense to recreate the mis en scene of the changing Germany or if his camera's timing was as perfect as Louis Malle's was in capturing "Atlantic City"on the cusp.Another irony, for an English-language viewer, is that there can be all these changes in the world yet subtitles are still white on white!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, charming and well worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a charming film, with lots to laugh at, but also lots of touching moments. The credibility of the plot might be stretched a little, but it was presented very well. There were lots of moments where I thought it would be tough for the screen play writers to get the characters out of the different situations they keep finding themselves in, but it all worked out perfectly. I recommend this to anyone who would like a pleasant story with somewhat of a true background.The principal character develops a taste for pickles - since then I have been shopping for pickles every time I go in the supermarket, trying to find the brand she liked so much, but no luck in finding them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best film about the fall of communism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am happy to see that this film got that many good reactions from the young IMDB reviewers, who never knew what communism was about. I am happy about it, because this film tells a lot about how life was about under communist rule, how a totalitarian system could build a fully fiction life at the level of a full nation, but also about how people could remain human, continue to feel and love, and hope. It also tells a lot about the process of transition that the former communist countries went through, a process which was not at all rosy for everybody involved, and had a lot of victims of its own - especially within the older population, who could not adapt to the change, to the new rules and to the morals of the new life in its capitalist ways. 'Good-bye Lenin' is above all a good film, human, well acted, and bitter-funny - one of the best, or the best I have seen about the transition of Eastern Europe from communism to freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being 31 years of age, I am sure that I am one of the older one here....anyways. I have a great interest in history and politics, especially those of the Warsaw Pact nations.Wolfgang Becker's wonderful film, "Goodbye, Lenin!" is satire of the highest order, in that it is able to take these historical events and inject them into a beautiful tale of filial devotion. The film begins with the dying days of communism, when young Alexander (Daniel Bruhl) takes to the streets to protest the repression of the East German government. His mother Christiane (Katrin Sass), a devoted party-member, suffers a stroke. Since her husband abandoned her for the West, the ideals of East Germany have been her greatest love, and she lies in a coma while they systematically collapse. When she awakes, Daniel is warned that another shock may kill her, and thus begins an elaborate cover-up to convince his mother that all is well in her socialist paradise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Good-bye, Lenin" has made it to the U.S. after being shown in many other countries for over half a year. Director Wolfgang Becker and a talented cast concocted an intertwined tale of family binding and political, actually national, dissolution.Christiane Kerner (Kathrin Sass) is in her fifties, living in 1989 in East Berlin, then the very tarnished seat of the German Democratic Republic (DDR). She's not only a dedicated communist, she's a humane one with ideals so high she's been canned from her teaching job, her example a bit embarrassing for the school's administration. Undaunted, she throws herself into youth work with a doctrinally benign and affectionate embrace of young kids. The dogma here is on the light side.Deserted many years earlier by her M.D. husband, Christiane has two at-home young adult kids, Alexander (Daniel Bruhl) and his sister, Ariane, (Maria Simon). By 1989 the DDR was definitely not a workers' paradise. It was a state dominated by a ubiquitous secret police (the STASI) and a world of informers operating with a thoroughness that by the chill autumn of Soviet communism couldn't have been maintained in the USSR.But the Kerners do not live the life of the proletariat. Their apartment is spacious and well-appointed and we later find out that they have a charming weekend, rustic cottage called, understandably, a "dacha."Alexander opposes the regime and in a very realistic scene where the police brutally beat up against-THE-Wall demonstrators, he's roughed up and arrested as his frightened mom watches from a distance. She falls to the street suffering a major coronary infarct. Alex is sprung from the cooler because of his mother's name or reputation (it isn't clear) and he finds her in a deep and unresponsive coma in the hospital.Fast forward eight months. The DDR is tottering on its last political and military legs, the Wall is down, the spirit of freedom (freedom here equals consumerism) is in the air and shining from the rapidly filling store shelves. Christiane awakens, weak but oriented. The story now takes off as Alexander becomes chief of a large but loosely organized gang of conspirators who, based on the doctor's warning that excitement can kill the still perilously ill woman, engage in a massive, complex and quixotic charade to convince the mom that her beloved DDR hasn't changed.Oh, and Alex met a lovely Russian nurse who speaks perfect German in his mom's hospital room. Her name is Lara (Chulpan Khamatova) and she's fetching and competent. It's nice to know that even in the squalid DDR love could blossom. Khamatova's Lara is a definite plus in this film, a balance to the increasingly frenetic Alexander.The apartment, or at least mom's room, is returned to its pre-unification form. Broadcast TV can't be permitted so Alexander enlists a close friend with dreams of stardom to make fake news videotapes.It isn't hard to figure out where this caper will go, is it? So I won't spoil it.The cast, through the director's vision, interweaves the last days of a rotten and oppressive system with a family's devotion to a beloved mom. Friends enlisted in the effort range from little kids, bribed for twenty marks to sing commie (can't resist using that word :) ) songs, to the perpetually plowed, stumbling and now unemployed former principal of Christiane's school. There are both very funny and very moving moments but Becker couldn't control, apparently, putting every whimsical scene in and at times the film drags a bit. A little snipping would have made a far tauter movie.Still, this is an unusual German peak into one of the most dramatic and unexpectedly rapidly shifting developments of the late twentieth century. Except for the brutal police suppression of the demonstrating youths, the terminally ill Honecker regime comes across as more ineffective than malign. Many in the former DDR would disagree but "Good-bye, Lenin" is remarkably free of cant. Generally very entertaining because of a high voltage cast, this is a fascinating look at very recent history. It's also an unabashedly nice story about caring for a beloved and critically ill mother. I hope it enjoys the same success here that it has in Europe and elsewhere.9/10.</fullReview>

That's why alex gone crazy in bank. That money was their efforts for years but now it was worthless.But it's also political and but the movie is not on a side. Neither Easterns nor westerns are the good guys. Both are the bad guys. Eastern side represents oppression and the Western side represent insensitivity and greed. End of the movie tells us what the maker imagine what should have been. Equality but also freedom. Not: If I had been a DDR citizen. I'm sure i would sob.

		<fullReview>This is very nice film; easy and a pleasure to see. As stated above by a person from Portugal, several points are risen: from a the most pure form of mother-son (he felt blamed for his mother heart attack) - and wish to create an "artificial world" for the loved person. At the same time, important political changes are placed - and in a very particular point: same people (german) split in two by a wall - so everything changes so rapidly! (just for a guess - if Fidel Castro lost control over Cuba, it would take several years for the changes happen - or even what just happened to Iraq, they are lost! - that's why this movie HAD EVERYTHING to do with GermanyOf course, it should be always remembered that those drastic changes occured in a 6-8 months period. It was not someone who was "away from this world" for several years....BTW, the funny "Old DDR TV broadcasts" they arrange is a very intelligent piece of work: naive and creativeness.The political aspects of previous GDR are not explicit most of the time, but can easily be seen: the stasi investigator at the beginning, the slight critics for few items available on supermarket and the biggest one: the real reason why the father left home, the mother did not had courage - or conditions, or weighted risks - anyway, the mother became a fanatic communist party and let their children grow with a wrong idea on their father.</fullReview>

No only does Momma not actually believe all the Marxist nonsense, but she finds out the truth...Then the focus of the film is brought into relief, what Alex has been doing is exactly what the East German Authorities had been doing - hiding the truth, in order to preserve a falsehood.Yes, this is a fine political satire and (though this is irrelevant to the film's quality), it is refreshing that the satire is aimed at left-wing reactionaries, rather than right-wing ones...Keep watching the masterpieces...Mike</fullReview>

The extents to which Alex goes to to keep his mother protected can seem an exaggeration but it is what keeps the film going until the very touching scene at the end. One can draw a parallel with Benigni's "la vita e bella" where the father creates an entire false world to protect his son. Here the son does it for his mother. Yet in this film, it seems that this "protection" may be more important to the son than the mother herself! Insightful, well made and above all: humane. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This apparently simple story has many different aspects and angles to which we must give heed. Aspects and angles of various types: sentimental, social, ideological and even political. A staunch communist lady in old German Democratic Republic suffers a heart attack while seeing her son being violently arrested by East German police during a demo for freedom in East Berlin in 1989. She enters into a coma and stays so during several months. Meanwhile the Berlin Wall is pulled down and all those events which led to the end of the G.D.R. take place while capitalist system and way of life with all their good and bad things gradually replace communist ones. The lady eventually comes off the coma but the doctor warns her devoted son that any new shock can be fatal to her. He brings her mother back home and from now on we witness a sequence of stagings and simulations, some of them very ingenious and inventive, by which he tries to hide from her the fall of Socialist German Fatherland while she lies in bed, keeping her convinced not only that it still exists but also it's even improving in the direction she'd like it to improve for she's a true communist idealist who believes in ideals but recognizes the regime has indeed a lot of flaws, shortcomings and drawbacks she always wanted to remove. This movie is a sentimental comedy full of moving scenes some of which will touch you deeply to the heart because full of filial love. Players' performances are excellent and very convincing.If you have a heart you'll love this movie.</fullReview>

The fact that it's still showing in London several months after its release, and that of the first 20 comments on this site there isn't one negative one, show that this film is an unequivocal success. The Oscar for best foreign language film is somewhat devalued currency these days, but I like to think that Good Bye Lenin will at least get a nod.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not quite sure why so many - particularly German - commenters have trouble with this movies brilliant mix of comic and serious aspects. Every good satire ever made does this (i.e. *Gulliver's Travels*).Like the current trend of "Ostalgie" (nostalgia for Eastern German ways of living) it may just be a bit much for some. It is really not too easy to understand that the people of the GDR did live their private lifes while the big ideological blocks stood head to head. And this private, quiet life is what most of them like to remember.******Slight spoiler ahead*********But this film goes much deeper, mainly due to the exceptionally good Kathrin Sass. Although most viewers I've heard talking about the movie and all reviews I've read pointed out the unrelenting communist in the character she plays, I urge you to look at her face whenever she talks with others about "her" socialist home country. At one time we are told about her former husband by her, together with another scene - when her son coincidentally is in one of the "We are the people" demonstrations and she sees what happens to him - this makes her stance towards the socialist regime quite clear.*********Spoiler end*********Enjoy it wherever you are, even if you have to cope with subtitles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little over a decade after its demise, communism in Europe is becoming an historical curiosity. In Prague, there is now a Museum of Communism (next door to a McDonalds) and here we have a German film which satirises the Honecker regime through an inventive storyline set just before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall. A middle-aged woman - movingly played by Katrin Sass, a successful actress in the former East Germany - goes into a coma due to a heart attack and, when she resumes consciousness eight months later, her son (Daniel Brühl) is warned that a sudden shock could kill her, so - through increasingly complex contrivances - he has to maintain the fiction for her that communism is still thriving. This requires him not just to disguise, but ultimately to subvert, history by representing the pulling down of the wall as a kindly act by the Communist regime to admit West Germans disillusioned with the excesses of capitalism. Perhaps one needs to have lived in an East European communist state (or at least to have visited one - as I did) to appreciate the bitterness of some of the humour and certainly this movie has done incredibly well in its native Germany. But anyone can enjoy this work, directed and co-written by Wolfgang Becker, for its mixture of quaint love of a son for his mother and sending up of some of the injustices and indeed absurdities of the former regime. The most memorable visual image is a brief, but somewhat surreal, one involving a statue of Lenin, seemingly bidding farewell to a failed system permeated by waste and deceit. </fullReview>

Parallels with the old regime are apparent - set up out of a desire to do good, he becomes trapped in a spiral of lies to perpetuate his initial deception. Ironically, his fictional DDR is a nicer country in which to live than it was in reality.Capitalism doesn't come off well, either, as we watch drab utilitarianism replaced by gaudy but equally soulless consumerism.All in all, a thought-provoking movie and, more importantly one that makes you laugh, especially his fake government propaganda.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was eleven years old, when the Berlin wall fell. Even though I have not had any relatives in the former German Democratic Republic, it was great to see the people climbing over the Berlin wall in the news. I have been to Berlin some years before and I remember how depressing the atmosphere was when we passed the German-German border or when we visited the Berlin wall, which directly passed the Reichstag building (the new domicile of the German parliament) in today's city centre of Berlin. Now, this movie showed the other side. Not everything that changed, was positive to the people of Eastern Germany. They kind of had to loose their culture, lost most of the brands of daily used products, and got into unemployment. Even though the movie expresses that is a amusing way, I noticed that maybe everything happened to fast at that time and I think that whole Germany was not prepared for that ongoing. Hence, we seem to have lost the chance to really MERGE both countries and finally the re-unification became a take-over of the German Democratic Republic by the Federal Republic of Germany. I think the movie will never be translated to other languages, and I think it will never be shown outside Germany. And that is a pity!!! It is a really great movie. Funny, sad, entertaining but over all it is informing in an undemonstrative way. I recommend to everybody, who speaks a bit of German, and has a tiny knowledge of what might have been differently in the two Germanies to watch it, if he/she gets the opportunity.</fullReview>

And they will miss this great german movie.Really great actors (perhaps Daniel Brühl is at the moment the best young actor, Germany has!) and a great story about a east-german woman, who fell to coma for 8 months in the late 80's and so she missed the fall of her socialistic republic. And when she wakes up, she's not allowed to know the truth. Her son now creates a small world, that still looks like the GDR and that's really funny. But after a few weeks he realises, that there seems no way out of his fake play.</fullReview>

The forebear in literature was Don Quixote De la Mancha who decided one day to not accept anymore the present which meant nothing to him and to create his own present by submitting his perception under his will and not under his cognition. Jean Arp did exactly the same with the "Nachkunstwerke" that he created for his wife Sophie Täuber after she passed away very untimely. Moreover, to all Europeans, the wonderful, 11 minutes long movie "Dinner For One" is known, in which the old lady celebrates her 90st birthday together with her faithful butler James and all her friends - who have already left this world quite a while ago. But she decided not to accept that, and since then, James has to take over the parts of the deceased.In the movie, a son and a daughter awake once more the DDR (German Democratic Republic) to life, since their mother suffered a severe heart-attack and is lying for eight months in the coma. While the DDR stopped existing, the wall fell, ten thousands of peoples went to the West, she slept. Now, when she awakes, everything should still be as it used to be before ... .</fullReview>

We also see some of its history.The relationship between the boy and his mother is also very touching. It shows loving devotion and commitment to help a loved one in need. He realizes that hearing of the fall of east Germany would kill her (emotionally and physically), and so stops at nothing to shield her from harsh realities.This movie was interesting and touching and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

		<fullReview>Wolfgang Becker has created a film that is very endearing because it has its heart in the right place. This is a different kind of movie, one in which Alex's love for his ailing mother will put him through the mill in order to make life more comfortable for Christiane, a militant member of the East Germany's communist elite, at the time when that society was collapsing.Alex doesn't hesitate one moment to do what he has to. His life becomes hell in trying to show his mother how nothing ever changed while she was hospitalized after the heart attack she suffers when she sees him in a street demonstration. Daniel Bruhl, as Alex, and Katrin Sass, as Christiane, his mother, are very good in the film. They are believable. Some situations are hard to imagine to us, not accustomed to living in a totalitarian system, as the one these people experienced. It is very refreshing to see a comedy about how a son's love will stop at nothing in order to make her regain her health.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good bye, Lenin! (2003), directed and co-written by Wolfgang Becker, is a film that has an interesting premise, but somehow fails to come together in a cohesive fashion.The basic plot involves Alex, a young man in East Berlin. Alex must prevent his mother from learning that the Berlin Wall--and, by extension, German socialism--has fallen. Daniel Brühl, the actor who plays Alex, looks like a cross between Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal. You can't help but hope that he can somehow succeed in this incredible deception.Unfortunately, there are several subplots in the film--involving Alex's sister and her husband, Alex's missing father, and Alex's romance with a Russian nurse--that don't really move the plot forward. It's as if the director didn't trust his main story, and had to fill out the film using whatever was at hand. Katrin Saß, who portrays Alex's mother, was 47 when the movie was made, and therefore could reasonably be expected to have children in their 20's. However, as an actor, Ms. Saß looks far too young for the role. She also looks far too healthy for a woman whose life will be endangered by the smallest shock.So, suspend disbelief, and see this movie for the main plot and the excellent acting. Don't expect a masterpiece; expect to be entertained by an interesting and unusual film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The words German and comedy don't often fit together, but Good Bye, Lenin! is an exception, a stinging political satire that shows the impact on a close-knit East German family of the events that shook Germany to its foundations in 1989. The film, which won nine prizes at the 2003 German Film Awards, including best director for Wolfgang Becker, and best actor for Daniel Brühl, interweaves comedy with a message of political change and the story of a boy's love for his mother, an unusual brew for those accustomed to Hollywood romantic comedies that often seem to take place in a vacuum.The film opens in East Berlin in 1978. Christiane (Kathrin Sass), a pre-school teacher, is questioned by the secret police about her husband Robert (Burghart Klausner) who has defected to West Berlin. After emerging from a long period of depression that distances her from her son Alex and daughter Ariane, she becomes a dedicated Socialist, working to improve the conditions of ordinary people, especially children, and writing letters complaining of the poor quality of East German products. We then jump ahead ten years to the autumn of 1989, when Christiane suffers a heart attack that leaves her in a coma for eight months, after witnessing her now twenty-year old son Alex (Brühl) being arrested in a street demonstration promoting reunification.When she wakes up from her long sleep, the German Democratic Republic (GRE) is no longer a political entity, the Berlin Wall has been torn down, and President Honecher has resigned. Alex is now a satellite dish salesman with a Russian girlfriend named Lara (Chulpan Khamatova). His sister Ariane (Maria Simon) works at Burger King. The doctors warn Alex that any sudden shock could be fatal to his mother's health, so he decides to pretend that the world is exactly the same as her mother remembers. He then recreates a pre-1989 world to the finest detail, fixing their apartment with the same drab furniture exactly the way she remembers, and scouring the garbage bins to find East German bottles and labels that he can fill and pretend they are her beloved Spreewald pickles and other unavailable GDR products.The most audacious deception occurs when Alex enlists his colleague Denis (Florian Lukas), a budding filmmaker, to shoot their own fake news reports for Christiane to watch on TV, mimicking the style and language of the official state newscasts of Aktuelle Kamera. The façade of lies threatens to crumble when Christiane sees a huge Coca-Cola sign and when she watches West German posters and cars in the street from her window. Alex, keeping the charade going, explains that the East Germans invented the formula for Coke which was stolen by the West, and that West Berliners are now taking refuge in the East by the thousands. Ultimately however, Alex, a staunch supporter of Western-style living, begins to look back with nostalgia on the old GDR regime. He longs to return to a past that never was, admitting, "the GDR I was creating for my mother was more like the GDR I would have wished." The fantasy he has created becomes more his own wish fulfillment than a protective cover for his mother.Although I recognize that a German audience might appreciate its political subtleties a bit more, Good Bye, Lenin! still won me over with its thought-provoking story about the strength of family that transcends political boundaries and ideologies. The film strikes a light-hearted balance in its portrayal of East and West, showing both the freedom of the West along with its crass consumerism, and the social awareness of the East along with its rigid bureaucracy in which idealism is a dirty word. While the premise of the film often strains credulity, issues of plausibility can be overlooked because of its overriding sincerity and humanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was OK. From all the hype maybe I was expecting too much. I thought the ideas of the film were interesting but more could have been done with them. I don't really get the stuff that people are going on about on the discussion boards about the film making out that Communism being evil or something. To me it seemed like the text was nostalgic for the era of the GDR and, I think rightly, showed some areas of society that were better organised in the GDR than they are in the West. Back to the film itself, I thought there were some pretty good laughs but the good idea of re-creating the GDR was not really worked through. It also did not feel like he had that much of a connection with his mother that he would do that for her. The guy who played "Denis" was very cute though!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that is moving and funny, showing us a different time in Germany. That is what 'Good Bye, Lenin!' is. We see how a mother (Katrin Sass) has a heart attack and ends up in a coma because she sees her son Alex (Daniel Brühl) getting arrested. He was protesting against the closed borders in his country East-Germany. It is 1989. Eight months later his mother wakes up and the doctor tells Alex that she must rest, and that even the slightest excitement can kill her. The problem is that the Berlin wall is gone and East-Germany doesn't exist anymore. Alex doesn't want his mother to know this so he makes sure their house looks exactly like it did before. He even convinces other people around his mother to play along.Of course problems occur. Things have changed a lot and his mother wants things, like Spreewald pickles, that do not exist anymore. Things have left together with East-Germany and that can give some hilarious moments. The movie does a pretty good job creating these moments, but never forces itself to be funny. Other movies might have forced the problems Alex can have with his mother and her love for the old East-Germany, but not 'Good Bye, Lenin!'.This is a terrific movie, although it has a slow part in the middle. There are sub-plots. One that involves the father of Alex and his sister Ariane (Maria Simon), one about Ariane and her child and her new boyfriend and another one that deals with Alex's girlfriend named Lara (Chulpan Khamatova). Some are interesting, the one with the father in particular, others were not really necessary. In the end I liked this movie very much. It shows us the changes Germany went through and that not all people from East-Germany got a better life. This is a moving story with time for great comedy. Although Alex doesn't seem to make the right choices, sometimes he almost gets annoying with his choices, he means well. A very good movie with an ending that it needs.</fullReview>

She is not supposed to have strong emotions, because that might kill her. The fall of the wall is by her son regarded as such an emotion, so he tries to make all things and people around his mother into a GDR manner. And he is very successful.This is not just a funny comedy, but there is also serious questions put about the good, life-giving lie and the all-to-high prize we sometimes pay for truth.

		<fullReview>This movie is a must-see for anyone knowledgeable of the former East German republic (some of the witticism and historical and political positioning may be lost on non-European viewers). The story is a touching yet witty account of the love of a young man for his mother. Awakened from a coma after a stroke, doctors tell him any excitement could kill her. Unfortunately, during her coma, a great political change happened, leaving virtually nothing as it was. Obsessively trying to shield her from these changes, the young man tries to keep up the appearance of the old East German Republic. This leads to very funny, but also very moving moments as the viewer is not only confronted with this charade, but also with the impact of the changes capitalism brought about and a young man trying to find his place in this new environment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy every moment of the movie, both joy and tears. (What's more enjoyable was that I watched it in a branch new cinema house "IFC Broadway Palace" here in town.)The Kerners are kind and innocent citizens. So far as I got from my observation, after the Berlin Wall was pulled now, not many Germans from the east can live so uprightly like the Kerners. Many young people like Alex might have tried drugs, sex, one-night stand, all-night-wild-parties. Ariane though has followed the western lifestyle: hamburger, boyfriend from the West yet she still takes care of the baby but didn't dump the family.It's a blessing to Mrs Kerner that she was not disclosed anything about the new Germany. How can she face the cruel reality that the country she always dreams about cracked down within eight months by pornography, American consumerism. What Alex did does remind me the ancient Chinese virtues of filial piety, which has fallen into obscurity for a long time in the west.The wax and wane of socialism is a lament of billions young souls who have been so devoted to the belief of a Utopia, an ideal generated in the brain of Karl Marx. Yet, this ideal has pushed many into their own tombs and its life span was less than a century. Those were the days, the days that many young innocent people sacrificed their youth to a big illusion.Germany's economy still has not woken up now after the unification, the road to revival is still long, perhaps the Germans are waiting for a miracle. The friendship of Alex and colleague Denis, a symbol of west and east's harmony, somehow is another myth. Go to Germany now, you will see though west and east came together, west people and east people don't truly can live in joy together under the same roof.How I wish that the innocence of Alex and Lara could continue, no matter what happens, their upright living and pure heart, how I wish Alex and Denis's friendship can continue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy with a covert ideology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Goodbye Lenin is a comedy, produced in West-Germany, just after the collapse of the Leninist state in East-Germany. Not surprisingly, the makers exhibit a lot of enjoyment of the failing state. However, they abstain from a too overt and harsh criticism, because obviously this would alienate and offend the East-Germans too much. Therefore the makers have chosen to depict a society with senile leaders and a naive and mis-guided but friendly people. Apparently they want to further the detachment of the East-Germans from their recent history and past, which after all spans a period of forty years. As such the film and its story are sentimental and nostalgic. by the way, often the word "ostalgy" is used as a pun on the word east, so be ware (!). But make no mistake: in essence it is a vicious and one-sided attack on the former workers' and farmers' state. Its high quality of social and existential security is ignored or ridiculed. It does not say what it says. The recurring covert message is that the forty years are an illusion, in a word, a fata morgana. The old folks with feelings of homesickness are portrayed as confused drunkards. They seem to be at bay. In fact the main characters are a disrupted family, where the husband defects to the west, while the woman is intimidated into staying behind or at home. Be ware that this is by no means a typical situation. Actually in the seventies and eighties on a yearly basis a meager 15.000 citizens (0.1%) left their state. Amazing, isn't it? So instead, if you prefer a more realistic picture, I recommend the East-German produce "Die Architekten". This story is definitely more solid and trust worthy (subtitles are missing). By now you probably suspect, that the whole conception of Goodbye Lenin annoys me. Guilty, but please read on, and discover more interesting hints! For I admit, that the film contains some nice and amazing fragments. For instance, when the gigantic statue of Lenin (some 15 meters high!) is replaced by an enormous banner of Coca Cola. Do I taste a trace of nationalism here?. Or when a fake TV reportage suggests, that masses of WEST-Germans try to ENTER East-Berlin through the shattered wall. Is this a parable for the by then flood of West-German products? Or when the East-German furniture is discarded and replaced by Ikea stuff, and subsequently it comes out that lots of bank-notes were hidden in the original pieces. Can furniture be a subversive idea? Yes, it IS an amazing comedy. Also there is plenty of footage about Berlin and its everyday life. Still, also in this area I prefer original material, for instance the East-German TV series "Einzug ins Paradies" (entrance into paradise, but alas! without subtitles). Or consider the film "Spur der Steine" (rolling stones), which provides satisfactory subtitles. Although they are both inside jobs, and be ware slightly beatifying, they also supply an amazing criticism, while depicting the REAL social relations, with all their nuances and pros and cons and what do I know. They do not take you in.</fullReview>

And I think that every movie that portrays Germans as chaotic nitwits rather than goose-stepping clones has to be applauded.With that said, let's move on to the nitpicking part: I didn't care much for the sappy love story, especially as that Russian nurse (with her curiously French accent) was far too pretty and demure to be interesting (it would have been much funnier had she been a feistier counterpart to her daydreaming "boyf"), and I have no idea what the father subplot was all about.If I would have been allowed to fiddle with the script I would have liked to see the mother start bickering about the old GDR after the staged "collapse of West Germany".

		<fullReview>Good Bye Lenin! faithfully recreates the time of reunification of the two Germany's and shows reactions from different citizens going through it all. Alex keeps his mother from knowing anything about it, as she may not experience any stress after a coma. What follows is an incredible funny way to keep recreating the past and keeping the present out of perspective. Alex and his co-worker Denis make up increasing fake video news to show to his mother as the actual DDR-news. They work as movie-in-the-movie: Coca-Cola taken over by the East, Western people fed up with their lives and fleeing to the East, etc. This is combined in the movie with real DDR news footage about drug addiction, jobless people and work stress in the West.On first sight it is a bit unlikely that the mother believes all the lies fed to her till the end, but there's more here than meets the eye to lift this from a simple story. As the whole DDR was a lie and everything was propaganda, we have a boy holding up that lie to his mother. But the mother knows all the lies, because as she later tells, once the father has fled, she considered fleeing also but was unable. To make her unsuspicious (after all, the father was not a member of the party and having someone fleeing made you suspect to the extreme) she has to live the lies of the DDR to the fullest and become one of the most committed members (She's even expelled from school because she is too fanatic). But she still knows it is all a lie (hence the ridiculous and funny letters). After her coma, she suffers from amnesia, so has difficulty to remember. Soon she realizes she has to go along with the lie again. As she has made her walk, she already knows what's going on. The scene in the garden house only confirms this. Then as the last fake news bulletin is shown, she does not look at her TV, but at her son. In a short scene Lara, the Russian nurse and girlfriend of Alex, whispers the truth she already knows. The final meeting between her and her man is not shown also. With this in mind, this movie is an even fiercer reckoning with the DDR, even harsher than when taken at face value. Note also the astronaut / taxi driver Jähn, he would be a hero everywhere, except in the DDR. When asked by Alex if he is his former space idol, he first tells he's not (again a lie).The production design, art direction and set makers did a wonderful job here with the beautiful sets. CGI is used to make Berlin look Eastern again. Also the editing is very good, because the humor parts are well executed but not overlong, and they are able to dose the drama parts. Rapid camera movement is used to jump from scene to scene, so the movie is never boring and keeps you involved.This is an important historic document, as it is a time we soon will know relatively little about. And if you have not already done so: See it before your own memory fades about die Wende.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fine example of what the human mind can fabricate in order to protect life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is set in 1989, in East Germany, a then communist country. It centres on a young man named Alex who disagrees with his governments communist views. Alex begins to protest against the regime, and one day when marching to convey his views is witnessed by his mother. So surprised to see her son fighting with the police, she suffers a heart attack and falls into an eight month coma. During her eight month sleep the Berlin wall falls and Germany is united. Against all the odds she regains consciousness, but heart can not take anymore excitement. Alex is left with only one option to hide the exiting news of the communist regimes withdrawal and the new united Germany. But one problem, he can't keep his mother in the dark forever or can he.Good Bye Lenin is a story of hope. It is a fine example of what the human mind can fabricate in order to protect life. Being a young Englishman I have no way of knowing what it would be like to be liberated from suppression but I feel this films gives me and others like me an opportunity to experience a tiny aspect of life at that particular moment, the film serves as a tool to educate the masses. One thing I did notice was the conflicting emotions that are experienced by the spectator throughout the duration of this film. One hand Alex lies to his mother and goes to great lengths to deceive her, he even keeps her prisoner in her bedroom for weeks. All of my human instincts were telling me that this was wrong. But as the film progressed I realised that truth is not always black and white. He does deceive her greatly but does it for her own good. This is a film of selflessness, but does Alex have the right to dictate what his mother believes or is her in fact just doing what the communist regime did to his people, the same regime that he rebelled against to start this whole thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be fair to this movie, I sat down expecting it to be something different from what it is, and if I'd been properly prepared I might have enjoyed it more. So I will properly prepare you: this is not a comedy. Some of it is mildly amusing but for the most part this is a rather melancholy drama using a family drama to highlight the changes in East Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall.I was expecting a comedy. The idea could be used in a very wacky comedy, but it isn't.In terms of what it is trying for I think it's pretty good. If I'd been expecting a drama I might have given it a 7 instead of a 6. But in spite of good performances I was really never that drawn into the character's lives. The movie is most interesting as a politic document. It shows how completely society altered in very little time. It is interesting that 8 months is enough for a Rip Van Winkle-style experience. And there is an interesting, mild nostalgia for the old way that is surprising. Parts of the movie are somewhat touching. But it just didn't do it for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the funniest film that I have seen in ages. I have a person connection to it as I was heading to Berlin at the time to take a new job. My wife had enough of Europe after 10 years and wanted to go home. I had a feeling that something was about to happen. Call it intuition, but I knew there was a change coming, and not because of Ronald Ray-guns telling Gorbachev to "Tear down that wall!" It just so happened that the change occurred two months before I was scheduled to leave. Talk about timing. It would have been impossible to find an apartment! It was good that I turned the job down.Alex (Daniel Brühl) had a similar problem. The wall came down just about the time his mother has a heart attack. he mustn't cause her any stress or she will have another. His efforts to recreate the East Germany that his mother dearly loved was a riot. Searching through trash for cans and bottles for products that no longer existed, using tapes to show the news when she insists on a TV, faking news reports with his friend, and having everyone pretend that the wall never came down, among other things. Even when she escaped the apartment due to his exhaustion, he managed to turn the story around and make her believe that East Germany was taking in refugees from the West. And the Coke sign; you have to see that to believe it.This movie was hilarious, and if it had Hugh Grant, it would probably be on the top of my list as funniest of all time.Brühl was brilliant!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clearly this movie will 'speak' most clearly and loudly to former East Germans over, say 40, who retain first-hand knowledge of their former life. Despite being something of a one-trick pony it still offers strong entertainment and a moving story of how a boy's love for his mother can drive him to bizarre extremes. Although there was a much better German entry this year in Belle Martha, which is perhaps more worthy of a Best Foreign Film Award, this is an honorable runner-up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That this harmless bit of sentimental fluff could be taken so seriously by a broad spectrum of viewers. It reminded me of nothing so much as Billy Wilder's "One, Two, Three" -- but without the obvious farce. Indeed, it plods here and there, and has some sudden shifts in mental focus that left me momentarily bewildered, particularly the up and down physical condition exhibited by the mother.Still, it is highly entertaining at times, and the ironic twist of portraying the central activities in tearing down the wall, etc. as having the opposite historical meaning was clever. I also liked the casting and background sets. Germans are fond of leaving nothing to the imagination, and sometimes this in-your-face expressionism leads to very satisfactory and memorable pictorial execution.Enjoy it exactly as it plays, and don't read too much into the political theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Likable - but very silly - look at the collapse of the former East Germany.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An East German youth (Alex played by the Spaniard Daniel Bruhl) wants to see his country become more free and liberal - and while out in the street demonstrating for it is arrested by the East German Secret Police (The Stassi) and taken to a holding pen.Sadly this proves all-too-much for his staunch Communist mother (Katrin Sass) who collapses in the street and lies comatose throughout the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reuniting of the two Germany's.When she starts coming-around her (now free in every sense of the word!) son decides to hide the radical social change from her thinking "the shock will be too much for her weak heart" (these stock scriptwriting devices should be given a bar code number!) and starts a plan to create a mini version of the former East in the family high-rise flat! Call me names if you want, but I prefer cliché (or even mundane) to far-fetched. There is many great and satisfactory film left in "cliché," rather like there is many great songs left to be written in basic eight bar blues. Meanwhile there is no great and totally satisfactory films left in "farfetched" unless you are playing it as wild comedy or fast paced satire. And even then you'd better be good!(One example would be the brilliant farce The Bedsitting Room that looked at a post nuclear holocaust society where people struggle to hang on to vestiges of their former lives, even in the face of total destruction and disaster.) Goodbye Lenin holds on to its one joke well beyond its natural life cycle and fails to explain his mother's condition very well either. Surely she should be encouraged to walk about a bit every day, rather than tucked up in her neat and tidy bed rarely asking any telling or difficult questions?(Well unless there is some sort of gag attached to them. We all know that one lie begets another!)Alex even creates his own television station so his mother can keep up with the news! Yes, the one joke starts getting out of its depth very quickly, but like the Duracell Bunny it keeps going and going and going...There is plenty of in-jokes about the fall-of-the-Wall. One being that East Germans rushed to have their first experience with hardcore porn (although videotapes were available on the Eastern black market) and another relates to simply taking over the luxury flats that the government elite had quickly vacated. Yet another being the long waiting list to get the basic Trabbi car - a coughing paperframe joke to those that had any kind of choice.In many ways the central joke is the "pitch" idea and spun around it is small observations of what really happened when two Germany's became one. Voice-over is overused, and to be frank it breaks the number one rule of voice-over: Never explain when you can easily show!I have actually studied the German language and history (at school/college) and knew a lot of the information related here. For the record the sub-titles relate more to what the intent of the words are - as opposed to a more literal translation. IMDb seems to love movies that are different, says new things or come from new places. Like this. They seem to get an unfair bonus point just for these things alone. While a pleasant film Goodbye Lenin remains a product that aims at farce and ends up hitting somewhere between silly and unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately I seem to be in the minority of people who really did not like this film. I watched it as it was lent to me by a friend who really likes it so I thought I would try it.The plot is an interesting concept - a loving son tries to protect his mother from a possibly lethal shock by recreating East Berlin in their flat after the collapse of the wall. However, for me, it sits uneasily between comedy and drama - having neither enough humour for a comedy or feeling serious enough for a drama.And despite the original plot idea not much seems to happen. There are several slightly inane subplots which seem to have no relevance to the rest of the story and do not aid it in the slightest.Saying that, the acting is competent all round, if not outstanding and the conclusion is satisfying. But the pace is slow, the story unengaging and most of the characters not likable or charismatic in the slightest.If you are fan of those movies where not much seems to happen then you will probably enjoy this - but I do not mean that I only like fast paced action movies by any means. Maybe I missed something as this seems to be a universally popular film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a thoughtful drama with some amusing moments, but really should be considered a drama. I was disappointed because I was expecting (and led by the trailer) to expect a comedy of a manic and somewhat screwball nature (not unlike James Cagney's cold war farce, "One, Two, Three". But if you go into this film expecting a poignant, thoughtful family drama with some offbeat funny moments, you won't be disappointed at all. Well acted and directed. It had some truly inspired moments, like when Alex's mother saw the statue of Lenin drifting by, arm outstretched as if to beckon her to follow (which she ultimately does). I do recommend this thoughtful and touching film, but understand; it ain't a comedy (not at least by American standards).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Good Bye, Lenin" is a subtitled dramady about a young East German man who lives with his communist party hardliner mother prior to the fall of the "Iron Curtain". The mother suffers a heart attack and lapses into a coma for eight months during which the "Cold War" ends and a divided Germany becomes one. Once the mother returns to consciousness, the son tries desperately to recreate the old communism within the confines of their flat to prevent anxiety which might result in another heart attack. Generally an acceptable film which manages some moments of humor, poignancy, pathos, and sentiment, "Good Bye, Lenin" received lukewarm critical reviews, 3 stars from Ebert, a few fringe awards, and good marks from the public. However, be prepared for low end production value, some redundancy as they milk what humor is to be found in the staging of the old regime for Mom, and, of course, subtitles. Recommended only for foreign film freaks, especially those interested in an East meets West story (Germany, circa 1990's). (B)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't really work as either comedy or drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years, some great movies have come out of Germany. "Der Untergang", "Gegen die Wand", and, to a lesser extent, "Das Experiment", are all well-made and impressive movies. I had really hoped to add "Goodbye Lenin" to that list, but unfortunately this movie doesn't really live up to the hype. Which is a shame, because it has a really interesting premise: woman, living in the German Democratic Republic, ends up in a coma and misses the fall of the Berlin wall. When she wakes up, her son hides from her this fact, fearing that the shock of finding out might kill her. Instead, he engages in increasingly more elaborate attempts to recreate the GDR in their small apartment and keep the truth from her. Billed primarily as a comedy, I expected this movie to be a lot funnier than it turned out to be. The truth is that it's only mildly funny at best, and only very sporadically so. During the entire running time, I smiled a couple of times and laughed out loud exactly once. Not a very impressive score.All of this wouldn't have mattered if the movie would have worked as a drama. In my case, it didn't. Firstly, the premise that would have been great for a comedy, is really a bit too silly and unbelievable for a fully-fledged drama. It's hard to take the characters seriously when the situation they're in is so surreal. Next, the drama by itself left me mostly cold. None of the characters are particularly well-developed, and I mildly disliked some of the people I was probably supposed to care about. The story meanders on for nearly two hours, moving at a fairly slow pace and without any major surprises, but with its fair share of clichés. The acting is decent I suppose, but once again none of the actors really manage to bring their cardboard characters to life. Granted, some parts are fairly clever, like the scene where the mother goes out on the streets for the first time and sees a huge statue of Lenin flying by, and some of the faked news reports are inventive as well. But on the whole, this movie is really nothing special. It's essentially an awkward combination between comedy and drama that doesn't really work as either. The slow pace and lack of jokes pretty much kill the comedy aspect, and its way too flat and unbelievable to really work as a drama. It certainly isn't without its merits, but it's also something that you can easily skip without really missing anything.*** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hello? editing? A little help?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Likable but surprisingly weak. Yes, of course, the basic concept is comic, and there are many funny scenes, but it really does jump back and forth between comedy and drama, and that isn't usually a problem, except that here, it is done poorly in many ways. A big part of the problem is editing I'd say. First, the initial romancing of Lara is way too long. SOme people think the movie itself is too long, but I find that hard to say, since I think there were things that needed to be added ... and other things that needed to be removed ... and a lot of things that needed to be one or the other. In general, the latter part of the movie was full of dubious choices and sloppy editing. Why was the father reintroduced into the scene? To show us that the mom is a moron? Great. There was NO reason to bring him back. Maybe it added the concept that families were torn apart by the wall, but DUH! The result was a deep dive back into drama from the shallow end of comedy. Then, why did the daughter run from the father after she had read his letters and knew the truth. It makes no sense, and is totally unexplored. Next, we see Lara tell the mother something about the border being gone. But the mother never asks her son what the $@#^$* his gal is talking about, and then when they show her the wall coming down on the fake news that night, the mother doesn't ask "Gee, how did Lara know that before it happened." Very weak all around. But there is more. Next we see Berlin's fireworks display to celebrate the anniversary. But, just a few minutes before, the son tore pages off the calendar and said they were holding their anniversary party on the 2nd, not the 7th. So, if this family was celebrating on a day other than the actual anniversary, why is there a city fireworks display on that night. Very weak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good bye German cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a (west) German expatriate, the events of the fall of 1989 remain vivid in my memory. I recall most notably, being asked by my American friends for comment and predictions, and being proved utterly wrong by the unfolding events. I would have never guessed that East Germans would be willing to give up, wholesale, their constitution, their achievements, their pride - in order to join West Germany. i have sympathy for those East German socialists who watched in shock the stampede of their fellow county men to prostrate before the Deutschmark. So the premise of the movie seemed to make sense: to protect their idealistic but frail mother from a dangerous shock, her two children decide to create an imaginary world for her, in which East Germany not only continues to exist, but prospers. It's a cute idea for a movie. It allows for some very funny scenes, most notably the reinterpretation of TV images of East Germans breaching the wall as images of elated West Germans wanting to come to East Germany. But the idea is unfeasible in the end, and the movie suffers from over-stretching what a viewer is willing to believe. There is no way, one could create TV programming on a regular basis that would keep the illusion alive in a thinking adult, no way for her to not notice the change in daily amenities (water, electricity, the noise from the road below), no way for her to remain confined to the bed, while looking healthy as an ox. So you give up, and say, maybe the movie wants to be a fable of sort. But to what purpose? Soon you are not sure if the movie wants to be a comedy, or a love story, or a drama. The movie meanders from one scene to the next. Very odd is the special feature on deleted scenes, where the director and the editor discuss what scenes were deleted and why. It turns out that the movie needed to be shortened by almost an hour for commercial reasons, and that the cutting was done by an editor - who really did not like the movie - against the will of a director who really did not like the cutting. In the end i was left with the impression to have watched a movie that resembles a painting that was badly cut up, and then reassembled, with the hope that the viewer may not notice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Canary and the open cage door</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie at the urging of some friends of mine from Germany who wanted to know my opinion. I'm not much of a movie goer, since I find most people who go to movies instead of read good books to be intellectually lazy and shallow. While there may be an occasional good movie, it is usually a poor adaptation or massacre of good literature. This film reminded me however of the age-old story of the canary who was trapped in a cage forever, and when faced with the door to its cage being inadvertently left open, elected to stay put on the safety of its perch. For some, this is a good choice, since the real world can be a very tough place, and little birds get eaten all the time by big birds of prey. The same is true of most of the characters in this story. Just like the lazy dolts who infect much of "higher education" in the Western world today, it is much easier to chirp some silly song and be fed by your owner than to actually go out and experience the world with all its warts. The comfort of the cage comes at a cost of freedom, but many do not know what to do with it, and would rather live in their little world, and chirp occasionally, but never contribute anything to society. Living as a serf under communist dictators, unable to flee East Germany except under the risk of death, is all forgotten quickly, especially when faced with having to get out and work for a living. Admittedly they were raised in a system, as Walensa most aptly said, where "We pretended to work, and the state pretended to pay."But there are many apologists for the mass murderers such as Stalin and his ilk, most of them scream bloody murder about someone taking away the "rights" they never fought for or earned. Usually these people are in their own little protected world, and have never seen or experienced the real one except through dumb movies such as this. But of course they have never visited the villages where millions were purposely starved to death in the Ukraine, where families were reduced to cannibalism when Stalin's goons stole their farms and their harvests in the name of the "greater good" of a failed system known as communism. Not to mention the millions of Chechens and other peoples moved to gulags to die in the name of the state. But this is too big an issue to be considered for this little movie, and the little minds of the little people portrayed in it. Sadly, the characters have no view of the world other than from their little perch to see just how small they are.</fullReview>
