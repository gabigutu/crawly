		<shortDescription>A classic underachiever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe Robert De Niro's doctor in Godsend (2004) went to the same medical school of horrors as his Dr. David Callaway in Hide and Seek, this year's De Niro toss away film, from which he deposits his considerable paycheck along with cash from Meet the Fockers. Why he doesn't concentrate his fortune and connections (as Clint Eastwood does) to craft an artful small film that would allow his acting gifts is the only mystery for me from his prolific but arguably spotty career.Young Emily Callaway (Dakota Fanning) has lost her mother (Amy Irving) to suicide. Psychologist dad moves her to an older, rambling house in the woods in upstate New York to start a new life. Not new are the abundant clichés of the horror film: the suspicious neighbors, whom director John Polson makes as creepy as possible; the questionable sheriff; the doors leading to scares; the mutilated dolls; Emily's imaginary friend, Charlie, who appears to be causing numberless offenses in the house; and knives placed as objects of intrinsic interest; and a vulnerable girl friend, Elizabeth (Elisabeth Shue). I stopped counting, for the film is one extended cliché after another.The interest for serious filmgoers might be the depiction of the psychological stat after a loss to suicide. Whatever the term might be such as "post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome," the film does a credible job showing how difficult it is for Emily to lead a normal life after the loss of her mother (and for her father as well). While there are echoes of Stephen King (The Shining's "Here's Johnny" comes to mind) and Hitchcock (think shower scene), there is no comparison in quality with those classics. The audience at the preview enjoyed some of the stock shock moments behind the many closed doors. Hide and Seek will titillate horror fans but disappoint discerning film buffs, who look for some believable edge and innovation.Milton in Paradise Lost expressed the descent from happiness to despair: "Farewell happy fields, Where joy forever dwells: hail, horrors!" Hide and Seek is not a classic horror film; it is a classic underachiever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This horror/thriller/(maybe)supernatural movie is nothing really remarkable, or anything that you haven't seen before, but it's quite watchable. After the suicide of his wife, Robert de Niro's psychologist character withdraws to an isolated rural location as therapy for his traumatised daughter. Things start to get creepy when she develops an imaginary friend who has a decidedly vicious streak.I've been complaining for some years now that de Niro really needs to pay a bit more attention to the sort of parts he accepts: he's been in far too many stupid comedies. Here we finally see him in a dramatic role, and whereas he pulls it off professionally, it's not really an inspired performance, and you have to wonder where his next classic role is going to come from.That aside, 'Hide and Seek' is a suitably creepy and dark movie. Its major fault, at least as far as I was concerned, is that its crucial 'secret' was obvious by about half an hour from the end. I still held out hopes that I was wrong, but I think anyone who's seen enough films of this sort would work it out by a process of elimination, and besides, the movie blows its own cover completely a good 10 or 15 minutes from the end, which leaves you with a rather disappointing and predictable run home.The DVD includes four alternate endings, three of which the directors eventually decided were too 'dark', and that the audience deserved some kind of positive 'reward' after having sat through so much traumatic stuff. I disagree. At least two of the three 'dark alternate endings would have improved the film by giving it a sting in the tail. Good god, go through a mental list of great horror movies, and you won't find many that shy away from endings that are 'too dark'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie down the tubes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the preview for Hide and Seek, i thought that it was just another creepy kid movie. but after going to see it with a clear mind, i was pleasantly surprised. The movie was well-crafted and suspenseful with incredible performances from the cast. Dakota Fanning played a scarred young girl who develops a dangerous "imaginary" friend named Charlie. Her father(Dinero) moves with her to a remote place out of the city for a new start after his wife's suicide.I loved the first hour of this movie. The characters showed true depth and the effects of what Fanning's character had seen were wonderfully shown. The neighbors were introduced and seemed very creepy.Okey, now to the second hour...Why? Why? The writers had so many ways to go, why did they do the second personality ending? For those who hadn't seen it, the Dad was Charlie. It's not even the lazy routine ending that bothered me, it's that they had so many other choices! one, the couple who lost their child. The father saw him speaking to his daughter. When he went over to their house, he talked to the neighbor's wife who broke down, saying that her husband did something bad. What was that about? Also, the neighbor who was returning a key at 3am who seemed very suspicious. With any of these endings, they could have scared audiences with the modern fear of kidnapping and child abduction. But no, they went with the alternate personality.This movie leaves the audience wanting their money back and wondering why they didn't see "Earnest goes to the Beach" instead. The writing is inconsistent, leaving loose ends with the neighbor's stories. I suggest watching the first hour and then leave or change the channel (if you're watching it on TV).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a psychological thriller, or a horror film, "Hide and Seek" doesn't break new ground. In fact, once it's over, the viewer feels somehow manipulated by what we have just witnessed. There are, supposedly, four different alternative endings for the movie, but unfortunately, the one being shown, doesn't add anything to what we have already seen.Although the film has some interesting moments, director John Polson has gone for the Grand Guignol effect. Ari Schlosberg's screen play gives us hints about what to expect, yet, when we realize the mystery at the center of the story, we keep scratching our heads.Suffice it to say, this film doesn't add anything to Robert DeNiro's brilliant career. Mr. DeNiro's last choices in films puzzle us, as well as his fans because we know he is capable of doing much better. Yet, as shown with this film and "Meet the Parents", and its sequel, "Meet the Fockers", "Analize This", and "Analize That", the actor keeps us wondering about his choices.Dakota Fanning is a young actress who shows an uncanny sense of how to upstage Mr. DeNiro in most of their scenes together. As Emily, in this film, this girl shows an enormous range in what she is capable of doing. One can see Ms. Fanning growing to be another Jody Foster in later years.The rest of the cast is completely underused. Amy Irving is only seen in flashbacks, which is a shame since she is a valuable actress. Famke Janssen has a few key scenes. The same goes for Melissa Leo, Elisabeth Shue and Robert John Burke.The only consolation was it was shown on cable and we felt lucky not having spent the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Thriller, With an Excellent Very Dark Alternative End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the suicide of his wife, the psychiatrist Dr. David Callaway (Robert De Niro) decides to move with his traumatized daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) from New York to the country to give more attention to her. In their huge old house, Emily finds a new and violent invisible friend called Charlie, making David very concerned with her mental state."Hide and Seek" is a good, but predictable thriller. Dakota Fanning has another outstanding performance, on the contrary of in the just-released "War of the Worlds", where she is histrionic. Robert De Niro is too old to act as the father of Emily, but in the end, this movie is enjoyable. The DVD shows three alternative ends, and there is a very dark one, which is excellent, with Emily in an institution. Unfortunately, the commercial end prevails and becomes the "official" conclusion of the movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Amigo Oculto" (The Hidden Friend")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the suicide of his wife (Amy Irving), David Callaway (Robert De Niro) takes his mentally disturbed 9-year-old daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning) to a new home in the country in upstate New York. Instead of getting better, Emily begins to withdraw further, and she announces to her father that she has a new imaginary friend named "Charlie." At first, her father sees Charlie as a way for Emily to express her feelings. Then a series of vicious acts such as menacing writings appearing on the bathroom walls, and other mysterious occurrences start happening around the house. David blames Emily for doing them, but Emily says that Charlie did it. But is Charlie imaginary? You'd have to ask Emily, who is the only one who can see Charlie. Charlie may actually be both real and very dangerous. The movie is well crafted and suspenseful with a great cast. For a thriller, I did jump a few times. The ending was a little disappointing, but not unpredictable. (20th Century Fox, Run time 1:40, Rated R)(8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hide and Seek is a really creepy psychological thriller directed by John Polson (Mission: Impossible II, The Sum of Us) and it has one of the most memorable and most shocking/surprising endings ever. Another movie that had that creepy-ending thing was Wes Craven's 'They'. (sorry, no other titles come to mind. but see They, it's extremely scary).Anyway, Robert DeNiro (Shark Tale, Cape Fear (1991)), for once, did not over-act in this movie. His acting was actually great! And Dakota Fanning just literally blew me away. She is definitely THE BEST young actress that has ever been and that will ever be (I hope I said that phrase right, but if I didn't, I'm sure you know what Ii mean). She did the same thing in War of the Worlds, too. She has a very, very, very, very, very, very, very rare gift of acting. She has such a talent that God gave her. She just passed through the part easily, as if there was nothing too it. Her part as Emily Callaway really creeped me out. She also won an MTV Movie Award for, 'Best Frightened Performance' in this movie. She really seemed actually frightened! Everything else was wonderful in this movie! See Hide and Seek! You won't be disappointed!Original MPAA rating: R: Frightening Sequences and ViolenceMy MPAA rating: R: Violence/Terror and Frightening Sequences My Canadian rating: 14A: Violence, Frigtening Scenes, Mature Theme</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't impressed with 'Hide and Seek.' If you've seen Secret Window or any of the recent horror=thrillers with endings of an identical twist, you'll understand how tired and utterly formulaic this has become. Hide and Seek lacks imagination anyways because the viewer is asked to be confounded by a series of disconnected scare tactics such as things jumping of closets, the last minute awareness of the culprit before the death of an unsuspecting victim, and above all, modern horror-thriller filmmakers determined to creep you out with some weirdo kid.All the while, however, the story is very thin: that of a father and his young daughter coping with the gruesome death of the wife/mother who supposedly slit her wrists in the bathtub where she bled to death. However, we are led to believe that in fact, her death was no accident. And the weird little girl and her mysterious, elusive friend "Charlie," seem to be behind the whole thing as they taunt the father who just seems to want to get on with things. Something like 'The Omen,' if you will. But, it doesn't end that way, of course.Instead, a cast of pretty good actors star in a film of cheap tricks and an even cheaper ending (including the infamous last scene where you think that all is well until there is some last minute evidence that in fact, the evil will continue unabated). Formula one hundred percent. If you've seen films like 'Secret Window' or 'Taking Lives' or other similar pseudo-mind benders (sorry, other titles don't come to mind at the moment), then you're in for nothing new if you watch 'Hide and Seek.' In any event, De Niro didn't over act and Dakota Fanning did a fine job creeping me out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low Temperature De Niro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>De Niro, though he gives a nice performance, is not exactly in overdrive, which probably explains why this film is released in February instead of the blockbuster periods. It is a nicely-cast and shot film, and De Niro avoids any temptation to munch scenery. The film has a Sixth Sense-type surprise, but just doesn't have the "oomph" of that movie. The scenes involving the neighbors are confusing and perhaps there was sub-plot that got cut. You might also say that the ending was telegraphed to some degree. I wouldn't go if you dislike violence against women (or cats). Won't be at the top of De Niro's resume.Rated R (dead kitty; gratuitous shower curtains and sinister facial expressions).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Notch Acting In A Good Suspense-Mystery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hide and Seek" is one of the best horror films I've seen in awhile. It is about a psychologist, David Callaway (Robert DeNiro) whose wife commits suicide, and he decides to move to upstate New York with his daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning), whose personality has severely changed after her mother's death. A family friend/psychologist/co-worker of David, Katherine (Famke Janssen) disagrees with David's decision to move, and thinks that Emily should stay where she is. Then after David and Emily move into their new house, David meets Elizabeth (Elisabeth Shue), who becomes a friend to David and Emily. Then strange things begin to happen - Emily discovers a new imaginary friend, Charlie. And then people start to die. Robert DeNiro and Dakota Fanning are both brilliant, their performances were extremely real and convincing. Dakota is quite talented for her age, and DeNiro gives another great performance like he always does. Famke Janssen ("Don't Say A Word" and "House on Haunted Hill") also does great, and Elisabeth Shue ("The Karate Kid") is also very good. In fact, the whole cast was great. The whole film was really suspenseful, and it tricks you a lot. The atmosphere was heavy, I loved the whole feeling of the secluded upstate New York small-town, and the large house David and Emily move into. I liked this movie because it was more psychological rather than chop and slash gore that most horror films use to scare people. "Hide and Seek" has a good, solid story behind it, which is why it is such a good horror film, and the acting is top notch on top of it all. I don't understand everyone's problem with this movie, it was actually quite good. Sure, the ending is a little cliché, but the rest of the movie was good enough on it's own. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was anxious to see this film, and I honestly enjoyed the first hour of it. And then...Charlie was revealed, and I was so angry I considered walking out of the theater.Not every horror movie has to be "The Exorcist" or "The Sixth Sense." Not every movie--horror or otherwise, has to be intelligent. With a little bourbon, even "Night of the Lepus" can be fun. Twists in a horror film are great--if executed correctly. And "Hide and Seek" misses the mark completely.For one, it asks us to be stupid and go along with the second half of the film. The second half of the film doesn't add up, nor does it make us say, "I should have seen that coming," as films such as "Sixth Sense" and "The Others" did. There's no equation for this movie--none. In the end, I had no idea what the movie was really about (that drawing in the final scene--what IS that? What does it say?) The only thing good about the movie was the performances by every member of the cast. Hey Amy Irving! Good to see you! Same for Elisabeth Shue. Dakota Fanning is very talented, and we should keep our eyes on her. But the cast isn't worth the money.Save your dollars for Blockbuster if you're really curious. Again, I was hopeful at 7pm this evening, and very angry two hours later. Little plot, no resolution. The film descends into utter nonsense. A true disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing performances and atmosphere with an intelligent script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All's not well at the home of the Callaways. David (Robert De Niro) and Alison (Amy Irving) have obvious tension in their relationship. When it leads to suicide shortly after the film begins, David, a psychologist, packs up his young daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) and heads from New York City to bucolic upstate New York to try to start over. Unfortunately, the suicide was just the start of their problems. It seems that something evil may have followed them into the woods.Hide and Seek is not your typical thriller. For much of its length, it is a much quieter, slower-paced drama, resting almost entirely on meaty, complex performances from two actors, one of whom--Fanning--was only 10 years old while making the film! It also is veers back and forth from thriller to horror territory (which have a notoriously gray border anyway) depending partially on one's interpretation of the film. The ending is marked by a clever twist that most viewers may not see coming, and which will pleasantly broach more questions than it answers long after you have seen the film. Those facts might turn some potential viewers off, but anyone able to slow down and appreciate fine acting housed in a dense, creepy environment will be rewarded. The film was a 10 out of 10 for me.Newcomer screenwriter Ari Schlossberg has said that he grew up in the city, so just the idea of the woods, as well as children in general, frighten him. Those may be unusual sentiments, but director John Polson has translated them with remarkable ease into Hide and Seek. The country setting feels eerie from the moment David and Emily arrive, and Fanning's outstanding performance has her gradually changing from a cute kid to a scary little pseudo-Goth monster more slyly than native New Yorker slipping into the subway car before you to grab the last seat. Of course De Niro is good, too, but that goes without saying. Hide and Seek gives both performers a chance to show their range, but the biggest surprise is perhaps that Fanning can match De Niro step for step. The rest of the cast doesn't slouch, either, but they're not the focus. Their role is more to provide the necessary little nudges to justify our stars' next dazzling feats.While I cannot talk at length about various subtexts and interpretations without giving spoilers, they range from the purely psychological to the supernatural. It is worth noting before watching that little of what you see playing out on the screen may be actually happening, and there may be something more sinister at work that is never fully stated in the film.Schlossberg has said that among his many influences for this script were The Shining (1980), and in fact, that masterpiece is directly referenced a few times. Those are big shoes to try to fill. While the style and content of Hide and Seek are very different than The Shining--Hide and Seek is even more understated--that's also a slower-paced film that finds much of its effectiveness from its thick atmosphere and commendable performances, and fans of Kubrick's great horror film should find enough to enjoy here as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hackneyed Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***This comment definitely contains spoilers!!!*** Robert de Niro's recent movie "Hide and Seek" is, as another IMDb commentator stated, a "watchable" movie. Although it is decently made, its failure to become a box office success was due to its script which was rather cliché. The plot line that the central character of the movie turned out to be the real villain is nothing new. Probably it was first used by Agatha Christie in her novel "Murder of Roger Ackroyd" approximately eighty years ago. Even with the further twist that this central character/villain himself probably did not remember the crimes due to memory suppression, the plot line is still nothing new. Rod Serling and others used this kind of plot line decades ago. (Some readers may recall a 1963 Twilight Zone episode "The New Exhibit" in which the central character played by Martin Balsam kept on killing and killing but did not remember any of his crimes due to his memory suppression. He blamed the murders on supernatural acts by his wax statues.) Because of this hackneyed plot, the so-called surprise ending of this movie was not much of a surprise. The only unexpected thing about the ending of the movie which is worth mentioning is the fact that the screenwriters steered the moviegoers to think that this movie was a horror movie in which an apparition named Charlie was behind all the horrible things occurring in the Calloway household. The screenwriters of the movie borrowed liberally from the Japanese movie "Dark Water" to make the movie look like a horror movie. For example, just like in the Japanese movie "Dark Water," 1) Calloway household consists of one parent and one child, 2) Charlie initially revealed himself only to the child and 3) Charlie seems to be associated with water, especially to the bathtub. At the beginning of "Hide and Seek," many fans of Asian horror movies and similar movies assumed this movie to be a horror movie, similar to "Dark Water." To the surprise of some of the moviegoers, the movie turned out to be a suspense movie in which none of the horrible events in the movie was supernatural. They were all the acts of the dual personality of the insane central character played by de Niro.Although de Niro did an admirable job playing the mentally ill psychologist, his acting was not good enough to save this rather cliché script. "Hide and Seek" was merely watchable, but not very unique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this had all the sufficient details and mystery of a typical thriller. as usual fanning displayed her enormous amount of talent, and De Nero portrayed his role or should i say roles quite satisfactory. the whole time i did not throughly pick up on the whole base of the movie as well as the plot until the near end when everything was cleared up. although things surely did not come to be as they seemed. i will have to give credit to the writers for that. it may have disappointed most but i wouldn't call it the all time worst horror movie. it was more on the physiologically thriller side than anything else.basically i enjoyed the creepiness of Dakota fanning's character through out the whole movie and the basic way everything was set up to happen and the whole time it kept the audience in silence and without much expecting of what was going to happen. i definitely think you should give a try it won't hurt. you pass the time and you have something to think about the rest of the day. although it took 2 times for me personally to completely grasp the movie other people might have understood it right away. and I'm not the type who is clueless about movies.</fullReview>

I found myself gripping my fiancé at times and almost burying my head when I knew something scary was about to happen. I would have never predicted what the truth was and it was right there all the time. I loved this movie, will see it again, and buy it when its out on DVD. What a great and awesome piece of work.

		<shortDescription>Is Hide and Seek worth the Peek?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The answer to the title is a mixed opinion. Hide and Seek suffers from the usual bad in most of the recent movies: the trailer gives away much of the movie itself, but watching the movie (and those of you who have know that), the trailer is cleverly edited in order to not reveal any of the actual plot twist in the end about the mysterious Charlie. For starters, the movie starts off with one thing in its favour: the cast. Robert DeNiro, the stunning rising Dakota Fanning, Famke Janssen and Elisabeth Shue. Well it is an almost perfect line up for the four main characters; but do they deliver? Only Dakota does. I'm realising that being Dakota 11 years old she steals the movie from any other actor even De Niro. She shows real emotion, real agony and we truly believe that girl is troubled. Although De Niro still marks some presence, and after all he his the genius we all know he is, his last few movie choices and performances are lacking, and here is no exception. Famke Janssen is merely an accessory to move the movie on, and Elisabeth Shue is clearly suffering from the "once-successful-but-not-anymore" syndrome. The script is not by all means perfect, nor above average, but it is my feeling that if it were handled by a more talented and trustable director, the movie could be a lot better. Hide and Seek is not an awful movie, but it is miles away from being a good one. Dakota Fanning is worth the movie alone, but the way the final twist (although farely indiscoverable) could be bombastic if better filmed. Too Bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say? It's scary for one thing, but the storyline IS in fact good in my opinion...not everybody has to like it, but I have to say the only disappointment was the fact that 'Charlie' turns out to be Robert DeNiro's character, David, after he sees his wife kissing another man at a New Year's party. It was confusing at first, but after working out that Emily (Dakota Fanning) knew her dad was Charlie and didn't want to tell him, just in case he thought she was crazy, or just in case she didn't want him to think that he was more traumatised at his wife's death as his daughter was. After that, I was able to enjoy it more...EXCEPT when we see everything fall into place, i.e: seeing that it was DeNiro pushing Elizabeth out of the window, how fast did he get there and become Charlie? Because he, as David was listening to music when Elizabeth knocked on the door to see how everything was. Hmmm... anyway, the music added drama and made me jump every time the music climaxed along with the film...No matter how many people think it is a poor film, I think that it was excellent acting, music and storyline.HIS WIFE'S DEATH IS NOT SUICIDE, IF YOU REMEMBER HE SEES HER AT THE NEW YEARS PARTY KISSING ANOTHER MAN AND GETS ANGRY AT THAT, IT WAS CHARLIE WHO KILLED HER</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deniro needs to stay away from thrillers and stick to playing bad guys or cops. In Hide and Seek, he portrays probably the worst psychiatrist/single father I've ever seen. Okay, I won't really spoil the ending but after "the revelation" of this Who's Doin It, it did NOT work for me. The writer of this movie Ari Schlossberg must have logged a lot of how-to-be-a-Hollywood screenwriter hours in class. Deniro's last thriller, Godsend, was also terrible, and he played a goofy doctor in that one, too! Typical stupid sheriff in this one who doesn't call for back-up and thinks his flashlight is a better weapon than his handgun. The daughter's role could have been played by anyone, but Dakota Fanning is the latest young darling hob-nobbing from movie to movie with big names. Her best-and only-good role as 'The Daughter' was in I Am Sam, where I thought she was fantastic. Famke Janssen was average and fluff as was Elisabeth Shue. The one and only good part of this movie is the one that didn't make it; be sure to see the alternate ending of Emily where she is institutionalized. A much smarter choice than the original ending. But then, making this movie at all was not a smart choice anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the opening night of this movie... and I must say, I am very disappointed. The trailers really made the movie look amazing, but when I saw the movie, I thought, "When is something actually going to happen?" I found it disappointing that it took a long time for something to happen, and when it finally did, it was a very weak way to finish off a movie. As someone stated in another comment, the only thing worth seeing in that movie is Dakota Fanning. For an 11 year old, she is very creepy and sure knows how to keep an audience at the edge of their seats. I suggest to anyone who wants to see that movie to consider seeing another one, or wait until it comes out on VHS/DVD so you can rent it for cheap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly Passable For One Viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was okay but nothing special. Frankly, I hate to see a young likable talent like Dakota Fanning play morose, ugly roles like this. Let her be a kid who laughs, has fun and acts like a kid, such as she did in "The Cat In The Hat." Since then, she's playing in rougher and rougher films although "Dreamer" with Kurt Russell, I am told, is a nice film.Anyway, you know that with her and Robert De Niro, you're going to get some excellent acting. The movie also offers a lot of suspense. While it was not fun seeing a young girl mentally tortured and depressed all the time, it was nice to see De Niro play such a low-key role for most of he film.I would think, without giving anything away, that one viewing of this film would be enough, even if one likes it. Once you know the ending, well......If you are not a big fan of either Fanning or De Niro (I am) , I wouldn't even give it one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You know its not that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie Buffs (snobs) will not be surprised by the stereotypical Hollywood ending, but the movie is not too bad throughout. Dakota Fanning puts on the typical scary little girl show to a above average level, and the cinematic action will make you squirm in your seat a few times. Therefore this movie isn't one that I would say you definitely need to see, but if you have some time to waste its a pretty good time. Also it gets bonus points for being a good date movie. The absolute worst thing about this movie is its lack of humor, though the dark overtones are necessary for a true horror movie there needs to be an element of humor(saving The Exorcist), even the Ring had its moments at the beginning with the two girls in the bedroom, this movie has no humor which makes us feel very little for the characters. This is the major downfall, but its still worth a viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting performance of Robert de Niro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To help her small daughter nine years "Emily" (Dakota Fanning) to recover the coup that meant the suicide of her mother, a psychoanalyst new yorker "David Callaway" (Robert De Niro) leaves the city and will be with the girl to live in a house in the forest. Far from help, the environment alter seems even more to the small, whose attitudes are becoming ever more disturbing. She begins to speak of a dangerous imaginary friend called "Charlie" which is threatening and terrorized. At the beginning the father will not take it seriously.This film is one of the best titles of the year as regards to this genre. Bringing together three major players in a film is something very difficult for a director. Robert DeNiro is one of the best actors, excellent, very concentrated and above all, very credible in this film. His great interpretation maintains the final secret hidden and concealed at any time.Dakota Fanning, the best actress category, very safe, demonstrates their fears, joys and sorrows with eyes that say it all, with clear dialogs, profound and with an interpretation clean, Framke Janssen, "Katherine" is splendid in a role that leads to much solvency and bounce.The film begins with a rhythm a little slow, until "Emily" known to "Charlie", then the film is very interesting and despair of the audience to discover who is "Charlie", the more interesting yet. It should be carried away by the images, sound, the dialogs and good performances of the players.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not the greatest figurer out of plot twists, and I didn't figure this one out. If you did, then I can see that there would have been an air of disappointment over that aspect of the film. I didn't so, plot-wise, I had no problem with enjoying the movie.I thought the ending was fine.And, as usual, I thought Dakota Fanning was quite remarkable, holding the screen with an assurance well beyond her years (although I find her manner in the "Making of.." documentaries worryingly un-childlike).I did have some other problems, though.De Niro's character must have been the worst psychologist in the world, given his complete inability to apply any of his knowledge to dealing with his daughter's problem in any constructive way (and, yes, I know "That's because blah blah blah", but it's still a distraction when you're sitting there watching him to fail utterly to exercise a shred of competence.I failed to understand some of the child's motivation for her actions and attitudes vis-a-vis Charlie and Dad, especially given the nature of the twist.Elisabeth Shue and Famke Janssen - nice to see them, even if only briefly.And De Niro - not your finest hour, Bob. Carry on like this, and Norton and Depp will be fighting over the "Greatest Living Screen Actor" crown, while you watch from the wings.My score of 7 is a point or two higher than it would otherwise have been, solely on the strength of Dakota Fanning's performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After his wife's suicide, a psychiatrist (Robert De Niro) brings his traumatized daughter (Dakota Fanning, in a terrific and eerie performance) to a house in the New York country. Upon their arrival at the new house, strange events begin occurring -- including Fanning's "games" with her new imaginary friend, Charlie.This psychological thriller is terrific in terms of the acting and imaginative direction by John Polson (2002's "Swimfan"). The ending is definitely a surprise, and the events leading up to it are definitely creepy. Fanning, once again, delivers the goods as the traumatized girl who lost her mother and even does a great job adding a creepy atmosphere to it, a creepy atmosphere every psychological thriller should have.Not recommended for the faint of heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hide and Seek is a rather dull movie, I believe that Dakota Fanning is a very talented actress and has such captivation screen presence, she is the only reason the movie was somewhat entertaining. The peculiar character which she plays is conveyed so well and is very believable. Her facial expressions and mere presence in a scene heightens the movie, if it weren't for Dakota's brilliant performance I would find the movie very boring. To me this is not Robert De Niro's best movie or character interpretation, yet he has made his character somewhat interesting. The story so not very complex nor is it very interesting yet the techniques the director uses make the movie bearable.The establishment of characters is made very clearly, the psychologist father trying to cope with loss and ultimately losing again (his daughter) and the young girl so traumatized by the event of her mothers death she is becoming introverted and reclusive , she appears seemingly insane ,all with the help of a devious "imaginary" friend. The bloodshed and gore belittled the movie to shock factor horror rather than the thriller it claims to be Very cliché' with an ending going for shock factor rather than depth. Fair effort but the movie lacks depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy and thrilling, but nothing special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film shows off all the elements that are required to create a perfect horror/thriller atmosphere: large country house, young girl with a psychological problem, a traumatic past premise, use of some typical objects like mutilated dolls, child drawings, mysterious neighbors with a hidden agenda, the camera often taking positions of a hidden character e.g. shots through closet doors... the list goes on. The screenplay in most parts is smart enough to keep the viewer interested in the story. The acting is professional enough, by De Niro, Fanning or Shue.The one major problem is that the whole film depends on only one major plot twist in the end. And the filmmakers failed to protect it properly before it's actually revealed. One could easily guess it after the film's forty-five minutes or so, because there's no other explanation left. Within another few minutes you are pretty sure about it, after the incident with the neighbors. There could have been other small twists or at least a darker ending. With the story's structure it's indeed difficult to protect the twist and the film faltered naturally. So it remains nothing special... just another psychological horror/thriller releasing every year.</fullReview>

And that really begins HIDE AND SEEK, a outrageously creepy and all together weird movie. Dakota Fanning stars as David's daughter, Emily, a girl so distraught over her mother's apparent suicide, her father takes her out of the city and to a nice, quit community in the country. That's when she meets her imaginary friend Charlie, and a not so nice one at that. Seems Charlie thinks David had something to do with his wife's death and Charlie wants to have fun with him. He does this through David's daughter, Emily. Or, is it really her that's doing it? Or...I'll leave that right there and say watch HIDE AND SEEK. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Yes, I will admit it's not the best of it's kind but it sure does deliver.</fullReview>

Schlossberg's script does have its jolts and scares, but the payoff is substandard, trite and boring to say the least.Deniro plays a psychologist with the emotions of a Star Trek Vulcan. I know the studio hired Deniro because he can "open" a picture and is a draw for moviegoers, but anyone with a lobotomy could have played the part. The one standout is the young and phenomenally talented Dakota Fanning. Her performance is absolutely remarkable for an eleven year old. But there are many more films in Fanning's future (better ones of course) and it will be wonderful to see her continue to outshine her fellow actors.</fullReview>

Dakota Fanning's performance is excellent and her character lends a great deal to the overall creepy ora of the film. I found the movie quite compelling, but the ending was too predictable to shock in the desired manner.The DVD does contains several alternate endings which all have stronger appeal than the one that was used, but none of them would have hidden it from the viewer.Overall, Hide and Seek is better than De Niro's last attempt at psychological thrills (Godsend), but is still not a film that De Niro should be proud of, even though his performance isn't bad.There are better films around than this, but there are probably more that are worse.Worth a watch 6/10 Check out 'Secret Window' its a little better and the ending works well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why wasn't the wife's (Amy Irving) suicide explained. She had a devoted husband (Robert Deniro) an adorable daughter (Dakota Fanning). This caused the daughter to retreat psychologically into creating an imaginary friend and terrors only known in a child's mind. The pay per view had the alternate ending after the credits. That made it fun. This young star, Fanning, will be seen much much more as she is hauntingly beautiful as a child and is a hell of an actress already. The cast is great, Elizabeth Shue, and the rest do an admirable job in a somewhat strange film. I on't tell you the ending it is worth seeing and check out the alternate ending. OK so bu the end you know all the answers. I figured this ending out. It was all too predictable. But enjoyable if you leave your brain someplace else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impossible to ignore the many similarities to THE SHINING! (Slight spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>De Niro is brilliant as usual. Hard to fault him. However it is slightly annoying that whomever wrote this screenplay owes a big chunk of homage to King. Instead of the Overlook Hotel we have a house on the lake in a very deserted part of the country. Instead of the black chef being contacted by the boy using the shining who then comes, we have the little girl phoning the Psychiatrist who comes from a distance but seems to arrive (from far away suggesting a continuity error) in a very short time (judging by the time passing in the movie). Other major similarities are when David looks at the journals he's been keeping all this time (he finds that they have never actually left the packing crates) and finds them empty - I wouldn't have been surprised if it had read "All work and no play makes David..." The final chase scene is once again similar to The Shining when he reaches the room door with he knife in his hand. Finally the many flashbacks he has to a dance hall which looks not like 2004 New Year but more like something from the 1920's is more than just a bit similar to what is going on in the Overlook's Gold room (which oddly enough is also celebrating New Year!) It's The Shining with the ghosts removed. Great movie, but really why so blatantly copied from another movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really is sad when an eleven year old child is a better actor or actress in a film than anyone else in it, especially when Robert DeNiro is part of that very small list. However, Hide &amp; Seek is one of those films. It is difficult to believe that an actress that young (probably ten when this movie was made) can act with such superiority, but unless the film was a documented reality movie (which don't worry, I don't really wonder whether it is or not), that is the case.A young girl (Dakota Fanning) loses her mother to a suicide incident and is never the same again. She misses her mother with passion, and all of the happiness and life she once had is drained from her. She therefore creates an imaginary friend named Charlie, which is all well and good, up until Charlie starts committing heinous acts against her father (DeNiro).The movie is very fast paced and it leads to a nearly fatal ending that you will never forget. The twist is not predictable, and you will never be able to pick up on it during the movie, unless you're very observant (there are some subtle hints throughout the movie).The ending is what makes this movie. I love movies that kick me in the balls at the end, and I have seen a countless number of movies like that (The Others, Secret Window, and Vanilla Sky as some examples), and I have yet to be able to see it coming beforehand. 8/10!</fullReview>

Otherwise, BEST MOVIE EVER.It has a zany plot, rich entertainment, and way better than some people said.

		<fullReview>I admit this movie kept me VERY thrilled till the middle. Then everything turned predictable. But what I did not like at all is the same idea of the mental disorder I saw a thousand times in other movies. Not only that. This film is full of clichés: childish voice tune, big house in the middle of nowhere, musical box, blood writing on the walls, strange neighbors, etc. It seems writers do not have imagination to create original scripts. More: Why are all obsessed with creepy children drawing eerie pictures? Please! Do something different once in a while!The cast was good but wasted. I really did not like how De Niro portrayed a father here. He was an iceberg! He was supposed to be a psychologist but he couldn't talk with his own daughter or even give her love! And the girl was like an iceberg too, her mom and also her cat died and she did not drop one tear or even a sad expression? Anyway, I can't blame Dakota. In fact, she is the only reason this film is getting 3 out of 10 from me. But not even her brilliant performance saved this Hitchcockian wannabe.The movie had a good atmosphere but that's all. When 1/4 of the movie is left there is a twist and an action breath but you just feel angry because the twist is a letdown. Also there were many things beyond any suspension of disbelief, for example little girl jumping off the roof without problems, woman walking on water in milliseconds and without a single splash sound, etc.I will not spoil the twist if you still want to watch this, but the biggest flaw is that the little girl was in danger all the time, because she KNEW the truth. After the truth is shown in the twist you would wonder "Why didn't she just get the hell out of there if she had countless opportunities to do it? Instead she was calm all the time."If you want to watch this, go ahead but do not expect something new. Instead be prepared to see a ton of plot holes and "homages" to other horror movies like The Amityville Horror, Psycho, The Shining, etc.</fullReview>

About 1 hour and 15 minutes into the movie. Right as we get to the big plot twist, it goes all wrong. The twist in itself is very good, one of the best I've ever seen, the problem lies outside of that. Right as we learn the big secrete, the movie should have just ended. Stopped right there, we should have seen the credits and moved on with our lives, but we don't. They keep going and end up turning this great film, into a really lousy piece of work. I had to force myself to finish the film. They go so off the path, that even the great acting, excellent effects and awesome story line can't fix the damage that had been done. They literally ruin the movie, making it into stupid American horror film. This movie lost points and fans with that one little glitch. The movie is worth seeing, for sure, but as soon as you come to that fateful scene, watch it, love it and then turn it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre horror movie doesn't move.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Robert De Niro is a great actor, and I expected him to be in this. I was sorely mistaken. Robert De Niro is usually a tough cop or a tough gangster, or sometimes a tough comedian, so it wasn't that great watching him attempt to act as a single father to a troubled 9 year old girl. Robert De Niro plays a father whose wife has committed suicide, so he moves his daughter to the country to help her forget. Here, she makes what he thinks to be an imaginary friend, but we know that this friend is real. As weird things begin to happen, he very unconvincingly worries about his daughter.The movie is both too slow and too fast at the same time. Dakota Fanning just didn't fit in the creepy little girl category. Robert De Niro was terrible. Then we are given a twist ending that you can see coming from a mile away, and it's an ending that we've seen many times before. I left the theatre very disappointed. The worst part of it is it's not even scary.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted, I really thought this movie was a 7 or 8 but I gave it a 9 to try to slightly offset the bad reviews this film has undeservedly received.I thought it was a good solid thriller with very good performances and an intelligent script and well above average direction. I was lucky enough to go into the movie with no real expectations. I think I had seen the trailer at some point but it had been long enough that I didn't remember much to have any preconceptions. This helped me quite a bit to enjoy the film since I didn't know what to expect. DeNiro was great giving a fine subtle performance and Dakota Fanning did a great job with her character as well.I also give this movie high marks for the exposition of the story since it kept me interested throughout and I was watching it late at night. If the suspense had not built so well I would have most likely been fast asleep pretty quick. I can't understand the low score this received. I just viewed Saw 2 and I believe it got a much higher score. This makes me very worried that audiences have really been messed up and completely dumbed down in recent years. Saw 2 had plot holes you could park an aircraft carrier in and didn't have near the quality of writing or direction Hide and Seek had. It is sad that people value cheap thrills and blood and gore over subtle suspense. I know this movie borrowed a couple of tricks from some other films but it was still very well done. I would much rather see a film like this that was at least written as if the viewer had a little intelligence as opposed to the typical crap these days that assumes totally stupidity on the part of the audience.I am adding to this review after having read many of the other reviewer's comments and I think I see why I had a slightly different experience from those who gave it a bad review. I think that the story up until the end was told from the perspective of Emily's father, David. This is why so many things don't entirely make sense because they are from his perspective. I will admit there are problems with some of the events toward the end but I was able to overlook the few minor goofs due to the excellence of the rest of the production. I am generally pretty picky about thrillers like this but this one impressed me nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Counting to Ten - But Don't be so Sure I'll Come to Find You Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very disappointing film when consideration to cast and expectations are tallied. The film chronicles a father and his daughter, just having experienced the suicide of wife/mother. They move out of the city to Upstate New York to a big, sprawling home against the background of woods and solitude, but what soon happens is the girl befriends Charlie - her imaginary friend. Well, I cannot go into too much detail for it might give away the not-so-clever denouement of this film. Director John Polson tries to pull out all the punches with his direction in terms of creating suspense: loud music that leads up to "something" happening, magnifying any crucial plot element, and using lots of close-ups of Robert DeNiro and Dakota Fanning. Does it work? Not for me. The script is the film's biggest offender. It is weak in terms of development and lame in terms of what it is trying to do. We have all seen movies with stories similar to this when the film's ending is revealed. Polson doesn't do a credible job building the plot and our need to understand the characters. DeNiro is okay as the lead, but he is a little too subdued through the first half of the film. Fanning is acceptable if nothing else. The fact that the film had four or five endings shot tells me a lot in terms of faith given to the project as a whole. Although some of the differences are minor amongst the endings (which can be seen on the DVD edition), the film appears to lack that creative dedication to story and purpose so necessary in making a truly good film. This is certainly not a truly good film. It might "watchable" at best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a crummy movie that makes you realize what a good movie Psycho was. Hide And Seek has a plot with a twist at the end that is like Psycho's but less effective, less exciting, and less surprising. Dakota Fanning is creepy. I can't decide if the creepiness is due to the fact that she's a good actress, or due to the fact that she appears to be a pint sized robot programmed to mimic adult behavior. DeNiro, it seems has two careers in real life as well as two personalities in this movie. There's the DeNiro that makes movies like Taxi Driver, Godfather II, and Raging Bull, and then there's the DeNiro that makes American Express commercials, and Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle. This movie falls into the latter category. It's a boring movie that makes you wait for a crappy climax. Rent Psycho.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie had potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie last night, and I am totally confused. Did DeNiro kill his wife because he caught her cheating or did she commit suicide? If he did kill his wife because she was cheating, am I to believe he developed a split personality disorder because of the "trauma". Or did he just go "crazy" because he found her dead? Regardless, the ending still stunk up the room. The whole time I thought just about everybody was part of DeNiro's multiple personality disorder. I figured Charlie(one of the multiple personalities) was the guy making all the bad things happen because DeNiro was a Vietnam vet having post traumatic stress and that "Charlie" was the Viet Cong. I thought the keys that the cop left were a symbolic way for DeNiro to start locking up the extra personalities. I thought that when some of the people (personalities) died, that was the good work of a psychiatrist ridding Deniro of the multiple personalities. I actually thought Deniro didn't have a daughter, and that she was just another personality that was trying to get him to understand that he was the one with a problem. I figured that DeNiro had actually killed his wife because of the stress of the Vietnam War, made him not see things rationally. I think my over thinking of this movie (as my fiancée said I did) would have made a great movie with a great ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie focuses on a father and daughter who move to the suburbs after the suicide of the mother. They move into a new house and that's when the sh*t hits the fan. The movie is very creepy and all but the ending reminds me too much of Secret Window. The alternative endings in the movie aren't very good at all and I feel that they should've thought about a major reconstruction of the ending all together. When I was watching the movie I had this weird case of deja vu where I thought I had seen this movie before. It wasn't that I've seen this particular movie before but I have seen movies just like it. Basically, the movie was good but the ending needed work but it's still worth seeing for the couple of creepy moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say about this film is that Robert De Niro should really do a better job of screening his role selections. Why would Mr. Raging Bull agree to do this film? I understand that the guy's gotta eat; but P-L-E-A-S-E, a split personality schizophrenic psychopath psychiatrist really could not have been the only role on the table out there for a man of his talent and caliber. Could it? I think not?.Anyways, David Callaway (De Niro) and his daughter Emily (played by Dakota Fanning) must reconstruct their lives after Callaway's wife played by Amy Irving commits suicide in the film's opening sequence. Calloway decides to relocate outside the city, and buys a country cottage in a upstate New York. Amongst the town's people, Calloway has a chance encounter in a local park with Elizabeth, played by Elisabeth Shue. Though he's thirty years her senior, an intimate rapport begins to formulate. (My God man, your wife's not even cold yet?.) All the while, another relationship is forming with Emily and her new imaginary friend, Charlie.Eerie occurrences, hostile messages on the bathroom walls, and the death of the family cat, all gravitate to this film's chilling climax. As the body count rises, so goes any possibility of reality; until the audience is forced to say, "ALRIGHT ALL READY" when the identity of "Charlie" is finally revealed.All that I am going to say about the identity of Charlie is this. I find it extremely difficult to believe that Emily (or any girl of this age) could REALLY differentiate who Charlie was, and use the conviction that she uses to express it. For example when she's explaining to her father that "Charlie did it!", "It was Charlie's fault!", or "Charlie and I were playing a game". I believe that you'll feel the same.http://farisreel.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A clichéd thriller with a dull, idiotic conclusion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In modern thrillers you can always bet that the cop investigating the murder is the killer, and the shrink ? in this case ? is the one who is insane. Why do killers like these exist only in movies? The movie employs all the cheap tricks, plot-devices and gimmicks from the Book Of Bad Horror/Thrillers: 1) suspicion is put on EVERYBODY, like the neighbour who JUST HAPPENS to have lost a daughter ? and guess what: she is about the same age as De Niro's AND has black hair, and of course the neighbour acts very strangely ? much like a sociopath, 2) the sheriff, of course, also behaves very strangely, especially when he investigates the house when his acting seems to be conveying only one thing to the viewer: "Please, viewers, just look how weird I am; suspect ME because I serve as a clichéd distraction in this dumb plot!", 3) the bearded guy JUST HAPPENS to be kneeling in front of De Niro's door ? at around midnight or so.About the murder at the outset of the movie: wouldn't forensics figure out that Irving died from suffocation and not from loss of blood? As for the girl, why is her behaviour so inconsistent? Are we to assume that BOTH De Niro AND his daughter are schizophrenic? If so, nobody notices anything??? The finale is so silly: very little makes sense. The only purpose was to surprise the poor, duped-into-watching-this-crap viewer with presenting ? TUH-DUH! ? De Niro as the killer. Forget logic or common sense. I guess we should be glad it didn't turn out that Jansen was the killer or the nutty neighbour's wife ? or Irving's aunt or something.Once you find out that De Niro is the killer, you might as well forget i.e. skip the remaining 15-20 minutes of the movie: a) everything that follows from there is totally predictable, b) the movie is so dark you won't see much anyway (unless you're an owl), and c) De Niro does a lame, low-key impression of Jack Nicholson from "The Shining"; you know, the father-chases-his-kid shtick. Yawn.The only good thing here is the nice photography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched "Hide and Seek" with a group of classmates in the movies, almost a year ago, and I remember how disappointed I was. I wasn't expecting something great as e.g. "The Sixth Sense", but I got even less.This may be easily Robert De Niro's worst acting (don't get me wrong, I love the man, but he sucks here). The precocious Dakota Fanning is good as usual (she might have been great if M. Night Shyamalan were the director, and the script, less twisted). There's a (failed) attempt to recreate the atmosphere of "The Shining". The ending is supposed to be 'surprising', but I figured it half-way. I was the only one in the group who disliked the movie and one of my classmates said, "I didn't quite get it, but it was cool!". I guess that's the same everyone who enjoyed this thought. 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hide and Seek is the kind of movie that desperately wants to be a taut psychological thriller but winds up spelling out its ending about twenty minutes too early. Robert De Niro plays a New York psychologist whose wife (the seldom-seen Kate Capshaw) kills herself by slitting her wrists in a bathtub, thus traumatizing the couple's young daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning). In an attempt to start over, the good doc David bundles up Emily and takes them to upstate New York for some R&amp;R.David tries to find new friends for Emily in the secluded, picturesquely rustic community and settles on Elizabeth (Elisabeth Shue) and her daughter (or niece, I'm not sure which, but it's not important, since we see the girl in only a couple of scenes). But it's for naught, as Emily apparently already has a new, albeit imaginary friend named Charlie. "He's fun," she says monotonically. "Fun like mommy." David and Emily have moved into a large frame house in the proverbial middle of nowhere, the latter location noted on screen by the real estate agent guy. But lo and behold, they do have close neighbors: Laura and Steven, who may or may not have their own super secrets. Just so you know our main characters don't have the skeletons-in-the-closet market cornered.David tries to understand his daughter's reason for having this new friend, and his doc pal Katherine (Famke Janssen) tells him it's just Emily's way of dealing with her mom's death. But then weird things begin to happen; is it Emily acting out, or is the house EEEEEEEEEEEEEVIL? Or are screenwriters just lazy? There's plenty of atmosphere, and the acting really is pretty good, considering the genre, but aside from some genuinely creepy moments, there's not much that grabs you and shakes you upside down, as real taut psychological thrillers should. The final twenty minutes of the movie will make or break the movie for you. If things come as a surprise to you at that point, then you'll probably like the movie; if you've been studiously figuring them out all along, this'll sink it for you.It's a pleasure to see Bob De Niro work, and he's surprisingly effective in a role that would normally go to Harrison Ford or even Mel Gibson - tough but tender. I kept expecting him to whirl around, eyes bulging, and tell Emily to "shut the f--- up!, g--d--- it!" Or words to that effect. De Niro isn't quite cuddly, but he's not entirely curmudgeonly, either, so that's a plus. Fanning's pretty unsettling, as she should be, and it's good to see her acting instead of cute-ing. The rest of the cast is basically interchangeable (although Dylan Baker's fantastic in his few scenes as the local sheriff); Roger Ebert notes that the Law of Economy of Characters does come into play.</fullReview>

This film practically seemed ripped off from another film I have seen. I was extremely let down at the turn of this film and was on the verge of stopping the film. Ms. Dakota Fanning and Mr. Robert DiNero do an excellent job as an on screen "team". The DVD extra endings seem like the director could not make up his mind on how he wanted the film to "leave you hanging" so he made 5 endings and let someone else pick.

		<fullReview>Don't let the presence of Robert De Niro and Elisabeth Shue fool you into thinking that "Hide and Seek" is anything more than a tacky, trashy thriller, utterly devoid of originality, credibility and suspense.De Niro is a Manhattan psychologist whose depressed wife (Amy Irving) kills herself in the bathtub. Feeling that a change of venue would be the best thing for him and his traumatized daughter, he moves to a small town in upstate New York, hoping to start life over again in an unfamiliar setting. Almost immediately, the child begins to turn strange, claiming that she has an "invisible" playmate who is none too happy with her dad for letting her mom off herself. Soon, animals and neighbors start showing up dead, and De Niro realizes he needs to start doing some serious intervention if he's to prevent his little girl from turning into a miniaturized Norman Bates."Hide and Seek" takes a serious issue - the effect a parent's suicide has on a child - and exploits it for cheap commercial purposes. Rather than dealing intelligently with this sensitive topic, the film uses it as window dressing for a squalid little horror film that feels like a thousand other thrillers that have come before it. The "surprise" twist ending will come as a surprise only to those who have never seen "Secret Window" or anything of that ilk, and whole sections of the last half hour feel as if they have been lifted almost verbatim from "The Shining." And what modern suspense film worth its salt would be without that single most hackneyed scene in the horror film canon - the old cat-jumping-out-of-the-closet trick!? In this respect, at least, "Hide and Seek" does not disappoint.De Niro and Shue are professional enough to turn in yeomen work, but even actors of their caliber can't make a silk purse out of this sow's ear. Dakota Fanning is fairly effective as the creepy child, but if you want to see a truly great film on the subject of creepy children, check out Jack Clayton's horror movie masterpiece "The Innocents" and avoid "Hide and Seek" at all costs.</fullReview>

Endless planted clues with no payoff. The creepy neighbor guy subplot fizzles horribly! Did someone edit this film?

But a lot of this movie leads up to nothing and has nothing to be excited or jumpy over. It has a story, but it wasn't delivered right. I mean, this is an A-cast: Robert DeNiro, Elizabeth Shue, and Amy Irving. I guess it just wasn't that interesting to me.If you enjoy these surprise thrillers, you probably enjoy it.

		<fullReview>ADDITIONAL SPOILER WARNING This summary line is to underscore the striking similarity between Hide and Seek and Sixth Sense. Change it to "I see imagined people" and it fits Hide and Seek like a glove. In both cases, the sleight of hand trick is in diverting your attention to the normal person (the kid in this case) making you believe that she/he is abnormal. Your perception is cleverly twisted around, switched between the two, the normal kid and the abnormal adult.Prior to seeing the movie, I read two words, out of my own choice, from an IMDb comment with spoiler warning and therefore pretty well knew what's going on right from the beginning. This is good because as I do not intend to watch the movie a second time (at least not in the near future), this foreknowledge allows me to fully appreciate how fine is Dakota Fanning's performance. I don't have to think back after the movie, but recognized right away all the meanings of her expression, that of a little girl trapped in a situation with no way out. This young actress has far to go. Only she can get away with that one scene where she is all addressed up, with full makeup, to join her father and Elizabeth for dinner.Actually, the clues are pretty painfully apparent that getting to the mid-point of the movie, one should really know what is going on. Knowing it right from the beginning, however, allow me to divert some of my attention to associating the various supporting actors with some of their other movies.Famke Janssen, for example, not only looks exactly like Jean Grey in her X-men movies, but plays a similar role too, that of a healer. Elizabeth Shue, on the other hand, leaning a little towards voluptuousness in this movie, is very different from the no-nonsense scientist she plays in Hollow Man. Dylan Baker I saw just a few days ago as the Rockefeller Foundation man trying to help Kinsey, until the kitchen gets too hot.Robert De Niro does not really have an exceptionally challenging role. Quite a number of actors can do just as well, and Robin Williams comes to mind immediately. It is Dakota Fanning that shines in this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a terribly original Summary, I know (the phrase has been used about 10 times on the review pages for this movie), but *Hide and Seek* is not a terribly original movie. If the filmmakers feel that they can be so lazy, why the hell can't I? After an opening scene loaded with faux-portentous overtones (an unrecognizable Amy Irving saying goodnight to her tucked-in daughter), we're treated to a crib from Kubrick's *Shining*: a lone vehicle wending its way through a mountainous countryside. Cue "dark" music. Then cue rambling new boondocks abode -- haunted, presumably. Turns out that Amy Irving (spoiler?) has committed suicide. Therefore, widower Robert De Niro -- a (spoiler?) psychologist -- absconds with his disturbed 9-year-old daughter (Dakota Fanning in a totally unrealistic performance) to upstate New York, to "get away from the City, from bad memories" blah blah blah.Look -- I really don't have the heart to provide the usual synopsis. All I have energy for -- and this movie is so tiresome it simply drains the life out of you -- is to warn you away from it. Don't let the flashy cast sucker you in: Elisabeth "Nice Cleavage" Shue is barely in the thing; Famke Janssen is barely in the thing; Dylan Baker is barely in the thing. And Robert De Niro is just sleepwalking. In my review for *Meet the Fockers* I advised De Niro to play King Lear or its contemporary equivalent, and to do it fast. *Hide and Seek* is not what I had in mind, Mr. De Niro! He doesn't even bother to conceal his utter boredom: mumbling his lines, totally "out of the scene", as actors say, walking around with that pained grimace on his face. . . . Enough already! At least Brando had the decency to basically retire, popping up only for the occasional lucrative cameo when his expenses started outpacing his royalties. De Niro, Method veteran that he is, perhaps ought to follow his mentor's example, if this sort of effort is all that he can muster these days. These aren't very nice comments, but when one is confronted with the fact that De Niro's last good movie, was *Heat* back in 1995, it's time to call a spade a spade.As for director John Polson, hey, dude, how about an original idea? I don't know who wrote the script (I guess I could've looked it up, but I just don't care), but the writers and Polson dredge up every cliché involving Strange Old Houses, Strange New Neighborhoods, Creepy Children Who Might Have Spiritual Powers, and Tell-Tale Psychology in the entire catalog of such nonsense. Heck, De Niro keeps waking up at the same time in the middle of the night, just like that James Brolin did in *Amityville Horror*, and when you're cribbing *Amityville Horror*, you may as well hang it up. There's about five minutes of mystery in the movie when we wonder if Fanning's imaginary friend "Charlie" is real or not (Charlie's pranks are too physically substantial to warrant speculation that It's All A Dream), but it becomes embarrassingly clear what's really going on far too quickly for any real suspense to get generated. Red herrings in the plot are obvious, and exist only to stretch out the film's running-time to feature-length. In fact, the movie's final "plot twist" should occur to you before you fork over your Hamilton at the box office. It certainly occurred to me. "Is this going to be THAT kind of movie?" I murmured to myself. Sadly, it was.1 star out of 10.</fullReview>

Look, when I see a creepy little kid, I will say that that kid is a creepy little bastard! I call it like I see it. I realize that most kids in the world are not disturbed, but some are, and should you ever come across one, then please save humanity and do all us humans a favor by making sure that said creepy little kid is locked away for life. I realize that creepy little kids have been a staple for horror films, but to suggest that they should never be thought of as criminals is insane. Hollywood loves to portray kids as angels. Like I said, most are, but I think Hollywood needs a reality check.This leads me to Hide and Seek, a movie that is mediocre even with powerful actors like DeNiro, Fanning and Shue. For some reason, Bobby makes more mediocre films nowadays then he does quality. I realize you have to pay the bills, but come on. DeNiro is one of the best actors ever, and his movie choices lately (Godsend, which is horrible)have sucked. DeNiro should have looked at the script and then decided to burn it after reading the first 3 pages. Either that or he should have demanded a love scene with Elisabeth Shue for extra compensation. Fanning parents saw the $$$$ there little girl would earn, and signed her up real quick. Well, that is my theory, cause she is way better than this garbage.Fanning plays the "creepy little kid", and DeNiro plays her psychiatrist dad. Mom kills herself in the beginning of the movie, or at least that is what it looks like. Darling daughter becomes depressed and creepy, and daddy decides to move from the city to the country for a new start. Turns out the move is a bad idea, cause (excluding Shue's character) all the residents of this small town that we meet are creepy too. And why is it that small town folk are always creepy? Big cities have there fair share of freaks as well, but for some reason, this movie (along with many others) wants you to believe that small town folks are crazy as hell. Anyways, this movie goes from okay to flat out ridiculous in no time at all, and once the big "surprise" comes at the climax of the film, you feel as if you have seen this movie somewhere before. That is due to the fact that Hide and Seek turns into a rehash of many other films. Sad thing is the fact that Hide and Seek wants to be different........but it isn't.I'll give Fanning credit. She does play her role well, and it was because of her that I watched this whole thing. This is a dark role for her, and she seems to eat it up. She does have a bright future ahead of her, but she needs to avoid crap like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hide And Seek is an effectively disconcerting horror yarn that met some nasty reviews and and deflated box office expectations. It's perhaps not the white knuckle blast of terror that people were hoping for, and more of a slow burn as far as pacing goes, but the scares lie in the mounting sense of unease and atmospherics, which work well enough for me. If I recall correctly there are a few cheap and tawdry jump scares that are almost always false alarms in these type of films, but hey, nobody's perfect. Robert Deniro under plays the part of a grieving widower trying to pick up the pieces after his wife's suicide, with a growing concern from his daughter (a goth-ed out Dakota Fanning) who doesn't seem to be taking the residual trauma very well. She has an eerie imaginary friend named Charlie, whose behaviour is a huge cause for alarm, not those mention the girl's mental well being. Famke Janssen warmly plays her doctor, who is subject to Dakota's violent outbursts which she vehemently pins on this Charlie piece of work. It's brash, sensationalistic and loves it's premise maybe a bit too much, pounding each plot point in with the subtlety of a steamroller. That's not to say it's not entertaining, there's some dark thrills here and there and it's shot wonderfully to give us some spooky visuals and drab, ominous frames. Fanning does what she can and holds up her end well, Deniro is solid, if a little strained. There's also work from Elizabeth Shue, Dylan Baker, Robert John Burke, Melissa Leo and Max Payne himself, James McCaffrey. Sure it ain't great, but it's still in the margins of a solid horror thriller, and is at its best when the atmospherics kick in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>little Dakota matches the legendary veteran in every frame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nine-year-old kids come home from school with perhaps something they made in art class. Dakota Fanning, at the tender age of nine, turning ten on the set, played the female lead opposite screen veteran Robert De Niro, and matches his performance beautifully.Okay, so this is years ago, and I've not seen any of her recent stuff, but come on, I'll just bet NOTHING matches this. She was great! Okay, the movie leaves a lot to be explained, there are enough p(l)otholes in which to sink an army truck, but the two leads are absolutely brilliant. And with one of then just a mere little kid...By the way, how do you set out to make a movie featuring a little kid in such a major role? I mean, find a kid who is so mature as to be responsible enough to handle all that is expected of her? Surely there must be a lot of potential little actresses out there, yet we see very few really young children on the screen.Anyway, I heartily recommend this movie. It has its faults, its foundations are built on quicksand, but it is thoroughly engrossing, so for the sake of enjoying it, and marveling at the acting, do give it a chance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy and unpredictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time by a pure chance (by flipping through my TV-channels) about a year ago and I remember that I thought it was a really great film. "Hide and Seek" have a really good storyline and has an eerie atmosphere which gave me an creepy feeling throughout the whole film. I also have to concede that the ending came as a total surprise. The acting of Robert De Niro and, especially, Dakota Fanning is terrific and also contributes greatly to the film. The acting is intense but not too exaggerated.There are, of course, things in this film which could have been better. The biggest drawback is, according to me, that you never get a proper explanation to some key things. I also think that the ending came a bit too quickly as well, even if the end itself is not bad. This pulls down a bit on the grade. But overall, I still think that "Hide and Seek" is really good horror thriller with a lovely creepy feeling constantly present. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies--not all--are like connected links in a chain; if you break one, then the whole movie falls apart. Thrillers are one of those kinds of movies. This movie has two of those when it cannot afford one: (1) If Charlie is Emily's dad and she knows who he is all along, then why doesn't she appear overjoyed to be in Charlie's(her dad: David's) presence when she is pleased with Charlie earlier? She instead acts as if her dad is a her dad rather than a friend. (2) How can Charlie be in Emily's closet when David is in another room when Charlie scares David's girlfriend out the window? Pretty good movie without those SERIOUSLY CRITICAL flaws mucking this one up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hide and Seek is an amazing film that questions the safety and sanctity of family. It follows David Calloway, played by Robert De Niro, and his daughter Emily, Dakota Fanning, who move suddenly after wife and mother Alison, played by Amy Irving, commits suicide. Once they move strange things begin to happen that revolve around Emily. For example, David wakes up at the same time each night, the time his wife died. He found his wife in the bathtub at this time, so every night he wakes up, he goes to the bathroom. Since moving, every time he goes to bathroom at this time, there is writing on the wall in blood and something in the bathtub, like, at one point, a dead cat. He always asks Emily who did it and she always replies, "Charlie". However, no one knows who Charlie is. In the end, we find out that David is Charlie and that David has a multiple personality disorder. The cast of this move is phenomenal. For being so young, Fanning does a phenomenal job at portraying this girl who is so lost and confused. She has no idea what to do because her dad is two different people. She does a great job at showing the stress this puts her under. De Niro also has a stunning performance. Waking up night after night to horrific scenes in the bathroom must be terrifying and De Niro does a perfect job at exemplifying that.The editing in this movie makes it obvious to the watcher that De Niro is Charlie if you re-watch the film. In one scene, David puts a tea kettle on the stove and walks away from it. He goes to his office when he hears Emily yell. He walks back into the kitchen and his tea kettle is overflowing and boiling over. David had only put the tea kettle down a few seconds before. He goes up to Emily's room and asks why she yelled. She replies with, "Charlie just left". After re-watching the film, you realize the tea kettle boils over so quickly because David is Charlie. David has no recollection of when he becomes Charlie. This movie is incredibly creepy and dark. It's a favorite of mine because it truly confuses you and makes you think. However, the premise of the movie is a bit of a stretch. It seems strange to think David could commit these terrible acts and not leave any clues behind that it's him. At the end, David realizes he is Charlie and then turns into Charlie. Suddenly, every aspect of David that he had is gone and doesn't come back.Hide and Seek is an incredibly well edited film that offers an original, thought-provoking plot. The editing in this film is phenomenal and adds so much to the story. The performances by the two main characters really makes this story believable. However, the plot itself is a little hard to believe. The plot is supposed to be believable. Instead of a dark, creepy story, sometimes, because of the plot, it becomes comedic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could this film be any more cliché? Hide and Seek is about when a man finds his wife dead in the bathtub at two in the morning on New Year's Day and his ten-year-old girl daughter is traumatised and will not speak.Then we get cliché after cliché for 90 minutes, as well as a stupid and cop-out ending. I will not spoil the ending because I think people should see the stupid ending for themselves. We've seen this stuff before so many times. Schizophrenia has almost become a stock plot for horror films. Gone are the days of vampires and witches. It's all just about mental illness now. And you only have to see 15 minutes of the film to realise this.However, I will at least give them points for trying. They obviously tried very hard to make this a good movie. It just didn't work out. They tried to do a few twists, but they simply did not work.4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hide and Never Seek This Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hide and Seek (2005): Dir: John Polson / Cast: Robert De Niro, Dakota Fanning, Elisabeth Shue, Famke Janssen, Amy Irving: Standard thriller about personality defects. Little Dakota Fanning witnesses her mother's death so her father moves them into a big country house but soon she begins relating to an imaginary friend named Charlie, which disturbs her father when incidents occur. Typical premise is pure formula until reaching the standard violent climax. Director John Polson does well with the plot twists but fails to entertain a screenplay worth them. He is backed with a cast worthy of better material than this. Robert De Niro struggles in helping his daughter dealing with mental and emotional issues. Fanning fares mutual with her blank flat emotion. We understand her trauma plus she is responsible for the few interesting twists. Elisabeth Shue appears as potential romance only. Famke Janssen plays a therapist concern for Fanning. The joke here is that Janssen will eventually have to take on the role of Wonder Woman. Amy Irving is refreshing to see in a key role but more of her would have been nice. She is responsible for a plot turn of sorts whether it matters. The theme of personality defects is hardly the point here. It is a typical dull thriller with good actors set against material that earns them little or no recognition. The screenwriter should hide and seek a better screenplay. Score: 2 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Enjoyable De Niro Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this isn't one of De Niro's best movies, it's definitely not his worst either. I've seen reviews saying that Hide &amp; Seek was the "lowest point of De Niro's career" and "De Niro done OK with a terrible script". This is, on both counts, absolute rubbish, because De Niro, along with Dakota Fanning, do a good job with a decent story. Hide &amp; Seek is not a supernatural type of movie either, so if you are expecting a movie of that genre then you'll be sorely disappointed. It's a psychological thriller, and a pretty decent one at that, even if the 1st hour is a bit slow, but thankfully the last 30 minutes or so makes up for it.The story is about a widowed father, David Callaway (De Niro), and his daughter, Emily (Fanning), who move to a secluded house in a small town after the death of David's wife. Emily is understandably withdrawn after her mother's death, and in time she starts spending time with an imaginary friend called Charlie. However, David becomes more concerned for his daughter when she starts blaming horrible incidents that are happening around the house on Charlie. Soon David learns that Charlie may not just be a figment of Emily's imagination after all, and he has to try and find away of figuring out the mystery.Like I said earlier, the story is a pretty decent one and is not anywhere near as bad as people make it out to be. There is a good amount of tension and suspense throughout...especially in the last 30 minutes where everything starts coming to a head, along with a pretty good twist to boot, which, when you watch it, is actually quite an ironic twist considering.Whether you're a fan of De Niro, good psychological thrillers, or both, Hide &amp; Seek is a very decent film and is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a particular fan of horror films, but this one starred Robert De Niro so I thought I'd give it a go. This is horror, mixed with suspense.The minute I saw that these people had a cat I thought this was going to be one cliché after another.The story is, an unhappy woman (Amy Irving) kills herself, leaving behind her husband and her beloved daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning). The father David is a psychologist and decides the best thing to do is to move upstate to a quieter setting with no reminders of their past lives.Emily is sullen and quiet and exhibits disturbing traits: an imaginary friend, not so disturbing in itself, but this friend is destructive, leaving some mean lipstick messages on the walls. Emily mangles a visitor's doll, openly resents a new friend of David's (Elizabeth Shue), destroys one of her own beloved dolls, and horrible drawings begin to appear. David half-believes Charlie exists and becomes suspicious of the next door neighbor, for one.What saved this film from being a run of the mill horror film was the ending, which was actually pretty good. The DVD I had also showed some of the alternate endings. The theatrical one for me is the best, though I think they're all making the same point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert De Niro takes his daughter, Dakota Fanning, away after the trauma of his wife's death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked "Hide and Seek". Not having seen a ton of scare horror movies, the story was fresh to me. The movie has horror trappings, but since there is no supernatural in it, it's really not a horror movie. It's more a psychological suspense movie that becomes a mystery as it proceeds. I see it as more in the neo-noir vein, like "Shutter Island".The story is logical, once one sees it through to the end. The acting is excellent, especially the two leads, Robert De Niro and his daughter, Dakota Fanning. She's an unbelievable actress for a girl her age in this movie.De Niro is a psychologist whose wife he finds dead in the bathtub, an apparent suicide. His young daughter sees him with the dead woman. She's quite traumatized. He takes her upstate for a new start and surroundings. She develops a friendship with a mystery figure named Charlie, whom we do not see. But worse things are going to happen.Not a deep story, this is an "entertainment" and not bad. I'd watch it again for the acting and there is some good staging, closeups and camera work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Evil Imaginary Friend Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Darko, Magic, Dark Water, Imaginary Playmate, these are just a few of the tons of films made over the years featuring malevolent imaginary entities. Hide and Seek is typical. Emily, played by the overused and rather annoying actress Dakota Fanning, is a little girl whose mom just committed suicide. Her dad decides to move with her out of the city to a country home. Emily tells her dad about Charlie, an imaginary friend she has created. As it so happens Charlie isn't just an imaginary friend.Typical.I have an imaginary friend; movies that portray them as signs of insanity annoy me because it really isn't true. Mind you it is a fictional movie, a horror movie no less. Still, it'd be a lot better if it didn't have Dakota Fanning in it. Just like the child actresses Chloe Moretz and Drew Barrymore, Dakota Fanning is used way too much in too many movies, is not a very good actress and is kind of annoying. It makes the movie less believable to see the same girl as you see in tons of movies. If you're bored and like a basic horror movie then you might like this one, but it isn't a very good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HIDE AND SEEK is a creepy psychological horror starring Robert De Niro, cast against type as a psychologist and family man, who goes to live in a new rural home along with his daughter Dakota Fanning after his wife's tragic suicide.The film has much in common with the current run of haunted house flicks like SINISTER and MAMA, in that it focus exclusively on building a tense atmosphere with suggestions of the supernatural. You can tell through the presence of muddled flashbacks that there's going to be a twist at the climax, and sure enough in the last half hour things go in a very different (and, it has to be said, disappointing) direction. The reason for the disappointment? It all gets very over the top and Hollywood-ised, in the worst way.Until that point, the film isn't bad, but it is a bit dull. De Niro is at his best when he plays angry or psychotic, but his character is rather dull here for the most part. He's still the best thing in it, however. I found the casting of Dakota Fanning a real mis-step, given that she fails to elicit the least bit of sympathy for her irritating character. The supporting cast are quite good, including a strong Famke Janssen, an almost unrecognisable Amy Irving (from CARRIE) and a youthful-looking Elizabeth Shue. But it's not enough to change HIDE AND SEEK from being anything but a distinctly average movie.</fullReview>

His daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) is suffering from the shock of seeing her dead body and they move to Woodland in upstate NY. Emily starts talking to an imaginary friend named Charlie.

Katherine (Famke Janssen) is the doctor friend from NYC. Dylan Baker plays Sheriff Hafferty.This movie moves far too slowly for far too long. It has a bit of moody atmosphere but the movie tries to stretch it out. There isn't anything scary for that long stretch. The acting is fine by the outstanding cast, and I'm not sure if they could have done anything better. Of course, there is the twist ending. It doesn't really set it up properly, and it feels very jarring. I don't think it's wrong. I just wish that they put down better clues to the twist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dakota Fanning has guided some of the greatest movie stars to successful performances, and here we have her leading DeNiro by the hand through a dark and occasionally disturbing horror tale. DeNiro clearly gets into his role by contemplating the upstageability of Fanning, possibly wondering what he'd done to deserve this particular child.A stranger double act would be hard to imagine, more so because DeNiro is clearly old enough to be Fanning's grandfather, yet somehow that is not really relevant to this tale. DeNiro certainly can do "creepy", and Fanning certainly knows how to play off that. At times it's a contest to see who can be more creepy, albeit in very different ways.Indeed, having watched this movie four times I just realized I may have drawn the wrong conclusions on the first three occasions. I'll leave it to you to decide who is actually the more dangerous person to be around, but frankly I wouldn't want to live within 100 miles of this odd couple.Quite possibly Dakota's finest hour - the subtleties of her performance and the understanding of the story needed for this, are quite remarkable.The suspension of belief needed to accept certain edits and plot twists deny this a 10, but as a piece of contemporary horror it makes for very satisfying almost-edge-of-seat viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Hide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know a horror movie is terrible when you're over an hour into the film and the director still hasn't revealed whether the "killer" is human or supernatural. That's just one of the problems with the dreadful "Hide &amp; Seek," a movie that's as predictable as it is terrible.Not even DeNiro can save a movie full of this many clichés: the zombie child who may or may not be in league with the devil, the creaking staircases, the haunting music box, the red-herring supporting characters, the quaint small town, the chilling voice of a child singing slowly in a minor key: "Hush little baby, don't say a word... Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird..." *shiver* And of course there's the shocking surprise twist ending which you can see coming from the opening sequence.I always try to find something good in every movie, even one this awful, so let's go with Dakota Fanning's incredibly natural and engaging acting. She's one of the few talented child actors who doesn't seem to scream: "Look! I'm a talented child actor!" and I predict a great career ahead of her. Also, this might be a nice movie to watch on late-night TV, when you aren't expecting much of anything. You'll find there's plenty of time to take bathroom breaks, make yourself a sandwich, get married, have children, and you can come back to the film without missing a thing.What more can I say? This is just Bobby D. paying the bills, sleepwalking his way through a by-the-numbers thriller. There are multiple rip-offs of Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining": the opening credit's shot of the car driving up the coast, the red writing on the wall, the child's imaginary friend, the new house, etc. I can't recommend this to anyone for any reason... it's like a horror movie for five year-olds. But they'll be bored too.GRADE: D-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humm... perhaps an attempt to repeat the formula of 'The Sixth Sense'?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's what I thought while watching this film. Now, I had never seen it before and I got to see it because they aired this on TV late at night and I decided to watch it, even though I had no idea of what I was going to see.Although I compared this to 'The Sixth Sense', this comparison may not be of the highest consensus, as this is a more violent and gory film than 'The Sixth Sense'.This story takes place in Upstate New York, a region of New York State north of the core of the New York metropolitan area. It is about psychologist called David Callaway and his daughter Emily and the strange and creepy events that affects them. Emily finds this invisible "friend", someone or something named "Charlie". Things happen soon: bodies in a bathtub full of blood are found, threatening messages written with blood appear written on the respective bathroom, a woman is pushed by "Charlie" out of a window, a neighbor has strange attitudes towards Emily and David even becomes possessed by "Charlie".Although "Charlie" is never seen, "he" is far more sinister precisely because of that. Being invisible makes "him" more unpredictable because you can't tell when "he" is going to do something and what is "he" going to do (something truly evil).It's a dramatic, suspenseful, disturbing and scary movie. Adults can handle its scariness, but I wouldn't ever recommend this for children - it has strong and shocking content for them. Although the film is well made, well acted by the actors (particularly Robert De Niro and a very expressive Dakota Fanning as the main characters) and with some gorgeous cinematography and a very nice house, it's not a great movie. Good but not great. 7 is a fair rating for this film.Still, I am surprised that this was a success at the box office but not so much critically. Apparently many people were displeased with it, although they praised the acting of the actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid and atmospheric, but nothing innovating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a quite watchful and atmospheric psycho thriller (rather than a horror movie) that presents nothing really new but does a quite good job and may not only satisfy the genre fans with its dark vibes and twisted ending. Many critics say that the end is too predictable but that is wrong because even if you get the solution out, you're still left with doubts as there are still many possibilities. The original ending of the movie is the most interesting one while the alternative endings are all very similar and not really as dramatic or dark as expected.Concerning the actors, one has to say that Robert DeNiro is not convincing me at one hundred percent, it is more the young Dakota Fanning who plays her role in an impressive way even if the screenplay for her role is a little bit too much orientated at the genre's classics like "The Exorcist" or "The Amityville Horror". The film, especially the role of Emily, has also some similarities to "The orphanage" but this movie was done two years after this one, so it is clear who inspired who, but as I've seen "The orphanage" before this one, there was a little déj?-vu effect but I have to admit that "Hide and seek" is the better one of the two movies.All in all, this is an interesting and entertaining atmospheric movie with a lot of dark vibes and an interesting twist in the end. It is quite watchful although there are no real new, impressive or innovating elements in this film. A film that you could see and might enjoy for an evening, but clearly not a classic or must have movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro continues his slide into slick, unimportant pictures meant to be commercially viable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young girl in upstate New York, apparently withdrawn after the suicide of her mother, invents an imaginary playmate who goes after the child's psychologist father. Director John Polson immediately sets an artistic yet engrossing mood for this thriller--he has a good eye for small details--but Ari Schlossberg's frivolous, derivative screenplay trips Polson up...right along with a strong cast. Dakota Fanning has a nicely matter-of-fact delivery, precocious but also gravely serious, however she's been directed for an obvious spookiness: wide eyes, indifferent readings, faraway gestures. As for Robert De Niro, we certainly can't expect the great actor to pull out a Travis Bickle or Jake LaMotta every time he's at bat, but this twisty tale leaves him looking faintly ridiculous by the final act (and the women get it even worse). Either Polson or Schlossberg has seen "Fatal Attraction" and "The Shining" too many times; they are positively shameless in their attempts at wringing scares from this scenario, including the old cat-in-the-closet routine. The overall lack of logic and abundance of unpleasantness makes the entire picture seem dreadfully silly. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually when i see a horror movie, they include a blonde woman running around being chased by a psycho killer brandishing a knife, but when i saw Hide And Seek, i was blown away. Robert De Niro was a very convincing single father, and, for once, Dakota Fanning acted out this role properly without moaning.I agree that this was a pleasurable experience that chilled me to the core. This movie is a good watch with great actors including Robert De Niro and Famke Janssen. I recommend it to anyone who is tired of watching a dumb blonde being chased by a psycho killer. But watch out for the ending. It will throw you slightly!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go Play Hide and Seek Instead !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Serious Matters : So the monster this time is the hunter. OK, but that was done without much creativity or attractiveness. I won't say the directing made it decent. I'll say usual. It looked like a TV episode with LONG end (or short idiot slasher movie!). And I was highly shocked when I knew that there were 4, I repeat 4, alternate endings else the one you saw. So they already shot 5 then selected one and put the rest in the DVD! Whether that was their way to sell the DVD or not, both ways it's confusion at its best. I believe at these endings Charlie turns out to be : Steven Seagal hiding from some viewers, the invisible man, George Lazenby and James Stewart's Harvey the bunny!Dakota's Matters : Although (Dakota Fanning)'s performance was creepy for some, but for me she is always creepy ! She took the child out of her character with this absurd performance, looking more like 30-year-old girl who's suffering from existential tedium! So, ultimately, when you re-look to the movie as a whole ? especially after she becomes a child near the end ? you've got to find out that she was the one with the schizophrenia not her father!The Rest's Matters : The music or the sound effects didn't effect. The movie's horror is just very tiny and tame jolts. I thought that declaring the truth about "Charlie" was too early, hence that's why the third act seemed so predictable and cheesy.Naive Matters : OK, so the lead killed his wife then his alter-ego, who did it, is blaming him (for letting her die?) and maybe he's upsetting his life (for giving his wife the motive to cheat on him ?) As you see I'm just guessing because this movie gave any elaboration no enough time (or a time at all!) so we can understand correctly. The character of the neighbor made such a weak thrill. And speaking about naivety I must recall the last shot in which the movie hints that the kid will be as the same as her father (a possible part 2 ?? Well, with anything doesn't have Dakota Fanning you can call me in !). Painful Matters : We all know that De Niro manufactures this popcorn to be present and make a living. But that doesn't mean necessarily making our day! I believe no one earned something out of this movie like this lucky producer who got an extraordinary star for his ordinary flick. (Elisabeth Shue) got no character and did nothing but being killed. Despite I was happy to see her in a role since ages, I felt that something had sucked life out of her.. and that was, after Fanning's performance, the real horror of this movie!Disturbing Matters : in the old horror movies when the lead was having a problem, we needed an intellectual wise man. Then in (The Shining) the intellectual was in question, so we needed a psychiatrist. Now, the psychiatrist is the criminal! That can say a lot about a dreadful, crazy and hopeless world we live in!One Good Matter : it's less predictable than (Secret Window) one year earlier. I can give it that! It's a well-made time to pass. Yes, there are funny details to be tailed in a second watching. But I'll prefer playing a real Hide and Seek than re-watching it again; and that's a Dead Matter !</fullReview>

Sure, is was great in Fight Club. But now I spent 5 movies praying that this time the writers actually thought up their own ending instead of fleeing into plagiarism. So the main character finds out that he himself is and always has been Tyler Durden/ a dead man with a hole in his stomach/ a bunch of people in a motel/ the writer of the mysterious book/ John Turturro wearing a stupid head etc. This isn't exciting anymore, this is cheap, that's all.

		<shortDescription>Overall a good made psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a good psychological thriller/horror. I am giving this movie a B- rating and 6 out of 10. It is definitely a well-made movie so heads up to the director and all the supportive crews. Some scenes of the movie were heart-throbbing. De Niro's acting towards the end of the movie was quite unfitting the Charlie's personality. I was hoping more from De Niro when performing Charlie's character. But again, we don't know if he was told to act that way or it was De Niro's shot. I am satisfied with Dakota's acting because she played her character very well. For the kid, it was a brilliant acting. The sound effects of the movie were good and well suited. However, the concept of Charlie could have been showed more clearly. The way De Niro acting as a Charlie quite confused me first. I definitely think there should have been some clarity with the way Charlie was presented. I would say the ending could have been alternately good. Instead of showing the drawing with 2 heads, something else could have been done to show Charlie's presence (a split personality). At least, I was hoping for something scary in the end. The male neighbor was quite a creepy character. The best shot of the movie was the wife's death in the shower; the way she was presented dead. At last, the best dialogue was the one that Dakota tells De Niro that Charlie could satisfy her mother more than De Niro. It was quite surprising to hear from a little girl Dakota.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dakota the best thing about this lukewarm thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again a thriller with a lot of promise at the start turned out to be a pretty damp squib at the end.I have written a few reviews now and in general try not to give too much of the plot away.Suffice to say that this film is pretty dependant on the twist at the end and I thought it was silly and didn't make much sense at all when you really thought about it.I must say that I pretty much guessed the killer early on,not through any cleverness on my part but just a gut feeling.With the film being so reliant on the twist the fact that it didn't really work spoilt the film somewhat.It isn't all bad though.There is a nice build up of tension through the film and the acting is pretty good.Robert De Nero is OK though he has been much better and the lovely Amy Irving is good but underused as his wife.By far the best thing about this movie is Dakota Fanning who gives a very mature performance as Emily and is convincing throughout.She does seem to have a lot of promise as an actress.To sum up this film,it does have it's moments but is nothing better than pretty average which is a bit of a shame given the fine acting talent on view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best things are the performances of veteran De Niro and his young co-star. But the average viewer can guess the "unexpected twist" long before the ending.However the idea is good and if it renews somehow the dual personality subject.All the credits go to De Niro ,for directing is very conventional,incapable of suggesting "the other"'s presence.The script borrows from too many works from "the others" to "the shining" to "psycho" .Also marred by a bloody ending which is nothing but "Grand Guignol" . The last picture ,in the grand tradition of "it's not over when you think it is " is a daughter's drawing which would like to make us believe that having a split personality is hereditary.Good title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoy almost every film that Robert DeNiro performs in and was surprised at the role he played in this film as David Callaway a child psychologist. This story starts out with a tragic incident that happens to David Callaway's wife and his daughter, Emily, (Dakota Fanning) views this entire horrible scene and is effected mentally and almost goes into a complete coma. David Callaway decides to take her away from New York City and go to a home he purchases in upstate New York in order to give her a new surroundings. Dr. Callaway has help from his local neighbors and especially his acquaintances with Katherine, (Famke Janssen) who is liked by Emily and also a psychologist. This is a good entertaining film, but I did not feel that this was the correct role for Robert DeNiro, I have seen him in much better films and I think he made a bad mistake in starring in this film.</fullReview>

I have seen many of these kinds of movies, but nothing compares to this. To bad they couldn't make a sequel to this, I would have gladly watched, first in line for a ticket, because the end of the movie left room for a sequel, but I am afraid that they aren't going to make one, which troubles me.Definite 8/10, deserves higher, but this mark is good enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain spoilers: Advertized as a supernatural horror movie, this is another film, like First Born, (also with Elizabeth Shue), which turns out to be a psychological drama about the dark side of human nature.Dakota Fanning as usual does a great job acting, De Niro is believable in his role as well. The DVD lists several alternate ending choices. The one I saw finishes the story as it started, as a study of the human mind.I am not a fan of slasher or horror films but have been renting movies like this for their possible supernatural content; psychological thrillers are okay with me, too. It's unfortunate that many movies are being miss marketed, targeting the wrong audiences and therefore not meeting many viewers expectations.Is this movie worth a rental? Yes, especially if you enjoy piecing a movie together before it's done. If parts are a bit slow, there's always fast-forward, a favorite button for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technically "Hide and Seek" is one of the best thriller I've watched,the movie has a classic horror atmosphere right from the beginning,along with the haunting music throughout the movie,which is quite rare and precious while the flooding of vulgar horror films nowadays.Dekoda and Robert gave us excellent performances,bringing the audience into the tension of the movie right away.The movie offered several possibilities of the identity of Charlie,who was Amily's creepy imaginary friend with the habits of recalling the suicide of Amily's mother and suggesting David's faults of his wife's death in dubious manners as well as an inclination of violence.Charlie could be the neighbors,who lost their own daughter and reached out for Emily;or the midnight-key-sending Realtor;or Emily herself.But in the end it was shown to be Emily's dad,who had distinctive double personalities.This brought the climax of the movie,the very people who had been haunting was nobody but the one who was closest to you...however,some audience may be able to predict this ending,which is a flaw of Hide and Seek,also I think the movie needed more description on the characters of their normal life,for the stressing air in the entire movie was a bit boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not entirely predictable, worth an evenings viewing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance Hide and Seek appears to be a rehashed version of Godsend which also features Robert De Niro and a child that freelances as a serial killer. Is the child a killer? Why is he doing this? Is he possessed? Man that kid looks scary and malnourished, etc etc. In addition to looking very similar to the mediocre Godsend, Hide and Seek also deceivingly appears to be a very run of the mill 2nd rate horror movie but actually has some unexpected twists and turns. De Niro is fairly decent as the widowed psychologist attempting to build a new life for his daughter (Dakota Fanning) and himself after his wife's apparent suicide. De Niro probably puts in a better performance than some of his recent roles and continues to possess a significant on screen presence. Dakota is very good in nearly all of her recent performances and is likely to be a major future actress or go the way of most child stars, the Betty Ford Clinic. The pace of the movie is slow but keeps you interested and whilst you are unlikely to be excited or frightened (unless you're female) you will be entertained. Overall, Hide and Seek is not excellent, it's probably not even very good but it is a little different and quite entertaining for an evening's viewing. The DVD also has some decent alternate endings that provide some post movie fun.</fullReview>

Every time you think you have it figured out, it turns around and gives you another point of view. Robert DeNiro is one of the most known actors on the set, Hes getting old but he can still throw those movies out like he records his awesome mob movies, this one is a little different for him.

		<fullReview>This is a brilliant example of a traumatic child's behaviour and the consequences of the pain. Not only speaking of Emily, but her father, David who has probably had a very painful childhood and the consequences of his agony show in his 2 sided personality. It shows how one character completes the other. Some people have the lust to experience something as tragic as killing something living. It was fury that brought him to murdering his wife in the first place. But he was too scared to admit it to himself therefore two, separate, varying personalities occurred in one mind. This is fascinating how scary, yet amazing and in a very frightening way, attractive such a human being can be. Some would simply call it being a phsycopath, but it's so much more that that. It's impossible to describe such a mind with only one word. His actions and thoughts traumatize Emily, because she isn't conscious of the effects of the game might be. She is torn apart and terrified. She tries everything to make her dad realise who, or what he is and what he has done but he never comprehends till the end. We see her drawing at the very end. The gurl has two heads, some could think that the ending is negative, but if you look closely there is a chance that she won't grow up like her father, because both heads are smiling. This is an excellent movie. I can never get enough of it. It's something that each of us need, FEAR. But not the normal fear were you can only see physically murdering action. But the real FRIGHt is when something euphamises tragedy by making a game out of it. This is playing with the mind, emotions..and mocking the most fearful thing. The humans thoughts...because that is one thing in the world, that NO ONE has the power to CONTROL. xxxxxxxxxx</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hide and Seek was made out to be a really bad, predictable, stupid movie by both critics and the moviegoers, so I didn't see it when it came round in theaters. While browsing Blockbuster one day to find something new I decided to take a chance. I brought it home and watched it, and actually really, really liked it.People need to understand this ISN'T a horror movie--this is 100% pure suspense, like the first Alien film. Horror would be a movie like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Saw, Hostel, or Black Christmas. Why? Cause, simply, Hide and Seek isn't scary at all. So hardcore modern-day horror fans aren't going to enjoy it as much.The high point of the film is the acting--sure, Robert DeNiro has seen better days--OK, actually, MUCH better days--but he gives a pretty descent performance in Hide and Seek. But who really steals the show is little Dakota Fanning, who is without question one of today's best in Hollywood. People have told me the best things come in small packages, that's no lie! OK, as I said, it's a suspense film--nothing to really be scared about. It will, however, give you that sense of "eerieness," and it's fun to watch on a big screen in a dark room with surround sound. The surprise ending is sort of predictable, but still surprised me. After you ponder it a little after the movie is over it becomes clearer.Actually, to be honest, I liked Hide and Seek so much the first time around I bought it on DVD on sale for $4.99. A few weeks later I watched it again instead of studying for my history test. Expecting to see the same greatness I saw a few weeks ago, simply, I didn't. Actually, it was horrible the second time around. I kept staring at the screen and asking myself "Is this the same movie I watched a few weeks ago?" And so it ended and I didn't think it was good the second time around--at all! Bottom line: rent it. Invite a bunch of friends over and watch it in a dark room on a big screen with surround sound. Enjoy it and like it as I did. But after that, return it, cause if you see it again you'll be sorry.</fullReview>

I haven't been this excited about a new thriller since Cape Fear; and not because I'm a De Niro fan, either. De Niro and Fanning should be teamed up again in a picture. Although, the father-daughter storyline was a little far-fetched considering De Niro's age. Possibly a grandfather-granddaughter relationship next time. In any case, they pulled off 'Hide and Seek' without a hitch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Robert De Niro biting at every script that's slipped under his door, and precocious youngster Dakota Fanning annoying the p1ss out of me in "War of the Worlds," I had very low expectations for "Hide and Seek," and while the (theatrical) ending degrades the material, I cannot say the build-up isn't worthwhile and effective. For a while, director John Polson kept me (quite literally) on the edge of my seat, and had me thinking he would pull something new out of a genre complacent with familiarity--unfortunately, "Hide and Seek"'s plot springs a leak and becomes obvious at the halfway point. Oh well. While he hardly seems like a psychologist or father at first glance, De Niro settles into his role as a troubled dad who moves with his eerily remote daughter (Fanning) to upstate New York after his wife commits suicide. Soon after, a series of "Omen"-esque accidents begin to occur, coinciding with the appearance of the daughter's imaginary friend 'Charlie.' For a while, "Hide and Seek" has the moody feel of a grown-up "Sixth Sense"--there are genuine shocks and suspense to be found, and our key performers (De Niro and Fanning) are excellent...it's just too bad that the third act betrays their efforts with a 'twist' we've seen one time too many.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As It Should Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite a superb performance from its diminutive star, this potentially spooky effort is never really as good as it should have been. Robert De Niro is David Callaway, a psychologist struggling to raise his troubled young daughter, Emily (played by Dakota Fanning) after the apparent suicide of her mother. He makes the mistake of buying a house out in the country, where increasingly grim and bizarre things occur that Emily blames on her seemingly imaginary friend, Charlie.Part of the problem with "Hide and Seek" is that its buildup is so gradual, there's not much left for the climax. Granted, the ending is clever and keeps the viewer guessing, but this just has the feel of a picture that overstays its welcome. Maybe they'll get it right thirty years from now in the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert De Niro plays David Callaway with his daughter Emily Callaway, played by Dakota Fanning. During New Years Eve, there is a party. Then we see David goes to sleep. We see a hand touch his face, he wakes up, and walks to the bathroom and finds his wife in suicide. The next day, Emily is in a mental hospital and the family decides to move out. During their stay, Emily makes up an "imaginary friend". David meets a nice neighbor that he likes to spend the rest of his life with. Emily's "imaginary friend" starts to kill people. Now we don't know if that person is imaginary or not.The movie starts off with a New Years Eve party. We just see glimpses of it. We see David's wife going somewhere. He follows without telling and the next thin we see is a face touching across his face. We see the black hallway, in which David walks, lighted by light in the bathroom door. He opens it to find his wife committed suicide. He and his daughter moves somewhere and they meet new friends. Even David meets a new woman. Emily doesn't appreciate this because she said that nothing can replace her mom. Then her imaginary friend turns out not too imaginary at all.This movie is thrilling and is the edge-of-your-seats thriller. The performances by De Niro and Fanning are great. John Polson tries to confuse us if the imaginary friend is actually real or not. The tone for this film is dark and dull. There are some clichés in this thriller. This is not a horror film but plays like one. In some parts, it's scary. We think to ourselves that we can solve this mystery all by ourself but misses it and the last few minutes reveal the big "twist" of the imaginary friend.This movie is smart, in the way it plays out. There are suspicions that if a neighbor might be Charlie, the imaginary friend. There are many things that Charlie has done that makes David think that his daughter, actually did them. He doesn't believe whatever Emily says. We go in our mines back and forth to solve this mystery but it doesn't work out.This is a great and suspenseful edge-of-your-seats thriller. It's not a horror film. This film is rated R but I don't know why? It has everything a PG-13 movie needs so I can tell it's a appropriate for children under 17. Watch this movie if you're into mysteries and thrillers but no horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A small chilling little thriller comes out to play...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to viewing this film I heard bad reviews; that it was shoddy, full of clichés and predictable from start to finish. But after visiting the website and seeing about 3 or 4 trailers for the film I figured, yeah, I want to see this film.The film sets around David Callaway's wife committing suicide: slitting her wrists with razors in the bathtub. Their 9-year-old daughter Emily is obviously disturbed by events. Actually, she's more distraught. David moves her to the country in a hope to put the past behind them. Emily ventures on to the woods where she meets Charlie, a friend that David assumes is imaginary. But when mysterious events begin happening Emily seems to be blaming it all on Charlie and is soon to discover he's anything but imaginary? The plot seemed good to me. I have to say, it wasn't all a bad thriller. The opening was okay; slightly weak but a lot of the time you need weak bits so that the horror becomes more horrifying. There were bits I expected to jump at me and they really didn't. Parts of it I felt were well written, with Elisabeth's niece playing with Emily and the "doll" scene. The realism of it is great with Emily's drawings being a key part. Some of it seems a bit repetitive even though that's the concept it all becomes a bit too flawed. Oh yeah and the plot twist?is highly predictable. But that doesn't make it any less frightening. In a thriller you're always led to believe it's someone who it's not and on that mark it really hits it. I was very close to being led astray, which made it even more frightening. There were some frights when the twist occurred with Dakota Fanning's weepy face just adding to the toned dark atmosphere and the words "Hide and Seek" really are etched in the final moments. So who is Charlie? It all becomes clear. Well there have been complaints with the haziness of the film's ending and people not getting it and I did have to get it explained to me. But then I understood it. Oh, and this movie has two endings. Both of them are satisfying even though I've only seen one. There are arguments over which is better but I can't really comment on that.It's not a horror film that will suit everybody. Those of you expecting a gore fest can easily skip this film. It's also not a film that everyone will leave understanding it, and you might need to view this movie several times to clear up certain questions that will no doubt arise after viewing.There are some slight chills even though it is pretty predictable. Oh, and there are some clichés from The Shining (and also the Sixth Sense but I'm unaware because I haven't the slightest clue on what that is about) which is maybe why people hate this film. But if you don't let that get to you it's not all that bad. It's actually quite good. But it really depends what you're comparing it to ? watch it with an open mind and it might just surprise you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) After her moms suicide little Emily Callaway, Dakota Fanning, became so seriously withdrawn into a fantasy world. It was then agreed by her psychologist father David, Robert De Niro,and his former student and children's trauma expert Katherine, Fmake Janssen, that it would be best to get her away from New York City and move to the country for little Emily to recover from the shock that she's suffering from.Right from the start things don't turn out the way David expected for Emily with her becoming more and more withdrawn from reality and into a fantasy world. It's in that world where Emily has this friend that she's involved with in playing games, like hide and seek, name Charlie.Charlie at first seems harmless enough but as things start to happen at the country house that border on insanity and later even cross over to murder the "fictictonal" Charlie is someone that's not at all to be ignored. Emily is soon in danger of being committed to a mental institution for the rest of her life because, or her fantasies, of him.We at first have no idea just who Charlie is and like David and later Katherine we assume that he's only a make believe friend that Emily conjured up. When the family cat and later one of the neighbors Elizabeth, Elisabeth Shue, end up dead and in the bathtub, the same place that David's dead wife was found, it becomes evident that this Charlie is a crazed lunatic on the loose in and around the Woodland Estates where David and Emily are straying at.Were given clues all throughout the movie of Charlie's identity and who's behind his murderous actions with a special focus of the clock, by David's bed, striking 2:06:AM and glimpses of some kind of party that David and his late wife Alison, Amy Irving, attended just before she was found dead from silting her wrists. Were also given to understand that David's next door, and somewhat unstable, neighbors have something to do with the weird and deadly goings on at David and Emily's country home. I's not until the last ten minutes or so in the movie "Hide and Seek" that were exposed to who really Charlie is and why he's doing the terrible things that he does and also why Emily is so terrified of him.Not bad horror mystery thriller that's a lot better then you would have expected it to be with the many negative reviews that the movie "Hide and Seek" got in he press and on TV. Rober De Niro gives a very controlled but effective performance as David Callaway the befuddled father who can't grasp what his young daughter is going through and feels at first that she's the one somehow responsible for the carnage that's been going on in and around the house. Young Dakota Fanning is perfect as Emily who's suffering more from the truth then some fantasy that her father David and his colleague Katherine think that she's having.The next door neighbor Laura and Steven, Melissa Leo &amp; Robert John Bork, are a bit odd who's actions can be explained that their young daughter recently died of cancer and look upon Emily as a replacement for her. But later the two , especially Steven, come across as more then just grieving parents but very unstable and dangerous individuals.The ending though a bit labored does put all the pieces of the puzzle together in just who Charlie is and what's the reason for his actions. With Charlie revealing himself to everyone in the movie but little Emily as the sick depraved and homicidal person that he really is. With Katheine, who Charlie earlier slammed down a flight of stairs, coming to Emily's rescue in a spine-tingling and deadly confrontation with Charlie at a deserted cave. Where he first met and got friendly and involved with the unsuspecting Emily and much later the rest of the unfortunate people that he came in contact with in the film "Hide and Seek".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was alright but nothing special. INteresting premise with a little girl who is traumautized after seeing her mother dead in an apparent suicide. Her father(Deniro) moves her out of the city and finds out she has an imaginary friend named "Charlie." He starts to get worried when she starts to recreate what she saw with her mom in the bathtub blaming him. She says she doenst' do it but her friend Charlie and of course the father doesn't believe her. Then comes the surprise ending which was very surprising but hard to believe. Such as why was she not afraid of her father who is the alter ego "Charlie' when her father is her father and also how did going to the country side bring out this alter ego which I'm assuming came about when he killed his wife.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hide and Seek is a movie you will either love or hate. It was not really scary, and sometimes got too silly to invest in these one dimensional characters, but for the most part, the movie delivers. One reason is about to be 12 year old Dakota Fanning(War of the Worlds, Uptown Girls). The actress gives a chilling performance as troubled Emily Callaway, who after her mothers suicide, goes to live with her dad in a new town where her imaginary friend shows up...scary things begin to occur and the movie really gets going. While the ending is somewhat a washout and too out-of-nowhere, the suspense and acting carries the film. While the so-so ending disappoints, Fanning and De Niro certainly don't. 7/10 C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parallels to The Shining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie for the most part. It had some parallels to The Shining in that the son/daughter had a mysterious friend, who apparently can make things haywire. There was another parallel with the dead women in the bathtub in both movies and the father getting crazy and going after an authority figure with an axe. This movie really kept me on the edge of me seat, and thats why I have to give it a seven. However, I had a hunch about 10-15 prior to the end that David Callaway(De Niro) was going to get killed. However, I thought Emily was going to be the one to kill him, not the lady. I figured Emily was going to stab him in the backside in the cave scene.</fullReview>

The direction and editing were sloppy, and the writing even worse. I watched it because I like the people in it, and kept hoping it would improve. Sadly, it didn't, despite decent performances by Elizabeth Shue and Famke Janssen (sorry if her name is misspelled.)The surprise ending was just plain lame. I think the idea had some merit, but it just wasn't well written or otherwise believable.I recommend watching just about anything else.</fullReview>

Don't read up or have a clue about the film, drop yourself in and enjoy the fear. The premise should of been kept up and down to the wire; right to a finale, that would have seen a 9 or 10, once it hit the knowledge horizon it fell away fast and trickled into a fade. Why people are beating up on DeNiro for this is a puzzle, he did as was required by the part and as for thinking him god like and untouchable so, 'why did he do this': Analyze This??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent thriller redeemed by the cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director of SWIMFAN tries his hand at a psychological thriller with HIDE AND SEEK, about a woman's suicide and the devastating impact it has on her husband and young daughter. The husband (DeNiro) spirits away his kid (Fanning) from Manhattan to upstate New York to try and salvage her. Things do not go well. People and pets start dieing or disappearing, and Fanning seems to have developed an invisible playmate named Charley. The plot is hokey and had been done a hundred times before, but the film is kept from self-destructing by the star power on display here. It is not a cast one normally associates with such B-level fare. A virtually unrecognizable Amy Irving, sporting a head of blonde curls, is DeNiro's distraught wife. The always-lovely Famke Janssen is the kid's shrink. And the fetching Elizabeth Schue plays DeNiro's new love interest. DeNiro is slumming, of course, but if his character had been played by virtually anyone else -- think adequate leading men like Dennis Quaid or Kurt Russell -- you'd have no movie at all. At all. On the DVD, you have a choice of five endings.</fullReview>

I was expecting more, because i was missing DeNiro, but it seems like "disappointment" is the word that describes this film. "Hide and seek" reminds me of "The Others" with Nicole Kidman - there is no action but there is suspense that makes you think at a lot of things, and in the end a stupid idea comes out. Of course there is something interesting in this film. The performance of little Dakota Fanning (Emily Callaway) is extraordinary. I cannot imagine how a 11 year old girl can act as good as her. I surely hope that she will grow to be a first class actress, because we really need some!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, watchable thriller with a surprise ending which feels somewhat squandered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's go straight for the twist, it's good. I didn't guess it at all. Well that's not true, I did guess it, but when you're pointed in every direction then you will end up wondering about every possibility. You see in a thriller that tries to surprise you mis-direction plays a huge part, and in this movie they turn from the traditional idea of taking you in one direction only to whip you back in the opposite direction. What they do is not to take you away in one direction, they point you in just about every possible one so you have no idea which could be right.I loved this. It's very clever. The hints are gone and you're left totally guessing. Yet it did have a negative affect. When the revelation comes there's not a big moment of surprise, and I think it's because you've not been led too far from the truth, because you're pointed in multiple directions you haven't been taken that far away to be whipped back to the surprise.There's also a bit of confusion in the moments of that revelation too, visually it's not clear enough until the final moment, I do feel that (without giving it away) if they'd film it a bit more open and recognisable you would have had a much longer time of the surprise than the short moment that you end up with.The ending though is intense, the final scenes with the girl and the flashing torch really did get to me, it was one of these scenes I'll bring up when I'm asked about the creepiest moments in cinema.There are a number of stars in it, another nice misdirection ploy. Fanning is stunning in this movie. She gives a performance that I've rarely seen in adult actors. Totally unnerving and amazingly creepy.I haven't found De Niro a convincing actor in a long time, and not belonging in the class that he has been placed in on the merit of his previous work. Now this is my view, yours may differ, but in this movie although he does give a good performance, it's not to the level of Fanning. There's a degree of distance about the character De Niro plays, and he seems inaccessible, a problem I feel when he's playing a Father.Janssen is absolutely gorgeous, and to boot she's the second best actor in the movie. Her portrayal of fear is utterly convincing, and she shows without a doubt she's much more than an X-Woman. Shue is another beautiful actress, but unfortunately she is very under used and her character unexplored. It does feel as though she's added for a simple plot vehicle, this too can be said for the equally strong performance of Baker, another missed performance.The rest of the movie is set at a really good pace, although at times it seems against the building of the story and some of the characters. Yet the pace keeps up and doesn't give you either time to settle with a possible suspect or to settle at all. You're continually questioned and fooled, and all the time the movie is reeling you in step by step.Picture: 2.40:1 - There's a slightly off green tinge to the picture throughout the movie, something that at times is quite distracting. Forgetting this the picture is sharp and the colours strong and autumnal, and particularly well done during the night time scenes outside. Audio: DD5.1 \ DTS - The DTS soundtrack is very sharp, and one would expect that it could easily be overused, however it's not. It's very subtle but the audio does make use of the full range of the speakers to help in unnerving the audience.Extras Presented: Alternative endings, Audio commentary, Making of, deleted scenes with commentary, pre-visualisation sequences and commentary - The alternative endings are very interesting, and more-so because I thought the perfect ending for the movie was one of these and not the ending used in the theatrical version. They are all available to watch as a complete movie, or on their own, and each carried with an commentary from the Director, Writer and Director of Photography. It's interesting to hear the makers take on the different endings, and how they can't even agree which is the better. It's interesting that the scene I think is the better ending is the original ending to the movie, but then those dreaded test screenings proved it too dark...wrong.The Commentary itself is good and very incisive, but it's more about the process of how to keep the tension building and the focus away from the revelation. It's really annoying the way they talk over each other and continually say "you know". No, I don't, it's for you to tell me, that's why I'm listening!They talk of the different drafts through the writing and filming process, as well as the actors and their processes. It's very interesting to hear the process of De Niro's acting. However through all this there is a huge feeling that the makers are more concerned about how to create an engaging thriller, and the rules of making a scary, hidden twist of a film. So you do come away with the feeling that they made a perfect, by the numbers thriller, but left out a lot of soul and feeling.Overall- It's a very good thriller with an excellent unseen twist, yet I don't feel it delivered. For all the build up for a moment of realisation just seems a shame. Add to that the fact that one of the poorer endings was chosen for the theatrical movie and the chance of a twist bigger than that of the main movie was missed. A hugely impressive performance from Fanning with some excellent supporting roles makes for a really watchable movie.</fullReview>

But there was not enough (or the right kind) of character and plot development. Then the weak plot just tumbled over one lame cliché after another. The movie maintained a brooding sense throughout, and there were some genuinely suspenseful moments, but eventually it was just disappointing to the point of irritation.A quality, though not stellar, performance by DeNiro.

Especially Dakota Fanning was as usual great in this psychological performance and I am looking forward seeing her in other coming movies. Please go on so, Dakota, you are wonderful. Robert De Niro was also interesting to see and was better than in his last roles. The setting place in the land house was mysterious and created the needed atmosphere.Rating: 6,5/10.

		<fullReview>HIDE AND SEEK (2+ outta 5 stars) Another in a long string of misguided attempts by Robert DeNiro to star in a box office hit. As great an actor as he is, why does he have such a hard time picking out decent scripts? Good lord, the man must KNOW what good dialogue sounds like... and I can't imagine what he could have possibly seen in this script that made him go, "Yeah! I need to play this!" He's even out-acted by little Dakota Fanning. (Note to Dakota's parents: I know you must love the money and all, but don't you think the kid needs a holiday? Most people don't have time to *watch* all the movies she's been in lately, much less *act* in them. Give the kid, and US, a break! Thanks.) This may not be his worst movie ever (that would be "Rocky and Bullwinkle") but it's a terribly pedestrian thriller... with another lame "twist" ending. The only reason it came as a surprise to me was that I didn't think they would pick a twist that *obvious*. DeNiro plays a psychologist whose wife's apparent suicide traumatizes their young daughter. He moves them to a remote country house and, faster than you can say "Redrum" creepy things begin to happen. Okay, there was a good scare or two... a creepy, atmospheric build-up to a lame, stupid finale. There are any number of similar movies that are better written or directed than this ("The Sixth Sense", "The Others", "The Innocents") and if I were you I would try and find of them before wasting my time with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing this movie. The synopsis on the box conjured up images of a cross between the Sixth Sense and What Lies Beneath. The movie borrows heavily from both of these titles but sadly, it fails to deliver anywhere near the same suspense, shocks or storyline. Robert DeNiro plays the grieving father, trying to pick up the pieces after his wife's suicide, and Dakota Fanning plays the traumatised daughter. As my summary suggests, the movie starts well with the tension being raised with every mention of the daughter's imaginary friend 'Charlie'. However, the film spirals downward and ends up mimicking a teen slasher movie with DeNiro merely going through the motions. Other, interesting characters are introduced into the movie and are then ignored or killed off. I was also a little bemused by the 'choose your own ending' option for DVD; there were no less than 4 other endings offered! It seems the director may be lacking faith in his original vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing thriller - but definitely not horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Hide and Seek for the second time, things finally began to make sense - mostly because I fell asleep the first time and so missed the big chunk where everything was supposed to come together. Then, at the end of the film, I was so confused I called out to the people in the theatre to see if there really was a different ending (Emily living with Katherine), or if I had just dreamed the first one (with Emily being hospitalised). Turns out I didn't. I'm still confused though. With my unfortunate first-time experience of falling asleep during a movie, I haven't quite perfected the skills on picking up on what's going on. So, I never really understood WHY Emily was in the hospital. Was it because of the traumatic deaths of both parents? Or had she dreamed the whole thing up and was locked away for everyone's safety? Hmmmm... And another thing. Why, oh why, is there so many story lines happening at once and just left there with their tails dragging through the mud? There's the weird couple next door with the 'bad' husband, but they just - stopped. Then there was the landlord/real-estate-man/whoever-he-was-guy, who was outside the door at 3am. And that sheriff was a bit shady too, especially when he gave the ticket and acted all....weird. I got the feeling the Callaway's weren't very welcome in that town.But this thriller, yes, thriller, has its moments. I'm not much of a scary movie person, yet I could watch this movie and jump at a few things, but I got through it and didn't have to sleep with the light on. The first half is really rather good. It creates the suspense really well with so many paths to follow, the problem is it doesn't follow through with them in the second half.It also keeps being tagged horror, but horror fans would know that the horror is about the gore (to HORRIFY), while thrillers are about the suspense, and the unknown. What's NOT seen is more important than what IS. And that's why this film is a thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so this film is pretty confusing to say the least. but there are so many questions left open. can anyone help? 1. why dolls? there are references to dolls through out and the cave is also full of them... what is this about? 2. why did Emily draw herself with 2heads? 3. what was it with the next door neighbours? was there a point in them being in the plot? 4. why was that guy at their house at 2am pushing keys under the door? 5. why was there a bed and a whole bedroom set up in the basement 6. the police officer was walking round the house with his gun (i think) but then when she gets knocked down in the basement by Charlie, she takes the gun out of its pouch thing (i might be wrong about that) 7. what was the point in the cave? who/what did Emily see in the cave for her to be freaked out?I have only watched this movie once so some of my questions may be answered by a repeat viewing... anyone any answers?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dakota Fanning did a great job, the movie was pretty good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The performance from Dakota Fanning was very very good. She is such a talented young actress and i really like watching her. She's really good at acting scared and everything. The movie was good and there were a few parts where i jumped out of my seat. It had a really twisted ending because in the beginning you think that there is like a ghost in the house that she is playing with but it turns out not to be. I think the director and actors did a very good job making the movie. Once again I want to say how great Dakota did, she is just so talented ex specially for being that young. I think its a really great movie and everyone should go see it. Also i don't really understand why its rated R because there is nothing really about it that i think should make it rated R except for some blood and violince but there are a lot of movies out there that are PG-13 and have way more blood and violince. I'm a huge Dakota Fanning fan and I think everyone should really watch her and don't forget to see her next movie starring beside the awesome Tom Cruise in War of the Worlds!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clichéd film with subpar De Niro performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to like Robert DeNiro. He really took risks early in his career, and they have paid off handsomely. He has even done a pretty decent job in mainstream films. Now he must be desperately strapped for cash because he has been taking some bad roles/movies. This is definitely one of them.Spoiler Alert***************** Essentially, if you have seen "Secret Window", with Johnny Depp, then you know the story about this one. Problem is there are several plot holes that screw up this film further, and DeNiro can't really pull off the "split personality" role too well. Admittedly, it is a hard role to play, but it's not an excuse to play it poorly. As for the other roles, Dakota Fanning is decent in the role of DeNiro's daughter, and Elizabeth Shue is adequate as the love interest. The only good actors in this film are Faamke Jaansen, who plays the calm psychologist, and Amy Irving, who is great as the wife. Otherwise, this is a waste of 2 hours, and should be thrown in the trash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have to say i enjoyed this film due to a strong performance by Dakota Fanning and its surprising scary moments. the film did well to grip me to its story and i was left wondering who Charlie was thought-out the whole film. But when you realised that Charlie was in fact David then i was puzzled. i thought that it was a good twisted but the reaction and shock was spoiled due to the fact the film didn't really make sense after knowing this. why would Emily still talk to daivd like her farther when she knows that he killed his wife. also the fact that he appeared to be in different places didn't make sense. he was in the cave with the butterfly when we actually saw him in the house. i understand that the film was trying to involve the audience with the confusion but it just ending up being that it all didn't make sense. i've only seen the one ending to the film so i will have to see the others but overall i did enjoy this film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining vs Hide and Seek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie reminded me of 'The Shining'. Especially the scene where David (de Niro) stood in front of the locked door with his 'little' knife, trying to get into the room to kill Emilie.In 'The Shining' it was Jack Nicholson, who smashed the door with an axe, to get into the bathroom, where his wife and kid were hiding.Especially in this scene it gets very clear, that Jack Nicholson is a better actor than de Niro and that 'The Shining' was a much better movie.Man, can't they afford an axe anymore nowadays ? De Niros attempt to open the door with his knife was really pathetic.All in all I think, that the story behind 'The Shining' was much more believable and therefore frightening.Don't you think so ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting film, though unoriginal. Its more disturbing than the 6th Sense, it relies on the audience empathy with the lead character to legitimize the story. If you're wanting to figure out the movie before it ends, you won't be entertained."Hide and Seek" is like a detective story for the viewer who can resist skipping to the last page. It has clues and well as others purposely false. Granted, I over thought the movie. Watch the wife taking pills. Is she in pain? Is there a jilted lover? Who emotionally suffered worst from the loss of the wife? The ending is a bit long and cliché, so try not to think too much and enjoy the film. Watch the alternate endings on DVD, they're as interesting as the "twist" in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read all the IMDb reviews and forum posts before watching, which is probably why I rate it so much higher than average. I was already spoiled, so the totally predictable and somewhat clichéd ending didn't bug me at all.Anyway, I thought it was great. Since I knew the ending already, I went through the whole movie looking for clues that it would turn out that way. And there were a lot of them. From the first little party segment interspersed before David finds his wife in the bathtub, you know that something's not quite right with him. Then there're all the little foreshadowings: Katherine telling him "Have fun with her; play with her" (when of course that's exactly what he's doing, through Charlie); the tea kettle boiling over after he's been gone for less than a minute; Emily's attempts to warn off the neighbors, through mangling Amy's doll and misbehaving at dinner with Elizabeth; and through hints like the misplaced knife.The one thing that threw me was the timescale: things like David being sitting at his desk when Elizabeth rings the doorbell, and then upstairs playing hide &amp; seek when she walks in the door. But look how quickly the personalities changed in the cave: one moment he's David, one moment he's Charlie. From what little I know of multiple personality disorder, this is typical of the disease. So I think that it's believable, though a little convenient for the plot.Aside from the plot, everything was fantastic. Great cinematography, great acting. Dakota Fanning's performance is particularly good: I'm used to seeing her in cutesy little girl roles (I Am Sam and Man on Fire); it's interesting to see her pull off the disturbed child role so well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i am not one that gets scared over movies often. in fact, i haven't really been scared of a movie since i was in elementary school. however, i love scary movies! i love the feeling of getting scared and / or just laughing at the ones that are horrible. if you feel like actually getting unbelievably creeped out, this movie is the one to get. it's perfect to watch with a group of friends, or by yourself (if you really feel like freaking out). dakota fanning does a wonderful job of being a creepy, severely messed up little kid. that was probably the scariest aspect of the movie. the idea of a child being somewhat psycho is very scary to me. it is not her usual, adorable child movie. also, kudos to robert deniro, who succeeded in being a concerned parent and not playing it off as hilarious, which he sometimes has a tendency to do. it's a very disturbing, creepy movie, unless you were a child like dakota fanning when you were younger, in which case you will probably relate. i wish you the best of luck if you are and hope never to meet up with you. watch this movie, it will leave you completely satisfied in a very unsatisfying way, if you know what i mean. if you don't, you'll find out. it's the definition of the "heebie geebies".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good psychological thriller with great acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was part of a rather new genre of horror. The kind of horror that is more psychological than it is scary, although "Hide &amp; Seek" still has some good scares! The director John Polson had also directed the creepy, teen stalker flick Swimfan.It's hard to say what it is that makes this movie a good scare. It might be because of the superb mix of drama, thriller and horror elements. A thing why all these elements flow so well isn't only thanks to the directing but also due to the acting. Robert DeNiro is excellent as the confused dad, dealing with a traumatic time but real discovery of the movie is of course Dakota Fanning. She is more than just a child actress, she is a real actress! The ending was a little rough though.See this movie for the tension, the drama and acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Given thought it borders on great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was going to give this a five like a number of other reviewers and critics seemingly did. It would have never dipped below because of the superb casting. De Niro and Fanning are phenomenal. They make each other better, rather that conflict with one another. Even Elisabeth Shue is very, very good in her small part. Amy Irving, the mom, is decent, although clearly distant, while Dylan Baker and the guy who sells De Niro's character's David the house, Steven, are both weird, creepy, and coupled with the neighbors, are like suspects in a Scooby Doo cartoon.Unfortunately, I knew the ending already because I had read the spoiler thinking I'd never see this movie. Knowing the ending still did not fix the unnerving and unbelievably chilling moments and feel of this movie. Fanning with her dark hair style like a thirteen year old, mixing with her bugged out seven year-old-like blue eyes is just freaky.At first I just thought the game was overplayed, but then I realized the therapeutic symptoms of it. David's career as a psychologist isn't really explored (in deleted scenes it is) and he doesn't seem to be working after moving his daughter. The move comes after the "suicide" of his wife. The cycle starts in the beginning with an apparently struggling relationship between David and his wife. You'll see what seems to be coming, but you'll also be surprised by its real meaning.The bathtub scenes in the new house are outstanding. How De Niro sleeps there after is beyond me. You walk in to your daughter's room and she's wide awake and bugged eyed, and talking about whom you've perceived as an imaginary friend. It gets worse obviously, but not as you might imagine. By the end of the movie it seems tedious and it becomes clear how it will end.The theatrical version of the movie contains the best ending by far. It's suggestive, yet clear, optimistic, yet alarmingly dark. It's fitting and creepy. Dakota Fanning's tiredness begins to make sense and it is made clearer in the deleted scenes; moreover, the backfill on this story is great. With the exception of Elizabeth Young. I didn't know the relationship between her and David had gone that far, not to mention some things didn't seem entirely congruent.De Niro may have been one of the only actors to pull this role off. He's real, passionate, and a good dad. I believe in earnest that he is trying to help his traumatized daughter. His patience is off-the-wall amazing (the psychologist in him), yet he maintains discipline when raising his daughter. Best of all he doesn't give up hope.I'd love more than anything to break down the "surprise ending" because it is when I feel De Niro is at his subtle best, and Fanning her absolutely most desperate, and it works. Famke Janssen works as Fanning's doctor. She doesn't steal any scene and is such a relaxing presence on screen. She very well-casted as a comforting doctor.You have to look past this movie as a psychological thriller, although there are unresolved issues. It is a movie about putting behind themselves (both David and Emily) a very traumatic past. That is accomplished and it was more of the point of the movie. De Niro at first looks old, but then seems to settle into his role, yet he clashes sometimes with Shue's character. But I love Shue as Elizabeth Young. This character needed to be strong, confident, yet not arrogant, while still being charismatic, and Shue brilliantly displays that. She and David work very well together. Emily on the other hand is clearly going down the path of a death obsessed woman and won't move on. All of these reasons are why the ending and the movie is quite good, and I've given it a more befitting rating.As for the whimper of the end: it's not. As aforementioned it gets tedious and redundant, but it is resolution and it is the full circle coming out of the character. Dakota Fanning is at her best here. She has rediscovered human emotion and reality. There is a lot of foreshadowing because it's a mystery movie, but most of all be prepared to be freaked out; and that is why you'll want the movie to be over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent horror/thriller movie with a pretty good ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pretty good movie; some suspense, action, and horror all in one. A little cheesy at parts, but overall I give it a decent rating. Dakota Fanning adds much feeling and emotion. Robert DeNiro -- well, maybe just not one of his best films. There are things that could have been better, but most of it was up to today's par. The movie's slogan ( Come out, Come out, wherever you are ) is excellent, and it's website is pretty cool.The movie advertises itself as a scary suspense-filled picture. Suspense definitely speaks for itself in this film, but I've without a doubt seen much, much, much scarier movies. Th MPAA gives the movie an R-Rating, but that's a little high. Canada, Australia and other countries gave it their PG-13 type ratings ( 14A, and M 15+ respectively ). I would tend to agree with them; I would unlikely have a problem allowing my thirteen year-olds viewing "Hide and Seek".Overall, I would give this 2005 Release a 7 out of 10 star, a 3 1/2 out of 5 star, and finally ,a 2 1/2 out of four star. "Happy Viewing" as BlockBuster says!</fullReview>

The daughter starts seeing an imaginary friend named Charlie. Is Charlie real or a figment of her imagination? The ending, which I will not reveal, is the least satisfying part of the movie. It goes on like a conventional thriller which we have seen many times before, such as The Shining. Elizabeth Shue is wasted in a role that looks like was more important in an original draft of the script. Famke Janseen comes across better as Fanning's therapist who thinks something is wrong.

		<fullReview>This predictable thriller attempts a Sixth Sense approach to strange happenings. While the movie is consistent, there are apparent gaps in continuity in terms of how a young girl gets so conveniently out of a window, that thrown in cat scenes. The theatrical release version exposes the climax of the movie early in the movie while then having to attempt to scrounge up a satisfactory ending that is typical, however, at least without the usual last scenes from most horror movies. There really isn't anything new in this movie so that the performances are also strained by the lack of novelty. This movie entertainment is more appropriate as a filler for Halloween or something to rent that is interesting but not compelling. *Added comment 3/8/08: The very last shot is actually nice, suggestive of evil but in a much more deliciously sinister way than most endings. The performances by these talented actors appear more likely strained by the script than by their abilities.*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dull and generic horror film is amplified by the performances of Fanning and De Niro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Emily Callaway (Dakota Fanning) is a young girl whose games with her imaginary friend Charlie quickly turn deadly as they dispose of anyone who questions his existence. It's even more troubling for her widowed father, played by Robert De Niro, who thinks Charlie may have something to do with the death of his wife.Hide and Seek is yet another generic horror film that offers nothing new to the audience. Despite an impressive cast and a decent premise, the film is very weak. It isn't scary nor is it creative. It's your typical horror film with all the clichés but without an ounce of originality. There are some good things about the movie though. The atmosphere is mildly creepy and effective. The acting is also pretty good and it saves the film from being completely bad. Even though this is clearly a paycheck movie, Robert De Niro still gives a good performance. He really needs to start picking better scripts though. Before, his name meant quality but after this and Godsend, I'm going to have to start approaching his new films with caution.Unsurprisingly, Dakota Fanning is able to keep up with De Niro and she gives a pretty good performance. She is creepy and she doesn't go over the top unlike her performance in War of the Worlds. Elizabeth Shue gives a rather poor performance and she brings down the film every time she's on screen. Famke Janssen isn't really in the film for very long and she only gives an average performance. John Polson does an okay job at directing and he manages to create a couple of suspenseful moments.He also does a good job with characters. In horror films, character development doesn't really exist but he actually makes the characters somewhat developed and interesting. Besides for that, everything else he does is on the weak side. The pacing is really sluggish and the movie becomes dull at times. Also, most of the scares are predictable and most of them fall flat. He also picks the wrong ending. The conclusion is so unoriginal and completely stupid. It ruins the film and the "twist" is obvious right from the start. The alternate endings on the DVD aren't any better either and this whole film is pretty much a disappointment. In the end, Hide and Seek offers a couple of an engaging performances but not even that can save the film. Rating 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad, but not because it's predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so everyone has agreed that this movie is predictable. But that's not what made this movie so terrible. It was the horrible padding of the film. The slow, staggered dialogue between Emily and anyone else, at first was meant to build suspense and give the inclination that this is really a disturbed individual. It succeeded in this simple task. But after the 15th time someone (usually Dad or Elizabeth) conversed with her, you knew before the conversation started you would have only a tidbit more of information after the conversation than you did before. And yet you had to sit through 5 minutes of terribly boring dialogue (or should I say monologue?) while the father plays 20 questions with her. Once the father would sit down with her he'd barrage her with question after question, never giving her time to respond, thus dragging out (padding) and causing us more pain. This movie just plain hurt to watch. I suppose for those intellectuals out there this is a good movie if you like to spend most of you time in the theaters pondering the ways of the universe as you don't need to pay attention to 40 minutes of it. I go to be entertained, which this movie did not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not your average childhood game. Pure knuckle cracker and mind bender. David Callaway(Robert De Niro)is an established psychologist who awakens in the wee hours of the morning and finds his wife dead in a bathtub full of blood. At the door watching this discovery is daughter Emily(Dakota Fanning). In order to cope with Emily's trauma, David moves to a reclusive wooded community where Emily creates an imaginary friend named Charlie. Some real strange and horrific events begin happening throwing doubt on Charlie being imaginary. Great nail biting twist ending. (The DVD includes four alternate endings.) The cast is filled out with Amy Irving playing David's wife Alison, Famke Janssen as co-worker Katherine; and a new friend Elisabeth Shue. De Niro is in top form and Miss Fanning is superb. HIDE AND SEEK is good enough to tell your friends about and watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>POSSIBLE SPOILERS...Some scary moments, but too much is borrowed from other thrillers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midway through, HIDE AND SEEK starts to lose whatever credibility it may have had. By the time we understand just what's going on, we have to struggle with the fact that it just doesn't make sense. And we do struggle because up until then, it's a pretty scary film, chock full of good, eerie performances from all concerned.Especially good at maintaining the creepiness is Dakota Fanning, a girl who would be perfect for a remake of THE INNOCENTS. She is the main focal point of the whole story and keeps the audience drawn to her frightened, withdrawn girl who has suffered a traumatic experience. Equally effective is Robert DiNiro as the psychologist father who takes his girl to the country, away from the scene of the brutal murder of his wife. His scenes with Dakota are fascinating to watch.But, alas, the viewer has a right to feel cheated by the time revelations are made with nary a clue as to the real Charlie. The script seems to be borrowing heavily from other recent thrillers like SECRET WINDOW, with hardly a trace of a clue that would make sense of the outcome. Those who claim to have guessed the answer early on must be bluffing.Horror fans will find some of it quite riveting. The decor for the house in the country gives the film some choice atmospheric moments and the cinematography is, at all times, very effective. Dakota Fanning gives a memorable performance, but seems to be a girl who ought to be slapped out of her silent state by her father once in awhile instead of being treated so gingerly by the seemingly patient man. Her character has a tendency to become more than slightly annoying at times.And surely, there are those in the audience who will feel cheated by the ending--and slightly annoyed, as well.</fullReview>

Hide and Seek is about David (de Niro) and his daughter Emily (Fanning) move to the country to start a new life after David's wife kills herself. This movie to me just seems like Secert Window but not as good. Hide and Seek is similar to Secret Window that seeing the same things done again just doesn't cut it. Hide and Seek takes awhile to get into the suspense 1hr and 8min if i can remember it correctly. Don't get me wrong its an OK movie but if you saw Secret Window you would probably enjoy that better because Hide and Seek is particularly the same. I was really looking forward to this film but it was disappointing, overall if you haven't seen Secret Window watch Hide and Seek you might like it but if you saw it i wouldn't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what a disappointment this movie was. Hyped up as a supernatural thriller, it was anything but! All the initial good work of the first two-thirds of the movie destroyed by an unoriginal, overused so called "twist". For me the movie was never going to be excellent but I was reasonably entertained until the "twist". Once revealed, the movie lost all its tension and thrills. From then on I simply didn't care. The four "alternate" endings were nothing special and were all pretty unsatisfying. Anyone of them could have been substituted for the original and it still wouldn't make a difference to the overall movie since they are all pretty much the same. Probably the only redeeming feature of this movie was the acting, which was uniformly excellent. It's a pity that it's wasted in this B-Grade thriller in disguise!</fullReview>

Unfortunately those days are probably over (in general really).This film is still a worthy watch, it's a popcorn thriller with a few good moments. It's not a classic but it's not as bad as it's made out as being. It is getting a lot of flack because De Niro is in it and it doesn't measure to all his previous films.Worth renting for sure! Don;t want to give anything away but don;t go in expecting a brilliant movie and you won't be disappointed.Personally I gave it 7/10 - good for one watch but not a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie ... but the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot say that this is a horror movie. It's more like a thriller and is very similar to White Noise. Pretty intense and scary at some points(not like The Amytiville Horror though) the movie per ensemble is good but the one thing that matters the most(in my opinion) - the ending - is poor and even predictable. I really dunno why people are saying that this is a horror movie. Maybe for a 13 year old. If you liked White Noise you can try this one too because I'm sure you'll find it pretty interesting ... The plot is pretty OK and the acting (specially the little girl) is very good !Robert de Niro does a great job again! Overall I'll give it a 7/10. Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Worth Seeking Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great success of "The Sixth Sense" seems to have made a lot of producers think that a horror movie just isn't a horror movie unless there's one hell of a twist. However the surprise ending in "Hide and Seek" does nothing but sabotage what could have been a decent, if conventional enough, ghost story. The only reason to see these movie is Dakota Fanning, who is made up to have an ethereal, yet somehow unsettling prettiness that is perfect for her part--she's like a Victorian wax doll that's been kept in an trunk for years. De Niro is okay as the rumpled-bear father, but this is a role that a dozen other actors could have played. The assorted creepy small towners turn out to have nothing to do with the story and were probably just included to add some Fargo-like local colour. And poor Elizabeth Shue adds nothing but her cleavage.If you like stories about haunted children, see "The Others" or read "The Turn of the Screw" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's the matter with Hollywood these days. They can't seem to deliver any decent horror movies these days. I watched Ring 2 last week and was really disappointed even though I thought that the original was a bomb. Anyways to discuss this movie, it is basically a rip-off of such flicks as "6th sense", "The Others" and "Secret Window". I suspect that there may be more to this list; it only shows how lacking originality seems to be. Come on this concept of having the protagonist not be aware of who he/she really is until the end of the movie is getting old. It don't matter if the protagonist is a ghost or suffers from multiple-personality disorder, it has the same effect on the viewers. Another thing I found disturbing is how a great actor like Robert DeNiro is taking on roles that don't suit him. Come on man, you should convince yourself that you are only suited for mafia and tough guy roles, you are only fooling yourself if you can think that you can take on comic roles as in "Meet the Fockers" or dramatic roles as in this sorry flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Horror movie with a common ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If directed well, movie would have been rated as a decent Horror flick. Of late we witnessed the trend of last minute revelation of suspense and this movie is no exception for that.From the very beginning you will start feeling déj? vu. You brain searches for the character Charlie, if you are a familiar with horror movie endings stay awake to see the climax and to know the Charlie. To mislead you, bunch of characters will be knocking your brain cells. Dakota Fanning acted exceptionally well with the legendary Robert De Niro. Few scenes are spine chilling. My friend watched this movie covering his eyes. Besides, there is not much in the movie. I still suggest this movie for one time watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A psychiatrist (DeNiro), haunted by the recent death of his wife, relocates upstate with his daughter (Fanning) to an ominously silent rural neighbourhood. Hide and Seek is standard horror fare and delivers few decent chills. The backwoods setting is suitably creepy and the new neighbours provide a subtle bad vibe without going overboard. But the few other townspeople we meet are simply ridiculous, including DeNiro's cardboard love interest and the dimmest police officer since the Blob.Violence and gore are surprisingly scarce for an R-rated horror film. Fox delayed shipment of the last reel to prevent spoilers. If only they'd been prevented from spoiling the promising setup with a mediocre movie. A few halfhearted stabs at black humour also fall flat. Horror fans might make a game of predicting all the major plot points ahead of time. Unfortunately that leads to a tedious wait to see every one of those predictions proved right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"David?"---"No, Charlie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the first, very long, ten minutes of the film were going by, and I was watching one door nearly closed that let light through, and a man entering to the room that door directed to, and a bath full of blood, I though: Why do they always use the bathrooms for these movies?. A friend who was sitting next to me told me: "It is sexy place for horror movies". I don't know what was he thinking but, sexy or not, I got tired of watching bathrooms in "Hide and Seek".The plot (you must know it) is quite simple and very repetitive, with the same sequences that you know you won't find out how they end until the last minutes of the film. I must say I jumped off my seat once, but because of the music. It is the sounds that the movie plays that make you jump, not the directing, which is regular. Polson couldn't find the note for the camera here, I realized because I had seen "Swimfan"; and I didn't like it, but the use of the camera was very good. The writing, with the psychology things and the dramatic moments, didn't work at all.I must say that it was kind of funny for me in some parts. This is because I have been laughing about the name Charlie for some weeks. I don't know, it's the sound of the name what's funny; but hearing it on the movie was as funny as when I hear it every day. Interesting experience for that matter.Actors are always the ones who can save these films from awfulness. Directors can too, but Polson failed the test. Robert De Niro (David) was cast as the main star of the film, and his is the only name we see on the advertisers. He should be ashamed of it. I thought he would hold on before the "acting for the cash", but he couldn't wait too long. I can't see his interest in a film like this one. For our luck, De Niro gets the cash, but he gives us the acting. The situation I'm talking about is happening with actors we're familiar with; Al Pacino and some films he's been doing is the perfect example. De Niro understood David and he played it, not at his best, but with what the role required.Now Dakota Fanning (Emily) hasn't been in the best movies during her short career, but I'm sure her agent has a very good eye about choosing the films that highlight Dakota's gifts as an actress. Her role is easily the film's highlight (I was talking about that). Her faces, way of talking and her movements were precise (although the fact of saying "daddy" in that tone all the time disturbed me a little; but that's maybe because I saw "The Ring Two" some weeks ago, and the kid was calling her mother by her name: weird). Elisabeth Shue (Elizabeth) was a nice touch for the class while Amy Irving (Alison) and Famke Janssen (Katherine) were underused in their short parts. Did I forget about Dylan Baker? Well, he sucks...Outstandingly. The twist that always arrives at the end of these movies, is not absent in "Hide and Seek". Although it seems the screenwriter wrote all the movie and when he reached the end, he thought about "the twist". His decision didn't have to make sense with the rest of the film. It didn't matter if some people in the audience realized it was all wrong. He knew it had to be a revelation that would shock them all, no matter what. The team would later find the way of putting it in the movie somehow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the subject of schizophrenia(dual personality) is not new in the film industry, this film stands apart.Robert De Niro and Dakota Fanning were their usual best in this film.Location wise, this film reminds me of The Village.Some scenes in this film are pretty scary, I must admit. Some improvements which could have been done were I guess the number of "suspicious" characters in the film. Clearly, it has only a few suspicious looking characters in the film. The neighbour turned out to be good, but the fact is that you can't suspect a person unless he's involved in some past events. And then, with a house left with only two members, one could conclude that the problem was with either Emily or her father, and that one of them could be schizophrenic. At the end, it turns out both are schizophrenic :) Clearly, the dad is the primary suspect since a child is less capable of attempting feats like throwing Elizabeth out of the window (and she was also standing besides her). Still, the movie feels good and I would like to rate it as 7/10.P.S: People who are interested in multiple personalities should watch Identity.</fullReview>

Agreed, the acting is patchy in places and it does bare a striking (Excuse the pun) resemblance to The Shining and you can see the so-called scary bits coming thanks to the badly used mood music. As for the acting, I think Dakota Fanning was unmatched through out. She did a good job creating some fairly chilling moments and in places I think she made De Neiro look like a novice.I'm undecided as to how I'd recommend this film, I'm tempted to see it again to watch it from a technical point of view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HIDE AND SEEK made for an entertaining 120 minutes at my local theater, but that's as interesting as it gets. HIDE AND SEEK tells the story of a Psychologist (Robert De Niro) who has lost his wife in what "appears" to be a suicide. He finds her in the bath tub filled with blood stained water and while he is crying and holding her, his little daughter watches from behind in distress. Needless to say, the little girl goes into a sort of a trauma, so his dad decides to move to upstate New York to sort things out and maybe even plan to start all over again. It's when this dad and daughter couple arrive to a small upstate town that weird things start to happen. The little girl these weird happenings to an "imaginary" friend called 'Charlie'. Through out the film, the audience is led to believe that this little traumatized girl is responsible for the things 'Charlie" does. The weird things turn into nasty pranks and then into the inevitable murders of some of the people in the area. HIDE AND SEEK has a nice disturbing mood, but it starts out at a very slow pace and it's only in the end that it picks up. For some reason, the movie didn't grab me nor did it scared me. It was interesting to watch the events unfold, but there was just "something" in De Niro's performance that didn't click. Perhaps it's because of his more than stellar curriculum and stuff like HIDE AND SEEK is simply not up to his standard. Elisabeth Shue's character could've been played by anyone, really as well as other minor character's. This movie is Dakota Fanning's (MAN ON FIRE) show all the way. She plays the little disturbed girl and I'm just waiting to see what this little kid will be like in ten years! She is definitely Oscar material. HIDE AND SEEK is not a bad movie at all. I just found it average, even with its "plot twist" in the end. A lot of movies now a days are actually abusing that "plot twist in the end" (shades of SHAYAMALAN?). I just hope it doesn't wear thin fast!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now we all know that trailers are only part of the story; rarely the actual story, right? So I fell for this. It looked like a good spooky ghost film. SPOILERS FOLLOW..........Seeing that trailer, you might guess that Charlie is perhaps the neighbour's dead kid's ghost or something? No. Far more mundane. And disappointing too.OK, so you DO go... "Ohhhh.... right!" as the major revelation occurs, but then you just plod about for 15 mins, awaiting the inevitable.The final twist remains the best treat of the film, however, albeit a very tame and predictable one.My point is? When I go to see a ghost/horror flick, that EXACTLY what I want. I don't want to see it all rationally explained away by madness.That's a ruination of a good premise. And a waste of my time.Did I enjoy it? Sort of.Did I feel cheated? You betcha!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ I'm just going to jump right in to the spoilers on this one. I'm so sick of the big twist ending. So, get ready for mediocrity, Deniro is the killer! Bum, bum, bum. Yeah, it's one of those split personality deals that we've seen way too many times now. In Fight Club, it was great. In Secret Window, it was just okay. In Hide and Seek, it's sad. The worst part is, this was shaping up to be quite the genre effort before the big "reveal." Deniro's wife (played by Amy Irving) seemingly slits her wrists and leaves no clues as to why. So Deniro takes his much disturbed daughter (Dakota Fanning) to a quiet place in the country to start a new life. Things are not peaceful for long. Fanning develops an imaginary friend named Charlie and weird occurrences start happening. I was really enjoying the film. It was building a nice creepy atmosphere, Dakota Fanning was proving to be quite the little actress, and Deniro was making up for last year's abomination Godsend. Then it p*sses everything away by saying Deniro is himself the Charlie character. The funny thing about the movie is that there are so many red herrings that they could have come up with a better way to explain Charlie. It's truly upsetting. Perhaps Deniro should just give up on the horror genre. The supporting cast includes Famke Jannsen, Elizabeth Shue, and Robert John Burke, who are all pretty much wasted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film at a small 'Local' cinema after seeing a barrage of adverts and trailers for it and reading information about how the ending reel was shipped, and therefore expected a good twist and amazing ending.Alas... I was duped as were many I feel by this rip off of various other films.the film takes you through the life of a father and daughter as they deal with the death (suicide) of their mother and move to the sticks. the story itself is good... well.. It should be as it has been done to death many times before.You get a general feel that the film will take a supernatural twist right from the word go with the spooky and rather eerie intro sequence and titles.. yet again then was a lie.I found myself knowing the ending of the film far too early which left me only with the acting to keep me interested in the rest of the movie, which was good in general if not a little convoluded at times and predictable.The young girl was fantastic and I am sure she will go on to do more involved story lines and plots as she gets older.Watch out for the '6th Sense' rip off near the end of the film, done with the tact and care of a beartrap.All in all the film is good, but was capable of so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilly but predictable Hollywood Horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leaving aside the stalwart performance of De Niro as the late middle-aged psychologist and the quite astounding breadth of performance of Dakota Fanning as his young daughter, it seems that Hollywood has become stuck on one predictable twist.If you don't want to know what that is then stop reading now.Recently 'Identity' did it far better, and 'Secret Window' didn't do it as well. I am of course talking about the denouément where the protagonist suddenly realises he's the antagonist (i.e. the hero realises it's been him all along who's been murdering people!) 'Angel Heart' was the first i'd seen of these and is still the best. 'Identity' added a twist of multiple personas, even 'Sixth Sense' had similarities but added to the formula. However I was disappointed enough with 'Secret Window' let alone to have the same storyline fed back to me barely 12 months later.What is this recent obsession with the unwitting schizophrenics? Please Hollywood - find another script idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Draw your own conclusions...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see the preview to 'Hide and Seek,' you immediately think of 'The Sixth Sense,' or 'The Ring.' Essentially any movie that crosses your mind that creates a creepy atmosphere that sets the movie. This movie doesn't do that entirely, or create the right effect it needs to. 'Hide and Seek' is about a dangerous game of cat and mouse that weighs the weight of the world on one person: Dakota Fanning. Since everyone plays their part to the best of their ability, the movie sets the tone around the young actress, who is the protagonist, and banks everything on her. What you think of her performance? Well, you have to see the movie for yourself to decide.After her mother commits suicide, Emily and her father move upstate to start a new life. But Emily sees something in Charlie, and who that is, is what starts the game of hide and seek.De Niro is such an accomplished actor, and if you look at this movie in hindsight, or in second viewing, you can tell that him and the actors did a perfect job in their characters. The movie is stale in its writing and direction. They give too many hints. The writing is too slow and that's where 'Hide and Seek' failed. Anyhow, the real reason to watch this movie is to see the future star in Dakota Fanning, who we will see later this year as the daughter of Tom Cruise in 'War of the Worlds.' Hollywood has been putting her in experienced hands lately and there is nowhere for this starlet to go but up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the suicide of his wife, New York psychologist David Callaway (ROBERT DE NIRO), takes his traumatised little daughter Emily (DAKOTA FANNING) to a rural area up state with the belief that new surroundings will cure her. However, she starts to have an imaginary friend called Charlie, which results in horrific things happening such as the cat being drowned in the bath tub and a neighbour being murdered because the imaginary friend is possessive of Emily's friendship. David is convinced that his daughter is in a very bad condition but isn't sure how to cure her.HIDE AND SEEK is the latest offering of Hollywood horror and since it's release in the UK, it has received unfavourable reviews from the critics. Agreeably, the picture begins slowly and predictably but it actually does pick up speed and resource in the last hour and delivers its quota of routine shocks and shudders that will make audiences jump out of their seat although it is ultimately tame compared to most modern day horrors rather like THE GRUDGE was last year. All in all, HIDE AND SEEK is nothing new, but you will get some amusement out of it. The acting isn't anything to right home about, but Robert De Niro and Dakota Fanning play their roles with a high level of competence and the rest of the cast play their roles with a commendably straight face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of bad reviews for this movie, so after seeing it last week (and enjoying it) I thought I'd offer my comments too.The film begins rapidly, setting up a pace and making it clear what kind of film this is: thriller/horror. This is not the best by all means in its genre; it has sometimes blatantly stolen ideas from other films (i.e: The Shining) and although I was aware of this I still enjoyed the film. The twist at the end is not particularly shocking, and not very well explained (there are a few plot holes which are left dangling). However, if you are a fan of thrillers I would definitely watch this one. Yes, it is full of clichés, and yes it is ultimately very predictable, but this does not detract from the enjoyable elements. Even though I could guess what would happen, I still jumped at certain points, and would definitely not choose to watch this alone!The actors make the best of the situation - Dakota Fanning is very good for someone so young, acting the disturbed little girl very well. Although I myself am not a fan of Robert De Niro, his character in this film is passable, and believable. There are some odd moments where you find yourself almost screaming with irritation, for example the fact that nearly everyone states: "Your daughter's so beautiful!, but apart from this the film is enjoyable, if not original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through the cold winds of February a creepy film appears from cinemas in the United Kingdom this month with an unusual ghostly presence.John Polson is a director that is destined for greater things; this unique sense of direction can be seen in Hide and Seek; a powerful story about a young girl, Emily Calloway (Dakota Fanning) coming to terms with the sudden death of her mother, Alison. Her father, David Calloway feels it would be best to take her away from the city that holds so many memories, so that the two can cope with their grief and begin to move on as best they can. Their new house is in the sleepy community of Woodland, in New York. For Emily though, the move has offered her little comfort; she has moved away from her friends and knows no one in her new town. As she becomes isolated and vulnerable, she invents an imaginary friend called Charlie, and together they play seemingly innocent games.Soon enough strange things begin to happen around the house, and Emily begins to change within herself. David is extremely concerned that Emily, with her mother's death so fresh in her mind, is having psychological problems. Who is this Charlie and is he really real? This creepy movie is terrifying and enjoys a mysterious ending that will keep you guessing for hours after the credits roll. Watch out for the promising performance of the young Dakota Fanning, a rising star in the movie business, no doubt. Although the phenomenal acting legend Robert De Niro steals the show, proving time and time again that he can turn a Hollywood movie into a box office sensation. So all in all hold on to your popcorn and be prepared for a very frightening game of Hide and Seek. This movie has a bag full of scary surprises that will satisfy even the hardened thrill seeker. Come out, come out wherever you are and watch this year's latest horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, to trailer-proof anyone reading this, there is not much Elisabeth Shue, and not much more Famke Janssen. It's pretty much just DeNiro and Fanning throughout the movie.This is the story of a psychologist who moves to the sticks an hour upstate with his daughter after the death of his wife. The daughter acts strangely, odd occurrences happen, and a zany time is had by all.I think the movie basically hit all the usual notes, and took the turns I'd basically expected it to take, including the ending. With a movie like this, however, you generally already have a few theories heading toward the climax, so it's not really a let-down when the movie ends in one of those ways.Expect to spend a great deal of time watching Dakota Fanning standing there, silent, and looking somewhat ghoulish, and DeNiro asking her who did this and that. This is basically 80 percent of the movie.The downside is that, toward the end when everything is revealed, the viewer is never overcome with the sense that he missed any sure tells during the movie that make sense now that the whole story is known. They tried a little "Sixth Sense" action there, but it didn't fly. And, no, the "Sixth Sense" reference is in no way a spoiler. Just a comparison for a plot device.In the film's final scene, the director/studio tacked on something completely nonsensical that was a little insulting. I just pushed it out of my mind and proceeded out the door.The performances, such as they were, were fine, but it's basically a beginning, a long stretch of the same scene over and over for the bulk, then an ending, and a tacked-on scene. I really stopped feeling any sense of suspense half-way through.But it's still better than "The Boogeyman," and a HECK of a lot better than "Alone in the Dark," a sure-fire front-runner for next year's Razzies.Take care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining little thriller - but not much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems sad to say this, but over the past few years, seeing Robert De Niro in a drama has become somewhat of a rarity. In the slew of Analyze this and thats, and Meeting Parents and Fockers, De Niro has rarely withdrawn from the world of mainstream comedy and returned to the genre he is best known for: drama. So I jumped on the chance to see Hide and Seek, knowing that even if the film was terrible, at least it would be refreshing to see De Niro trying out his hand in the horror genre. After the apparent suicide of his wife, psychologist David Calloway (De Niro) decides that a change of surroundings is what would be best to help he and his daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) to get on with their lives. OK, this I can understand, it's a decent enough idea. But why move to a creepy, enormous, empty house out in the middle of the country? Yeah, the terrifying surroundings are really going to help the kid adjust! Sure enough, Emily isn't taking the death of her mother very well, and withdraws from spending any time with pretty much anyone except her imaginary friend, Charlie, whom she seems to have invented upon arrival at the house. But then, much to the dismay of David, frightening occurrences keep happening at the house, ever time accompanied by Emily's insistent "Charlie did it!" It's a good premise for a plot, with good casting in the lead roles. But Hide and Seek is really let down by actor turned director John Polson, who floods the story with every imaginable horror cliché, from the thunderstorms at every single frightening scene (that's not an exaggeration - every single scary event is accompanied by the crash of lightning in the background) to even the horrendously overused 'door slams by itself when protagonists enter the scary looking house' trick. Everything seems too staged in Hide and Seek - it becomes hard to take the movie seriously because it tries too hard to be scary, to fleeting effect. De Niro is effective enough as widower David Calloway, but he doesn't do anything outstanding here, most of his role being reacting to the various creepy events which happen around the house. Dakota Fanning is given little to do but stare blankly and try to keep up a mask of menace throughout the film, but she manages an impressive enough performance nonetheless. Then we have our necessary creepy supporting cast: the mysterious sheriff (Dylan Baker), the disturbed family next door, who have just lost a daughter very similar to Emily, and the friendly neighbor who tries hard to befriend the family (Elisabeth Shue). Famke Janssen also gives a good performance as an old psychologist friend of David's, not to mention the only person in the film who seems to think that moving into a huge, spooky, empty house out in the middle of nowhere right after the loss of her mother might NOT be the best thing for Emily. She seems to remain the only character in the film who usually shares the audience's point of view throughout.It's an entertaining enough thriller, but there's little here that hasn't been done before in the far over exhausted horror genre. Nothing about Hide and Seek would have seemed in any way outstanding if it wasn't for the involvement of Robert De Niro, who may not be terrible, as most people seemed to expect, but he isn't outdoing Taxi Driver here. Not a bad choice for a lonely night if you feel like some frights - just don't go in expecting anything outstanding. -6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a horror movie. Nothing out of the ordinary really and while the ending is supposed to be a surprise (it is actually, they did good there) it is so prolonged that you kinda feel cheated. The punchline is made and then the movie just keep going. I believe that an alternative ending (much shorter) would make this movie a really good one, but as of now it is actually quite dull at the end. Still, performances are good and Emelie has a truly scary visage at times.All in all, it is a fairly scary movie at times and is probably appreciated by people who like a mix between simple and intelligent horror movies. If nothing else, it is a good excuse to snuggle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was amazing. It was so well put together, the sudden music is scary and the plot line is surprisingly good.I thought that Robert De Niro was alright, he didn't act to his finest though. I thought that Dakota Fanning was BRILLIANT!!!!!! She just acted so well and seemed so creepy that she was a pleasure to watch. BRING ON THE Oscar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The twist at the end is a little un-understandable (Like the Sixth Sense) but it's always fun to try and figure it out by yourself.I though the best thing in this movie was Dakota Fanning's acting, the rest was alright.The movie is great, and scary in places so it's worth ten dollars for a ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly surprised - POSSILE SPOILERS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the heading goes, I was truly surprised by the outcome of this film. HIDE &amp; SEEK opens in Singapore together with the sneak preview of WHITE NOISE and I was dying to see the latter over this film out of my curiosity about the supernatural and such.Then, my friend and I saw them the two films as double features (HIDE &amp; SEEK and WHITE NOISE) at midnight. After the watching them, we were truly pleased with the storyline. Even from the start when I got to know about this movie, I thought it'll be a film on the supernatural elements. But it turned out to be more psychological than of "the other side".We (my friend and I) kept on guessing who's Charlie and we made several guesses. Yet they were all wrong. We never thought it would be ***. The thing was that there were clues left along the way for us to decode who it actually was.But all in all, we were generally pleased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film knowing that it was supposed to be suspenseful, but I was left disappointed. The scares are stock-standard: cat jumping out from closets, grisly discoveries in bathrooms, etc etc. It's nothing you have haven't seen before if you are a horror fan.To its credit, Hide and Seek had a rather good beginning. The isolated wilderness where the father and child lives in, the suspicious neighbours and the archway in the wood - it was all great setting for a flick that would blow your mind away.Yet everything the director managed to build up disintegrates in the third part of the movie. Charlie's identity was revealed way too early - so the suspense you get from trying to guess who Charlie is, gets taken away rudely. And then the movie just went steadily downhill.Could have been better, certainly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't mean to give away anything so this review will be spoiler free.This movie tries to be so many other movies from Fight Club to Sixth Sense, via Psycho and Identity but it end ups just being a very long boring and unimaginative plot with a bad direction that confuses looong quiet scenes with meaningful scary tension.The acting is quite good (if you don't consider the fact that there's nothing to 'act' really) but if you're looking for a thriller, look somewhere else.I guess we can thank Sixth Sense for the double plot twist mania that sweeps thru pseudo thrillers nowadays but don't expect anything as scary, deep or interesting as Sixth Sense.If your scary movie is the slasher type, you'll find this one is a slight upgrade from your usual eye candy but otherwise, don't bother... it's a 2 yawn movie! 1/5 for Dakota Fanning and Famke Janssen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this was not a slice 'em up horror film, but was a fantastic who done it. although a little bit satanic, (this stuff doesn't happen in real life), it left me with a sick, but satisfied feeling. the movie starts out a bit slow, but intertwines it's characters, and sets them up nicely. i am by no means a film critic, but this was a fabulous film. Deniro is great as usual, and adds a certain strangeness to the film. after one third of the way through the movie you will be sitting on the edge of your seat wanting more. the sick feeling in your stomach as the movie unfolds, is similar to putting a fat, bloated, bloody worm on the hook. hating to do it, but knowing you must to get an end result. this is a must see. i would classify it as a twisted mystery..........no kids for this movie !!</fullReview>

Much vandalism, all blamed on Charlie.Then even worse. Things (dolls, cat, etc.) die at Charlie's hand.Final revelation of Charlie could have been better handled, perhaps with more of a struggle between Charlie and the dad.Possible spoilers now: Some of the things I really liked - in fact, liked enough to make me watch the film again sometime to see what I missed: The kid's comments about Charlie "I think he's sleeping now" mean something VERY different after you know what he is.In trying to figure out what's going on, there's some very nice misdirection, such as: Everyone in town seems a little creepy (sort of "Rosemary's Baby" neighbors) and comments on "what a pretty daughter you have," which just makes a parent paranoid.The neighbors next door have "lost a daughter" recently, which if you don't notice that the photos they have of her imply she died of cancer, might lead one to believe Charlie's been around for a while...OK, I found it very interesting.

Everyone seems to be asking why does Robert DeNiro do this to us, make crap films that he gets a big fat check for. In asking that question you get your answer, the big fat check.

		<fullReview>The story of what happens when a father and daughter move to the country after the death of the mother is a creepy little thriller.I have to say that I wasn't expecting much, and talk of multiple endings made me think that this was a troubled film that wasn't going to be very good. I was surprised to find that despite the film following well worn tracks of movies that went before that this is a really good thriller thanks in large part to the cast headed by Robert DeNiro and Dakota Fanning. Its not under any circumstances a great movie but its a nice updated thriller that would have been a B- movie programmer back in the 40's or 50's.Recommended for a rainy afternoon as a bargain matinée at the movies or at home on a Saturday night with a huge bowl of popcorn.

		<shortDescription>"At one point, near the climax, the whole audience burst out laughing"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First up, I'll admit I'm not a fan of horror movies (and have never been close to being scared my a movie). But I was out with friends and some were keen to see it and there was nothing better on. So I wasn't expecting much. The acting was good, especially from the little girl, which for someone of that age was amazing. The cinematography was good. Not great, but good.The script was good albeit a little sparse at the start. One thing we learn from horror movies is that a lack of dialogue leads to boredom. You wouldn't expect a lot of dialogue at the climax of a horror movie but when no one says anything at the start you just get bored. Endless dreary grey scenes don't help either. Again it's not suitable during most of the body of the film but how about a little cheer at the start so they can strike it down later. This contrast between cheer and greyness would highlight the fear of the antagonist. OK I'm just rambling now, lets move on.Although the movie featured good acting, good filming technique and a good script, it was full of clichés. Additionally, the plot twist, while interesting and unexpected, was nothing new. But the curiosity does keep the movie alive. Not that it's particularly interesting or scary.THE IMPORTANT BIT: But there is one thing, above all else, that truly does stand out in this movie. I'm talking about the numerous references to paedophilia. I was laughing the whole way through the movie, as was much of the rest of the audience. At one point, near the climax, the whole audience burst out laughing at a blatant reference. It was truly entertaining. But it does say something about the film. Recommended for all immature people to see with their immature friends.</fullReview>

Unfortunately it didn't last! After building up so much tension (and actually starting to scare me...a little)it blew it all away with the last 20 mins or so of the movie...I never expected that predictable ending so it did surprise me...do you think that was the point?Anyway you look at it this is your typical straight to video/DVD script and to see some of the people involved in the movie there must be a low budget movie script writer somewhere laughing all the way to the bank...as its the same script he sells each time with a different title only this time he hit the jackpot!Catch it on TV don't waste time or money before hand!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similar to the 'Identity' movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminded me about 'Identity', except the character 'Charlie' is the only 'psychotic' character in the mind. It film is great in its suspense, because you never guess who Charlie - the girl's imaginary friend is. The girl played a convincing role - putting a little girl up to potentially defacing dolls, killing cats, and a baby-sitter, and she is blaming it on her imaginary friend, has a really chilling effect. You do not imagine a little girl to be a monster like that and blaming everything on Charlie.That's the strength of the film - who is Charlie, is that little girl crazy, is it the neighbour who was acting really weird, may be it is the Real-Estate agent who sold the home, but came by in the middle of the night before he went to Canada. The film was really good, because it is not until approaching the crises of the plot until the character 'Charlie' - and its revelation is the surprise. When you find out who Charlie is - it is a shocker. It becomes like a twisted 'Identity' type thriller.However, as great and eventful as this movie is, I still think Identity was slightly better as an analogous film so I give this and eight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As fun as the children's game is, this movie is a severe disappointment falling in the ranks of repetitive horror. There is nothing new here.Here "The Shining" meets the awful "Cold Creek Manor," without the first's originality. A burnt out psychologist and his daughter move to start anew after the death of his/her wife/mother. What do you know, creepy things begin to happen and Dakota Fanning turns psycho on us. The horror in this movie is amateur and I don't mean from a visual standpoint, it just isn't anything scary beyond creaking doors and words written on walls in morbid handwriting.Aside from a recycled plot that really never changes from film to film, "Hide and Seek" suffers from choppy storytelling where we, the viewers, know stuff is intentionally being left out until the big finish, which is really not all that big. Movies that have a twist are always more fun if after the twist is revealed, you can look back and to what was shown to you and pick out the clues. "Hide and Seek" delivers bits of information and fills them in during a montage in the end. This could be forgivable if the end twist was anything close to interesting. Viewers with the slightest bit of experience with these sorts of films will see it coming from a mile away. In the end, "Hide and Seek" leaves a void that should have been filled far earlier.Robert DeNiro's second horror offering in less than a year is a huge disappointment. Throw in Elisabeth Shue, Famke Janssen and Dakota Fanning and you would think you're in line for a decent film. But, the January release should tip you off. "Hide and Seek" recycles an old horror cliché, offers nothing new and has a twist spot-able from a mile away, this is one round I wish I sat out on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Callaway (Robert De Niro) is having a tough time dealing with the apparent suicide of his wife (Amy Irving). His young daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning), also has taken her mother's death very hard, retreating into her own little world. As a psychologist, David decides the only way to help Emily is to move from the big city to a house in the country. Sure, that kind of thing usually works like a charm. Emily does perk up a bit when she finds a new ''friend,'' Charlie, who likes to have fun and play hide and seek with her. Of course, we can't actually see this new friend but that's beside the point. The imaginary Charlie is still a powerful force in Emily's life, instructing her not to talk about him much and hating pretty much everyone else in her life, including her dad. In short order, bad things start happening--yes, the family pet gets whacked--which Emily blames on Charlie. This leaves David wondering how his little girl could have turned so psychotic. But wait. Maybe Charlie isn't imaginary after all, but actually a flesh-and-blood, malevolent presence. Oh god, do you think so? NOTE: Did not write that, I got it from www.movietickets.com :-)Before seeing this movie, I thought it was just going to be the same old Hollywood movie. i thought it was going to be just like Secret Window, and I guess you can say it was like Secret Window, but this movie kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. Robert De Nero did an awesome job as the confused parent, and I am surprised people are saying how bad he did. He did a good job trying to mislead the audience, getting us to think Emily was in fact "Charlie". Of course, I know how Hollywood works, so I knew Emily wasn't Charlie. I thought it could be the neighbor who seemed to be a little strange. But then the police man came into the house and asked Emily a simple question that caught be off guard. He asked Emily if she would tell her dad anything, she shook her head and the police officer said thats good. I thought wait, is the police officer testing her, since we all know Emily isn't aloud to talk about Charlie? But then, David went to his office, and all of his stuff wasn't unpacked. He then starts to remember everything, that he is in fact, Charlie. I was shocked. As for Dakota Fanning, she also did an amazing job playing a disturbed little girl. She acts far beyond her age, and I couldn't think of a better person to pull it off.</fullReview>

Hide And Seek, starts out like it could be interesting but it turns more into a bore and gets a little repetitive after awhile and soon I just stopped caring. The film has a bad screenplay and really doesn't do anything new or exciting that other horror films haven't done before. The film is also not scary and stops be interesting after awhile too and soon I was just waiting for the film to end. It is too bad because you have a lot of talent behind this film such as the great cast but it starts out bad and goes to worse. A repetitive and un-interesting film.</fullReview>

Hopefully she will retain her skill and success into adulthood. She did a great job being creepy throughout the film. Robert Deniro did a pretty good job acting as well but he played a roll that he has played time and time again. Overall I enjoyed the movie but felt that the end was a blatant attempt to twist the plot. A supernatural enemy would have been more in line with the plot of the movie, but I guess if the movie ended that way it would have been compared to White Noise.

Yes, you could guess what happens in the final reel but not through any educated piecing together of what happens before it, simply through pure cynicism brought upon by watching bad movies like this one.On a lighter note, Dakota Fanning does make me laugh at one point in this.

		<shortDescription>All build up but its late pay off still makes this movie remotely watchable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike most people, I actually preferred the second half of this movie over its first one.The first half of this movie is basically all build up. Nothing good or creepy really happens and the movie just drags along. I was mostly bored and annoyed because I also didn't liked any of the characters. For a movie with so many great and well known actors in it, the movie surely features some boring and flat characters, as well as some disappointing performances.Robert De Niro looked so bored in this. I really hope for him and his kid's sake that he isn't such a boring father in real life, like he portrays in this movie. Makes me sad to see the once great De Niro in a movie like this, playing such a bad and flat character. No, his presence really doesn't add anything to this movie, which can also be said about Famke Janssen, Elisabeth Shue, Amy Irving, Dylan Baker, Melissa Leo and Robert John Burke. Seriously, what are they all doing in this movie? Most of the characters don't even add anything to the story at all and could had easily been left out or played by some unknown extra. But I also was annoyed by Dakota Fanning. She's playing a depressed kid, who is mad and unkind to to almost everyone. Why should we ever care about such a character. Just because she is a kid? The film-makers seemed to think so it seems but just because she is a kid doesn't mean she and the writing can get away with just everything.It's obviously all what they wanted to do and achieve with this movie but the execution however isn't very good. The first half of the movie is supposed to be a mystery, in which you are not supposed to be sure what is going on or what direction the story is going to take. It constantly tries to fool you but problem is that it all takes too long and the story just isn't being told in a very intriguing, mysterious or tense way. Again, this is also due to the incredibly flat characters that are in the movie its story.This is foremost why I liked the second half way better. As soon as it became clear what direction the movie was heading toward, the movie finally started to gain some pace and also even the characters started to change, for the better of the movie. This however happens all far too late, which means it can't really save this movie from being a disappointing one. Once the movie is finished and you look back at it, there are plenty of things in this movie and story that don't always make too much sense. These are all moments that are put in this movie to either fool or scare you, without adding up or making sense by the end really. It's a kind of cheap writing and way film-making, which makes me wonder all the more why all these big names ever singed on to this movie in the first place. It's also a rather clichéd movie, which reminds you of far too many other genre movies you have probably seen already. No, "Hide and Seek" is not a movie that adds anything new to the genre or is being great in any way. It's also at the same time not the worst film but with a better approach and execution this movie at least could had been an efficient and average one. I now really can't say that about this movie sadly and therefore also can't really recommend it to anyone.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>t was Charlie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the sudden death of his wife, David Callaway takes his traumatised daughter, Emily, away to find peace and to start their life again in a new home.Emily fails to settle in well, with David becoming concerned as Emily identifies with Charlie.Someone who David has never met before, but who likes to play Hide and Seek....De Niro in a horror movie, a total shambles rip off of every thriller/horror/twist ending film you have seen ten years sort of horror movie, with totally nothing new to offer the viewer.Fanning is okay as the traumatised girl, who has an imaginary friend, it's just the rest of the cast. Shue is wasted, Robert John Burke is just reprising his robocop role, and Janssan just plays concerned throughout.There are no real scares, and there are the usual jump shots, but it's just a total waste and a shame to see De Niro looking genuinely embarrassed to be in this.And then there is the ending. which is predictable on the verge of laughable.a bad movie in many respects, but there was something about De Niro shouting 'Marco' toward the end which made me smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seek the (not so) hidden plot holes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer was promising, the first half of the movie was sort of delivering, despite being a collection of topoi (or clichés for those less fond of big words) already used, overused and abused in hundreds of similar movies. Nonetheless the story was unfolding in a satisfying way, leaving many options open, before going for the weakest and most predictable swerve possible. To add insult to injury, the movie still runs for a while, with the ever so typical "chase in the dark" and its equally typical ending with unsettling finale on the top of it. But had it been consistent with the whole story it would have still been acceptable, albeit rather dire.The fact is there are many blatant plot holes it's hard to buy it was David/Charlie all along. For starters, if he smothered his wife and then staged the suicide, it's IMPOSSIBLE it could have gotten unnoticed... You don't need the whole cast of all the CSIs to tell death by suffocation (or signs of suffocation anyway) from suicide. Who examined the corpse? Doctor Nick Riviera?Also, what about Elizabeth's car? The sheriff might not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but a crashed car with no corpse (or blood...) nearby should warrant for something more than a polite 2 minutes inquiry.Last but not least, Emily can safely tell when David is Dad and when he's Charlie, but she won't tell Dad. And of course David, a psychologist himself, doesn't seem to suspect a damn thing until the final and totally clear epiphany... Icing on the cake, Emily herself, in the official ending, knows/feels she has split personality too... Something his dad, a trained professional in that field, didn't understand before having killed three people. Long story short: the movie is an average pop-corn psychological thriller. You can enjoy it as long as you don't try to take it "seriously", because behind the nice execution there's little substance. It's a shame because there were many and better avenues to explore starting from the same premise, and the cast was indeed above average.DeNiro phones it in, but he's still quite good, as is the rest of the secondary characters. Dakota Fanning was quite convincing in her spooky withdrawal and in her growing unease and panic. Considering the material she had to work with, she was really good.All in all a missed opportunity for everyone involved, but mostly for us, the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offensive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally don't mind watching horrible movies: I find that virtually any movie--even a tedious, by-the-numbers Hollywood thriller--has at least ONE unusual detail, one weird line of dialogue or character trait that the scriptwriter casually threw in that sticks in my head and makes the experience worthwhile. I enjoy spotting these details and ruminating on them, even if the entire rest of the movie is crap. And that is what offended me the about "Hide and Seek": THERE IS NOTHING. It is a walking Frankenstein's monster of clichés. If someone were threatening to kill me unless I named something interesting in "Hide and Seek," I guess I'd die, because it does not contain a single element I haven't already seen 25 times.Sometimes the screenwriter approaches creativity but dives out of the way when it gets too close. There is a creepy couple, for instance, who have built a living room shrine to their dead child. I wanted to learn more about these people, but it turned out it was just a stupid diversion. Like most Hollywood sh*tfests these days, the DVD was released with two alternate endings, meaning the director didn't even consider his work a finished product. I don't need to know about alternate endings, just give me a real ending and be done with it. I grew out of Choose Your Own Adventure novels in fifth grade.But I'm not one to condemn a movie and just walk away; I'll instead offer some advice to the fledgling screenwriter in case he is reading this. Sir, about this shocking "twist" you put in (which I won't reveal here for the people who have never seen a movie before). It didn't need to be a twist. If the actual circumstances of the little girl's invisible friend were revealed to us at the VERY BEGINNING, and we saw all the interaction between her and the friend happen IN PLAIN VIEW, this movie would have been AWESOME. I'm not sure if it would be hilarious or terrifying, but either way it would have made an interesting movie and possibly a cult classic. If you are thinking to yourself, "Nah, that'd be too weird, the audience would never go for it," that attitude is why you are now a failed writer reading IMDb reviews of your work three years after the fact. Good day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately just not all that satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess it's just difficult to view this as much else than a recent entry into the recent Hollywood fad of "the big 'twist' picture". There are some magnificent actors in this, but what they're given to work with... or maybe they just didn't particularly fit the material; bottom line is, it doesn't work as well as it could. Various performers attempt to play "creepy", with varying results(Fanning certainly gives it her best shot, with decent results). The plot, well, it's there, and it keeps the thing moving along. Pacing is fine. Acting is a mixed bag. It wouldn't have hurt the editing to turn down the flashiness just a tad(though it's not as bad as other works), but it is tight and at times effective. Direction could be more engaging. There are some scares, though, and build-up isn't without accomplishment. Cinematography is mostly good, there's one particular angle that's perhaps overused(you'll know it when or if you see it), and more often than not, you can't quite tell what's going on. The violence is beyond what a child should see. Effects are pretty well-done. The twist... I don't know, in the end, after(as is what happens with these films) the viewer basically spends the entire thing theorizing... and the very end just... I don't know. Some may like it. Personally, I find this to be about average fare. I recommend this to big fans of twist films and horror, as well as the actors. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good Twists and Turns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I disagree with many other users that rate this movie as a poorer version of Taking Lives, Secret Window, etc. No, is not as good as M Night Shymalan movies ("Sixth Sense, etc.) But it was still entertaining and provided some nice shock value.I wasn't necessarily expecting "Charlie" to be the dad. At first he could have just been an imaginary friend, and then when we see all of the events that Emily (Dakota Fanning) could not possibly have orchestrated on her own, we realize that a real person (or a mighty powerful ghost) has to have been responsible. As for the other users who say that it could have ended up being the neighbor, or the realtor - well, they were obviously red herrings designed to lead us off track. Yes, it COULD have been them, but it wasn't. It wasn't so much of a different personality as it was a psychotic break on the part of Robert DeNiro's character. And no, you would not necessarily say, "I should have seen this coming" - but looking back, we do have a lot of images of a New Year's Party in Robert DeNiro's mind. So clearly this was an important element that the filmmakers wanted us to consider. I was surprised that DeNiro turned out to be Charlie. I liked the part of the film that took us back and helped us realize what had happened.Dakota Fanning did a marvelous acting job. She was eerie and scary in a way that only children can be. To respond to one person, there are obvious reasons why she did not react to the death of the cat and the other scary events. She was trying to keep it together in front of her father, and perhaps, as one person suggested, she was suffering from a form of PTSD and was compartmentalizing in order to cope.Of course, some things don't make sense. Why would she engage in games "to upset Daddy", as she told her therapist? That would make sense if she was in fact evil, but since we find out that she is merely a pawn, it is confusing. I guess we can surmise that she is at the mercy of her father and is doing what he tells her to do, even while he is "Charlie." I was also wondering why it took her so long to become visibly upset, as she did following Elizabeth's (Elisabeth Shue)death. I would have expected this to come sooner, but perhaps you can argue that the death of a human is more traumatic than the death of an animal (even if I don't agree with this).It also didn't fit that she would be calmly drawing a picture of the sheriff's death, as if it were a picture of flowers. Maybe she was in shock or denial? Who knows? I liked how they showed us that the reality we saw was actual a reality only in David's (DeNiro's) mind - writing in the journal, listening to the headphones, waking up to find his wife dead, etc. It reminded me of the revelations from other movies.As for the last scenes, users have commented that it was disappointing that it didn't end either darker or happier. Well you could tell this was film noire, and it wasn't going to end entirely happily. It would have been to easy to have the father kill everyone, including the daughter. And you also knew that it wasn't going to be happily ever after - no one could emerge from that kind of trauma unscathed, even the most resilient children. So, yes, I had a feeling that something would be revealed at the very end. When they showed the drawing, I knew it would pan out and show us what was there. The two heads? I am sure the second head is an "evil" head, that is now a part of her ... perhaps deeply embedded and will not emerge for years.Overall, not a great movie, but a good movie. Come on people, it is a horror movie! You can't expect great cinema from this genre for the most part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie late at night and I have to say I got shivers in my spine throughout the movie. Despite the fact that I am only ten years old and obviously seen a variety of horror flicks, I have to say this is my favourite one! Not that it's ultra-scary but it came dangerously close to being a true story.The performance throughout this movie was incredibly realistic all thanks to Dakota Fanning she is an absolute stunning young actress and I truly felt that she was doing her performance for real. She done a fantastic role doing the traumatised looks and mysterious influences and I think she is the best young girl actress in the world and I hope to see her again in more movies. As for Robert De Niro, I am a massive fan of his and I thought he was the perfect choice for dad/Charlie! I mean,when things took a murderous turn in the movie I truly believed that he was doing it for real and made me hide under the sofa!I quite liked the plot in the movie, despite it took a slow start for the movie to pick up, the end of the movie actually made up for it otherwise I would given this movie a low ranking! I thought that the writers still did a fantastic role producing the storyboard and the script and that is one of the best points about the movie.So rent this movie, turn on your television but turn off the lights and hope you enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is just not well made and the script is lazy when it comes to explaining everything about it's supernatural mystery. The editing by the director/cameraman is very sloppy, Dakota Fanning is very annoying as the "Carrie" child, Elizabeth Shue has a predictable death scene that the viewer knew was upcoming; Famke Janssen has a good small role as the psychologist keeping an eye on the girl's behavior, but suffers with the material; there are familiar character actors in the roles as the weird neighbors and sheriff overlooking the girl as well; Robert Di Nero is good as always as Fanning's psychologist dad who at the end is revealed to be the imaginary friend causing all the mysterious murders, thus, creating a absurd/unbelievable ending that even when the viewer understands it all is just dull/lazy script writing and doesn't change the fact that this is one of Worst Films of 2005! I seriously mean it! While this isn't the worst film of all time, it still smells and acts like a turkey despite the talent involved. It's just something to avoid on the Blockbuster shelf or when you're flipping thru the channels. Even when you get into it, in the end, you're just watching it just to see how long this confusing mess of a train-wreck is going to go on. So don't watch if you hate things that drive you crazy or are not of good quality. Plus, if you're into supernatural thrillers, you're better off with the "classics" THE SIXTH SENSE and THE FRIGHTENERS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You won't be Hiding behind the sofa and might even end up switching off half way through to Seek out a better film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hide and Seek is a tired, tired film that makes a slow and unspectacular start before turning a slight corner and moving up a gear with its great acting performance from Dakota Fanning before finally limping its way towards the finish line with a weak twist, fewer and fewer scares and a really disappointing 'Hollywood' way of rounding the story off.I would use the word 'interesting' to describe the opening of Hide and Seek. The film is a study of loneliness more than anything else as a man and his daughter come to terms with the death of their wife and mother respectively. In order to combat the loss, they both take time out to rehabilitate in a small, middle of nowhere town that is complete with the sheriff you see all the time because he's the only police man that does work, big houses that are set back from any road in sight and rough rocky landscapes complete with caves for disturbed children to wonder off into to make seemingly imaginary friends.Although Hide and Seek isn't necessarily a terrible film, I'd say it's a very underwhelming and flat film that hangs around on the same subject matter for too long to warrant any progression or indeed; scares. Hide and Seek is of the psychological horror variety yet lacks scenes that make you want to turn away in sheer anxiety at what might be presented to you. In order to get across its disturbance and its eerie feeling of the uncanny, it'll rely on images of dolls faces that have been pushed in and subsequently presented to the camera; it'll rely on a close up of a set of kitchen knifes in which one of them looks like they've been used quite recently and not put back properly; the film will also rely on the possible threat of a paedophilic neighbour. But these things in the film aren't scary, they just act as clues and even then they're not great clues. The knifes indicate that at some point later on, some one will use a knife in a 'scary' scene; the neighbour is a clue that the film will go down the route to make him look like he's the antagonist and as for the dolls, well I don't actually know why we are presented with dolls, toys and pictures disfigured in the way they are.Like I said, the film plays with the same things over and over. David Callaway (De Niro) can't quite keep his daughter under control and although recognises all the bathroom graffiti is done with her crayons, it's not done in her handwriting. Incidentally, things should've become a lot clearer when the bodies popped up but Hide and Seek played around with the whole concept for just a while longer ? long enough for that sheriff to turn again, at least.In-between all these supposed scares is a really, really weak and pointless love story that seems to want to form between the father and another town resident who seems all too happy to pop round on request, cook and dine with the main characters. She doesn't mind that the child looks like a bit of a psycho and the man is about thirty years older than she is although the scene in which the imaginary friend is revealed to actually be part of this physical world is impressive since it's unpredictable ? any unpredictable scene in a horror film is always going to work out well. When the twist does make itself known, I started asking myself why Emily (Fanning) had acted the way she did for whole film and if it was indeed because of 'Charlie's' behaviour or something else that wasn't even there. Yes, coping with her mother death would've been very difficult but defacing her dolls and wrecking her drawings is destructive behaviour. I would've though she might have become less destructive and more defensive. Another thing is that surely her father would've recommended she get the help from the psychologist character and not keep her there longer as the rehabilitation clearly wasn't working.Hide and Seek rounds its poor performance off with a really typical finale as the psychologist character of Katherine (Janssen) arrives on cue and then descends into a 'lair' before surviving the 'near death experience' and then getting the 'reversal of fortune' to all coincide saving the day. Hide and Seek was a very disappointing and routine thriller with few things to even recommend it as a good horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Much Better Ending looks like this.........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 3/4 of the film is outstandingly good, and had set great stimuli to viewers' curiosity. Audience are attracted to wonder how the ending could be. The ending is controversial, but is not the main problem.The biggest flaw in this film is that the Director has intentionally cheated his audience, in the sense that: if David is Charlie, there's no way that Emily could have that type of conversation with David as depicted in the picture. She would have told her father something like " How come you can turn into a different person" or "Charlie is you!" Their interaction could not have been as depicted despite that Emily is also a potential split-personality person as hinted by her 2 headed-girl drawing at the end of the film. So this is pure cheating!Having said that I still feel the film is great but it needs some amendments.OK, David has split personality and he murdered his wife, we can retain that. David SHOULD NEVER BE CHARLIE! How about this : Emily is schizophrenic and has lots of hallucinations (as psychosis run in family). "Charlie" was in fact a wolf Emily met in the den as depicted in the film whom she had befriended .The wolf fancied Emily(just like Kong felt for Ann), who had imagined and hallucinated all the conversation with this "Charlie"."Charlie" visited Emily now and again in the house, but being a wild animal, when it jumped out of the closet it had still shocked Elizabeth.When David's split personality emerged finally and tried to harm Emily,the audience started to think that David must be Charlie. When he chased Emily to the den and when David was about to kill Emily, "Charlie" appeared from the corner and killed David, saving Emily's life.This is the first scene that the wolf should appear before the audience's eyes. Still trembling in the dark, Emily uttered, "Thanks, Charlie!" IMAGINE THE EFFECT!Everyone thought David was killed by the wild animal while trying to save Emily, who had kept the story to herself. She was raised under custody of Katherine, and is ready to bring us another exciting story in the coming sequel. The audience should then be hinted at the end that she is schizophrenic and not having "split personality".There's one more flaw that needs to be corrected. When a person is suffocated and died her heart stops pumping and her blood clots.There's no way you can drain the tub with blood afterward. So Alison should have been drugged first and then slain in the tub afterward, but then she had to be depicted to be a chronic drug addict to explain why the Coroner had not suspected foul play.Everybody happy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable, by-the-numbers tripe . . . what was Robert DeNiro thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**riddled with spoilers; don't read if you don't want to know what happens, though nothing in this movie comes as a surprise** Let me just start by saying I have a special contempt for people who claim to be sooooo smart that they figured out the end of a movie while watching the opening credits. However, this movie was so bad I guessed that Robert DeNiro was the bad guy . . . while watching the trailer on TV. I'm not kidding, either. I'm sure you did, too. You don't need super smarts to figure out this movie in the first 20 minutes, my friends. Geez, I don't even know where to begin evaluating this mess.The director trotted out every bad movie cliché he/she could think of, and things rapidly go downhill from there. Creepy daughter traumatized by mom's alleged suicide? It will really help her to uproot her from her home in the city, and everything that's familiar, to a huge creepy house out in the middle of creepy woods in the middle of nowhere, away from all her friends. This move is allegedly good for her, for reasons that are never fully explained. Yep, makes perfect sense to me.Then, the requisite red herring with the creepy neighbors. How obvious was it that the couple had lost a daughter Emily's age, and that she reminded them of her? Nope, never saw that angle before in a movie. Depsite the movie's failed efforts at subterfuge in making us think of them as the villains, it was obvious they had nothing to do with "Charlie" and all the strange goings-on in the house.Speaking of Charlie. They did everything but put Robert DeNiro in a t-shirt that reads "I am the bad guy." The director connected way too many dots way too early, from which it was easy to conclude: Robert DeNiro killed his wife; that Dakota Fanning's character knew this (though why she never confides in anyone - even Famke Jannsen, whom she obviously trusted - truly makes no sense to me); that he is the malevolent Charlie and requisite split-personality character wreaking havoc in the household, and this is why his daughter obviously hates him; and that he kills Elisabeth Shue's character.There wasn't a single moment of suspense here. We knew Elisabeth Shue's character would encounter "Charlie" when she opened the closet door. We knew someone would kill Charlie/DeNiro (I don't even remember his character's name, that's how little I cared). Famke Jannsen was in remarkable shape for someone hit over the head and knocked down a flight of stairs. Man, I'd love to know where she works out. Whatever. That's just one of the little things you have to overlook to make sense of this movie. Oh, wait, there is no making sense here. And don't even get me started on the stupid small-town sheriff who suspects foul play but shows up at the suspect's house . . . alone. With no back-up. Genius, that one.What exactly did the drawing at the end mean? They never bothered to explain. I guess it was none of our business. And by this point of the movie, I really didn't care anymore.I regret the 1 hour and 45 minutes of my life that I devoted to watching this tripe and that I will sadly never get back. Note to the director(s) - twists are more suspenseful and effective if you haven't been painting a "you are here" road map to them all along. The actors did what they could with the material, but even they seemed embarrassed.The best way to watch this movie? Invite a bunch of friends over, serve lots of alcohol, and watch this trash as part of Mystery Science Theater 3000 nite. Otherwise? Avoid this movie at all costs. I'm giving it a "3" and that's pretty generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Creepy Kid and Her Imaginary Friend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A horror film with a surprise denouement, "Hide and Seek" kept me on the edge of my seat even when nothing was really happening. I'd credit director John Polson for that, and for sustaining an unsettling, macabre mood from beginning to end. Robert De Niro's performance is mostly very nuanced and understated, and Dakota Fanning is appropriately disturbing as De Niro's daughter, joining the line of Creepy Kids currently fashionable in horror films like "The Sixth Sense" and "The Ring." After the death of her mother, played briefly by Amy Irving (who seems to drain the life out of everything that she's in), Dakota is taken upstate New York by her psychiatrist-father, to live in a gloomy house that looks haunted and is conveniently off the beaten track. This seems like an odd place for a child to recuperate, to say the least, but then it is a horror film after all. The nearest neighbors are a couple of kooks and even the local cop comes off as vaguely skin-crawling. In this environment, li'l Dakota is visited by Charlie, her imaginary friend. Or is he imaginary after all? Charlie's anti-social behavior escalates as we wonder if he's a supernatural being, Dakota herself, or perhaps one of the crazy, white-trash upstaters. I was guessing until just before the denouement, with the red herrings leaping gleefully throughout.Once the film lets us in on what's been really going on, late in its third act, it becomes less interesting and settles into your typical action-oriented climax. Famke Jannsen is a concerned friend and doctor, and Elizabeth Shue is a neighbor who runs brazenly about the chilly upstate landscapes in a variety of tight, plunging v-neck sweaters, full-bodied country girl that she is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine cast, but an uninspired plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Warning: this comment definitely contains spoilers!*** Despite a great cast and mostly good acting, John Polson (director) and Ari Schlossberg (screenwriter) just can't quite pull it off in this contrived horror/murder/psychological thriller. The red herring characters were never developed enough to make them credible suspects. Rather than teasing the viewer with options to sort through, this film relies on raw deception to throw you off the trail of the most obvious suspect.My frustration with this film can be summed up in the sequence of shots leading to the death of Elizabeth. We see her arriving at the house, stepping onto the porch, and knocking on the front door. No one answers. The next shot is of David inside the house, wearing headphones and writing in his diary. He is oblivious to the sound of the knocking. Then we see Elizabeth again, entering the house unheard and going upstairs to find Emily in her room. These shots clearly take David out of the running when "Charlie" bursts out of Emily's closet.I expect to be misled, even fooled by a good mystery; but this sequence was nothing more than a lie. OK, I understand that the headphones and diary were David's fantasies, as was revealed in the big finale that identified David as "Charlie." But, this plot device is akin to having a character suddenly wake up and find that "everything was a dream." It was stupid when Dallas did it ? it is stupid here as well. Compare this to the skillful way "Sixth Sense" misled you with camera angles and dialog. You can go back and watch every scene with Bruce Willis and it all rings true in its own context, and in the context of the surprise ending. "Hide and Seek" on the other hand has to resort to a hasty "never mind; that scene you saw earlier didn't really happen!"Other than the plot, the biggest disappointment was to have Amy Irving killed off so soon. After all, the cast members were this films most redeeming quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tired and Weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert DeNiro seems intent on ruining what's left of his career by being in poorly constructed and conceived horror movies. First, there was Godsend, now Bobby follows up with another mediocre effort in Hide and Seek. This movie is only partially saved from being complete garbage by Dakota Fanning and one of the alternate endings that you can find on the DVD. In the end, it suffers from the use of what is rapidly becoming the most overused horror film twist of the century.The story is about a single dad (DeNiro) who's struggling to bring up his daughter (Fanning). She's a troubled little girl who has apparently made up an imaginary friend to help her get cope with her lack of a mother figure. The problem is that Dakota's imaginary friend keeps threatening to hurt people if Daddy doesn't start paying more attention to Dakota. The body count starts to rise when Daddy tries to send Dakota to a shrink and get her to play nice with the local Milf's kid. We are led to believe that Dakota has suffered some kind of psychotic break and she is actually doing all the murderous things that her imaginary friend is doing. Throughout, DeNiro plays the patient and exasperated father, trying so hard to understand how his little girl could be so twisted. But this is exactly where the movie goes wrong. I found it really hard to believe that Daddy would be so understanding when his daughter kills the family cat and then shoves the nice blonde hot Milf lady, Elizabeth Shue, out the window. All dad does is send her to her room with no supper.It turns out that Daddy's lack of reaction to the murders is because of the big plot twist. If you intend on watching this movie and you want to be surprised... well, you're out of luck. The twist is telegraphed pretty early on. But if you want to try and figure it out for yourself, you should stop reading this review now because here comes the big reveal:Daddy is actually the imaginary friend.After this weak I'm-the-killer-and-didn't-know-it revelation, we are expected to buy that Daddy was going around killing the cat and shoving Shue out the window and he was completely oblivious to the fact that he was actually the killer. Oh, how I wish that Hollywood would stop using this device. It's so cheap, and it's such a convenient and weak way of resolving the story. You might as well tell me it was all a dream. These movies make me so angry. Just when I was starting to think that the writer was really going to have to be clever to create a solid resolution, it turns into a Twilight Zone episode. When you lead me down the road through this long, taut thriller and then reveal in the end that there really wasn't a bad guy, it's kind of a letdown. It worked in ANGEL HEART, people. That was like twenty years ago. It has not worked in a horror movie since. Well, I take that back. It worked in HAUTE TENSION, but it doesn't work in IDENTITY, SECRET WINDOW, THE MACHINIST and especially not in HIDE AND SEEK. This lame reveal is so cliché now that I don't even know if you could consider it a twist at all. In fact, I think that this twist might be my new pet peeve, worse even than the Occurrence at Owl Creek I'm-Dead-and-Don't-Know-it reveal. Yes, I think that the I'm-the-killer reveal is just a little bit worse. Like I mentioned at the start of this review, there are several alternate endings that are included on the DVD. There is one ending with Dakota Fanning that almost pulls this movie out of the fire. It still doesn't excuse the use of this tired old twist, but it made me feel less angry. In fact, the alternate ending is the only thing that kept me from giving this movie one star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay film, with a bad ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Emily Callaway's mother commits suicide her father decide to take her away to a house in the woods to help her get over the trauma. But Emily seems to be getting worse. She starts talking to a new friend, Charlie, and he seems to be a bad influence. Her father David, a psychologist tries to use this imaginary friend to help Emily work through her issues. While the audience is left to wonder is Charlie really imaginary? Is he a ghost or the neighbour's dead child? And why are the locals acting a little strange? And the trouble keeps on coming as mysterious messages, some a little gruesome, get left in the bathroom, often with a message scrawled in red for David to read.The first hour or so of this film is decent enough. Dakota Fanning is great as the kid, you have no real problem in believing that she could be evil, or seeing ghosts or whatever, but by the end of the film you just don't really care. The resolution is dull, and the final scene pointless.Since his slew of so-called comedic roles where he pokes fun at his previous characters I've found it a little difficult to take De Niro seriously, but he does a fine job as the worried Dad here.All in all this is a mediocre film, dragged down by the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, we don't see many psychological thrillers around, don't we?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hide and Seek is just your average, typical psycho-thriller, which, as you can expect, deals with psychotic people and psychotic behaviour. Since I don't see many psycho thrillers around, I'm not going to bash it too hard, but if this movie hadn't been a psycho thriller I would've written it down in my list of Worst 100. The storyline? As you can guess, it deals with psychotic people and psychotic behaviour! This movie reminds me of the Korean horror movie, A Tale of Two Sisters, which is also a psychological horror movie. The storyline is similar in that both the protagonists in the story were the antagonists at the same time. However, the problem with Hide and Seek is its overly direct and shallow storyline: there were no twists in the plot (everything was happening the way it was supposed to be), nothing that was out of the ordinary. You can expect what the killer will do next.The acting was probably the thing that saved this movie, Dakota Fanning did a brilliant job as the troubled kid, whereas Robert de Niro did a decent job playing the psycho-man. The cinematography and setting was alright, but certainly did not make up for the predictable storyline and lack of originality.Ironically, the father, who makes his living as a psychologist, was the real psycho and killer in this movie. Well, we don't see many movies like this coming out every year, so if you;re desperate to see a psychological horror flick, perhaps this movie ought to satisfy you until you can get your hands on A Tale of Two Sisters. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Loved This Movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really sure why the ratings for "Hide and Seek" are so freaking low on IMDb, or what most of these people were expecting. If you ask me, this movie couldn't have been much better. As usual, Dakota Fanning did an awesome job, and looked so cute with the dark hair. Her acting abilities never fail to impress me, and it's gotten to the point now where I will watch a movie just because she's in it. Robert DeNiro, Elisabeth Shue and all the other actors were great too.I guess I can understand that the "alternate personality" thing that went on with the Dad, is pretty common in horror movies, but at least in this one it was unexpected. They put in other suspicious people to throw you off, like the guy delivering the key, and the neighbor. So I don't think ANYONE could say that "they knew from the start the Dad was Charlie." Maybe this movie wasn't quite as "scary" as some of the others people have seen, but so what? Can you really say that just because a movie isn't frightening enough for you, it's automatically bad? The reason why it's rated so low is probably because people who haven't even seen the movie are giving it a bad vote because they might hate Dakota Fanning or Robert DeNiro or horror movies altogether. So yeah, "Hide and Seek" is a great movie. Pay no attention to all the losers who are saying it sucks. Definitely go out and buy it...or at least rent it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dakota Fanning is stealing the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dakota Fanning is only 11, but she has already 16 movies on her record, and another three in production. She was directed by Spielberg, she worked with Tom Hanks and now with Robert Deniro. She is competing with Nicole Kidman for the super-active star of the year title. Yes, she is an amazing actor, although having her act in such dark films that she would not be legally allowed to watch for the next six or seven years raises some interesting moral questions for her parents or legal tutors to answer.But well, we are seeing a piece of entertainment, so let us judge it by its own value. I read some other comments and do not really understand why 'Hide and Seek' got that badly beaten by other viewer. It starts as a psychological story, of a child traumatized by the suicide death of her mother. Her father moves in the country to help her, but as you can imagine the change in scene will not help and will not leave to a quiet development. The girl seems to start living in a half imaginative world, strange and stranger things seem to happen, and the relationship between the father and daughter turns ugly. It is quite easy to smell the double personality trick, but when it comes it comes in logic. The comparison with 'Secret Window' is immediate, and although De Niro does not get to the level of deepness that Johny Depp reached there, he is quite good in his portrayal of the bereaved father, different from his usual formula.Without being very original, 'Hide and Seek' is credible, well acted, and did not seem to fall into ridicule at any moment.The defense rests its case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The blow up credibility phrase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is excellent except for 1 very, big mistake. A simple phrase that blow up all the movie credibility. David and Charlie doesn't know each other. In multi-personality disorder, the person ignores what the other personality does.In the cave, Charlie uses David to foul the psychiatrist (I don't remember her character name) to kill her, that's absolutely impossible! He is saying to her kind of those words: I know, I am sick, I have to be treated, etc... Once again, it is impossible! In a real situation, if David switched from Charlie's place in such location (the cave), he will be just disoriented, asking himself what he is doing there and probably just go back in his house.It is sad, I believed in the story up to that fatal mistake. How come the great De Niro didn't notice that in the scenario?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It cuts this reviewer to the quick, that one of our living legends of acting has now decided to let his skills go flabby, settling for the big, fat paycheck instead of a big, fat role that at least gives us a glimmer of the man who created such memorable icons as Travis Bickle and the young Vito Corleone, and brought to roaring life real life figures like Jake LaMotta and Al Capone. To be fair, his role in "THE SCORE" was the last time we saw a flicker of the brilliance of "old-school" De Niro, galvanized by the mere presence of the late Marlon Brando, (as big as Orson Welles in his decline, yet still as mesmerizing.) Well, this latest stab in the heart for his fans is not the most painful (see "THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE" for that...if you can look at yourself afterward), but it cribs from everything from "THE GOOD SON" to "DON'T SAY A WORD" and "THE BAD SEED". In short: calling it derivative would actually be paying it a glowing complement.De Niro sleepwalks through his role as Dr. David Callaway, a psychologist whose beautiful wife (Amy Irving) has committed suicide, with their young daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning) witnessing it all. For Emily's sake, David decides that a move to the country is in order, to give her a chance to mourn, heal and start life over again.Which never happens in these potboilers, of course. Emily does a complete one-eighty instead, regressing into her own little world, where she finds a new friend in an 'imaginary' playmate named Charlie, who apparently is not a very nice friend, to put it mildly...Okay, and I'm going to stop right there. The producers went to some unbelievable lengths to safeguard the "twist" ending of this mess, (somewhere, William Castle is having a great belly-laugh), but the only way you won't figure it out in the first twenty minutes, is if you have never seen thrillers like "IDENTITY", "THE OTHERS", "WHAT LIES BENEATH" or more obviously "THE SIXTH SENSE". I read somewhere in another review that the script was so bad that a twelve-year old could've written it. Let's not insult twelve-year-olds, okay? At least someone in that age group could've done something a lot more inventive with this story than first-timer Ari Schlossberg manages (or not).And granted, there isn't much more that's fresh or original that a director can do with kid-in-peril or old-dark-house-in-the-country thrillers. But director John Polson was a heckuva lot more daring and inventive with his acting career than this, (he played a potential boyfriend for Russell Crowe in "THE SUM OF US".) But first "SWIMFAN" and now this??? C'mon, mate, we all need to get paid, but you're not even trying at this point!And this supporting cast...Elizabeth Shue (where have you been?), Melissa Leo, Dylan Baker, Robert John Burke, Famke Janssen...all of this magnificent talent in one place, wasted. At least Amy Irving gets to bow out gracefully, which is certainly a blessing. Doing remarkable things with small cameos is becoming her specialty, and even in train wrecks like this, the strategy serves her well.But it isn't all a waste of time for one reason only: "HIDE AND SEEK" becomes another opportunity to track the burgeoning education and remarkable evolution of Our Next "Meryl Streep"...Dakota Fanning.Not only is this talented little miss landing parts along side some of the industry's top leading men, acting heavyweights and blockbuster barons, but she is literally acting the pants off of them. Bobby De Niro is just the latest notch in a trophy belt that includes Sean Penn, Mike Myers, Denzel Washington and Tom Cruise. Every scene she shares with De Niro is one she literally slips into her back pocket and walks away with, and he doesn't even seem to notice! Tackling her parts with the same natural grace that Jodie Foster possessed at her age, she is also as skilled at handling the weightier aspects of said roles. The closest we've come to seeing her in her own "TAXI DRIVER" was the "MAN ON FIRE" remake, but if and when such a controversial part comes her way, we are now on notice that this little titan of a thespian will be able to meet the challenge with ease.Which is why "HIDE AND SEEK" gets six stars from me, instead of the four I would otherwise be duty-bound to rate it. Dakota is now and continues to be a pure joy to watch. I can only hope that she won't have to rise above yet another fallen acting great, in another turkey like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't listen to horror bashing critics!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's official, no critic knows how to properly enjoy a horror or sci-fi action movie anymore! They just refuse to get scared and nitpick like surgeons. In my opinion, this horror movie is right on caliber with a movie like The Ring. Rather than just the basic humdrum horror movie plot line, the plot had a satisfying twist with a sort of Gollum/Smeagol kind of thing. De Niro was a great as ever, displaying that he can effective be goofy in a comedy role, but dead serious in a horror film role such as this. As for Dakota Fanning, her acting job was right on par with Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. It's one of those things that make you amazed that she's only 11 years old. In addition, the movie effectively adds throw back to old horror movies by giving childhood songs like "Mockingbird" a sinister feeling. As for the ending, those who decide to critique this movie right after walking out of the theater need to rent the DVD, because there are 5 different alternate endings! 3 of which will make your spine tingle! My only complaint might be how the movie at times could get repetitive in ideas, such as dead bodies in a bathtub. However, the reasoning behind it all makes all the more exciting! Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good thrill!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dakota Fanning and Robert De Niro in Hide and Seek is probably one of the best matches for a movie like that I can think of. I was expecting a horror movie, but then as it went further it didn't really scary me just kind of got the adrenaline pumping, so I like to call it a good thriller instead of Horror.Anyways to move on Dakota Fanning is so good in this movie, her scared performances and so well done, now I wouldn't say she UPSTAGED Robert De Niro, but she was certainly at the same level as he was, Robert De Niro also put on a great act for it, playing the Dad of a little girl who lost something very important in her life, he plays the part very well.As the movie goes on you meet different characters that are setup perfectly to be Carlie, the thing or person that makes friends with Emily, David then becomes weary of everyone around, which includes, a neighbor who he finds making friend with his little girl in the backyard, a police officer who seems to want to see her and talk to her an awful lot and a home owner who comes by at the wrong time. Sets it up perfectly but the Ending was a twist and a half. Everyone that David meets even an older lady kind of makes you think, but you probably won't see the end coming, once again Dakota gives a 10/10 performances, as does Robert in this movie, it's worth watching, so get some popcorn a good drink, two thumbs up for Hide and Seek, 10/10.Ready or not, here I come.</fullReview>

Repleat with stock characters (creepy neighbor, creepy landlord, creepy sheriff,)stock props(a mysterious cave in the woods behind the house that nobody has trouble finding even in the dark)) the big denouement is as as flat as the suspense throughout the movie.But Fahmeke Jansen looks great in a smallish role as a colleague the Doctor.

		<fullReview>"Hide and Seek" is an above average thriller that deserves to be seen. This reviewer certainly felt that as far as "thrillers" go, this was one of the better ones that have been unleashed upon the masses in a while.Ahhh... life was all too good for little Emily Callaway (Dakota Fanning) until mommy slit her wrists in the bathtub. Now, what what was once a happy go lucky little girl has become an extremely introverted little nut case. She has no friends her own age, barely says a word, and can stare you down with one look of her bulgin baby blues.Of course, Daddy (David) Calloway (Robert De Niro) ain't doin so hot either. He has lost his wife and he's losing his daughter a little more each day; so he packs up and heads upstate.... hoping that change will help his daughter "heal".However, once they move in to the new house, little Emily starts getting kookier by the moment. She shuns Davids attempts to find her new friends, begins closing herself off even more, and develops a new "imaginary" friend named Charlie; who seems to have vengeful motives of his own. The further Charlie's influence begins to affect little Emily, the stranger and stranger things get for poor David. Of course, it all leads to the climactic showdown--which is done in typical thriller fashion.This reviewer enjoyed "Hide and Seek". I have read plenty of reviews that state that this movie was a waste of Deniros and Fannings talent. Thats a real crock of B.S. if you ask me. Deniro and Fanning both turn in subtle then chilling performances. Fanning elicits childlike fear with a cool precision.....and Deniro...well.....Deniro is Deniro and thats good enough for me! They are both very talented and do what they need to make the movie work..Nice supporting roles from Famke Janssen (Dr. Jean Gray from X-men) and Elizabeth Shue help flesh out the storyline nicely.The very -very- very- end of the movie is kind of hokey but the other 98% of the film delivers just what a thriller should. The script is sharp, and not as predictable as previous reviews claim.The film puts a nice little spin on a subject that has been played out before--so while "Hide and Seek" is not entirely original, it is without a doubt thoroughly entertaining and watchable.Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had already read many many reviews on this movie before watching it, and many were very bad, which is why I expected a poor movie.However, when I watched it, I was actually surprised and quite enjoyed the movie. The first half hour was fairly disappointing, but after things started to get a little tense, the movie began to improve.It starts with Allison Callaway (Amy Irving) playing a small game of Hide and Seek with her daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning). After Allison has tucked Emily up, and after Emily's father David (Robert DeNiro), who is a psychologist, goes to sleep, Allison does something that would change the family's lives forever.David wakes at 2.06am, and sees a light coming from the bathroom. When he gets up to investigate, he pulls open the bath's curtain to see Allison dead in her own blood-bath. She had committed suicide. And from the doorway you can see Emily, just watching with an expressionless face...After Allison's death, David decides to move away to Woodland, New York, with Emily. The house is very large and surrounded by woods, a typical horror story setting. For the first few days, Emily does literally nothing. She is traumatised by her mother's death, and begins to start to act strangely. She throws her doll, with whom she had been clinging to for so long, in the bin, and informs her father she has a new friend by the name of Charlie.David is happy for his daughter at first; playing with an imaginary friend may keep her from thinking about her mother's death for a while. But then David realises that Charlie isn't imaginary. He keeps doing awful things that terrifies nine-year-old Emily until she doesn't want to play anymore. But Charlie won't stop. They become involved in the deadliest game of Hide and Seek possible. Ready or not... here he comesI stand by what I said at the beginning of this review. It wasn't as bad as I thought, there are some elements of this movie that are very interesting and unique. However, the star of this show wasn't Robert DeNiro, as most would expect it to be. It wasn't Famke Janssen playing Katherine, it wasn't Elisabeth Shue playing Elizabeth. No, it was Dakota Fanning playing Emily. Dakota has pretty much received the most credit for this movie, and is excellent in every movie she's in.Overall, this movie wasn't that bad, but it wasn't stunning either. I'd recommend it to fan's of Dakota Fanning and people that like fairly creepy horror movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The filmmakers of the hideous psychological thriller "Hide and Seek" should hide and seek help right away. It's hard to find entertainment in this appalling "Hide and Seek" cinematic game. Robert Deniro stars as David Callaway, a grieving widow who alienates his 9-year old daughter and himself from the hectic New York big city lifestyle to the tranquil upstate New York countryside. Dakota Fanning, the poster child of child actresses, plays the young offspring Emily Callaway. She suffers from distress, depression, and detachment because of her mother's recent suicidal demise. Therefore, David feels that a more serene society would benefit Emily. Bad idea! Emily befriends an imaginary playmate named Charlie. Sir Charles pressures Emily to do horrific acts of violence, or in other words pressures her be one of "Charlie's Devils". Director John Polson undoubtedly inserts scenes influenced by such thrillers as "The Sixth Sense", "The Shining", and "The Omen". However, I could not find the suspenseful mastery of "Hide and Seek" which the aforementioned films possessed. The screenplay of "Hide and Seek" was also one-one thousand, two-one thousand, and three-one thousand worse than of those stellar flicks. So hide the women &amp; children and seek mental help if you encounter the boredom of this snoozer! ** Needs Improvement</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"EMILY? EMILY? EM'? EMILY!!!!!!" (creak, creak)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to confess. I began laughing at some point in the film. Not at Amy Irving's delicately dark portrayal of a woman trapped in God-knows-what misery. This odd concoction kept my interest, but, God help me, kept getting funnier and funnier. I was never invested in these characters so the suspense didn't kill me when they were in jeopardy. I was laughing and saying, "Take them all away to the loony bin! They're all nuts!" Everything was laden with psychiatric geegaws, like the whole cast was from the Day Room at Psych 2! Elizabeth Shue's wardrobe, on all three separate occasions she appears, was so low-cut I'm surprised De Niro didn't offer to treat her for a breast fetish. The kid moped and was silent. There were so many dead stops where she doesn't answer questions or greetings that you wish people would just quit talking to her! Everybody was pussyfooting around treating her so gently, that I hoped somebody would scream, "STOP IT, EMILY! SNAP OUT OF IT!" It isn't until the end that we realize WHY she clams up, poor devil, with her hyper-fervid eyes protruding out of her head and her penchant for morbid drawings of herself and her invisible maniac friend "Charlie." You'll enjoy this movie if you like to see a bonkers kid get tucked into bed a dozen times with identical pillow talk from three different adults who must have been raised in the same Group Nuthatch. You'll like it if you wanna play hide-and-seek and hear De Niro incessantly calling, "Emily? Emily? Em?" with doors squeaking and winds ululating. It's a long, languid fright in the night, especially at 2:06 a.m.. I don't see how the De Niro Clan could go to the bathroom in that house. Nights, the bathroom door is bathed in light and critters, human and non, keep croaking in his tub. If you enjoy seeing a look of consternation embed itself on De Niro's face, this film is your baby. (Maybe he is just constipated.) He proclaims he's going to be a full-time Dad to his near-catatonic daughter and what does he do? He takes her to a strange new manse in the country, where she wanders around like a wraith while he plasters a headset on his ears and plays jazz so loudly he can't hear the kid or people knocking and walking in! He keeps fooling with a TELESCOPE, a very good one, brought from the city where, what?, he used it to track his voyeur clients? In the boonies, he uses it to observe his sorrowing neighbors. De Niro, supposedly, is a psychologist, counselor to all manner of troubled folk for many years, given his age! Have a cathartic laugh. The swarms of psychiatric personnel are inundated with their own psychoses and blind spots in this movie. That is one reason I liked it - seeing the Behavior Police overwhelm and suffer! There is a "good" psychologist/colleague of De Niro's, Famke Janssen, who is so sweet, she should be canonized. She's evidently been working cheek-by-jowl with De Niro for years and has NEVER picked up anything at all strange about him. But she finds lots of neuroses in the spooky child, who is so eerie with those bulging orbs the janitor could diagnose trouble. This movie is a psychiatric hoot. The neighbor lady, Melissa Leo, is a real doll and the movie's only normal human being, and is handling the recent death of her little girl with grace. Her husband, said to be goofy with grief, appears to be just fine. To these people, De Niro shows no warmth except when he thinks to advance his crumbling perceptions in this wooded Community from Hell and goes next door to fraternize, briefly. The canny neighbor woman WISELY refuses his attempt to give them counsel. He'd certainly have brought them CLOSURE! Haha. Her instincts, unlike the saintly lady shrink's and Elizabeth "Decollete" Shue's, are true! I have never seen glass and a window frame break so quickly, and catapult a woman effortlessly thru a window in the little girl's bedroom, with Bug-Eyes looking on. "Em? Emily? Emily? Em' Em'?" Soggy cat, crimson bath waters, bloody printed expostulations worthy of a demented kindergartner on the tub surround, swinging metal lamps that squeak in the night, light bulbs on strings in basement a la "Psycho", with empty cot at the ready - a perfect John Wayne Gacey sublet - this movie has something for everyone. But, above all, it tickled my funny bone! I loved the end, where the Wacko Arch-Villain, in that special inflatable yellow jacket, dies in the dingy, dank, dark drink of a convenient nearby cavern. The defunct Villain was kept afloat, amid a sea of mutilated baby dolls, so a great profile could be shot. The last scene of the movie foreshadows future psychiatric eruptions for the Saintly Lady Colleague to handle. It doesn't look good. But we somehow know that if this Dr. is dispatched by the "Evil Eye" progeny she has chosen to mother, she WILL go to Psychiatric Heaven with Freud, Jung, De Niro (he wasn't responsible for his actions, after all) and Dr. Spock. At long last,in "Hide and Seek," the shrinks and psychologists are outed! This is one cathartic anti-Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual movie. How about a sequel featuring that lovely neighbor lady writing a self-help book entitled, "Baked Goods Are Better Than Half-Baked Therapies?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never thought I'd say this, but why cast Robert DeNiro?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those creepy little thrillers about a weird kid who whispers scary little comments while terrible things happen in the middle of the night. That Dakota Fanning is quickly filling the void that Haley Joel Osment left when he got to old for these sorts of roles. And she's pretty good. Admittedly, I've never seen her play anything other than a weird scary kid, but she's pretty good at it, and she's not the problem with the movie. No, the problem comes with our main character, her father. This guy does so many stupid and illogical things throughout the course of this movie that there is absolutely no way to be pulling for him. I mean, what is this? Passive parenting 101? Your daughter just messed up the bathroom and wrote insulting things about your dead wife on the walls. I think you'd get angry! Of course, in movies like this, there maybe something they're not telling us... or it may just be bad writing! But the real problem with this movie is the very presence of Robert DeNiro. Sure, he's made some bad movies recently, but he still has this aura of quality around him, which makes it impossible to enjoy a movie that is so distinctly not-quality. There are plenty of great actors who fit in just fine in B-movies and can make this stuff believable. But Robert DeNiro is such a good actor that it feels a little embarrassing to watch him in such an obviously sub-par movie. Maybe stick Gary Oldman in the lead... Jim Carrey might have been interesting. But Robert DeNiro? Somehow I can't get around the fact the he just shouldn't be doing movies like this.Finally, there's the plot twist. The simple fact is that most plot twists suck. I challenge anybody to actually explain how (or why) the killer would have actually done the things that occurred in this movie. Oh, sure, I can understand in the logic of a silly B-movie, but when you put Robert DeNiro in the lead, I just expect more for my $$$.Finally, a note for Famke Jannsen. I'm a big fan. I fell in love with you when you were doing really fun but cheesy movies (MODEL BY DAY, GOLDENEYE, HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL). I then liked when you moved into smaller roles so you could work with really quality people (Robert Altman, Branagh, and so forth). But what is with these middle-of-the-road crap-fests like DON'T SAY A WORD and this? Dammit, you're wasting your talents. Maybe if you could have had the lead, this would have been worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoilers) I rented this movie on Friday night with high hopes that it would be a truly scary psychological thriller. The beginning was good with the audience trying to guess who or what is Charlie and the mysterious killings and the little girl blaming all of them on Charlie. But then the ending came with the father being Charlie all along. Once they revealed that the father had a split personality, that just ruined the whole evening. Everything went well until that stupid ending and I feel really sorry for Fanning mostly, she is probably the best child actress I've seen since Drew Barrymore in her early years but now she has this flop to make a blot on her resume. Follow my advice people and save you're money on a better movie or a book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HIDE AND SEEK Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSFollowing his wife's tragic death, a New York psychologist (Robert DeNiro) takes his 9 year old daughter (Dakota Fanning) and relocates to a remote house in the country, where the little girl acquires an 'imaginary friend' who seems intent on ruining her father's life.Mild, inconsequential thriller in which DeNiro's widowed protagonist engages in psychological conflict with a rebellious child who appears to blame him for the loss of her mother. Perhaps because it IS so mild, the climactic revelations aren't nearly as shocking as director John Polson and screenwriter Ari Schlossberg might have hoped, and the narrative builds to a lacklustre conclusion. DeNiro is miscast as the 'saintly' psychologist who tolerates his daughter's worst excesses, and the glossy production values are wasted. Also starring Famke Janssen as a fellow psychologist, and a virtually unrecognizable Amy Irving as DeNiro's ill-fated wife. Casual viewers will get their money's worth, but die-hard horror fans are urged to look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert De Niro must of needed some quick loot. This thriller has its frights, and is paced well, which I can appreciate. I have to say I enjoyed this movie, up until the twist that is, which is without any evidence (save some dirt or bug guts on 'his' hand). The acting was good, though Hollywood-average, nothing memorable or ground-breaking, performance-wise.Alter-ego twists only work, IMO, when there is subtle yet substantial evidence towards the truth. This film lacked that entirely. If this was a b-grade movie, then the plot holes would be more forgivable. Nice sets, textbook-cinematography, and big name actors won't save this from being a wasted watch, and a waste of millions of dollars. Reminds me of the overrated M. Night Shyamalan thrillers. "That's the twist?! But I knew that already..." - Me, watching this film.</fullReview>

Dakota portrays Emily Callaway as creepy, sneaky, vulnerable and scared really convincingly.It has all the horror film clichés - isolated house, dark woods, damp cellar, etc. but very well done with plenty of 'try to remember to breathe' suspense and a great sting in the tail.Certainly an original and very nasty storyline that examines really difficult subjects like suicide, grief, mental illness, family inter-relationships and infidelity.Well worth seeing for an intelligent dose of the heebie jeebies!</fullReview>

The film does keep you guessing as to who or what the imaginary friend really is which was good. But when the film is over and you think about it. It just doesn't add up.

I would have much preferred to find out why the couple next door were arguing and what REALLY happened to their daughter! Maybe give her an imaginary friend as well eh? Instead they get to the end and cant think of a decent Charlie so they just pin it off with split personality! Disgraceful! I was really disappointed!

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Hide and Seek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Would Dakota Fanning be the next Natalie Portman, or Christina Ricci? It's not a longshot, given the credible performance here in Hide and Seek. I still remembered that she managed to stand on her own against the enigmatic Denzel Washington in Man on Fire, and here, she does a commendable job beside veteran Robert De Niro.The premise of the show suggests suspense, thrills and maybe something of the supernatural perhaps? It explores the relationship between a psychologist and his daughter, after their wife/mother died in a suicide, or is it? What is the impact to a child who witnesses the death of a parent? Whilst the blood and gore are kept to a minimum, what you can't see actually sends shivers to you. The buildup shows a lot of potential, but too many red herrings and the pacing at the end leaves much to be desired. Any alert movie goer will anticipate and guessed the twist that is offered halfway through the film, and once that is done, the narrative seems to drag itself into an ending.Robert De Niro breezes through his role - nothing new to offer here, whilst Famke Janssen and Elizabeth Shue up the babe factor.Watch this not expecting a tight narrative or a shocking ending, but watch this for Fanning's performance.</fullReview>

(the mom killed herself) there is a lot of mistakes but the only reason I gave it an 8 is because I'd only watch it once or twice.

		<shortDescription>Actually a little disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever spoilers within are also revealed in the trailer:Hide and Seek is a tale about a Psychologist who after finding his wife has committed suicide, decides to move into the country with his little girl in hopes that a change of scenery will help pull her out of her deep depression. Shortly after moving in it becomes abundantly clear that the girl is becoming steadily more disturbed, because strange things begin to happen, dolls disfigured and mutilated, cryptic messages written in the bathroom, all of which she blames on her imaginary friend "Charlie". However, as things progress, one begins to suspect, then becomes aware that Charlie is not imaginary after all. Robert DiNero's performance, as Well as Dakota Fanning's(I hope I got her name right?), are both strong. He is very believable as a grieving widower trying to keep himself and his daughter from falling apart. Elizabeth Shue is effective, but her role is more of a plot device than a challenge.Perhaps the main reason I didn't rank this movie higher was the fact that the ending didn't quite live up to the buildup. It also smacks very strongly of another recent release, which I won't mention here, because the connection is so strong you will immediately guess the ending. I hate to be so cryptic, but the similarities are so striking that someone in the audience that was so stoned they thought the slide-show advertisements they show before the credits were absolutely hilarious, was still alert enough to blurt out, "hey, this is just like *********". This is not a metaphor either, it actually happened.Another thing that casts a shadow over this review, is early into the movie I thought I had the twist ending figured out. Unfortunately, by the end, I still liked the twist I had thought up better, because the one the movie actually provides didn't strike me as all that original. And as you can tell by reading this, I'm not exactly John Stiebeck, and if I can dream up something better, I'm not congratulating myself so much as complaining about the product.Anyway, this isn't a terrible movie. In fact it's pretty good in many ways, but if your like me the ending will leave you a little flat. My advice, only pay a matinée price, or perhaps rent the DVD. It's worth seeing, but not for 8+$.</fullReview>

The problem is that the entire film is just a distorted version of Secret Window, the fairly recent Johnny Depp flick inspired by a Stephen King novella. If you've seen Secret Window, than I've just given the ending to Hide and Seek away, but in any case, neither of these two films were that good. As far as the acting goes, there is simply a lot of wasted talent. Again, the film isn't absolutely horrible, but it certainly would be if it weren't for the exceptional cast. DeNiro is... well, he's DeNiro. Fanning, while suitably creepy throughout the film, truly shines when the big twist is revealed and the climax ensues. Famke is an entirely underrated talent and it saddens me to think she was given such a small part. In any case, it's not bad to watch, but only if you have money to throw away, otherwise save your cash for something better.</fullReview>

The set-up was well-done, but the last 20 minutes were more than a bit disappointing.Robert DeNiro does a decent job as a psychologist and father, but has been much better many times before. Dakota Fanning continues to shine on the big screen. Her role here could not have been played any better. Famke Janssen and Elisabeth Shue have supporting roles, and do as much as they can with the material they were provided. Other supporting cast was not horrible, but not memorable either. The directing was passable.The large problem with this film was the screenplay. The pacing was slow, which can be quite effective if done correctly. It was not done correctly here. The plot was disjointed, and several things about the film do not make sense. The 'pay-off' was horrible, predictable, and not particularly interesting. There is no real explanation as to why the ending occurred as it did. I can't go into more detail without spoilers, but the viewer will understand upon watching.There were several 'jump' moments in the film, and there was some tension at a few points. Overall, though, I couldn't say it was scary.I can't recommend more than a rental for this film, and the rental would only be to see Dakota Fanning's performance. Score - 5/10</fullReview>

So why did she keep talking to her father as if Charlie was someone different ? Why did she help Charlie kill the Elizabeth Shue character ?

		<shortDescription>Not a Commonly Played Game in Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All right, well the premise is interesting--a little girl with a dark imaginary friend who is there to play a specific game. There is an ominous and gloomy atmosphere in this film, and that is what makes it better than a few other thrillers. The moments of silence and the dialogue is actually scarier than the actions themselves, and this is where the praise for Fanning comes into play. She proves her good acting skills here as she is very haunting with the creepy goth look. This is not a movie in which everyone will like. It does not aim to scare us; it wants to disturb and play with our minds rather. If you do not like films that do this, then this one is not for you. That is probably the main reason that the critics did not like it, but let me tell you that this movie is not a common one. I kept calling it atypical, which it is because they could have taken this in a lot of different directions, but they chose quite an unusual one. That is not a commonly played game in films, and that is a reason I liked this. To a lot of people, this will be confusing and seem not to make sense, but I will say right now that it makes complete sense when you sum it up. And once you do sum it up, the story seems even more interesting. It makes you want to go back and perhaps see it one more time. The bad thing about this movie is that there were unnecessary scenes and characters that were only distractions from the main events that were occurring. Other than that, I will have to say that the film is fair overall. It is not the best, but it is worth watching at least a second time. Go out, go out wherever you are and see this movie if you are a fan of remotely interesting thrillers =)6.6/10 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Contains Spoilers*'Hide and Seek' is a solid 6 out of 10 stars movie. DeNiro plays a father who takes his daughter to the country after his wife commits suicide. His daughter befriends a 'friend' named Charlie. You don't really know if Charlie is a ghost or one of the few town's people. This movie is more of a thriller/mystery than a horror flick as there is only violence in the ending. I was surprised to see that DeNiro had his split personalities going on but also disappointed. He gave the best performance he could with the roles he was given, I guess I just expected a little more from him. Besides having a pretty normal plot the only problems I had with the movie is that it didn't explain some things. Like when DeNiro looked through the telescope and saw the woman screaming at nothing (since you could see the husband sitting in the other room calmly watching the TV)! Also, when DeNiro goes to visit the neighbors the wife mentions that she lost her child and starts to go into detail about her husband &amp; her problems. She suddenly stops and says she can't talk about it anymore. What is that about?The only thing I had to say after I saw the movie was "I liked it better when they called it Secret Window".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just my luck... last night I wasted valuable time watching the remake of Dark Water. Tonight I have scraped the barrel further still with Hide and Seek. I really should have guessed, since the DVD proudly boasts that it 'includes 4 alternate endings not seen in the cinemas' ? a dead giveaway that the movie is going to suck (get a bad test screening ? film a new ending. Get another bad test screening ? film another ending).Despite a talented cast, including Robert De Niro, Dakota Fanning, Elisabeth Shue and Famke Janssen, Hide and Seek remains a dreary mess, devoid of atmosphere and lacking any fresh ideas whatsoever.After the death of his wife, David Calloway (De Niro) and his daughter Emily (Fanning) move to the country to start anew. But before long, they are terrorised by Emily's new friend Charlie, who may or may not be imaginary, but who is definitely out to cause trouble...This film is 96 minutes of pure Hollywood garbage. Neither 'creepy' nor 'disturbing' (as claimed on the cover), Hide and Seek lacks the ability to scare, even with the old 'cat leaping out of the cupboard' routine. De Niro is bad to the point of being laughable, Elisabeth Shue is totally wasted in a role that amounts to no more than 'victim, and Fanning just stares a lot. Most annoying, for me, is the inclusion of the line 'come out, come out, wherever you are', De Niro's famous quote from the infinitely better Cape Fear, which is repeated by several characters and is no doubt considered as some kind of 'in joke'.Those who can be bothered to stay the distance and actually discover who Charlie is, will be treated to one of the lamest 'twist' endings in recent cinema history. Be warned - Hide and Seek is tired and weak!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hide and Seek" is one of those movies where you can only enjoy it if you know absolutely nothing about it ahead of time. I couldn't have predicted what would happen. David Callaway (Robert DeNiro) and his daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) move to a small town after his wife Allison (Amy Irving) commits suicide. But when David and Emily move into their new house, strange things begin to happen, all of which apparently relate to Emily's imaginary friend Charlie.Okay, so the people-move-into-house-and-abnormal-occurrences-follow idea has been used more times than anyone can count, but the performances keep this movie afloat. DeNiro naturally does a good job, as do Famke Janssen and Elisabeth Shue. And Fanning, despite her "cute" reputation, actually looks pretty creepy.So come out, come out, wherever you are, and see what you think of "Hide and Seek".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Piece of Grade "A" Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so sick of these "wannabe Hitchcock" filmmakers with their cartoon characters and cardboard plots I think I'm going to snap a cork and become one of their cartoon villains. The only thing more sickening is respectable actors who don't need the money lowering themselves to take the roles and get these scripts made. There is not an ounce of realistic character development in this film. Do yourself a favor and save your money. Don't even take the DVD if someone gives it to you free.Thank you very much Hollywood for a complete piece of crap and a waste of my money. I have a good mind to sue for my DVD rental fee. And then they're surprised that box office sales are down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just something to help pass the time - nothing special, but much better than "Godsend."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hide and Seek" is yet another supposed psychological thriller that deals with something I can't mention, since doing so would ruin the end of the film (not that you won't have guessed the ending waaay ahead of time). Most surprising of all is that the finale has become such a cliché in Hollywood that they're no longer delivering the "shock" endings with finesse ? I found the final revelation in "Hide and Seek" rather lackluster.No, seriously, the movie isn't half bad ? at least not as bad as it could easily have been. Sure, there are some logical gaps. The ending goes on far too long, a few loose threads are left dangling, etc. But the acting is good, the direction is apt and the dialogue isn't as terrible as I had expected."Hide and Seek" is like the good version of last year's "Godsend." Neither are excellent films, but one of them is below mediocre and the other is lukewarm and, at the least, entertaining. The other? isn't.Robert De Niro isn't out to win any awards, but he delivers a fine and believable performance (save the last fifteen minutes) as a concerned parent whose troubled pre-teen daughter (Dakota Fanning) is taking a liking to violent drawings and sick mind games after her mother commits suicide in the opening scenes of the film. De Niro moves with his daughter to the countryside, out of the big city, where he tries to provide her a "normal life." Unfortunately in her new home she makes friends with "Charlie," an imaginary pal who might not actually be so imaginary after all.De Niro isn't worried until people start dying and cops are banging on his door asking questions about missing people. Windows mysteriously open by themselves, doors are left ajar, and his daughter begins to play hide and seek with her best friend Charlie, who doesn't like to be discussed about with other humans."Hide and Seek" is hardly offensive and it's instantly forgettable. It's intended as a piece of entertainment, nothing more and nothing less. No, it's not De Niro's best performance but he isn't on auto pilot, either ? I thought he was better here than he has been in some time and his interaction with Fanning (one of the all-time best child actors) is convincing, to say the least. The dialogue is pretty realistic most of the time (it's a movie that doesn't shy away from revealing the dark sides of parenting) and the direction isn't as hackneyed as "Godsend." Overall "Hide and Seek" is nothing special, but it's a great deal better than "Godsend" and nothing particularly substantial ? just something to help pass a couple hours when you've got nothing better to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hide And Seek first appears to be a thrilling movie. It starts off really well. DeNiro gives a good performance throughout this film. But sadly it doesn't end with the same thrilling chill it started with. It starts off with a bang but doesn't pay off. It just kinda conks out like my 1975 Chevy Malibu. Not even the gas fumes can get this clunker across the finish line. What started out as a very promising film, turned into the dozens we've all seen just like it. I won't tell anyone to pass it up, but I really wish I had waited for it to be release on cable. This was definitely a one time viewer for me. Once is all I need to learn my lesson. I really wish I had went to Ladder 49 instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From viewing the trailer i thought this was going to be an exciting successful film..... also the actors that star in it who have been in other films i thought was going to make this an entertaining film to watch however, from viewing the whole film i found it to be a disappointment. I felt that the film was dragged out and didn't capture my imagination from the start which i feel a successful film needs to be able to do that... As all horror films it has th 'scary' building up background music when something is going to occur which i felt was repetitive and there was nothing unique about this film. I felt that the enigma of who the character 'Charlie' wasn't to clear to the audience.... because when the scenes move from the basement to another point it could make people wonder if there are two characters playing the dad and Charlie however they look the same..... and the women in the basement who ends up with the little girl gave the dad a tape which could have made him think differently and made him kill all these people....the other question unanswered is at the end of the film the camera slowly moves into the drawing that the little girl has done of her with her head doubled which could make people think that it could have been her who helped Charlie kill these people in the film.....I think the reason for them making so many unanswered questions in this film is in case they want to make hide n seek 2...... which may answer the questions that have been left unanswered for the audience... which i suppose could be seen as a positive point... i just felt it was disappointing because the parts that were picked out to produce the trailer made this film look somewhat scary,jumpy and entertaining.... however i feel the trailer seemed more grabbing then the film itself from my point of view...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hide and Seek is came from the hand of the man whose directed Swimfan. Considering as a little thriller, Hide and Seek is a rare gem. Cast is dynamic, such as Robert DeNiro, Dakota Fanning, Famke Janssen and Elisabeth Shue. Every cast is playing their role respectively, especially Ms. Fanning, what a scary little girl. Meanwhile, Mr. DeNiro a bit stereotypical, but fine.The plot can be so deceiving, is it a supernatural event occurs or what? Well, without spoiling the plot, it more like The Sixth Sense meet The Shining, but in a good cause. The atmosphere is well build. The tension is medium to high.As a underrated flick, Hide and Seek is a fun ride. Watch it, and you won't disappointing.</fullReview>

The story begins with David(Robert Deniro) who is a doctor, and his daughter Emily(Dakota Fanning) move from the city to the country, after the sudden suicide of her mother(Amy Irving). Emily shuts herself off motionless. They meet new friends, and things seem to be going okay so far. That is until Emily claims she meet a new friend named Charlie. David believes that he is imaginary. Until a series of tragic events seem to center around them. And we half to ask, Is Charlie real, or is Emily crazy? Robert Deniro and Dakota Fanning give top notch performances. It is quite suspenseful. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I call it the best tribute movie of all time because there was not one second of originality in the entire film. The movie contains what I like to call the "Trifecta" of clichéd horror movies.1) Long drawn out moments of loosely tied "clues" that have absolutely nothing to do with the movie plot. 2) The classic cheesy horror movie line, "Hide and Seek this dirt bag"?um what? 3) The typical opening for the regurgitated sequelSeriously, I call this a "tribute" movie because if you have ever seen: Secret Window; The Shining; The Sixth Sense or Psycho then you have seen this theatrical masterpiece. Here let me run it down for you?Mom kills herself and is discovered by dad and kid-dad figures instead of professional help he should pack up everything and move to some freaked out version of Mayberry in the middle of the woods-decides to buy a ridiculously huge Bates motel house for him and his daughter-the creepy neighbors continue to bother him with jelly and terrible dialogue-dad meets hot single chick (a.k.a. gold digger) who is promptly met with seriously disturbed kid with an imaginary friend known as Charlie-blah, blah, blah?dead cat, dead gold digger?inharmonious moments?BAM-there is a sixth sense revelation where DeNiro realizes he is the Charlie-bimbo to the rescue-cheesy line (see #2)-end of movie.Do yourself a favor, save some money, stay home and watch paint dry.

		<fullReview>I Have seen a lot of movies in my time. As I was growing up, I never really gave it any thought about criticizing movies that I saw, cause back then, when I was a kid, I enjoyed going to the movies. Now that I'm an adult and knowing how much the price of a theater ticket is now-a-days, I can't help BUT Criticize movies. Hide &amp; Seek I gave a 5 rating because I happen to like Robert De Niro. On the other hand, the movie has long episodes where nothing much happens and "CLICHES!" Talk about clichés, After I saw the movie, "Fight Club" which I thought was a very good movie, and then seeing "Secret Window," which was also not bad, until I saw the ending, then compared "Hide &amp; Seek," I often wonder if Hollywood will ever stop making movies that share thoughts from other writers. That is why I recommend watching it when it comes on HBO or Showtime and don't waste your money renting it or going to the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>too fake, too disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't take this movie seriously. No one in the theater could take this movie seriously. DeNiro is wasting his talent on these creepy kid movies. Hide and Seek is a very dull horror movie, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.While it has its chills and thrills, it doesn't particularly entertain. The audience laughed at Fanning's anti-social mortified character when they were supposed to be disturbed. And when the movie was disturbing, that's all it amounted up to. Hide and Seek eludes to a lot of sick things but never quite shows you the whole story.I didn't cringe or close my eyes the whole film, but the movie left a sour taste in my mouth. I just didn't like it. It comes to a conclusion but the pieces aren't all there. I think the director tried so hard to creep you out it came out as very fake, and that's why there were some chuckles throughout the theater.Trust me, even if you are a fan of this kind of stuff, avoid Hide and Seek. It always tries too hard, or doesn't try hard enough - and the result is a very offset horror flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One is led to believe this film is of supernatural origin, not so. I will not give away the plot in consideration of the audience. If you are expecting some creature to jump out of the closet, you will be very disappointed. If you are in for something in the line of Psycho, you will find this film very interesting. This is a simple film made complicated by the moody and very good acting by the films two leads. Robert Deniro is one of our generation's great actors, but he is overkill in this part. I think an unknown would've been more convincing in the role of the concerned father. Dakota Fanning on the other hand was fantastic in her part. Her acting gets better with every film she does. Her range in roles surpass even those way beyond her years. One must watch her performance in the tele-series TAKEN. She carries that film. Her deep set eyes haunts the viewers long after they leave the theater. I suggest that she play Wednesday Adams if they make another ADAM'S FAMILY movie. All things considered, I would recommend this film. If you are more of the simple minded / no imagination type audience, stay away.</fullReview>

I believe at this point she told him of who Charlie really was because this would only make sense of the part where the neighbors are fighting in their room and pointing towards Emily's house. The husband had told the wife of the encounter and the wife was trying to portray her husband into contacting the police. The next day David walks over and greets her and she breaks down talking of her late daughter but i believe she really is crying because she wants to tell the truth. She says to him "I've already said too much" but really has revealed nothing to David that is too much. She was going to tell him who Charlie really was but they just want you to think that her husband is the crazy one and misguide you to the real Charlie.

Father and daughter then move out to the country with hopes of starting life anew, but Emily still remains mentally traumatized from the loss of her mother to the point of inventing her own twisted imaginary friend with a taste for vengeance, named Charlie. It isn't long before dad's already pained life is slowly turned even more upside down by a series of inexplicable happenings and fatalities that make him doubt his own child's sanity.A deadly serious, solid and well-directed thriller with horrific elements that did not disappoint by the time it reached its final revelation (which worked completely for me). At first there wasn't all that much to admire except for a very fine Robert DeNiro performance that seemed to be wasted on a somewhat aimless movie that didn't want to venture anywhere; but by sticking with it, things gradually came together in the final mix for an entertaining experience. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie. Not high enough to warrant seeing it the day it was released but all the same I was hoping for a nice suspenseful thriller. I thought my hopes were justified given the starring cast of Robert DeNiro and Dakota Fanning but when all was said and done the movie fell well under my expectations. When the big surprise at the end happened, I wasn't that surprised and knew full well how the rest of the movie would play out. Not to say I totally saw the ending coming, in fact I didn't. But the twist just didn't have the desired effect. I didn't gasp, it didn't make me shift in my seat, it simply made me happy knowing that soon enough this movie would come to an end.I wouldn't say that this was a bad movie. It was far from bad. But for a suspense thriller to work, it has to be really good. And this movie was definitely not "really good".</fullReview>

Soon his daughter begins interacting with a seemingly "imaginary" friend, and soon that friend gets violent.Anyone who has seen the recent crop of Hollywood suspense thrillers will know exactly how this movie will end, and to make matters worse, the finale degenerates into a slasher film. Apparently, the same story recycled over and over is the extent of Hollywood's imagination these days. The direct-to-video, B movie circuit offers much more imaginative stories than what we find here.The film's strongest asset is exceptionally good performances by Robert De Niro and Dakota Fanning, who hold our attention enough to make us want to sit through the tedium.** out of ****</fullReview>

Who is the killer and who is the victim? Both questions are variations of the same theme. Here's a clue to screen writers: This idea is no longer original and viewers will recognize it as ripped-off from 6th Sense.When the audience can predict what's going to happen all sense of fear is lost. We can predict this film because it's so formulaic. Let's try something original, OK?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, but worth seeing for Dakota Fanning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, with far too many movies this season, the trailer is the best part of the movie. Unfortunately, the same holds true for "Hide and Seek." I won't summarize the plot here; so many IMDb users write long synopses instead of writing reviews. I won't spoil the plot or give away the ending. I will break it down into the Good and Bad.GOOD: 1) Dakota Fanning - What a great little actress! Never fails to delight. Her 'Emily' is a very sympathetic character, and Dakota steals every scene -- not because she's cute, but because her performance is so deliberate and so exact that the audience is compelled to watch her face for clues to what's going on in Emily's mind. It's too early to think 2006 Oscars, and the Academy doesn't usually pay attention to Winter movies (or this genre), but Dakota should get a nomination -- she's just that good. 2) There are some genuinely creepy scenes, and some good suspense. 3) Sorry, there is no #3BAD: There is no "Bad" really, just overall it was not good. The "twist" at the end was not entirely unexpected, and was not original.So, it's an okay 'date movie,' but don't expect a De Niro masterpiece. Worth a look if you want a few real scares and maybe a nightmare or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing and waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was depressing to both me and my husband. It left us in a bummer mood. I never thought about DeNiro being too old to be Dakota's dad, it's not unusual to see an older man with a young child. Actually nowadays it's very common with marriages/remarriages. I would rather see that matchup then the leading man being 65 and the leading lady 25 if you know what I mean. Or a sexy young woman who is a nuclear fusion/fission genius or museum curator. But Hide and Seek had the usual "rich people fleeing life" twist- when an awful thing happens in your house, you must move somewhere else and start life anew. But why would you move someplace so out in the country, away from the bustling city? Seems like the kid would be even more depressed leaving all her old friends, school, life, etc. behind. Then DeNiro had the physician syndrome, "even though I am licensed professional, I cannot help my own child." Fanning was OK, but I have seen her in better roles. (and yes, I have recently seen War of the Worlds and thought she was great and believable). I can't fault the kid, she probably was taking directions from off camera. I found her constant freezing up and shuddering weird and odd. It reminded me of Wednesday Addams, but Christini Ricci did it much better and much colder years ago. I love DeNiro in his other roles, perhaps he was trying a new slant. After all, now he's doing comedy! I never want to see this again, it depressed me badly. I like to see a movie for entertainment, not a black cloud feeling. Sorry, but this is the best I can do. I do try to write a fair review and like DeNiro/Fanning in other roles. Love the IMDb, it gives great background on movies and opinions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hide and Seek; cliché in the extreme.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good cast is a terrible thing to waste. How did Polson, whose last effort was "Swimfan", swing a cast like this? Many parts of De Niro's performance felt like parody. I expected at any moment to hear "Live from New York...". How does De Niro get himself into these movies (remember "Godsend"?). I will continue to watch any movie with De Niro in the credits, but this one really hurt.Elizabeth Shue has shown glimpses of greatness ("Leaving Las Vegas"), but here she's given nothing to work with. The role doesn't require the talent of an Elizabeth Shue. Plug in any fledgling actress/waitress you like and the movie wouldn't suffer a bit! Amy Irving is in the film for about 30 seconds! Not much to talk about.A gaunt Dakota Fanning was the victim of absurdly overdone goth hair and makeup. At times, I thought I was watching another incarnation of "The Adams Family"! Famke Janssen wasn't given much to work with here either. Her big hoorah in "Hide and Seek" was a slasher style chase scene taken straight from the reels of "Friday the 13th" parts one through twenty-seven! Aside from the abuse of the cast, the biggest problem with this film is that any plausibility or original thought was meticulously excluded from the script. You need go no further than to consider the basic premise of the film. Middle-aged guy with no apparent history of mental illness (he is a psychologist as a matter of fact), when faced with the sight of his wife in the arms of another man, suddenly presents Multiple Personality Disorder and takes up the old "everyone must die" philosophy. All we see is one kiss with another man. Is that credible motivation for a killing spree?? It's lazy writing that borrows heavily from other thrillers that are themselves questionable. "Hide and Seek" is cliché in the extreme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry...just far too much cliché and not enough thrill ***CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!!!***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will try and be objective, because I loathe "this movie sucked" types of reviews.DON'T read any further if you don't want the movie spoiled for you....The movie starts out well enough, mother (Amy Irving) commits suicide, father (Robert DeNiro) and daughter (Dakota Fanning) are left to grieve and they start anew, buying a house in a tiny town in Upstate New York. The movie is creepy, strange and kind of eerie, complete with an abandoned and chilling cave, that Emily, finds when she and her father move to their new house. OK, so far, so good.There are a few supporting characters who lend further creepiness to the movie, such as the homely and strange neighbor who shows up with goodies for the two people when they get there. She seems friendly enough, but she gave me the shivers...like the old lady down the street that you think is so nice and it turns out that she has bodies buried in her basement.It is actually a very good movie UNTIL you get to the end and find out who "Charlie" is. It turns out that "Charlie" is Robert DeNiro...yes, Emily's dad. It has been him all along.Let me explain...Normally, OK...fine, wife kills self and dad goes nuts...but from an author's standpoint and from one who takes great pains to NOT leave any gaping holes or questions in my own works, I found that the end of this story was not clearly presented enough to not require in-depth thought... at least in my opinion. I like a movie to be thought provoking as much as the next person, but I don't want to have to struggle with a movie's message or struggle to "get the point." I did nothing BUT struggle with this movie's message.It took a concerted effort on my part to finally get to the point of what was going on, as I was lost until I actually sat and thought about it. I like my thrillers to actually thrill me, not make me sit and say "huh? OK wait...let me think about this." Kids nowadays are precocious at best...they do not just take things at face value with no questions. This is why I was convinced that, until the ending, Emily is possessed by "whatever it was" that she saw in the cave.While her dad works in his study one day, shortly after moving into their new home, she goes in the cave that I mentioned and comes back out a changed little girl, with reports of a new friend...Charlie. She acts eerily, looks like something out of a Gothic horror movie, complete with brown circles under her eyes and pale skin (reminded me of the Necromongers in "The Chronicles of Riddick" and the dark circles they had under their eyes,) seems to like anything bad that befalls her father and keeps secrets, including "he doesn't like for me to talk about him," when asked about Charlie. She seems to like the fact that she and her father get a parking ticket when they are in town..."we broke the law" she says with evil glee. The writing ends up on the bathroom wall, accusing David of "letting her (his wife) die" complete with candles burning, much the same way that the mother had committed suicide. It was Charlie, Emily tells her dad. The beautiful family cat ends up dead in the bathtub, drowned with the stopper chain around its neck and Emily seems not to care, while David is horrified that his daughter did it...not believing in her claims once again of "Charlie" doing it. Emily spears a live bug on a fishing trip with her dad, and once again grins in wicked, childlike glee, while her father acts disgusted. She seems much too pleased when family friend Elizabeth (Elizabeth Shue) is pitched out the second story window of Emily's bedroom. Emily's haunting warning, of "you better hope that you don't end up the same way," delivered at dinner one evening in which Elizabeth is a guest, rings in your ears as the poor woman meets her demise.All of this is once again VERY effective, UNTIL you get to the end of the movie and find out that the "killer" is her father and that Emily was in cahoots with him all along. It is a game to Emily...a sick and twisted game. All along it seemed as if Emily were possessed and David is distraught because of her declining mental health.Once I sat and thought about it, it was then very obvious and I came to the conclusion that both Emily and David are messed up...big time. Finally, when Emily decides that she doesn't "want to play with Charlie any more" is when it all starts to crumble for David.The movie makes sense, once you think about it, and even though the ending was not predictable, it was a major letdown. I should have seen it coming...I should have seen it a mile away. This movie absolutely reeked of "The Others," and even faintly of "The Sixth Sense" (yes, I am one of those terrible people who knew from the moment that Bruce Willis was shot that he was dead because of the color of the blood and where it was that he was shot...liver shot...will get you every time) and I completely missed it.I guess if you stop and think about it...for a child to go along with the things that Emily did...having all of her dolls destroyed, her cat murdered, witnessing the death of her dad's new friend, and having no emotions...is truly, utterly and terrifyingly horrifying. But sorry...I have to say...it was just too much of a stretch for me. I gave this movie a 5. While I didn't like it...I didn't hate it either and encourage each person to make their own assumptions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good actors shamelessly shadowed by clichés and bad directing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is going in Hollywood these days? Isn't anybody proofreading the scripts before they end up in the actor's mailbox. The movie is so full of clichés I couldn't tell if it was tribute film to Hitchcock or modern day spoof of M. Night Shyamalan clones.This knock-off is about a girl (Fanning) whose has trouble dealing with her mother's suicide. The troubled father and psychologist (DeNiro) decides it would be best to move to the country for a change of scenery. Fanning is showing signs of post traumatic stress syndrome and DeNiro, the certified psychologist, has no idea what is going with his daughter or what to do about it. Did I forget to mention he's a certified psychologist? Now that the movie has you set up, Fanning admits to her father she has met an imaginary friend named Charlie, who she is never supposed to talk about. Now, the movie throws you a few more curveballs to include a snoopy female neighbor whose husband is obsessed with Fanning, the token clueless sheriff who shows up at convenient times and knows nothing about crime investigation, and the quirky real estate agent with pedophile like habits that shows at 2:06 in the morning to try to slip a set of worthless keys in their house they he forgot to give them when DeNiro he bought the house. Oh yeah, DeNiro starts to date a girl (Shue), only weeks after his wife died. Fanning is subjected to "Charlie's" weird behavior like writing messages on the bathroom walls, killing their cat and pushing Shue out a window and burying her. **SPOILER** It ends up being that every strange character you've met so far is completely normal and that Charlie is DeNiro himself, who suffer from split personalities. No, you're not reading the review for "Indentity", "Primal Fear" or "Secret Window." Somehow, this DeNiro mind decides to split at the ripe and fragile age of 55 when he finds out his wife cheated on him, and he kills her. Did I mention he's certified psychologist? In the end, DeNiro's colleague (Famke Jansen) rushes in at the last moment and saves day in a climatic scene that would make Dirty Harry blush, and utters "Hide and Seek!" to DeNiro before she shoots him. Nothing like ending a serious suspense thriller by adding a Schwarzegger line at the end.This movie was a little suspenseful up to point where found out what was going on, but it's hardly scary. The dialog and plot are borderline insulting for a DeNiro film, and the movie had no room for the word "plausible." I would've had no problem finding out that Charlie a ghost, monster or one of those quirky side characters, real or not. Instead I was subjected to "It was him the whole time?" rip-off. The bright spot of the movie was watching another step to the potential future Dakota Fanning's career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I'm taking the wife to Disneyland and it rains.. when it starts Really pouring, I decide to hit the theater. Hey! Look! A De Niro flick! Hell yea! One of the best actors of our time! So I pay the LA 10 bucks a head price and we start watching... You know something has to happen soon right? One and a half hours later and basically nothing has happened. I am talking watching iron rust, grass grow and paint peel kinda slow. Stuff starts to happen, stupid stuff. Cheap sorta stuff, stuff that has happened in dozens of lame Hollywood revamp stuff. In my heart I'm in pain, no not De Niro! Not the taxi driver! I've loved so many of his movies, I'll forgive him rocky and Bullwinkle, but this.. this.. I'm going to wait this out, watch the rest, find out if there is some redemption. The ending is coming.. OH NO NOT WHAT I FEAR ITS TO BE! Please don't let it be the ending I see coming like a sledgehammer hidden lodged in my skull! BAM! Its over. Title credits. I walk out of the theater and the first person I see I have to tell them.. Don't see this movie! Don't! I had to over and over, anyone I saw. I tell you now. DON'T see this flick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World Class Acting Makes This Movie A Great Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hide And Seek is about a family of three who have to put their mother/wife's suicide behind them and get on with their lives. The father, David (Robert DeNiro), and daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning), have a rough time getting through it. Emily more so, if only because her father is more concerned for her well being. Emily soon makes a new friend in "Charlie", with who she can confide and play games with. No one really knows what or who Charlie is and that is pretty much the mystery, as you may have guessed from the trailers. I won't give it away here so fear not reading on.This is your rather typical, paint by the numbers thriller. Typical in the fact that it really brings nothing new to the table. That makes it sound boring but it is really not. In fact, even though I thought I had it all figured out from the beginning, it was still pretty exciting. I did enjoy the story quite a bit but it did have many of the same stereotypes or cliché's you see in most horror/thriller movies. The creepy cat, the lonely house in the middle of nowhere, questionable neighbors and eerie coincidences all contribute to that.I think what brings this average story to an above average and pretty darn good movie is the great acting by those involved. Of course, I'm talking about world class actor Robert DeNiro and the astonishingly good Dakota Fanning. DeNiro was good enough here to make me forget Godsend and Dakota has you hooked from the beginning. That's quite an accomplishment for an 11 year old. For someone that young to convince me that she was really that scared is amazing, and scarily good. In her short, but what will be unquestionably long, career, she is showing some great range for her age. My recommendation is see it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Opinion of Hide and Seek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Rated "R", I don't think so!! It was interesting at the beginning, then as the movie went on it became very boring and the end was horrible. What was rated "R" about the movie? Could someone else had been the imaginary friend? I think it would have been more acceptable if it was another character. The plot to the movie!!! " NO HATS OFF TO THE WRITER!!!" If Robert De Niro wasn't in the movie, I would have never gone to see the movie. But, what a way to get people to see a movie that you're unsure about, put a popular character in it. I think it was one of the worst movies Robert De Niro has ever played in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>C'mon now, the critics have truly lost their minds or maybe they just want to hate Deniro. Maybe its become fun but this movie certainly did not deserve any of the negative reviews it got. The audience I saw it with was loving it and I thought it was a thrilling ride. It was totally creepy and chilling and little Dakota Fanning is a true original. I thought it was really well made: acting, directing, cinematography, etc. The story was not so original but it overcompensated for that by just being fun and by doing what a scary movie should.Its official. No more listening to critics when it comes to most movies. Go see hide and seek and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was about a father mourning the loss of his wife and trying to help his daughter recoup from the tragedy. They move to a small town outside of New York and that is where Emily befriends Charile, her imaginary friend. This is where all the trouble begins. I loved this movie. I was on the edge of my seat in anticipation. There are several scenes I was not expecting and was throughly impressed. The ending was one i did not see coming. For me there was no time in this movie..I was not bored and didn't have to wonder how much longer was the movie going to be. Dakota Fanning was a superb actress. Along with Famke Johannason, Robert Dinero and Elisabeth Shue. I would totally recommend this movie to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DeNiro has to stop making comedies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I should let you know that Hide and Seek has to be the best comedy since Paparazzi. While I was mildly entertained by the movie, I was surely not scared by it. Hide and Seek is the kind of movie that ends up being actually a little bit funny instead of the shocker you'd expect. I can see the spoofs already: Robert DeNiro and Dakota Fanning, together in a movie about a daughter who constantly acts creepy as terrible things happen and the dad is driven nuts by it. Take for example the scene where DeNiro brings over another little girl to play with his daughter. What happens between the two girls is priceless comedy. Now, I know that you may have to have a pretty dark sense of humour to find this movie funny, but I'll raise my hand up there, and I know for sure that I wasn't the only person smirking and snickering in the theatre.Then we get to the final act of the movie, which I didn't really find that funny. Obviously, there is a "twist," which seems to come a dime a dozen with thrillers these days. I won't give it away but I'll tell you this much: I'm not sure exactly what the hell happened, but I didn't see it coming. I also have nitpicks, which I won't get into. If you stop and think about it or have at least been watching your CSI then you'll come across the same thoughts as I have. But who really cares? It's just a stupid movie anyway, and to pick it apart is just a waste of time.I, personally, and many many others would regard Robert DeNiro as one of the greatest actors of all time. The fact that he's starring in a movie like this along with little Dakota Fanning is hilarious enough and proof that this must be a comedy.My rating: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though this movie was not as scary as it was hyped up to be, it was still an excellent film. The director should be applauded for the magnificent job he has done in the production, along with his ability to pull such great talent from the actors.This movie is more freaky then scary and will leave you guessing until the very end. It is a little slow at first, but it picks up and turns into a fantastic cinematic feature full of twists and turns that leave you stunned even after the movie is complete.I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys thought-provoking films or scary/freaky movies. Though it is rated R, there is very little cussing or bad language. Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Widower David and his daughter Emily leave the big city for the country after the tragic death of the Misses. Due to the fate of her mother Emily is going through a tough patch, one might say she has some issues when weird things like mutilated dolls and dead animals appear. But the clincher is her new found "imaginary" friend Charlie. As Charlie asserts himself more and more, darker things start to happen and we all know what that means.Not a horrible film but the script is horribly clichéd. I enjoyed myself but not quite the way the filmmakers had in mind. My friend and I traded quips back in forth as if we were at our own MST3K party or something. I noticed many others in the audience doing the same so we weren't alone. DeNiro was solid if a bit restrained. Fanning is a pretty good actress for a ten year old. She held her ground with DeNiro and even bested him several times. Hell she barely blinked for the first 45 minutes of the film. The direction wasn't spectacular, not overly flashy but didn't need to be. The script?ahh the script is where the film skids into a tailspin. A veritable Frankenstein's Monster of plots, devices and red herrings that served other films well but became a tepid pool here.Disappointing but not a total waste of time if you can forgive its shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Initially, this movie seemed OK. Unfortunately, movie makers feel the need that in order for a thriller to be good, they need some sort of twist ending. While that tactic was applied here, it definitely did not work. I was severely disappointed with the ending. I can't believe some people give this 9 out of 10 stars, even after admitting to a crappy ending. Would you give Titanic 9 out of 10 stars if the boat didn't sink? The ending can make or break a movie, and this one needs a full body cast. I suggest before the twist is revealed, you turn off the movie and pretend it ends there, you'll save yourself much disappointment and you can imagine it ended well.</fullReview>

The only time I jumped in fright was when a cat jumps out of the cupboard with a crescendo of violins and...then...nothing happens. After 45 minutes you will still be waiting for something to happen...after 90 minutes the same...and then shock when you see the credits start to roll. The plot has been done a hundred times and so you are thinking all the way through 'that cant be it!' The part about this movie being terrifying is true in the fact that the great man Robert De Niro actually took a lead role in this flop. It is about a scary as The Village. Remember The Village?

This is exploitation of the little girl, pure and simple. It was watching child abuse...the kind where nobody intervenes until it is too late. The characters in the movie were making unbelievable statements about her cuteness. Anyone with eyes could see the suffering she was going through. Yes, the little girl was excellent, but how can you exploit a child like that?Shame, Shame. Slow and disappointing, you wait for something to happen. It is supposed to be scary, so you wait for the boogie man to jump up. Oh,and my husband thought Amy Irving was very "well kept".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did anybody ever see Secret Window? This movie seems a lot like that except for the fact that they threw a little girl into the picture to lead us into thinking this was a different film. Shame on people these days.Maybe we are running out of creative ideas to spend millions of dollars on.All of the actors worked everything out just fine. They earn their pay days as far as I am concerned. I am a bit disturbed with some of the script. It could have covered the appropriate details of why things were happening the way they did.The circumstances that were laid out there in the last fifteen minutes of the movie do NOT convince me of someone suffering from a traumatic incident would flesh out and do more then what they had first intended. A specific character figures out the problem but suffers from a purely psychotic nature...versus the initial acting out in trauma. The director misleads us a bit...Not in the nature where we are left to wonder, whats next? Or who is it? But,pushes the possibility that there is a unique force present. He created it...and it doesn't exist. The very end of this was awful.I guess it insinuates that if we all have been dealt a deal of trauma that we will all become someone else. Shue was absolutely beautiful by the way. It is still worth taking a peek at. It has a slow build.Then it is good for a short period of time. It drops and then maintains a moderate pace up until the resolution.I mean no disrespect. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching thousand of horror movies out there, I imagined this one wouldn't be able to bring something completely new with such subject-- dude, I was right. Jokes apart, I can say "Hide and Seek" surprised me. While watching this film you will surely remember of other horror pictures, from "Rosemary's Baby" to "What Lies Beaneath". From the get go there are many possibilities of how the ending will be. I started watching this and told my friend from work what she thought about this picture; she said the outcome wouldn't be "anything I could expect". However, considering the other thousand horror movies out there, it turned out to be something that can be guessed, even thought wasn't that common back in 2005. Atmosphere is tense and creepy, actors do their job, and we have some jumpy moments to bring some frightening. In the end, the outcome looks much like "Identity"'s, but never disappoints the spectator. Good movie anyways.</fullReview>

Sure the "twist" wasn't executed very well, the end wasn't very good, nor was it an original idea, but the first half of the movie was done well, the acting was better than most, and the atmosphere/score managed to be somewhat creepy. No film is perfect, so despite its flaws, it kept me interested and watching until the end. It is about psychologist and his daughter moving into the country to start a new life after the suicide of his wife, however it seems his daughter creates a disturbing new imaginary friend to cope with her loss. Though it turns out her new friend Charlie may actually be real. It's good to watch when you're in the mood for a thriller type movie. Nothing groundbreaking here, and doesn't require a lot of thought, but a fun watch none the less.</fullReview>

To help Emily through the trauma, her father David, a psychologist, takes her to an isolated house in upstate New York.

In no time at all, things get spooky and David suspects this imaginary friend isn't so friendly. Elisabeth Shue and Dylan Baker co-star.It was directed by John Polson.The film has great performances especially from Robert De Niro and especially Dakota Fanning.Unfortunately, the film is derivative, illogical and somewhat silly.Also,it is somewhat predictable as the end is obviously not going to be a surprise to the viewers.</fullReview>

Unfortunately this tragic incident is causing a big trauma to his little daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning). David decides to move to the countryside to to give all the support and make her to forget what happened, but things became even worse and very weird. In the new house Emily's imaginary friend named 'Charlie' takes control over her behavior. Somebody wants to play hide and seek but neither David nor little Emily seems to enjoy this apparently innocent but dangerous game. The most scary movies are the ones where a child plays a significant role, Dakota Fanning is quiet scary. An unusual performance of Robert De Niro not the best of his famous career.</fullReview>

This has to have the best twist ever in a film (I really can't tell you) If you've seen it before you'll know what i'm talking about.Basically Hide And Seek revolves around 2 people David Callaway (Robert De Niro) and Emily Callaway (Dakota Fanning). David's wife committed suicide whilst Emily was watching and it understandably truamatised her. David decides to move to the countryside. The move doesn't go down to well with Emily until she meets a new friend named Charlie. Is he real or make believe? Night after night Charlie and Emily play together but night after night the games get more and more violent and the death toll increases! The acting is fantastic Robert De Nirro plays a tremendous struggling dad and Dakota Fanning plays a chilling girl who even though she doesn't say much still provides a scary character. Go watch this if you're a fan of horror/thriller because it is actually scary unlike the awful Saw or Hostel series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great but the ending blows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts out great and very creepy. Everything seems to be some sort of entity which makes sense such as the girl running down to the basement looking for Charlie while De Niro is in the kitchen doesn't make sense considering the ending. Who turned off the light? It couldn't of been "Charlie", he's in the kitchen. Maybe a power failure but why would the girl look for "Charlie" when he is in the kitchen? Or why would she tell her dad that Charlie left out the window when he is coming from downstairs? Or any girl with half a brain would say "Dad your Charlie" or when the psychiatrist woman visits she doesn't say "Dad sometimes acts strange saying he is Charlie and does weird and scary things" There is so much more where the dots don't connect, clearly Charlie isn't an entity but in some scenes thru the movie De Niro isn't physically possible to be Charlie. Like when he heats up something on the stove and he walks in the kitchen and a minute later he walks back and sees it overflowing. Which means it isn't physically possible, clearly Charlie isn't a ghost. Maybe I missed it and need to watch it again to understand it. The movie had such a strong foundation and my guess is the writer had some sort of writer's block and decided to go with that type of ending. You got the creepy former houseowner showing up at 2am after a cat is killed, ah I could go on. But common sense doesn't apply but as a suspense thriller it is very good until Charlie is revealed which in fact caught me by surprise but it was very disappointing. The first 70% of the movie is great, top notch but the last 30% was terrible and not worth watching. Also the made for TV version, I don't understand the two headed girl drawing. Does that mean she is going to suffer from Split Personality. I recommend waiting for it to appear on TV, probably FX like I watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I had feared.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hide and Seek starts in New York City where psychiatrist David Callaway (Robert De Niro) finds his wife Allison's (Amy Irving) dead body in their bath having cut her own wrists. Obviously traumatised David decides to take his young daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) &amp; move away from the city &amp; so buys a house in a small town called Woodland in upstate New York, soon after they move in strange things begin to happen. Emily says she has a new imaginary friend called Charlie who she blames for the odd occurrences like drowning a cat, breaking dolls &amp; drawing disturbing pictures. As the events turn from sinister to murderous David realises that Emily's friend Charlie may not be as imaginary as he first thought...Directed by John Polson this dark psychological horror thriller wasn't as bad as I was expecting but I still only think it's nothing more than average. The script by Ari Schlossberg takes itself very seriously &amp; just about manages to maintain ones interest throughout with just enough incident &amp; intrigue to keep you watching, however the entire film rests on the twist ending which is a straight Fight Club (1999) rip-off. To be honest I thought it was alright &amp; may take a few viewers by surprise but it's a twist which has been done before &amp; much, much more effectively. Also to try &amp; keep the audience guessing there are several red herrings scattered through the opening half which actually amount to nothing &amp; when you think about them once the twist is over don't make a whole lot of sense, the scene when the real estate agent tries to quietly deliver the keys in the middle of the night by slipping them under the door, the scene when Emily is so cold towards the other girl Amy in her room &amp; breaks her doll &amp; that Emily tells her dad that she first met Charlie by the cave but while she was there David was clearly talking to the Sheriff &amp; the real estate guy so she couldn't have met him, right? I suppose if you just 'go with it' as it were then it passes the time &amp; the ending is alright if unoriginal &amp; there's nothing spectacularly wrong with it besides a slightly slow pace &amp; a few minor script problems.Director Polson does an OK job, the film looks alright without ever being that stylish or scary. In fact I'd have liked the makers to have put more emphasis on the horror elements as I'm sure Hide and Seek would have been a better for it. There's no gore or violence apart from a bit of blood which isn't great as it could have done with some. It's amazing just how much of Hide and Seek is set in the same house, apart from a few scenes in New York City at the beginning, a few Woodland town scenes &amp; the ending the entire film takes place in &amp; around one house.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 this has high production values &amp; is well made throughout. Despite being one of the greatest actor's of his generation Robert De Niro agreed to be in this, while it's not as bad as his other foray into horror the Christmas sized turkey that is Godsend (2004) he deserves better than this, he doesn't even put much of a performance in especially towards the end when the twist is revealed. The acting otherwise is alright but everyone except De Niro &amp; Fanning are relegated to underdeveloped bit part character's.Hide and Seek is an OK way to pass the time if you like these sorts of dark psychological horror thrillers, unfortunately if you do like them then you will probably guess the ending a mile off &amp; be annoyed by the little plot holes. I thought as a one off watch it's alright but I doubt I'll ever want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit, I watched this film with an eager anticipation of something wonderful, for I had not prior seen any previews for it and I thoroughly enjoy Dakota Fanning's work, as well as Robert DeNiro's.After having viewed this movie, I realized that any anticipation I began with had since died and I was left with a potentially-good-turned-rot Hollywood horror (and by horror I mean psychological {Hollywood has a fine way of confusing the two}) film that was predictable from beginning to end and seemed to follow a nice MadLib pattern of placing a name here, a noun there, a vowel here, etc. It was lame and it seemed a bit candid to me how DeNiro was out-acted by Ms. Fanning. As he romped around like an old dog she saved the film from being wasted. Her presence is it's only redeeming quality.Having this film in my collection is an embarrassment to me and I find that at times I'll even hide it away in the presence of others. This film makes you want to shoot your face off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>kind of sick, and sick of crazy psychologists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fairly interested in this movie until the end, although I just didn't like De Niro in it - it's just not his style, and I didn't think it worked. Sometimes when someone is so famous it just interferes with the mood of a movie; you're thinking the whole time, that's Robert De Niro. The kid was great, although most of the time she sounded EXACTLY like the kid in The Ring - short sentences, toneless voice, etc. If I'd closed my eyes I wouldn't have been able to tell them apart. But the part I really didn't like was the ending, because it just seemed sick. First the kid's mom dies, and the dad is the killer, and now he's going to kill her? I definitely didn't suspect it was him with a split personality, so I guess that was good. But it just felt like this kid was being emotionally tortured. And MUST every psychologist in movies be insane? What does Hollywood have against psychologists? I thought all the stars WENT to psychologists. Was the last good psychologist in Ordinary People about 9000 years ago? And the ending - the picture with the kid having two heads - come on. How predictable. Nearly every horror movie seems to end with, it's not over! Do something new!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film starts really well. The tension builds nicely, the acting is great and you're filled with a sense of anticipation/dread as you just know that something bad is lurking just around the corner.Unfortunately, the 'something bad' is the ending! I thought the plot twist was still a good idea (I definitely didn't see it coming) but then the way that they bring the story to a close just isn't convincing. It feels rushed and unbelievable.It's disappointing since they spent so long building the mystique and tension, just to end it suddenly, leading you to initially forget how much you enjoyed the beginning and just feel let down by the ending.I'd still recommend the film - once I'd finished watching it, I actually wanted to see it again just to spot any details/clues to the twist that I might have missed the first time around. Just don't go into it with high expectations, as you're likely to be disappointed...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is generic crap, and nobody should ever bother renting it. Not a plot device in this movie hasn't already been done in several other similar mediocre horror films in the last few years. The plot is pretty much a copy and paste from another Deniro film, Godsend, from the year previous, except this is far more boring and pretentious than that film ever was. And speaking of Deniro, why is he here, anyway? Goodfellas! Cape Fear! Casino! So many good films, and then...this? His standards must be awfully low these days. Tragic. He's still a good actor, there's just nothing in the world he can do with such banal, bland material. It's just the same old crap as always; creepy little kid, ghosts, supernatural powers, hot blond women who end up dying in the end, and Deniro playing a rather suspicious character. I mean, Christ, I can barely tell this movie and Godsend and Skeleton Key apart! And those are just the cream of the crop!Please, stop, Hollywood, this is far too much to bear. As for Hide and Seek, well, it's got a lame script, wasted potential, a washed-up, rehashed plot, and it's far, far too long. Just forget about it. It will all become a blur to you eventually, for this is not memorable film-making, and I'll just end this review with a nonsensical, rather humorous statement that doesn't have much to do with anything.Have a nice day, and enjoy the fried squid.</fullReview>

DeNiro should have made a sequel to "Bronx Tale" (Just kidding, leave well enough alone on that front). Anyway, this film is utter garbage! What the hell have suspense/thrillers come to these days anyway? The last good scary movie I saw was "The Ring." Then that got spoiled with that unwatchable sequel.

		<fullReview>It was just a terrible story set together with DeNiro's fairly good acting and a rather good performance by Dakota Fanning! (I guess you must see the contrast there!). It just wasn't what I had expected. Honestly I don't see how such psycho-dramatic horror movies can work. Unless they are really meaningful, I don't think such movies are worth the acting of the likes of DeNiro (Although it's him that's gotta make the decision, by no means me!).I'll admit there was some slight content to this movie and plot, but I just hate to see movies about twisted people's vision. My question is always, whether these movies help us to understand anything really in our lives? I'll admit it's only my taste and many others might have other ideas. But I just didn't learn anything new by watching this movie and that's NOT what I'm looking for in a movie. Good directing and camera movements though. Overall, a 3 out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The twist that broke the camel's back!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah Hide &amp; Seek, another film I had expectations of. Mostly I was hoping it was better than Godsend. Ah well. The first part of the film was kinda creepy, a little hard to understand sometime, there were some odd clues, possibly red herrings littered around, dirt on DeNiro's hand, a crazy kettle, a potential paedophile village where all the inhabitants like talking to little girls, 2.06 wake up flashbacks etc. And it was spooky for a while, Dakota Fanning looked like a heroin chic child with her lank dark hair, alabaster skin and saucer eyes. And attitude. DeNiro was DeNiro, and even pulled his grimace/smile thing that comics take off. Then the twist. What is it about filmmakers and twists??? They are not a necessity for a good film, if your story is enthralling enough, you do not need to turn the world on it's head to get a gasp from your audience. It was the single worst twist I have ever seen. I shouted at the TV. What a load of cobblers, partially nicked from The 6th Sense, partially from Primal Fear and partially from the mind of 7 year old. Junk, junk, junk. Very hard to believe, the child's hatred of the father was evident, if he had been acting with this duel personality she would have been in fear of him and probably run away with Elizabeth Shue at the first chance. Totally ridiculous and DeNiro's acting when he became Charlie was like something out of a teenagers after school drama class. Over-crazy, silly put on voice - argh! The end was also crap, Famke Jansen do an X-Men turn and being able to move in a flooded cave without making a sound and Fanning ending up in a mental home? Why exactly? Because the distraught child did what her 'scary' father told her to. Dreadful. The 4 marks are for the beginning, where there was a possibility Charlie was real, perhaps a child befriending weirdo or whatever, which is a hell of a lot scarier that two DeNiros.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does De Niro keep churning out this stuff?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a reasonable beginning, this film descended into a run of the mill, no surprises here, psychological horror(?). Despite spending the opening few minutes trying to work out if that was Amy Irving or not, I was intrigued as to how this film would pan out. Unfortunately, the intrigue did not last. Perhaps having 2 people in an isolated house with a few other sparse characters dotted about narrows down the whole "charlie" thing. Or perhaps I was guilty of thinking ahead and trying to work out the twist. Either way, the film disappointed. There must be 1000's of these types of scripts submitted every year and I would imagine most are discarded as clichéd. De Niro was wasted - maybe one day he will give another outstanding performance in a film, but my hopes for this are fading fast. It was the usual (of late) De Niro by numbers. Fanning was good in it. She continues to impress me as an excellent actress for one so young. Other than that, what is there to say. Replace De Niro with a lesser known actor and this would have been straight to video..er..DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most predictable twist since Chubby Checker's hit remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a recently widowed father (De Niro) and his daughter (Dakota Fanning) move to upstate New York, the daughter soon makes an imaginary friend by the name of Charlie to compensate for her lack of real ones. Which is all well and good until strange things start to happen. Then it's up to De Niro and his daughter's therapist (a very underused Famke Jannsen) to figure out what's happening. While still eons better than Director John Polson's last film, the atrocious "Swimfan" due to the vastly higher caliber of acting involved in this one (yea the acting is kinda weak especially towards the end, but I mean comparatively), the film ultimately flounders due to a unoriginal 'mystery' that anyone with half a brain can figure out pretty early into the movie. Despite the numerous red herrings thrown at us.My Grade: D+ Where I saw it: Cinemax on Demand</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dakota Fanning is the only reason I watched this movie. After seeing Man On fire, I love her work! My problem with Hide and Seek is it seemed to drag on and on and on. They gave her hardly any lines. It's like she's walking around as a zombie, for lack of a better term. Plus the movie was confusing at times. I'm not a big fan of Robert De Niro. Had Dakota not been in this movie, I probably wouldn't have watched it in the first place.. I don't blame Dakota for this movie being such a failure. Had they given her more lines, more dialog, she would've knock our socks off. Dakota is the best up and coming movie star right now.. Off camera she's so funny and articulate. So bully on the writers and director for not letting her show her full potential. Man on fire is the only movie to ever brought a tear to my eye. Both her and Denzel are just great!

		<shortDescription>The Shining, Redux</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To give it credit where it's due, HIDE AND SEEK does live up to its setup in which a little girl and her father move into a house in the country only to be tormented by something that could be a figment of the girl's imagination or an actual killer on the loose. The problem lies not so much in the big revelation but the way the plot stops working and decides to go on stand-by with scene after scene being a rehash of every other slasher/horror movie that's been done. The most notable homage here is to both Stephen King's novel "The Shining" and Stanley Kubrick's film version of Stephen King's classic horror novel. It could have helped to have a little less reliance on the red herrings -- the odd neighbors, the odd sheriff, Emily's penchant for ripping off doll parts -- and the Big Twist also known as the Shyamalan Syndrome. In Stephen King's novel (and Stanley Kubrick's movie) horror didn't depend on such a surprise but would wrap its filaments around you until you realized you were being consumed alive and then all the bets were off. HIDE AND SEEK, on the other hand, decides to present its characters and make it a race to see who gets it next (once the third act begins) while toying with the audience. Even so it's not that bad a movie and can be enjoyed the same way the writers decided to conclude it: on autopilot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The imaginary playmate comes out of the woods.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Famke Janssen is no longer the wide-eyed teenager of her early movies but is definitely in contention for the title of World's Tallest Danish Pastry. She's ravishing. Alas, she has little to do except give a bit of good advice to Robert DeNiro's psychologist near the beginning and to show up just in time to save his daughter Dakota Fanning's bacon at the end.Robert DeNiro is surprisingly good in what is for him an unusual role, a quiet, thoughtful, analytical humanistic type. With eyeglasses. It isn't until near the end that he become a somewhat more familiar figure and then he lack's Jack Nicholson's inspired lunacy.Elizabeth Shue does very nicely by the part of a sensitive and warm woman, of just about the right age too, who wouldn't mind taking the place of DeNiro's recently deceased wife, which she does too, in a curious kind of way. She's quite attractive with her long curly hair the color of straw, schlepping around that magnificent bosom. No wonder Charlie gets jealous.I'm just throwing in these observations seriatim, trying to avoid an outline of the plot, because the plot takes the road less traveled and I don't want to give too many hints. Still -- Charlie is the playmate of ten-year-old Dakota Fanning. He may or may not be imaginary. The acts he performs have real enough consequences and they could NOT have been performed by a skinny little ten-year old, so that leaves only two possibilities. Either this movie has a genuine supernatural element, or one of the apparently normal human beings is nuts.Rolling right along with the performances, and passing quickly over a sheriff who has a disconcertingly suspicious habit of smiling at the wrong times (such as when querying a possible witness to a murder), that leaves Dakota Fanning. A ridiculous name, a splendid performance. Where do they find kids who can hold their own against veterans like DeNiro. She shows considerable range and is at least as convincing as anyone else in the cast. And she has this quirky appearance too. In profile, and with her hair styled as it is in this film, she looks amazingly like one of Lewis Carrol's photographs of Alice Liddel. She has the wide face of a child. Her eyes are like two gigantic marbles, white with big blue irises, that seem barely to be held in their sockets by their lids, which slant outward and upwards like a kitten's. If you haven't seen an example of the Big Eye Art of Margaret Keane, check out some images. Fanning is a convincing actress but her career appears not to have survived her growth spurt.The photography is quite good. It captures the gray overcast and denuded thickets of a wintry northeastern forest. The interiors are neatly done as well, except that the lights have an irritating habit of going on and off for no perceptible reason. Each time they go off, there is a loud BANG on the sound track. Ditto, for each time they go on. In the last scene, even a flashlight flicking on and off emits what seems like a sonic boom.Doesn't leave much to discuss except the plot, does it? And this movie depends a lot on its resolution of the puzzle it's been posing, so I don't want to reveal it. I'll just say it reminded me a bit of the climax of "The Shining." In fact, the whole business could have been written by Stephen King. Come to think of it, there's a similar movie written by King, about a writer in a cabin by a lake who -- Well, enough of that. There is a virtual cascade of clichés tumbling out of this horn of plenty. Example: The dead body that comes back to life. The snarky low-frequency rumbling musical score that only an elephant could hear. The plot doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense. Why does the daughter treat Charlie the way she does until the very end? Some misleading slight of hand there, if you ask me.Worth seeing for the performances, the photography, and the easy shocks. It will not occupy a prominent place in anybody's resume.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...that an actor who I once admired so much, whose films I raced to the cinema to see, has chosen to go down this particular road! The most recent films of Robert DeNiro have been nothing more than typical Hollywood trash that once upon a time he swore he would never get involved with! However, driven by new incentives, he has put his name on this stinker too! I love the horror/thriller genre and as long as there is a good plot and characters, I can usually get quite involved. During 'Hide and Seek' however, I found myself spending the entire film predicting what was about to happen next. OK, that is something many of us do...but I was horribly right every time! I also predicted the ending right at the start! The problem is, we've seen it all before. Freaky kid, isolated house, recently traumatised, etc etc! This film took some very good - some classic films, - eg 'The Shining', 'Sixth Sense', 'Secret Window' - stole some of their plots, mixed them up, and came out with this cocktail of everything we know and hate about Hollywood today.</fullReview>

Robert De Niro just can't get good work nowadays, considering his last great movie was 2000's Meet the Parents. I can't believe he agreed to do this film. The twist near the end was perhaps the lamest twist I've ever seen. How does any of it make sense? And what did the ending mean? Is she a schizo?

I love watching the underlying frustration in De Niro's face, how he so hard tries to find the right words and methods to council his daughter. Prime acting Bobby! The problem with this film is the script and, as I said in my summary, the main plot point. And this is where I have to give away a major spoiler. THE major spoiler to be exact. Okay, besides the fact that it was fairly obvious that Dr Callaway was "Charlie", why in gods name does he want to kill everybody!? Sure, in a fit of schizophrenic rage he kills his cheating wife but why - why I ask you - does he want to kill his daughter!? His daughter even says at one point that the game she and Charlie are playing is "freak out daddy" or something along that line. In other words Davids dark side - Charlie - only wants to mess with David. So, again I ask you - why does he want to kill his daughter when he realizes the truth? Of course it's because the movie has to have some sort of climactic ending but I would rather have seen a struggle of the mind between David and Charlie - not this mess of a wrong turn.

		<fullReview>Hide and Seek *1/2 (out of ****) Robert DeNiro, Dakota Fanning, Famke Janssen and Elisabeth Shue Directed by John Polson101 minutes long You would think after Godsend that Robert DeNiro would have figured out that horror just isn't a genre for him. But then again, this is a small improvement over Godsend, but still Hide and Seek is a truly awful film.After the death of his wife, David Callaway (Robert DeNiro) moves to a new home, along with his seriously disturbed daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning). But moving doesn't seem to be working. Strange things keep on happening. First things first, we all know (well, for those of you who have seen the trailers) that Emily makes up an invisible friend named Charlie, or is Charlie real? Also, David seems to be waking up every morning at the same time only to find someone killed in the bathroom, and for some reason the writers even write a love story in there too.Hide and Seek isn't scary, that's the biggest problem. I do not see the effectiveness in imaginary friends, dead people in bathrooms (thats more or less disturbing than actually scary) and Dakota Fanning. Robert DeNiro also needs to learn that he can't do horror films. Judging between this and Godsend, he must really quit that genre and do more crime dramas with Scorsese. I am also a little tired with this formula of little boy/girl in pearl. I do not see the greatness in that.The most irritating thing in the whole movie is the consistent "come out, come out wherever you are"s. Sure, it may be sorta clever (well, not really) but after saying it 10000000000 times it just gets annoying.Avoid Hide and Seek, unless you are terrified of the following: Dakota Fanning, dead people in bathroom, messages written in blood, Robert DeNiro scoring with a younger woman and an invisible friend, then this is your movie, everyone else, you know what to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hide, Just Hide. Do Not Seek This Movie out!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to say this but I'm at the point now that if I see Robert DeNiro's name on anything that's not a comedy I know it won't be any good. In the last 8 years Deniro (One of the greatest actors of all time) has made 4 great comedies. Meet The Parents was funny as hell. Meet The Fockers was even better. Analyze This was great and Analyze That was just as good. Then he made Godsend, which should have been titled GodAweful and this piece of garbage Hide &amp; Seek. Hide &amp; Seek is the story of a man named David (DeNiro) a psychologist and his Daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning who can be seen along side Tom Cruise is Steven Spielberg's remake War Of The Worlds, a film I have been told has one of the worst endings ever) who move to upstate New York from New York City after David's wife commits suicide. Emily is very upset over this because she is losing her only friend Katherine (Famke Jansen who is best known for her role as Jean Grey in X-Men, X-Men 2 &amp; the upcoming X-Men 3 a film I do not hold high hopes for)who is also her psychologist. When they move to their new house Emily meets a new "Imaginary" friend named Charlie. At first when David hears this he thinks it's cute and his daughter is being a typical kid. However Charlie has Emily doing all kinds of bad things and once David hears that Charlie doesn't like him and doesn't want him to be happy things go south real fast and David becomes afraid for his daughter. Things really take a turn for the worse when David meets and starts having feelings for Elizabeth (Played by the very over rated Elizabeth Shue) and vice versa. Now this might sound like a great psychological thriller with a serious creepiness to it but trust me it's not. what could have been a great movie turns out to be just another knock off of really good thrillers such as The Sixth Sense. The Others, and The Shining. The acting is flat and it's pretty sad that one of the greatest actors to ever grace the silver screen is out staged by an 8 year old girl. This could have been a great movie. It has a great concept. Unfortunately the screenwriters and directors made a movie that should, and could of premiered on HBO. If you want to see a great Psychological thriller then I suggest you check out The Sixth Sense, The Others, Red Dragon, The Silence of The Lambs, or Seven. I know the last 3 are rather gory and graphic but you can't beat their stories. Silence Of The Lambs won best picture for a reason. If you want to see a good serious DeNiro flick then I suggest Taxi Driver, Goodfella's, Cape Fear, or Heat (Bonus you also get Al Pacino in that one). Just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If DeNiro keeps making these kinds of movies he might as well just stick to comedies. The thing that makes him so funny is I don't think he realizes just how funny he is. If he keeps delivering crap like this and Godsend we might be witnessing the unthinkable. The retirement of Robert DeNiro. On a scale of 10 I give Hide &amp; Seek a 2. If it wasn't for very impressive acting by Dakota Fanning this movie would have received a 1. Like I said, if you are in the video store and you see this movie. Hide. Do not Seek it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although many are the references to 'The Shining' and the most recent 'Secret Window',this film has definitely succeeded in creating pure terror and suspense. If you do not want to make too many comparisons with the former masterpiece by Kubrick,you can still enjoy two hours of a well narrated story. Dakota Fanning is a little genius,and De Niro definitely one of the best actors in different roles. His acting in this movie is genial. Although it is very well directed ,the films lacks originality . It is a perfect combination of deja-vu formulas,but at least it lacks the banality of most horror movies nowadays. Not many special effects but pure psychological terror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was weak in every point. Robert De Niro deserves better. The story was lame. Normally when you see this kind of movies (the 6th sense, the others, ...) you want to see it again to look where could have known the ending/answer, but this movie I really didn't want to see again because of the stupid ending and weird story. Its hard to say in English what I think about this movie, because I'm Dutch and my English isn't really good, but I can say this about the movie, it was the weakest I've seen this year. The best horror/thriller movie of this year was the grudge. I hope there will come more better movies out in the rest of the year like The Grudge or like I named before movies like Hide and seek but then with a good story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hide and Seek holds its ground as a good movie. There are some interesting twists and turns, it does a great job of building up suspense and is genuinely scary without being a slasher movie. Both Robert De Niro and Dakota Fanning do a great job, the acting is spot on. The music and lighting create a great atmosphere through out.However, We've seen it all before. There are so many similarities to other moves you almost know what's coming next. In parts I almost thought I was watching a remake of The Shining! Down to the door being smashed and Danny escaping out of the window. I was actually expecting De Niro to Say "Here's Johnny!" I think they tried a little too hard to throw viewers off the scent at the start of the move and this seems to result in a few things being thrown in there for no reason leaving you wondering why at the end.As a conclusion, Cross The Shining with Secret Window and you have Hide and Seek.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another silly Hollywood ripoff of a what works. We've seen a lot of them lately, The Others is a ripoff of The Sixth Sense, Sabertooth is a ripoff of Jurassic Park, etc. Then again anytime something works for Hollywood that is original, it is then ripped off by the straight to video companies. So anytime a forgoing film works Hollywood rips it off, as in Replacement Killlers is a ripoff of any John Woo movie. It doesn't mean its bad, just unoriginal. Hide and Seek is both. Do yourself a favor and go rent High Tension. Its a French film with the same ending (which even in my inebriated state I will not reveal) and a lot more creepiness and scares. Hide and Seek moves and an utterly ridiculous slow pace, making you stop caring about the characters by the end of the first half. I'm not saying the movie is entirely bad, but I've seen better with the same basic plot. If you want chills rent High Tension, if you want skin watch Never Talk to Strangers, they're all the same movie over and over again.</fullReview>

The storyline is fantastic the actors are brilliant, it somehow in some way lacks the usually punch of a horror.You will jump once in this film, and it won't be a heart nerving jump either.The story is about a Psychologist (Robert DeNiro) and his daughter (Dakota Fanning) who move to the country after the tragic death of his wife.You will be wondering right up to the end of who is Charlie? It is a shame that the subplots were not tied up in the movie.I gauge a movie by the "would I watch this again" factor. I probably wouldn't and I wouldn't recommend it to a friend either.However if you want to see some brilliant acting by Dakota Fanning then this is the movie to watch.

		<fullReview>The year 2005 was the year for horror movies. Hide and Seek might be one of the scariest so far. I found the movie creepy and scary in some parts. It stars Robert Deniro as David Callaway who is a widower and tries to make a big change when his wife dies. He feels that it would be a big help for his daughter Emily Callaway played by the wonderful talented actress Dakota Fanning. In a way to cope with her mother's death, she creates an imaginary friend named Charlie. As soon as things go wrong, David thinks that Charlie may not be so real after all and thinks his daughter is doing everything.I love Dakota Fanning. She is so talented and she can act better than some actresses out right now. She made Hide and Seek creepy with the way she was acting. Robert Deniro did a great job also playing her father.I found the ending a big twist and a shocker. That Charlie is Emily's father. I didn't expect that at all! What I expected was there was no Charlie after all and that Emily was doing everything. Maybe everything would've been better.The ending killed the movie. It made the movie be bad.At first it was good and scary. But then the film begins to reveal itself Probably thats what everyone was expecting. recommending it. I don't hate Hide and Seek. Let me just say that some performances were better than this movie. (5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HIDE AND SEEK is a multileveled film that raises as many questions as it answers. Even the screenwriter Ari Schlossberg and director John Polson seem as though they weren't sure about the mysterious workings of their characters: there are four alternative endings on the DVD, each of which suggests something much different than the final moments of this sleekly drawn suspense thriller. I like that! This is a story that the audience will feel seduced by the odd behaviors of ALL of the characters: everyone is suspect for the spooky derring-do that fills this film.Psychologist Dr. David Calloway (Robert DeNiro) and his daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) are decimated by their discovery of the apparent suicide of their wife/mother Alison (Amy Irving) and against the advice of David's fellow psychologist Katherine (Famke Janssen), they move to a spooky old house in the woods of upstate New York. Emily remains withdrawn, electing to be friends only with 'Charley', a probable fictive ideation. Neighbors (Melissa Leo and Robert John Burke) extend kindness but at the same time are a bit ominous. Even the sheriff (Dylan Baker) and the realtor (David Chandler) are weird. The only bit of light in this disturbed household radiates from Elizabeth (Elizabeth Shue) who offers friendship but whom Emily dislikes because she sees her as a threat to her father's memory of the deceased mother.Bizarre and heinous incidents happen with more and more regularity, each time the tragic situations attributed to Emily are blamed on her friend Charley. When everyone outside the house become suspect the story really takes a turn that results in the unsuspected ending.More than just a strange scary movie about the game of hide and seek this is a rather disturbing document on the extremes that mental illness can cause. The capable roles growth and change between DeNiro and Fanning is superb and while there may be a little too much for the average movie buff to swallow, the points are well presented. Give this little thriller a chance and see if you can diagnose the endings - better than the filmmakers could! Not a great movie, but at least as good as others in this genre, plus it has the bonus of DeNiro and Fanning! Grady Harp, July 05</fullReview>

They moved into a house where the former occupant invented an electrical apparatus allowing the user to communicate with the dead. This new family found the apparatus and used it - when they did, the child "came to life". I seem to also remember there being a toy train set in the den. There was also a "cave" in the woods and the little girl (or was it a boy now that I think of it?) also drew pictures of her imaginary friend surrounded by darkness.Can anyone help me in remembering this movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hide and Seek is an excellent, suspenseful thriller about a girl who finds an imaginary friend after her mom dies. Some of the scenes in this movie are very disturbing, and this reminds me of something that M. Night Shyamalan would direct. But ever since the mishap with his unsuccessful movie The Village, I think this story is far above his ideas. Robert DeNiro plays an excellent role in this heavily frightening film and is suspicious about Emily's new invisible friend. You don't have to see the film repeatedly to get the ending; you just need to listen to everything that happens and everything that has to do with Charlie. This movie is scary indeed, and I absolutely loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, So I am not to thrilled with how the movie was written. I mean how often does someone wake up at the same time every morning? 2:06 a.m.? well yeah so it was like a coincidence or something. Every morning he would wake up at 2:06 a.m. and look out the door of his room and see that the bathroom light was on, then he would walk into the bathroom to see that the curtains were closed and it was steamy. Well the first time there was a dead person (mrs. callaway), the second time there was writing (you let her die), the third time there was writing and a dead animal (now look what you've done (arrow down) and dead cat).So I am starting to see this awkward pattern... Then Charlie is exposed. What is up with that? You cant just expose an 'imaginary' friend. I mean then they're not 'imaginary' right. Sure it was through drawings and not through beings but that kind of ruins the point.Well, so I don't think I would recommend people watching this movie. There are a lot of better movies you can go and see...well if you have any questions or comments you can email me or message me on AIM...email : surferchickandie@yahoo.com AIM: fasten6490</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And reminiscent of several horror movies made recently like the Secret Window and Abandon. Takes a lot of inspiration from both of those films. DeNiro's character is strange from the beginning and you wonder how in the hell he ever became or more specifically how someone let him become a psycho-therapist is beyond me. His wife dies in a upsetting manner and he doesn't even take his kid to any counseling whatsoever except to say hi to his friend/protégé/hack sorry excuse for a doctor so she can let him take her to a remote place upstate to "sort out their problems" where they don't know a soul. Makes perfect sense to me. Dakota Fanning is a good little actress and very believable I think she has a good future ahead of her in movies and she's certainly making it right now. I find it hard to believe that her character does not confide in Famke Jennsen as she really cares about her but then again that isn't bad acting that's bad writing. If Jennsen's character was half as competent as she appeared to be she would have solved the affair after having spent 20 minutes alone with the girl but then again that's bad writing. A would say this movie wasn't bad it could have been scripted a little better and been more fluid but oh well. At least there was a little action in the ending and left you guessing til the end.</fullReview>

This time he plays a man whose wife suicides, so he has to look after their little daughter by his own. They move to the country from New York City and there (in the old country house they buy) begin the typical strange incidents (the daughter finds an imaginary friend, there are some killings, etc.).Dakota Fannigan plays the daughter, and she's so goddamn good that she is not credible at all as a 10 years old child!. Elizabeth Shue and Famke Jensen plays two pretty pieces from the "atrezzo". Anyway, anything matters, since the movie is pure crap. Two or three easy frights, a thousand topics from the terror-genre, some appalling references to "The Shinning"... Well, watch it and judge by yourselves; but do it under your responsibility!!

The movie blends mystery,intrigue,horror,thriller,fright and a little bit of gore when the murders happen.In spite of developed in interior scenarios and with a not many people, isn't tired neither dreary . At the motion picture there are spooky and creepy atmosphere and although is a little slow moving isn't bored because there are amount scares and shocks. The picture achieved limited success in United States, at Europe obtained more letterbox. The flick has certain resemblance to ¨the shining¨of Stephen King adapted by Stanley Kubrick. Interpretation Robert De Niro is top notch likeness to ¨Cape Fear¨. Dakota Fanning,the clever and psychic child is outstanding similar to role in ¨Man of fire¨. John Ottman music creates strong emotions and the movie is correctly directed by John Polson. The yarn will like to suspense and horror fans. Rating: average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE ENTIRE COMMENT IS A SPOILER!The movie was immensely interesting ? creepy, scary, jumpy, you name it, everything which an excellent thriller should be ......... alas until the very end, when it turned into a farce.I am perfectly aware that it is in fact the plot twist, which sells a thriller at least to the average intelligent viewer, but, seriously, should scriptwriters abandon logic and reason (and patoanatomy rules!!!!!) in a desperate attempt to find a mediocre ending to an excellent movie? They obviously could! So, straight to the only defect of the movie - the ending. Could someone please answer me, with simple yes or no, would it be one and the same if (a) I lie down in the bathtub and slide my wrists and bleed to death; and if (b) I lie in bed, my boyfriend/husband suffocates me with a pillow (so I die of lack of breath), then puts me into the bathtub and slides my wrists? Could a patoanatomist (or whomever performs an autopsy) simply miss the fact that I have been suffocated, that the bleeding of a dead body is different from the bleeding of a live person? Apparently yes, according to the scriptwriters, that is if patoanatomists existed in the first place.To cut a long story short ? I did not see the end coming, not because the movie was nicely done, but because it was obviously screamingly illogical. The scriptwriters should have stuck to the paranormal and/or monster trend ? an area in which they could freely use their imagination with no logic/reality limits. They preferred to try and explain everything in the context of reality instead ? I wish I could say "nice try", but I cannot! ? oh, and please ? do not try again!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best of recent horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems to me that we are being flooded by more and more horror movies in recent years. Especially the remakes of Japanese horror movies seem to be very popular (think of "The Ring" and "The Grudge"), but sometimes Hollywood still seems to be able to make a 'new' movie. "Hide and Seek" is such a movie that hasn't been copied from a Japanese horror film and that tries to be original.But if I'm honest with you than I must say that this movie isn't so original at all. From the beginning on, you'll have the feeling that it all has been done before. I know I did and some of my friends, who are much greater admirers of horror movies than I am, had the same feeling. That doesn't mean of course that the movie isn't any good. Especially thanks to the performance of Robert De Niro this movie is still better than average.The movie tells the story of a psychologist who moves with his daughter from the city to the countryside because they want to process the trauma that his wife's suicide has caused. At first the house and the neighborhood seem perfect: nice surroundings, nice people, good neighbors... but it doesn't really go as planned. Instead of getting better, his daughter's situation seems to get worse. She no longer wants to play with her dolls, but has an imaginary friend. When that imaginary friend starts to write messages on the walls and people are dying, all hell brakes loose...I must admit that the plot twist at the end of the movie came as a big surprise and I really liked it. In fact, if it wasn't for the last 30 minutes of the movie, I might not really have liked the movie. OK, the acting is very good (especially by De Niro), but the movie didn't feel as a horror movie at all during the first hour. It rather gave me the feeling that I was watching a romantic drama. That's fine with me, if I go to see such a movie, but if I go to a horror movie, than I want to see horror from the beginning until the end. And no, that doesn't mean that I want to see zombies, ghosts, living mummies or I don't know what kind of ugly creatures. A good horror movie, for me, builds up the moments of tension without giving away too much information and no weird creatures have to be in it to do so.In the end this wasn't a bad movie, I had a good time watching it. The only problem is that I expected a lot more from it and that's why I can only give it a 6/10. It's worth a watch thanks to the acting and as long as you don't expect too much from it in the beginning...</fullReview>

But this movie was a lot more scarier, it's really a great movie if you like adrenaline :)... I saw it last Friday with a friend of mine, and I really needed my scarf to "protect" me ha ha. when I read another user comment, she said "I was at the tip of my chair" well...

		<fullReview>... but I, too, found myself making mental references to The Shining while I was sitting watching it. I even wondered at some points if he was playing it a bit tongue in cheek for that reason. Or maybe he was just thrilled to not be playing yet another Italian stereotype... and speaking of stereotypes, I did sorta wonder if in 2005, the typical nutso mental case as the killer isn't not only a bit tired, but a bit insensitive, too. Nothing like making someone's life a bit harder when all they're trying to do is secure employment and live a life like the rest of us have. I know, I know, it's a movie so I should stop being so PC and chill out a bit, but we're slowly erasing stereotypes against religions, sexuality, race, country of origin, how about illnesses, too? Would we be making a diabetic look like a crazed maniac? Dakota Fanning reminded me of Christina Ricci. Also, what did I miss with the neighbours??? I felt like there was a whole story there that I didn't tweak onto. I understand their daughter looked a lot like Emily, but what's with the cartoons on TV and the big fight that he watched on his telescope and her saying that she'd said too much and that he was making it so hard? Please explain!! lol</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only kidding.I had an imaginary friend when I was a little boy. His name was Penfold and he looked exactly like the character from "Danger Mouse". I don't think he ever did anything like this, though."Hide and Seek" is probably one of those films that are going to be slated by the snobbish of snobs critics. However, if you are looking for a good evening's entertainment - with a few jumps and maybe one or two scares thrown into the proceedings - then I really do recommend this movie.David Callaway (Robert De Nero) decides after his wife commits suicide that the best thing to do is to move away from the city with his daughter, Emily (Dakotta Fanning) and move to the country somewhere nearby. When they arrive there, however, the infamous "Charlie" turns up as Emily's new best friend - imaginary, of course. Pretty soon really weird and scary things start to happen, including one or two deaths of people that stand in the way of "Charlie's" ultimate goal...It is certainly true that De Nero has been in better films than this - after all, about twenty years ago or so he was in "Raging Bull" - but to be perfectly honest with you I think it's a good thing he did do this movie. I reckon he recognised the potential of this film just to be a good entertaining night out for many people, and an actor should do a film like this once in a while. Just because he happens to have been in some serious arty movies previously doesn't mean he can't have more fun roles to play, and he certainly looked like he was enjoying himself.It is good to see Famke Jansenn in a role that doesn't need her to have her cleavage showing all the time. I warmed to her character of the smart, serious child psychologist, and wished that she was on screen for more than she was. Plus she's quite fit, too.But the star of the film has to be Dakotta Fanning. I was blown away by her performance. She plays Emily so creepily and scary that you can believe that this kid could be capable of practically anything - including murder...There are one or two negatives - Elizabeth Shue is practically set up as fodder for Charlie, and there are one or two weird characters whom you're not really sure should be there - but all in all the film is entertaining, and hey, that's what we go to the movies for, right? Entertainment.Incidentially, the final plot twist is brilliant and I advise anyone reading this not to read any more reviews if they haven't already seen it.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a fatal ending..!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that the first part of this movie is very good and freaky, but when Charlie is reveled is so little be frustrating because the supernatural touch is lost because these reason I can't give a greater rate to this movie.What do I really like from the movie? the new perspective of making a movie of suspense and thriller with a normal theme of life. Nothing about paranormal stuff. The actuation of the actors very good, the ambient where the movie develops is very appropriate. The contest of the movie argument is very good. I though that this movie was very inexpensive, because all the time the father and his daughter are in the same place. But I think if Charlie w'd be something paranormal the movie will be better.This movie try to do something similar to Six Sense, The Others, and all the others similar movie. But sometime the Director and the movie crews get lose in something, it is that a Thriller movie is not that one that make sense, is the one that make you freak and scare you from the top of you feet till the top of you hair. Please Directors don't get lose on this definition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Hide and Seek'? how about...... well, i dunno. Why bother?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Put it like this, I'm not what you'd call 'an avid fright fan.' I don't really go out of my way to watch scary films because quite frankly ? they scare me! I swear, with regards to being frightened, when I watch films I have the disposition of a two year old; my body can't handle the pressure. As well, in my opinion they are all very much the same. I know I'm generalising but it is true in a lot of cases. However, I must say that I admire how they really do affect you, as any good film should, albeit in the case of horror films being they all do it in the same way.So because of my choice to view this type of film, a type I seldom watch, my head was packed with preconceptions as to what to expect; and the one I was least looking forward to was impending certainty that the film would make me jump. To begin with, this film is a prime example of a stereotypical horror film; this of course sadly means that there is a huge market for it, however poor it is in theory. It opens slowly, with the mandatory 'nice' beginning and quickly introduces a number of those lines that you just know you'll keep hearing throughout the film. DeNiro's character finds his wife dead in a bath filled with blood; it is apparent that she has committed suicide. He decides to move away and start a new life with his daughter ? the film monitors the emotional reactions of both characters to the tragedy. From this point though, you can't help but get an uncanny sense of i've-seen-this-before as the widower and his daughter as drive up the mountain roads to their new life and behemoth home. The likeness to almost the entire story of 'the shining' runs through Hide and Seek, even the climax. This film uses 'The Shinings' character Jack, as Charlie; and of course here, the twist is created. Again, even with the twist, it's all been done before ? fight club, Secret Window and to some extent Memento.In fact almost everything about this film was textbook horror. The psychological monitoring of an innocent child (sixth sense), the secluded house near a wood (evil dead), the group of strange neighbours (take you pick). As well, the unnerving tones of a child's musical box, the whole notion of 'hiding and seeking,' the recurring reconstruction of the 'wife' character's death, the impact and isolation the elusive Charlie has on the father character and of course? the big, old house. But because this film contains such a wonderful plethora of good-old horror devices, it does work as a horror film, and I have no doubts as to its viability in keeping young couples in a tight embrace throughout. However, from my point of view, as one who is not a great horror fan, I believe the films only saving graces are the performances from the two main actors. Dakota Fanning shows she is able to pull off the weird-messed-up-little-kid look, taking her perhaps to the status of the best child actor at present. While DeNiro keeps the film together with what spit and string he has to work with, he shows that he still has a captivating aptitude and oddly, in my opinion, his performance in Hide and Seek is his best this year. Because this film has simply 'been done before' it can only really be merited on the fact that it did work as a horror film; and even on this fact, it is by no means the best I have seen. I would even go so far as to say the film would probably not have been made had the big names not signed on. Basically, if horror films are what you love, go and see this film, it's everything it tries to be. If you're after something on the approach to being original, something you haven't seen before, something quality - then don't. I think in future, I'll have to only 'seek' out horror films that are actually done well. But for I while, I'll 'hide' from the genre.With regards to 'Hide and Seek's' strength as a quality film, it is unfortunately left to be found wanting. Good for scares, but lacking in any real class.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hide and seek is definitely one of the top psychological thrillers i have seen in a long time. The twist at the end is something i can honestly say you will not see coming a mile off and changes the way you saw everything previously in the movie. However, unlike movies with excellent plot twists at the end (e.g. sixth sense) the movie doesn't end there. There is some heart pounding action at the end, and it will have you biting your nails. Robert De Niro is really good as the father, considering that i usually associate him with gangster movies etc. However, it is Dakota Fanning who stands out as the creepy and distressed Emily.Come out, come out wherever you are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indeed, "The Sixth Sense" was shot in 1999 - not so much time has elapsed, and thriller lovers won't escape disappointment. The suspense is non-existent, De Niro is pathetic and not convincing, and even brilliant Dakota Fanning can't 'save the dance' - the plot and most of the scenes are utterly familiar... The only cute plot thread is the repetition of "Come out, come out wherever you are!" - however, the intonation is suspiciously close to famous "Here's Johnny!" in the great "Shining." Alas - nothing new under the stars, and you won't even get enough adrenalin to kick a rat crossing your way in the empty streets of the megapolis. Hmm... I really wonder if anybody will ever beat "The Ring" in the horror genre...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst movies I've seen in the past few years, this is a sort of Secret Window gone bad (and Secret Window was definitely not so good, indeed!!). De Niro, who is collecting infamous roles in this era after the really bad Godsend, is a schizophrenic father of a sweet child (Dakota Fanning, the only good actress in this movie), who after the "suicide" of his wife is forced to grow up the child by himself. What follows is a very mediocre thriller, that is resolved at two third of the total time of the movie, so the last third is inane (with an ending that is called home way too long before). And, yes there is also Famke Jensen, in a minor - if decisive - role. She is still a beauty but doesn't save the movie - only the little girl.</fullReview>

Elaborate sets. Check. Opening in New York City. Check. Huge isolated country house. Check. Spring-loaded cat flying out of the closet. Check. Shiny pointed objects. Check. Candles. Check. Characters who have graduate degrees but for plot reasons act as if they have IQ's under 50. Check. A third act that goes on for way too long so that you realize that the killer would have to have superhuman powers to have accomplished those acts in that time span. Check.If you're a fan of the films of Dario Argento (especially UNSANE) or Lucio Fulci you know exactly what I mean.As is, it's a great popcorn movie. I hope everyone involved in making it gets filthy rich.</fullReview>

This is a movie that some may really like and others may really dislike. I lean more towards the dislike end. Different individuals think differently about this film.

		<fullReview>The movie started off with a bang. Not like some that you wonder if they will ever get started. Robert Dinero is a psychologist who has a tragedy hit him hard in the very beginning and the movie escalates from there. Fanning is his daughter who, after the tragedy, finds herself with an imaginary friend who "tells her to do things". It is an 'on the edge of your seat' kind of movie.The movie was rated R, not a bad movie though. I do not recall any vulgar language or nudity, just made me jump several times. It was VERY well acted,Dinero and Fanning were awesome. It had a nice twist at the end as well. It was not a movie where you knew what was going to happen at the beginning of the movie. One of the better movies that I have seen in a while. The movie had some parts when you would literally jump because the thrilling parts were very unforeseen. Fanning nailed her part, she was so believable. Great flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Callaway's (De Niro's) wife has committed suicide, and his daughter (Fanning) is not handling the aftermath very well, so he moves them to the country in upstate New York in an attempt to gain a new start from recent events.Emily (Fanning) begins an association with an "Imaginary friend" whom she calls Charlie. But is Charlie imaginary? You'd have to ask Emily, who is the only one who can see Charlie, as things begin to start happening around the house. As they progress from bad to worse, and then grow completely out of hand, a final climactic deadly game of Hide and Seek begins.The script here is adventurous and daring, unfortunately, it appears to suffer weak direction. J. Polson does not have the experience to draw upon in order to break this work out of the mire of normalcy, and (while not glaringly obvious) it shows. He is adept at tension building, but the subplots and outlying elements seemed to throw him for a loop. He shies from taking the necessary chances, or doing anything which will call attention to this film, be it good, or bad. While you can enjoy this work, it could have been so much more.De Niro was good, but his performance was the one factor with which I had real problems. I know that De Niro is better than this. I know that he can DO better and BE better. I've seen him in countless brilliant performances. But this was just not one of them. I don't blame De Niro. I blame the direction elements (or rather, lack thereof) which I mentioned earlier having to do with shying away from taking the necessary chances. It seemed as if De Niro was restrained in his undertaking of this role. I know he could have been much more dramatic and exhibited much more caring towards the daughter. He was withdrawn, lackluster, almost hesitant in letting out his "inner animal." Knowing De Niro's performances as I do, I have to blame this on direction. Otherwise, the father would have been tender, and the dark side would have been diabolical. As it is, the father was stolid and clinical and the dark side walked up to the bell, but was afraid to pick up the hammer and ring it.Although satisfying, the ending was shaky. It didn't seem to know if it wanted to be a horror or a drama. It felt rather anti-climactic but the twist was completely astonishing, as this was more a re-telling of Identity with a weird mix of The Sixth Sense thrown in for good measure.The camera usage was stylish; the angles and lighting weren't anything inspired, but were instrumental in helping to set the mood. The score was committed to the background, and was better left there, as it contributed nothing memorable to this work.I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed Dakota Fanning's work. I thought she was quite the professional in that her portrayal felt naturally realistic. This work has some extremely dark and suspenseful moments and in spite of its shortcomings was still entertaining.It rates a 6.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes girls just don't wanna have fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last year Robert DeNiro played a doctor helping a bereaved couple in "Godsend," and the result was an absolute stinker. "Hide and Seek," though no classic, is superior in just about every way. Starting with actually filming in New York instead of Canada.The movie doesn't drag out all its big guns right away, scattering some red herrings along with some genuine clues (hint: pay very close attention to the eerily self-aware Dakota Fanning); in fact, the prologue of DeNiro's finding his dead wife in the bath is shot and scored in a surprisingly restrained way - which certainly can't be said for later events in the movie. Director John Polson and writer Ari Schlossberg keep the interest going while building up the story of our disturbed heroine's little friend Charlie without having much to go with at first, but the movie's penchant for introducing hints of pederasty will not please some viewers (at one point Fanning appears for dinner dressed up as her mother going out on the town, and it does not look thrown together; and every man DeNiro meets compliments him on his daughter's attractiveness...).The movie could also have made more of Elisabeth Shue (who's wasted as the closest this movie comes to a love interest) and Famke Janssen, and some plot points come frighteningly close to absurd. (This not being a spoiler review, I can't really explain.) But DeNiro and Fanning are both fine, and when the fireworks finally start it's pretty tense stuff - even if it does come close to being reminiscent of "Wait Until Dark," with which this movie is not in the same league. But neither is it down there with more recent would-be chillers like "Gothika" and the aforementioned "Godsend" - and although I'm sure there are some who sussed out the big twist, I freely confess I'm not one of them.Although the final shot (though it could have been more subtly put) is the real disturber.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The elements of the thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Add this one to the collection...A Perfect Murder, What Lies Beneath, Don't Say A Word, Secret Window...and so on and so on and so on. No it's not a bad thing at all. All those movies were great, amazing, fun thrillers...except maybe Secret Window. All these thrillers have the same make-up, the same recipe. But if you enjoy thrillers of this style then you've got nothing to worry about.Hide and Seek is the story of a family, the Callaways who seem to have the perfect life. Unfortunately, Alison, the mother, is very unhappy. Both the father and the daughter awaken one night to find the mother dead in the bathtub with her wrists cut. David moves his daughter to the country to try and escape the memories of her mother's death. Unfortunately the little girl seems to be getting worse emotionally and she begins to talk of her friend Charlie who seems harmless at first but slowly begins to make things very bad for them. The rest is a bit of a twist.There has to be the obligatory twist. It's not beyond figuring out but again that makes us feel smart and part of the mystery to figure out some of the clues ourselves. The story is a little slow moving at first as director John Polson allows everything to be clearly explained without worrying about cutting the film down to an annoyingly short hour and a half. The film stands firm at two hours and doesn't bore by any means. Part of that reason is the two main members of the cast. The always amazing, truly worthy of star status, Robert Deniro in a very familiar type role for him but still great. And the equally amazing, she holds her own against the veteran Deniro, Dakota Fanning. She is creepy, and perfect for her role demonstrating something different from her usual roles and she pulls it off. This little girl is an amazing actress. The two of them are enough to watch for an entire two hours. Nonetheless the final hour of the film is riveting and nail biting as all thrillers must be to be watchable. Anyone who loves a good mainstream thriller will love this movie. If you're looking for something unique and artsy....well this isn't it...this is just for a good time, and that you will have.8/10....the highest I could see giving a thriller such as this.</fullReview>

The movie's "twist" was so predictable I actually tapped my friend on the shoulder 10 minutes into the movie and told him what was going to happen. It's all too obvious. This movie could have been a lot better if the crew would have gone to more trouble to hide the twist. I walked out of the theater feeling disappointed and cheated, just to see that the movie "sideways" was playing and I hadn't seen the poster for it.

Now its not as good as "Idenity" but i was surprised at the end as to who is doing all the killing at the end of the movie, totally unpredictable. So if people think its bad because you couldn't figure out who the killer is in the first 30mins or so of the movie then i disagree because i don't see that as being bad. If you want to see a predictable movie then go see some garbage like XXX or some silly Will Smith flick where you can check your brain out at the ticket booth and pick it up when the film is over.</fullReview>

SPOILERS!!!! It had Secret Window written all over it. The only difference is that I actually connected with Depp's character and was in a cold sweat when the twist was finally revealed. In Hide and Seek, there wasn't the same kind of intimate connection with De Niro. The flash back scenes were vague and just about unnecessary. The acting was very good, it looked really well done, it just didn't tie together well at the end. I wanted to see De Niro's character rescue his daughter. I was let down by what actually happened.

We suspect she is or that Charlie is actually one of our suspects.These are the Realtor who drops off keys at 2:15 in the morning, the town sheriff, and the creepy neighbor who just lost a daughter. I thought there'd be this whole complicated ghost story involving maybe a boy who might have lived there and haunts the place luring girls like Emily and the neighbor's late daughter to certain death, but that never happened. ...and hey! Don't these weird flashbacks remind you of another Secret Window *coughs* I mean, movie!? I then start to suspect Robert DeNiro.So we get bathtub threats from Charlie 'cause the wife was found dead and wrist-slit in the bathtub. Apparently, Charlie doesn't like Mr. Callaway and is intent on pissing him off by killing new pets and girlfriends and telling Emily to say rude things. Emily has no problem with it, but can you blame her? I don't think it would matter if she didn't have an imaginary friend, she'd probably still have melted that prissy-girl's doll's face.So things heat up after we find more and more dead things in the bathtub. Hey, has anyone wondered by Charlie's always around when Mr. Callaway's in the study or (like our friend Johnny Depp) asleep? This attracts the attention of Sheriff Haferty and the obsessed and bereft next door neighbor.After driving these people off, David Callaway enters his study and realizes that every time he went into his study or went to sleep, he would become Shooter *cough cough* I mean, Charlie. Oh yeah, he killed his wife, too 'cause she was whoring it up at a new year's party. He could have at least killed the man she was cheating with, come on... A psychologist, no less! Who would have guessed! I did. The rest of the movie is like the Shining, minus the hotel and the ghosts (but you still got the bathtub and "heeeeeere's Johnny Depp!).So, here's the damage in order. Neighbor's girl dies (I forgot when and why). Mrs. Callaway is smothered under a pillow, put in a bathtub, and bled. A beetle gets skewered on a fishing hook (Emily's only victim besides the doll). The cat is drowned, stuck in a bathtub, thrown into a garbage bag, shoved down a hole, and buried (maybe he was blaming the cat for his wife). The new girlfriend is pushed through and out of a window (they would have made a good couple if the guy weren't CRAZY!) and falls to her death, then goes through what the poor kitty went through. The neighbor gets cut a few times on the hands for being a bit too pushy towards a crazy-man with a knife (so THAT's what it was for..), and the sheriff gets a face-full of shovel. David Callaway is shot a few times and dies. The heroine psychologist back from the beginning of the movie gets pushed down the stairs and beat up by Charlie, but she still saves the day and starts a new life in New York City with a schizophrenic Emily. How touching.So, this movie is basically like a modified "The Secret Window"+"The Shining." This offers the basic modern horror-suspense found in a good movies, but you can tell what'll happen on most of the "suspenseful" last half of the movie 'cause they give you enough time to think. The cast did a good job. The plot, though, seems unoriginal to me. I do not recommend this movie to those who have seen or know the ending to "The Secret Window," nor do I recommend that movie or this one to anyone who knows what I'm talking about. You can watch it anyway, for kicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE US Movie Association for America (MPAA) is sending out free Parent File Scan software that lets mom and dad in a wholesome US family sniff their kid's computers for peer-to-peer programs. It will also list all movie and music files the kids have on their hard drive. The software will tell you if the computer has copyrighted material and will instruct you to delete it.The big idea is that all good parents will instantly delete the kid's files before the MPAA releases the hounds on the family. Since most parents have not got a clue when it comes to deleting things, chances are that the poor kid will be sent to his room without his supper for 'stealing' that Windows opening music. There could be other problems. There will be at least one clever kid that hires a brief to force his parents to get a court order before they are allowed to look at his computer.

		<shortDescription>Disappointing thriller despite solid acting; Fanning continues to excel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HIDE AND SEEK (2004) ** Robert De Niro, Dakota Fanning, Famke Janssen, Elisabeth Shue, Dylan Baker, Melissa Leo, Robert John Burke, Amy Irving. Disappointing thriller about a recently widowed psychologist and his young daughter attempting to resolve their grief when his wife commits suicide and they relocate from the urban jungles of Manhattan to the reclusive rural Upstate New York to adjust to their new circumstances only for things to take a turn for the macabre when the girl begins speaking to an imaginary friend who may or not be real and may or not be committing some unspeakable acts. With an intriguing premise by screenwriter Ari Schossberg and fluid direction by John Polson the story becomes predictable by its middle and last acts which are confounding that it relies to atypical horror/slasher tactics to elicit any pulse pounding moments that were achieved only to flatline by the end. Well-acted by the leads (little Ms. Fanning is proving to be a true acting find as she provides a very scared and spooky little girl) and able support (some sadly underused including ? for my money ? the sexiest two women on celluloid Ms. Janssen and Ms. Shue, as respectively De Niro's former student and current child psychologist and divorcée attracted to him) cannot rescue a misconceived attempt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard Chills In A Passionless Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first reaction as this movie began was that Robert Deniro is way too old to be playing father to Dakota Fanning. That stuck with me all the way through the movie and made this really difficult to accept. It was, however, only one problem when there were in fact many problems. Fanning played Emily, a young girl whose mother apparently commits suicide as the movie opens. To get her away from the memories, her dad David moves them from New York City into a small country town, where mysterious (and increasingly violent) things begin to happen. First, there's mysterious writing that appears in the bathroom, then the family cat is drowned, ultimately a murder is committed. It all seemed to coincide with the appearance of Charlie - an apparently "imaginary" friend of Emily's. There's an attempt to build mystery around the identity of Charlie. As David and Emily arrive in their new home, there's a vague suggestion of some supernatural presence, then the finger seems to be pointed at Emily having knowingly done the evil deeds herself, then a strange and somewhat creepy neighbour is introduced as a potential suspect. Unfortunately, it's all pretty standard, cliché type stuff for this kind of movie. Then comes the "surprise" twist with maybe 20-25 minutes left to go - the only problem being that it didn't surprise me for even a second. It was easy to predict what the mystery of Charlie was going to turn out to be. Setting the unsurprising part of the surprise twist aside, mind you, that twist did allow for a decent enough last 20 minutes that did have a fair amount of suspense, although they were again routine chills. In addition to the routineness of the whole thing, the movie wasn't helped by the acting. The movie definitely wasn't an award winner and all the actors played their parts as if they fully realized that fact, with little passion. When all is put together, I wouldn't categorize this as a bad movie, but rather as a sadly disappointing one. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing short of highway robbery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love suspense movies, and I'm a good sport even when I'm not presented with a top-notch scenario. I don't know about you, but for me the believability of the plot's twists and turns is the main thing in a thriller. Once suspension of disbelief is broken, you can't mend it.In this regard, this movie is "nothing short of highway robbery", as Stephen King might say. The revelation of the culprit makes you think back, as usual, about the clues presented throughout the film, and none of them seem in sync with the identity of the villain in the end. Food for thought: these three points. One: WHO in the world might the "person in the cavern" be, that the little girl discovers with such a look of happiness and enthusiasm at the beginning of the film, to the point that she abandons her beloved doll? You have the feeling that the Mother has come back...The answer provided in the film "just isn't fittin'".Two: When the little girl shows her dad her drawings of "Charlie", the whole scene (always in light of the ending) should have been way way different. This makes no sense at all.Three - last but not least: There is a scene where the little girl who comes with Elisabeth is scared witless by "Charlie" barging out of the closet ; we see her running to the car for safety, followed by Elisabeth with an apologetic expression in her face (something like "I don't know what got into her"). Later in the film, Elisabeth is back to the house for a visit, relaxed and all, as if the little girl had never spoken to her and never told her who was hidden in the closet!! As always in Hollywood, even the worst of plots is well-wrapped and technically impeccable. But this is still a very bad movie. You can't even say if the casting is right or not: here are some "names", but they have no real parts to play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keep this movie hidden and don't seek it out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hide and Seek was a giant let down.I didn't enjoy this movie. The plot is full of clichés and even "borrows" elements from other movies (The Shining, Secret Window). Yes, this movie has a surprise ending but you'll be able to guess it a long time before it happens, this movie is that pathetically predictable. For an R-rated horror movie, Hide and Seek is not very violent or shocking, honestly this movie should have been rated PG-13. It's also horrible to see such great actors (Robert DeNiro, Dakota Fanning, etc.)being wasted in this movie. One more comment, the male neighbors in this movie are unnervingly creepy, most of them all make remarks about little Emily (Fanning)saying, "She's such a beautiful little girl" , all the while having a perverse grin on their faces. I was half-expecting one of those weirdos to offer her candy.This is a below average horror movie; don't watch it, you'd just be wasting your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We were very disappointed in this movie and felt it was a waste of everyone's time (including the cast and crew as well as the viewers). DeNiro portrays a wimpy pseudo-psychologist who probably got his degree from the island of Grenada or over the internet. He definitely was incapable of giving advice to anyone as he could not even handle his daughter or himself properly. The "plot" consisted of a number of plagiarized themes from THE SHINING and PSYCHO, plus other hackneyed situations from old black and white movies, resulting in a mishmash of unbelievability. The best part of this movie is returning it to the video rental store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What lured me to watch this movie is its title and Robert De Niro, however, it turns out to be a big disappointment. The first half of the movie is OK and drew me into the story quite pretty soon, but after the father and daughter moved into the countryside, the story line began to develop at snail's pace and it was hard for me to retain attention or to sympathize with the two main characters in the movie. The end of the movie is quite sort of a cliché and defies proper reasoning. How come the father turns into a murderer without knowing it at first? It just doesn't make sense. The director was trying to tell an original story but failed to deliver it in a reasonable and entertaining way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was that guff all about? How can this movie exist? How can nearly 11% of voters give this film a 10 rating? They are just some of the very deep and meaningful questions I was asking myself before writing this review, they are all questions you the voting, movie going public should be searching you souls to find the answers for. Well I'm (sort of)sorry for being over dramatic but those questions are infinitely deeper and more challenging than this 'film' can ever hope to be. I think the most hilarious and slightly ironic element about the whole Hide and Seek experience for me was that the only reason I ended up seeing it was The Life Aquatic, a film enormously more horrific and terrifying (for all the wrong reasons) than this could ever be considered, was sold out. If you are able to take this film seriously as a thriller, horror or drama and extract anything resembling entertainment out of it I guess you either; 1.have an IQ hovering somewhere around 0 or 2.you are heavily sedated or on Prozac or 3.you are in fact not in possession of a fully functional brain, well a human one anyway. This is simply pitiful and De Niro should know better, he should lock himself in a windowless room for 20 days and 20 nights as punishment to himself for ever accepting to appear in this film. Bob, it was not big and it most certainly was not clever. If you gave this film anything above 5 stars, never mind 10, the joke was not funny!Well I went in a bit angry that I hadn't got into TLA, however terrible this was I guess it was mercifully not as bad as the film I had missed, otherwise I certainly would have lost the will to live. What made the experience worse though was that there were a group of teenage girls behind me, not normally a bad thing, but they decided they would irritate everyone even more than the film could. They were determined and skillful in their efforts so they managed to achieve their seemingly impossible goal. Every 10 minutes they let out a shrill, even in moments where nothing was going on (the film mostly consisted of such moments), the rage building up inside me was far, far, far more intense than the film itself. I felt if the film did not get better quick I would have to mould my popcorn carton into a makeshift knife and perpetrate some horror of my own. Well thankfully I did not, but the film did not get better either. This is one of these wretched films where the 'twist' at the end is what the whole shebang is about. The preceding hour+ of De Niro pandering about as a doting single father is just there to fill screen time and drag the viewer to that destination kicking and screaming, and to hell with anything that's interesting or intriguing or vaguely intelligent, no, no, no forget all that we just have to set up the tension for the big original, amazing twist that will make everyone choke on their popcorn.I don't rate Shyamalan very highly (other than The Sixth Sense) but at least he does it right. In this film if you can't guess who the oh so mysterious Charlie is by AT LEAST the 45 minute mark then you must be from another planet and have never seen a movie of any sort in your life. If I was to look for a visual explanation of the word predictable for somebody I would show them this. Then there are the other elements that simply don't deserve your attention once you have 'guessed' the twist, which should be about 15 minutes in, De Niro must have been blackmailed into this film, I can see no other reason why such a talented, acclaimed and usually prudent actor would subject himself to such humiliation which may even tarnish his career irreparably. He was awful, and ridiculously cast as a single father of a 10 year old despite being, and now looking, 60+. Fanning was passable as the seemingly demented daughter, which is good as can be expected with the script and character she had to play, so fair play to her. Everyone else involved was basically peripheral and you really couldn't care less if they all died. The only redeeming points for this film came when doting dad Rob turned into a spade wielding psycho and briefly brought life to this turkey. Alas he got all out of breath and stumbled about before his dramatic demise, he was probably just a bit pi**ed off he couldn't find his anti-inflammatory pills and ended up dead, poor guy.It really is THAT bad, but I showed I have steel and I sat through it, for that I am a true modern day hero and should be awarded a full refund!</fullReview>

Also the writer dragged in lots of things that have nothing to do with the story, probably just to get the viewer to suspect someone else. My advice: Don't go and see it, a total waste!

		<shortDescription>An excellent horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm quite keen on horror films. Actually it's a bit of a tedious hobby as most of them are so utterly dreadful and not the least bit horrific. It pays off from time to time though, I thought that 'The Blair Witch Project' was a masterpiece, for example.I, consequently, had extremely low expectations when I went to see 'Hide and Seek' today. Verity, as usual, refused to join me, she sees no point in ersatz fear. www.IMDb.com gives this film a very low rating and it is usually reliable so I expected even less - in fact I only went to see it because there was nothing else on at the time that we happened to be in Cavendish for other reasons.I was very pleasantly surprised. Robert de Niro is an excellent actor who gives a good performance despite it being such a hackneyed genre. His performance is considerably weaker towards the end, but it doesn't matter much at that stage.The plot is unusually intelligent with fewer of the 'why be so stupid as to split up when in the haunted house' moments than usual. The characters who are the usual red-herrings are more plausibly drawn than usual and the sets much less spooky - a benefit in plausibility.The little girl Dakota Fanning (a peculiar name, if ever there was one!) acts well despite the rather confining nature of her character.The psychological parts of the plot line are indeed rather thin and the aetiology of the bogeyman's pathology not explored at all. Disappointing as this was, it was probably wise as any increase in psychobabble would have been considerably distracting.The suspense is well presented, it is convincingly scary at times, to me the ultimate test of this genre. The musical score isn't that original, but I didn't think it overplayed.If you have a penchant for horror flicks, a very minor vice in the scheme of things, I'd recommend this film despite its poor showing on IMDb. I don't think that I was alone in enjoying it, there were some full-blooded shrieks from the audience a number of times and no snigger's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the worst De Niro film I have ever seen... I believe I could make a better film than this not only did it have massive plot loops it was amazingly boring Hide and Seek features a very evil looking Dakota Fanning and a very old looking De Niro I cant believe that De Niro has gone from the awesome taxi driver to this film is a travesty to De Niro's good name then again if you've seen analyse that then you'll know how bad he can be. Yet even after saying this Hide and Seek did have the right elements to be a good thriller/horror yet it unfortunately falls flat on its boring non-scary face which is quite a shame as I believe Dakota Fanning acted very well in Man on Fire and I do sincerely hope that this does not taint a promising career.Not only is this film boring it also has some of the most obvious plot lines and character development I have seen in a while, yet the strange almost paedophilia's cop does get a good beating which in my eyes is well deserved.In conclusion this film was a massive waste of time and I would have been better burning my hard earned cash and watching a bad b movie on T.V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hide and Seek" has been advertised as a movie with a really good ending and really good performances by Dakota Fanning and Robert DeNiro. In the end, you will be pleased to see that those advertising were at least true about Dakota and Robert, because the rest is just so dull and worthless...The movie reminds me of "Swept Away" in the way thinks get stinkier: it begins very well, and then it comes to and ending that is so pathetic it will make you think that the main reason Fox was hiding it was because they didn't want people to see how bad it really was before the movie came out. And if Dakota Fanning gets better and better as the movie goes, the same can't be said from Robert DeNiro. He starts well, but stops being convincing once he... well, I'm not gonna spoil the ending.Oh, the ending. The ending everyone has been talking about. Don't let anyone spoil the ending to you, because, if you're not a regular moviegoer , you'll be quite surprised with it, but it's so badly copied from other films that for those who really like and know movies, it's no big deal. All I can say is that it has that old problem of characters that jump in the movie with no further explanation. In the end, the movie is recommended for those who are easily scared and it never really rises. Avoid it until it comes out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, unlike the person at the top has rated it, deserves 10/10, as this movie is the best i have ever seen! Firstly, it has a reasonable plot and the it is stuck by all the way through, and secondly there is a lot of drama and suspense in this movie. Even though the story isn't very true to life, not many movies are. If i had to suggest a movie for anyone, expect younger children obviously, you should see this one. My all time favourite bit is when the police guy comes in and Emily tells him to die. Frightening, and a little down right scary at some points, this movie has an all time great potential as a horror film spectacular. So if you feel ready for a good scare go down to the cinema this weekend and watch this thriller movie on the big screen you wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

Not one good shock in the whole thing - they even use the tired IL' - what-could-this-be-in-the-closet-shriek-a-cat jumping out at me!!! DeNiro must be bored and will do ANYTHING for a check. he phones it in and actually looks embarrassed playing the "other guy" once the big, no-surprise "twist" is revealed!! Ho hum. Dylan Baker and Melissa Leo are totally wasted in thankless roles - especially Baker who is wonderful in everything from "Happiness" to "13 Days". here he plays ONE of those stupid cops who come into a house where all kinds of suspicious things have been going on - and shoot - the power's off - I'll just walk around with my trusty flashlight, wave it around and shout "hello". Call back-up? Why don't be silly. Sheesh. This movie is just bad - people were actually mocking it in the theatre. P-U - line up all the bad horror films of late, Alone In The Dark, Boogeyman and this stinker and yet - wait - look - they make money - cause teenagers just want to get out of the house and go see ANYthing. Can you imagine how much these things would make if they were actually GOOD??? You want to get scared? Go to a cool video store that has an Asian section and rent the horror film "Pulse" - it takes its time, it's slow but man, when it scares you, it scares you BIG TIME!!!</fullReview>

I wanted to see it because I like Dakota's acting skills. She is excellent in this movie. (As always) There was a predictable ending though. I hope that there is a second one. It seems obvious downs't it? I mean, Emily (Dakota) drew that lady and her and they went to go to drop Emily off at school, and when they turned back to the picture, there were two heads on Emily's body.

She's just perfect for the part.Robert De Niro - should have passed - by the time the plot is unraveling, so is ANY shred of believability in either of his characters.The flashbacks scenes that explain his own dementia and split personality does not stand up to par in how he convinced his own child that he was another person and not the one that killer her mother....it just doesn't wash.And Femke....YAWN - after seeing you in 2 x-files movies, we expect you to show up as PHOENIX and save the child....you should have passed on this one as well.overall - they tried to make a scary psychological thriller - but the only thing scary was how empty the theater was for what COULD HAVE BEEN a kick-bu## thriller.It just falls short in the light of day. Here's hoping that in 10 years time they Don't ask Dakota to reprise her role for what we know will be the silliest of sequels!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meticulously well done thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very much pleasantly surprised by this film. For everyone going in expecting a 'horror' movie, it's understandable you will be disappointed. Why it was marketed that way was silly. It is a psychological thriller that corresponds with a lot of the 'formulas' inherent in such a genre. However, I found it to be innovative in how it was done; meaning performances, lighting, lead up, etc. Yes, some of the writing was cliché but the execution did a nice job of making me forget that. My wife, who refuses to go to any remotely scary movies enjoyed this movie a great deal and actually enjoyed being frightened. The acting was terrific. Dakota Fanning and Robert De Niro (truer to form than in most films he's been in lately) had wonderful chemistry and the supporting actors were solid as well. Well shot and well directed. The only thing I would have wished for was a little better dialogue but it's the writer's first film but we'll cut him some slack.I definitely recommend checking this one out but don't go in expecting a slasher film full of gore from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is about a psychologist, David Callaway (Robert DeNiro) whose wife commits suicide, and he decides to move to upstate New York with his daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning). A family friend, Katherine (Famke Janssen) disagrees with David's decision to move, and thinks that Emily should stay where she is. Then after David and Emily move into their new home, David meets Elizabeth (Elisabeth Shue), who becomes a friend to David. Then strange things begin to happen - Emily discovers a new imaginary friend, Charlie. Robert DeNiro and Dakota Fanning are both brilliant. I liked this movie because it was more psychological rather than chop and slash gore that most horror films use to scare people.I think this movie was very well thought out, it was suspenseful and you never knew what was going to happen next. It was sort of confusing at the beginning and the middle but at the end it all came into perspective about what REALLY happened. I have seen it twice and each time i see it i understand more and more fully. Dakota Fanning played such a great role, she should win an Oscar for this movie. I think this is what made the movie worth while if she wasn't in it it would have been a bad movie because she is such a good actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that this wasn't Dinero's best work, however, it was a change for him, and I like to see actors in new roles.Dakota is an amazing actress for her age. She's been in so many movies, I can't even keep up.In this the two of them play a father and daughter whose mother dies, and move to a country setting. Dakota makes a new friend, Charlie, who she seems to play with WAY TOO MUCH.I think the movie keeps you thinking, and than when it finally hits you at the end, and everything ties together, you're a little shocked and startled at the same time.I gave it 7/10 because some things could have been approved on.However, the main reason I loved this movie, is because Famke Jennsen was in it. I can't get enough of her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How contrived can one movie get? If you want to know the plot, take every trendy movie with a "twist" ending of the last 10 years (Fight Club, the Usual Suspects, Identity, etc.) Mix in a little of Stephen King's "The Shining." What do you get? A homicidal father whose split personality is "Charlie", the "imaginary friend" of his daughter.I waited faithfully through 1 hour and 50 minutes for the movie to turn "scary." By then, it wouldn't have been scary if Dakota Fanning was brutally cannibalized by the Village People. There are too many plot holes to tackle, so many boring (unscary) moments, I nearly cried when I realized they won't refund my 8 bucks.Hollywood, you owe me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy Robert Di Nero in anything he does and this movie did not let me down. I LOVED it, as did my 15 year old daughter, but that very end scene confused us. Any insight to the drawing? I got it when it first just showed she and her new caretaker, but then when they panned back again and there was that extra head in her drawing, what was that supposed to mean? Was it to supposed to be a picture of she, and her daddy, and Charlie? I absolutely loved the suspense and was totally riveted and clueless until the very end when all was revealed. Again, my only feeling upon leaving the theater was confusion and I want someone to explain to me the meaning of the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect but worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS* There are some unintentionally funny scenes in the first quarter of the movie. My wife called it "Addams Family" because of the young girl, with dark rings under her eyes, who meets every query with silence. It is funny and had us saying - Get Out!!, a la The Amityville Horror. That said, the movie does create effective suspense and if not a surprising ending, than at least a well done ending. This movie is miles ahead of "White Noise". I read many of the reviews and was not going to see it - but just fell into it somehow and my wife and I were not disappointed. Based on the Director's ability to create and sustain suspense and tension I gave it a 7 out of 10 which I think it deserves. The humor, although not intended, reminds me that the best horror movies successfully walk the line between comedy and terror. You could do much, much worse in your movie choice than Hide and Seek.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that most of the movie was very well written and very suspenseful but the ending really disappointed me. There were so many scenes in the movie that didn't tie in with the ending. There were also too many strange characters that were never explained. I kept waiting to find out what these characters had to do with the story but never found out. I came up with many other ways that the movie could have been ended that would have been far more believable. It seemed to me that the writer had a great idea for a movie and went with it but couldn't decide how to end it so he threw in the first ending that came to mind. I was really disappointed by this movie and don't plan on seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film cheats the audience (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers*** Whatever happened to the good old days of horror? I'm talking about the days of horror where you knew who the bad guy was and the suspense was created by wondering how the hero would dispatch the evildoer. Now days it is all about the "twist." I'm not talking about the Chubby Checker twist. I'm talking about the "Sixth Sense," "Signs," and "Along Came a Spider" kind of twist. Although these types of twists can be effective, all too often they can leave the film viewer scratching their head and feeling cheated. "Hide and Seek" demonstrates all the worst characteristics of the Twist movie.The biggest offense made by "Hide and Seek" is the lack of credibility. In a good twist movie there is usually that point in the film where the light bulb goes on and the viewer thinks,"I see what's going on here." In "Hide and Seek" when the twist finally occurs, there is no light bulb going on, there is only anger and confusion. I wonder if the writers of "Hide and Seek" didn't come up with the ending after shooting about 3/4ths of the script. I can almost picture the producers/writers/directors saying to each other, "what if we make the dad the killer?" "Who cares if the movie makes sense or not. I bet it will sure be shocking!" Avoid this movie if you haven't already seen it. Send a message that stupid and pointless twist endings will no longer be tolerated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did Robert DeNiro really need to participate in this travesty? I don't think he has money problems, so what's the logic in wasting his skills in this pathetically lame 'thriller'? This movie disguises itself through the first hour as a mildly unsettling horror film. That is of course, until we are introduced to Charlie, and when you get to meet him, you realize you've been intellectually raped. You'll get angry and you will think of leaving before the movie ends. Maybe you'll also think of spraying the whole theater with gasoline and throw a match. Whatever makes your day...Just when you learn what/who Charlie is, any interest in the outcome instantly dies. It all becomes so insultingly predictable and done a thousand times before that if you're lucky, you'll sleep through the dime-a-dozen ending.Of course, any movie in which Robert De Niro is forced to say 'aren't you enjoying your meatballs?' sure has a scare factor, that's why this movie gets 1 instead of 0 (as if I had a choice) stay clear of this stinker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>horrible, never go and see this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie mostly takes place in upstate New York in a secluded town in the middle of a forest-type setting. Robert DiNero's character is the dad of this psychotic 10-year old who is the sole person who knows that her dad is schizophrenic, which you do not find out till the end. "Charlie" is her dad's other "evil half" and he pushed people out of windows, drowns cats, kills wives, policemen and does random other assorted bad things.The reason i gave this movie a "1" was the last few scenes.First off, you find out that throughout the entire movie you have been lied to. The real half of DiNero supposedly wrote down all of what had happened in the past months. In the end you find out that he had done nothing and the scenes with him writing and listening to music are just when "Charlie" has taken over his mind. Secondly I despise the final scene. In this scene their psychiatrist friend from New York City shows up out of nowhere at like 3-4 in the morning, gets thrown down the basement &amp; grabs the cops revolver *please note that it is a revolver, and not a closed barrel gun*. DiNero (as "charlie") kicks the gun into a giant knee-deep puddle of water. "Charlie" starts towards the little girl flicking the flashlight on and off. The last time he flicks the flashlight, the psychiatrist lady is there with the revolver and fires 3 or 4 rounds into him. I just have one statement as a gun enthusiast, and that is this: You can not fire a revolver after you drop it in water!!!!!!!!!!! geez people...Oh and in the very end you find out that the little girl is a schizo too, and that just the icing on the cake of crap that this movie made.This movie also made me loose all respect for Robert DiNero. He did a good job playing the part of the schizo, however, the fact that he looked at this script and said "hey, i'd like to do this movie" makes me want to go and slit my wrists in a bathtuball in all, if you like sucky movies with inaccurate gun scenes and killings, see the piece of crap movie.</fullReview>

I was amazed to see people jumping and gasping in the theater.This is not DeNiro's best role, by far. Dakota Fanning was more annoying then scary. Even Elizabeth Shue and Amy Irving seem misplaced.The so-called "twist" was a joke. Smack-bang in the middle of the movie; I predicted who Charlie was, and I was correct. Same thing happened with Fight Club. Movie-goers must be getting really stupid if they don't figure this stuff out until the very end.My stupid teen-aged friends found crap like this, and Shrek 2 good, but said Closer and The Wicker Park were the worst movies they've ever seen. The Earth is doomed...Do yourself a favor; don't waste your money on this, and watch a classic horror movie. The Exorcist, Carrie, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), Hellraiser, etc.Hell...Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992) was more entertaining then this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a a good movie. I would see it again and almost expect it to be better the second time. What a twist at the end. Not one person will ever guess the outcome of the movie. Lots of jumpy parts but not super scary - probably not appropriate for young children. Dakota Fanning is excellent and a little creepy. Movie moves a little slow in the beginning, sometimes plot doesn't fit together after you know what happens at the end. I found myself replaying the movie after the twist and some of it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I guess it is one of those movies that is better the second time around and makes more sense. Definitely worth seeing - especially at the theater to get the effects of the big screen and loud music.</fullReview>

The first 80 are suspenseful, scary, somewhat funny, entertaining, and keeps you guessing. But when the story resolves, it's less than thrilling. The twist to me was pretty predictable.

More stuff that didn't make sense, the crazy neighbor, the creepy cop, the strange real-estate guy, and Elizabeth Shue getting so obviously killed that she should have done it herself. This movie had absolutely NO direction, no kind of a cohesive plot, and absolute garbage for writing. I was so bored during this movie I though I was going to chew my hand off.

Its like gothika or even what lies beneath with harrisson ford, these are the sort of films that people are watching these fays. Although i haven't seen the film it does look good. I am in the UK and I don't think it comes out over here until April 1st 2005.De Niro actually brings the film together and does some good acting here. Dakota Fanning does play this piece very well to say that she is only a kid she actually makes it entertaining. Even though people say it is a poor film i think that this movie is a one to see!

		<shortDescription>Mind numbingly awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been said about me that I have bad taste in movies. I tend to have the opposite problem of most critics?I tend to love everything, where as critics tend to hate everything. The reason is I alter my expectations for every movie. If you know you're going in to see a silly buddy comedy, you don't go in expecting clever Shakespearian comedic genius. In addition, I'll often enjoy a movie even when it's really bad simply due to the great performance of some of the actors.However, not even the unsettlingly brilliant Dakota Fanning could make me sit through Hide and Seek ever again.There are so many things wrong with this film I don't even know how to start. It's choppy, the dialogue is so bad my eyes rolled until they could roll no farther?even the opening credit's sequence made me cringe. If you can't even tackle the opening credits of a film, you have a serious problem.The film begins by showing us a mother and daughter bonding and being perfectly happy together. Cut to mother swallowing a pill with a bottle of wine. Could there perhaps be some trouble in paradise? The question is quickly and ridiculously answered (after a quick game of "hide and seek," a motif which reappears so often in this movie I wanted to scream?I realize it's the title, but there's a thing called overkill) as Mom (Amy Irving) kills herself in the most diva-like fashion I've ever seen. Candles, bathtub and all.To try to help his daughter get past this tragedy, Dr. David Calloway (Robert De Niro playing the irritatingly inept psychologist gives one of the worst performance of his career) decides to move his daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning, who does wonders with the silly script) an hour away to upstate New York.The make-up on Fanning gets paler and paler and her blue eyes grow wider and wider, and we know that there's trouble coming from the moment they get out of the city. Emily quickly and violently gives up her security-blanket like doll and instead attaches herself to an imaginary friend, Charlie, who does not like her daddy very much?according to Charlie, Daddy let Mommy die. Cue orchestra hit.Is Emily evil? Is Emily insane? Is Charlie a real person? Is Charlie a supernatural phenomenon? The red herrings that are dropped in this film to try to keep you from answering those questions are so clunky and obvious I literally had to look away from the screen. Is it the creepy Sheriff? The creepy neighbor? The creepy realtor? It's not even so much that there are so many red herrings, it's that the dialogue in those "Ooh, that character seems quite creepy," scenes is atrocious. Completely random declarations of how lucky David is to have such a beautiful daughter. How horrible it is to lose a daughter. Wink wink, nudge nudge.Not to mention the laughable attempt to include some kind of psychoanalysis. Director John Polson claims David is a psychologist, along with his apparent protégé Katherine (Famke Janssen) who remains in the city as a long distance friend. Every time Emily does something creepy, we get a repeat of the same phone conversation between David and Katherine wherein we hear lines like?and I am not making this up?"Trauma causes pain." Really, Dr. Freud? Hide and Seek beat their motifs (they must have played some variation of hide and seek a hundred times during the course of the film), red herrings, "Who's that in the bathtub?" 's, and so called analysis so firmly into the ground nothing even resembling a decent film survived the bashing (with the notable exception of Fanning). Instead you have a legend and an up-and-coming legend trapped and dying in a lifeless film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Horror Thriller for the Twisted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the movie. The only problem I found with it is that, in light of recent movies and their "twisted" climatic points and endings, this one was WAY too easy to figure out. That, of course, could just be that I watch horror movies and thrillers habitually and have become immune to their red herrings (false leads). However, my initial assumption was cemented in the scene where the next door neighbor confronts Robert DeNiro in the back yard. I find some correlation with "Psycho" in this movie as well as the more recent "American Psycho". Over all, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie - even in light of the fact that I spoiled it for myself over analyzing. This movie stars two of my favorite actors. I foresee little Dakota Fanning as a bigger name in Hollywood yet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hide" from this movie--don't "seek" it out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Callaway (Robert DeNiro) and his young daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) are trying to deal with the suicide of his wife (Amy Irving). They move to a remote country house to get away from everything. Then Emily has this new friend named Charlie--who no one can see. But then Callaway starts to wonder who Charlie is when strange things begin to happen. And how about the creepy neighbors next door?Dull, pointless and stupid. This is a simple by the numbers horror film that moves painfully slow and telegraphs every 'scare'. If this was just a low budget horror film it would be easier to dismiss--but this is a big budget horror film with good actors by a major studio. I really want to know how they got these actors to sign up for this.For starters this plot has been done many times before...and better. This movie adds nothing new to the formula. There is a very undeveloped subplot about some creepy neighbors. It actually looked very interesting but is dumped completely at the end with no resolution. Also this movie treats the audience like idiots. At one point Fanning has to run for her life. She has a choice--go outdoors or upstairs. Guess which one she picks. At another part the chief of police (Dylan Baker) is investigating the house when the lights go out. Of course he should leave the house. Instead he checks out everything with a flashlight! It's really hard to care about people who are such idiots. And I saw the 'surprise' ending coming halfway through the movie.The acting wavers. DeNiro (surprisingly) is not that good. He isn't terrible--it's just he's capable of being better. Fanning is excellent as Emily. She's one of the few things that kept my interest. Very well-done, believable performance. Famke Janssen is wasted as a family friend. And I think she should have guessed out what was going on long before they tell us. Irving is hardly in the movie (a good thing) and she is cruelly photographed. Elisabeth Shue (a wonderful actress) has absolutely nothing to work with. It's always good to see Robert John Barker (next door neighbor) but he only has two short scenes.The R rating is not necessary. There's no sex or nudity, only one instance of swearing and the murders (both of them) are just a little bloody. I'm assuming it got the R because it does deal with a little girl dealing with her mother's suicide pretty grimly.All in all this is just a dull horror film that will be forgotten in a few months. Skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I have to say is that WOW this movie could have been terrific. I mean just terrific because for the first hour and say fifteen minutes, I was hooked. This creepy little girl was really interesting. And who the heck is this Charlie she keeps talking about? I mean intense. Then all of a sudden the twist occurs and that's when the movie lost me. I swear I thought I knew the outcome at the beginning of the movie say 2 minutes in but I was no that's too simple it can't be the ending. Sadly, it was and it angered me because I wanted it to be different. Hey even if it was like I first thought it was, it still could have been better executed. What the heck happened? Everyone in the theater was involved even the two little girls who paid to see "Fat Albert" but then snuck into "Hide and Seek" were hooked on the movie but then it got stupid and I am sorry I have to say that stupid! And that's when it lost the entire audience. Laughing started and the whole intense atmosphere of the movie was gone. Even I had to chuckle a little bit at it because wow how typical could you make it. Just sitting here now can thing of more than one way to have made the movie work. I mean several ways, which I am not going to write out because I don't want to really spoil the movie for anyone but seriously what the hell happened in the last 20 minutes? For once in quite some time, I really thought Robert De Niro had a good role. I am talking about a good serious role because the man has been in some crap over the past few years. The only thing I liked him in was "Meet the Parents" and "Meet the Fockers" but hey those aren't the roles Mr. De Niro was became famous for playing but they were decent at least compared to the other crap he was involved in. For the first hour and fifteen minutes of the movie, Robert De Niro's acting was good and very believable. You liked the character, you felt bad for all what happened to him, it was a good role for him but like I said after that hour and some odd minutes it was just bad, I mean laughable bad. It went from a well-written serious character to a joke. Dakota Fanning, on the other hand, was actually good all the way though even when the movie got bad. She freaked me out the whole movie and why people in the film were calling her cute was beyond me because she was scary looking. I have to give her a bravo for her role though. There were a few supporting roles but none of them were really important only De Niro and Fanning."Hide and Seek" was written by Ari Schlossberg who is a first time screenwriter. What I have to ask is what happened with the script here buddy? I mean, a really good script until the last 15 pages. What happened? You had good characters, good plot, good pace, good action, and then all of a sudden you just seemed to give up. Why?? Why did you pull out the book on how to make a lame thriller? Why did you do that? You could have had the best thriller of the year but no you decided hey I want to screw up in the end. The writer had to know what he was doing because the movie was good for the first 85% of it. Ahh it angers me.John Polson is the director on this film. Mr. Polson had a good view of this film. The setting was very good, the way he viewed the characters, the way he developed the suspense. But why didn't he say something about the ending? I mean excuse me Ari we need to talk about the ending. The movie is great but I think we need to work on this ending. This could be a great film for the both of us if you fix that ending. Why was there no talk about this? Even if they filmed the damn thing and then watched it as a whole they could have figured out something to make the film end better because I could just sitting here right now.In conclusion, I can't express enough how much the ending angered me. I WANTED to like this movie, I really did because it had so much going for it and like I said several times already it was all going good until the last twenty minutes and then it went down the crapper. I know this because when the laughing starts in a theater and your not watching a comedy or something that's supposed to be remotely funny you have a problem. Especially when you're at the film's serious climax and that occurs and that only means one thing, you lost the audience! I think this film was even more of a let down for me because of the way I predicted the idiotic ending about 2 minutes in and was just hoping I was wrong. I think that's what made me hate the ending even more. The film had so much potential and had such a good story but I'm sorry the movie really just got messed up in the end. I would have to say go see this at the matinée or wait for video. Just do yourself a favor and don't think of the most predictable or obvious answer to the film because then you will just be as mad as I was.MovieManMenzel's final rating for Hide and Seek is a 5/10. Great pace, good acting, good story but lousy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahh.. Hide and seek. I could go on about how the ending was substantially bad, and how it was all quite cliché, but that has been done by many people already. So, I will just say that: 1.Dakota fanning truly put in an amazing appearance, which just might have saved the movie from complete and utter terrible-ness. 2. The plot was pretty good except for the obvious attempts to confuse the audience and keep them guessing about who Charlie was/why the neighbors were so weird /what was up with the real estate agent. Actually, we never did find out about that real estate guy. But anyway... This was a pretty good movie, it had me jump many times.. If it wasn't for the terrible ending,this movie would have been amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hide and Seek Isn't Worth the Ride To Peek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Split-personality horror movies love to lead audiences astray with red herrings. When you think about red herrings, smoked fish with a reddish color may come to mind. In movies, however, red herrings constitute an entirely different kettle of fish. Red herrings serve as tricky plot devices designed to mislead audiences, so they can neither recognize the villain as easily nor resolve the mystery until the plot does. In other words, rather than revealing the actual killer's identity, the filmmakers incriminate a variety of other characters, stretch out the suspense, then spring a surprise ending which divulges the killer's identity. "Swimfan" director John Polson's psychological horror chiller "Hide and Seek" (* out of ****) follows this derivative, age-old formula from fade-in to fade-out. Unfortunately, this split-personality potboiler comes up short on chills and long on psychology. In between, the horror is held to a minimum, largely because a pre-adolescent participates in this deadly mischief. First-time scenarist Ari Schlossberg cheats audiences with a script so convoluted and contrived that it defies its own logic, especially with its preposterous last minute revelation of the murderer. Moreover, "Hide and Seek" bamboozles us as an audience, too, because both Polson and Schlossberg withhold crucial information until the last minute so that their twist ending contains a semblance of plausibility. Despite a sturdy supporting cast, with top-notch stars like Oscar-winning actor Robert DeNiro and cute little scene-stealing Dakota Fanning, "Hide and Seek" manages to deliver several sinister scenes (not sinister enough to justify its R-rating) before it unveils the killer's surprise identity.Everybody in "Hide and Seek" acts like an idiotic movie character. At times, you want to scream at the screen, because they carry on so cretinously. One character threatens to shoot the villain. Of course, this gives the villain a chance to get close enough so that the latter can knock the revolver out of the former's fist. Unfortunately, Twentieth Century Fox appears to have blown a bundle on "Hide and Seek," so much so that you'd think it would be a cut above average. Instead, this substandard psycho drama juggles elements of Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" and the complicated plot of any Agatha Christie mystery with considerably less finesse.Initially, the premise of "Hide and Seek" shows promise. Things haven't been going well for bespectacled Manhattan psychologist David Callaway (Robert De Niro of "Meet The Fockers") and his lovely wife Alison (Amy Irving of "Tuck Everlasting") lately. One night our protagonist discovers Amy's dead body in a bloody bathtub with her wrists slit. No sooner has grieving David made this ghastly discovery than his nine-year old daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning of "Man On Fire") walks in on them. Of course, this sight of her dead mother traumatizes Emily, and the woebegone little girl withdraws into a near catatonic state. David consults a former student, now one of his colleagues, Katherine (Famke Jannsen of "GoldenEye"), about Emily's state of mind. Against Katherine's advice, David decides to move his daughter out of his urban New York City apartment where the suicide occurred. He takes her into the wide-open, wooded suburbs upstate, so she can sort out her feelings without any grim reminders of her mother's death. No sooner has father and daughter relocated than Emily creates an imaginary friend with a murderous streak. Charlie's antics keep David up at all hours. David believes that Emily is acting out her fantasies. As the bodies pile up, however, you pause to wonder if she could be doing this all alone. Is Emily's imaginary friend real? Or is she manipulating one of the many oddballs from the community?Scenarist Ari Schlossberg and director John Polson nurse this moody melodrama through the first hour with some illusion of subtlety. You may feel a shiver squirm down your spine when Emily sketches her crude crayon drawings of death and dismemberment. Robert De Niro gives a nuanced, low-key performance as the sympathetic father who struggles more patiently than most would with his precocious "Bad Seed" of a daughter. Dakota Fanning is superb as the mischievous daughter who knows more than she is telling, right up to that tricky ending. Meanwhile, "Hide and Seek" dutifully trots out its red herrings one-at-a-time. No sooner does one character qualify as a red herring than they meet their maker and the next candidate approaches. "Hide and Seek" is the kind of improbable horror chiller that you should not take a ride and peek.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When will someone produce a movie of this genre that is not predictable. You literally have to be an idiot not to know the true identity of Charley from the beginning. There was no suspense, to many implausible suspects. The only things that make this worthwhile is the cast that more likely than not jumped on the "I want to work with Dakota Fanning Bandwagon". I can only imagine that the script was better on paper. I wasn't even planning to see it because I guessed the ending based on the trailer ( they continue to give away to much ), I just happened to have time to kill, and this did it. For those of you actually looking for a good movie to see, skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The little girl in War of the Worlds was one of the most irritating things, so I decided to see if I'd have the same reaction to the actress in this film. Basically former doctor David Callaway (Robert De Niro) and his traumatised and mentally disturbed nine-year-old daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) have moved to the country in upstate New York, after the suicide of wife/mother Alison Callaway (Amy Irving). Instead of making her better, the move has made Emily a little worse for ware, creating an imaginary friend named "Charlie", but family friend and fellow doctor Katherine (Famke Janssen) says this is pretty innocent and there's nothing to worry about. Slowly though this imaginary friend may in fact be a dangerous expression of feelings, when writing appears on the bathroom walls, and other mysterious things happen. David of course blames Emily, but she protests that it is Charlie that did it all, even the one or two deaths that are the worst thing imaginable to happen. The twist near the end of the film (I suppose I didn't expect it) is that Charlie is in fact a schizophrenic second personality inside David, so of course he/they are bound to want to kill anyone that gets in their way of making life a misery. Also starring Elisabeth Shue as Elizabeth, Happiness's Dylan Baker as Sheriff Hafferty, Melissa Leo as Laura, Robert John Burke as Steven, Molly Grant Kallins as Amy and David Chandler as Mr. Haskins. The story may not be very original, but De Niro, and even the slightly annoying Fanning, do make good performances, and there are one or two not too bad thrills, so it's not an all terrible psychological horror thriller. Okay!</fullReview>

Hope you have seen the spoiler warning but here goes, 1: people do not cast Robert De Nero to play sensitive understanding people, 2: only one person had keys to the rooms. A very famous film reviewer, who I can not remember the name of now, once said of Robert De Nero that "He makes two kinds of movie one of which he believes in and makes as a piece of art and the other is there to pay his bills" This movie is so much the second in this statement that it really is not worth watching. I hate the way studios come up with such old hat ideas and try and sell them as blockbusters by putting big stars in there when all they really need to do is risk a bit on new directors and go back to the idea of creating great movies instead of easy cash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller that starts good but disappoints in the end. Dakota Fanning is superb.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have long contended that virtually any writer can come up with a good premise and write half of a good movie. But only the really fine writers can write a satisfying ending. "Hide and Seek" is one of those that starts out very nicely, sets up a very interesting premise, but the final act plays out much like other thrillers of this type. While it is an interesting movie for the performance of child star Dakota Fanning, who is superb as the troubled daughter, the other cast members are just OK with the scripts they are given. Filmed in the winter mostly in upstate NY, the almost black and white of the film adds to its sinister tone.The story starts in NYC, and we can see that David Callaway (DeNiro) and his wife (Amy Irving) have a strained relationship. David awakes suddenly at 2:06AM, senses something is not quite right, and goes to find his wife dead in a bathtub full of bloody water, an apparent suicide. After the funeral, David decides a fresh start is in order, especially for his traumatized young daughter Emily (Fanning), so they move upstate to a rather small community. Emily is withdrawn, but she says she has met a mysterious new playmate, "Charlie", but who is Charlie? Is he a real person, maybe the strange man next door, or perhaps just a figment of Emily's imagination? Regardless, strange things begin to happen, and David, who is a Psychologist, works to get to the bottom of this, and to help his daughter heal.MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW. David meets a new friend, recently divorced Elizabeth (Elisabeth Shue). As they begin to get closer, Emily says that "Charlie" doesn't want them to. Several times the 2:06AM is important.When Elizabeth is visiting Emily in her bedroom, playing hide/seek with "Charlie", something comes out of the closet, Elizabeth is terrified, she falls backwards out of the 2nd story window to her death. It was at that point I realized that "Charlie" was David's evil alter ego, who had killed his wife and made it look like suicide. So the rest of the movie plays out as "Charlie" gets more persistent, kills the sheriff who came into his home, and in the cave at night down the hill is about to harm Emily, when Psychologist friend Katherine (Famke Janssen) is able to get the gun and shoot "Charlie". The movie ends with Katherine taking care of Emily, who makes a drawing of the two of them, but Emily has two heads!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert De Niro may be one of the greatest actors of the 70ties, but he's really met the wall in his latter days. Acting in poor movies, were his latest performance in HIDE AND SEEK don't really spice things up, it's still going downhill for Mr. De Niro, very downhill. And with the upcoming youngster Dakota Fanning doing a better performance, still she doesn't do a especially good one - HIDE AND SEEK really misses it spots.Widower David and his daughter Emily are having a tough time after their wife/mother committed suicide. Moving from the city out to the county to start their own rehabilitation. But soon, Emily finds solace in a imaginary friend named Charlie...HIDE AND SEEK spins around the typical, tired and way too used scares around freaky children and psychotic twists. And if that kind of movie does its job well, you can't blame it. But a movie that truly doesn't succeed simply falls in the grave without no one even noticing that it had birth. Robert De Niro acting time after time ridiculously bad as the worried father and Dakota Fanning (much better in War Of The Worlds) doesn't put anything of soul or interest into her confused character, the whole horror anchor in the movie should do a better job than this. Though my expectations weren't that high either, this movie ruins all of it's treasures. The whole idea about psychological excitement with children is originally a good idea, but as more and more movies use the formula the effect surely lessen.You shouldn't get scared watching this movie, it's even pathetic sometimes. If you're a huge fan of the young star Fanning, it may be a reason, but you will surely be disappointed after her performance here.</fullReview>

We already saw that in other Hollywood pieces but, unlike usually, this movie gets the viewer to have many chilling scares, due to some really frightening and well shot scenes.

This film is very cleverly put together with Robert De Niro playing his role in the film with excellent acting prowess.

		<fullReview>Why is it that whenever something bad happens to an urbanite in a thriller-horror film, his solution always is to move his family to the country, to a large house in a secluded spot? How come the family never decides the best way to recuperate after a tragedy is not to seek solace in some lonely house in small-town America but, instead, to find some happy place, like a lovely cottage on the beachfront in Key West or the Gulf of Mexico? You would think that these chaps have seen enough horror movies to know that moving to the country never is a good idea.Not that there are any good ideas in "Hide and Seek." Despite a stellar cast - Robert De Niro, Dakota Fanning, Elisabeth Shue, Famke Janssen, Dylan Baker and Amy Irving - this is yet another dreary, tepid thriller with a sole gimmick, and not a good, or original, one at that.When New York City psychologist David Callaway (De Niro) suffers a personal tragedy, he promptly moves himself and his young daughter Emily (Fanning) to the country, to a place called - and I'm not making this up - Woodland, because the writer, Ari Schlossberg, couldn't think of a more original name for the town. Emily's struggling to deal with the tragedy and doesn't take too kindly to her dad's friendship with a young woman, Elizabeth (Shue), who has a young niece who pops in for one scene before promptly disappearing from the story. The Callaways also have neighbors (Melissa Leo and Robert John Burke), who, as neighbors in these sorts of films are apt to be, seem slightly strange. There's also the town sheriff who seems a bit creepy. Emily soon finds herself an imaginary friend named Charlie and things go horribly haywire.For a mystery/thriller/horror, or whatever you want to call it, director John Polson's film is surprisingly devoid of all three. "Hide and Seek" contains no suspense; it's a movie where the audience is so far ahead of the characters that it seems inconceivable no one on screen has figured out the mystery. Having the audience know more than the characters isn't necessarily bad. The trouble with this film is the audience figures out the whole mystery about 45 minutes to an hour into the film. So there's nothing left to keep us on tenterhooks after that.It doesn't take a genius to figure out this film out. It's not that you have be particularly smart, it's that Schlossberg's script isn't. And in case you didn't quite solve the puzzle, about an hour into the film, he makes it blatantly obvious.To make matters worse, Schlossberg and Polson create no mystery about the film's denouement. His script is so utterly conventional that you can predict not only the ending, but also where it will take place. Aussie-born actor-turned-filmmaker Polson, whose directing credits include the awful teen thriller, "Swimfan" (2002), directs with little imagination, opting for routine shocks and contrived moments of suspense that never rise above ho-hum.Young Fanning does well as a girl who just might be spooky or someone simply trying to hold on to her wits. She keeps us guessing, though because the story's secret is so obvious, much of her work is for naught. De Niro apparently didn't learn enough about being in bad movies from last year's "Godsend," so he sleepwalks through yet another role. The paycheck for this must have been too attractive to refuse. For a man considered to be the greatest actor of his generation, De Niro's sure has made a name recently by dialing in his performances in mediocre fare. Oscar-nominee Shue, Janssen and Baker all have thankless roles and do their best with what Schlossberg wrote for them. Which isn't much.Films like "Hide and Seek" must frustrate talented new writers who can't get their good scripts by Hollywood execs. Many terrific scripts flounder while studios green light crap like this. Watching "Hide and Seek," I was reminded of a chilling little film from the 1980s - Joseph Ruben's "The Stepfather" (1987). And I realized how much happier I'd have been sitting at home watching that film again than waiting for this bore to come to its blah conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hide &amp; Seek A Welcome Break From The Everyday Horror Filler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First 2005 movie I get to see, and it's a horror flick with Robbie deNiro and Dakota Fanning. Fanning has constantly impressed me, but deNiro proved he'll do schlock horror films like Godsend. However, this one wasn't another crappy PG-13 horror flick. It didn't look like a stupid slasher 'Freddy vs. Jason' type either. So did I want to see this? Hell yes. Is it any good? Plot: 19/25: After his wife Alison (Irving) slits her wrists, psychologist David Callaway (deNiro) takes his daughter Emily (Fanning) out to live in the country to try to get away from it all. Emily becomes very secluded and makes up an imaginary friend named Charlie. At least David thinks he's imaginary. But when things start to happen and Emily starts to get scared? Of course, there is a little more involved. David begins to form a relationship with local divorcé Elizabeth Young (Shue), which started when he tried to help Emily find friends in her niece (which, of course, never really got anywhere). There also is a part involving their neighbours (Leo &amp; Burke), who recently lost a child.All in all, the plot works well for a horror movie. It is fairly intelligent, but becomes a little too stereotypical for my taste at the end, using a plot device that is both unnecessary and unwanted. For the most part, though, the plot carries the chills that we want.Horror: 23/25: Basically, horror movies nowadays are divided by PG-13 or R. The PG-13 ones are toned down, relying on quick grabs and darkness. R rated horror movies, with few exceptions, rely on over-excessive gore and sex. Now, each of these can work. I liked The Ring and I liked Dawn of the Dead. But H&amp;S tries something more different. This one creates a genuinely creepy atmosphere. It got an R rating not because of gore (which is minimal) or sex (which doesn't exceed Shue wearing low-cut dresses), but because this one is the kind of movie that genuinely has you scared while you sit in your little chair. Granted, it does cheap out now and then and use some lights-off scares, and is never really scream-out-loud scary, but the atmosphere will have you paralyzed.Acting: 25/25: DeNiro (The Godfather Part Two) has been in a slump lately. The only hits he's had since '97 have been comedies (though I thought City by the Sea and Men of Honour were both great). Here, deNiro is great, showing that, even if he hasn't shown it in a while, he still has what it takes to give a great performance. Fanning (Man on Fire) is the most talented young actress working now, and is extremely creepy here. Shue (Hollow Man) shows the concern for Emily needed for her character, but basically doesn't have much to due but show cleavage. Janssen (X-Men) is good, but underwritten, as David's friend/co-worker. The acting, due to the two leads, gets a perfect.Entertainment: 22/25: Apparently, this movie is getting panned. While I can understand complaints about the ending, this movie is a very welcome break from the barrage of terrible horror movies we've seen recently. When horror movies didn't have so much gore it was silly or tamed themselves down to make a quick buck, we had movies that had a frightening atmosphere, and this is a great throwback to the time when horror movies were actually scary. If you are a self-respecting horror fan, you owe it to yourself to ignore the critics and see this one.Total: 89%: Hide and Seek is underrated, that's all there is to it. It creates a frightening atmosphere that draws you in, partly thanks to great acting, and is a welcome break from the everyday crap we're spoon-fed so often. I, for one, recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dakota, DeNiro Deliver!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter what you think of the movie's final act, HIDE AND SEEK is worth watching for the performances alone. I, for one, liked the ending even though I saw it coming a reel away. It's the only way the movie could've ended for me. No one else could've been Charlie. I would've been disappointed if it didn't end the way it did. What makes the ending so effective is that it makes the performances even richer. Despite what its distributor 20th Century Fox would like you to believe, it's not a "twist" movie. HIDE AND SEEK is an acting thriller. The biggest thrill is watching De Niro and Dakota Fanning. The biggest suspense lies in whether a master actor would hold his own against a scene-stealing student. The "twist" for me is that the master still has the chops. De Niro gives a quietly compelling performance. It seems hip nowadays to bash De Niro for choosing projects that aren't worthy of his talent. Hey, he's De Niro. He can do whatever he wants. I think his role in HIDE AND SEEK is a worthy and challenging one. It's a role that requires subtlety and power. De Niro delivers. And there's the challenge of going toe to toe with that kid phenom. The music they create together is beautiful and haunting. They're so good together it's scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was awesome! I was so creeped out! I seriously thought that Charlie was a doll! Emily played and mutilated her dolls, so I thought that her doll had come to life or something. I had no idea it was her father. That was so surprising. I had no idea what was happening. I knewn that Emily wasn't the one doing it, but I didn't know for sure who was. I highly recommend this film. Robert De Niro did a wonderful job. He is a very talented actor. Dakota Fanning also did a very good job. She look like a possessed little child. I did think that her mom did kill herself. She had taken wine and pills, acted like she would never see her daughter again, and acted like nothing would solve what was going on with her and her husband so she was going to end it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as thrillers go, this was pretty okay. As far as copycats go this was tip of the top. Combining the insane genius of both "Secret Window" and "A Beautiful Mind" this movie classically brings out the psycho in all of us. Take the gentle naivety of Mort from "Secret Window" and toss in a little girl and *poof*... You have the makings of "Hide and Seek". Of all of the movies I have seen this year, this is the worst of the worst. This movie makes "Elektra" look like an Oscar Winner. As far as the play, it sucked, the players however were most amazing. Young Dakota Fanning plays Emily to a perfect tee, catching every bit of emotional damage a child would receive after losing a parent, and playing it up to make you almost afraid of her. Robert De Niro did well as the doting father who has to help his 'deranged' daughter try and deal with her feelings on her mothers death. Elisabeth Shue, however small her role, brought her character to life in this movie with a creepy decadence that would only lead on to believe that she will be Charlie's next victim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hide and Seek? More like Thriller by Numbers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! WHY? Why must movies do this to me? Man, this is so annoying.Everything starts out great. Robert De Niro's wife kills herself. Ooooh, we're dealing with dark subject matter! Dakota Fanning displays her fine acting ability and starts to act a little creepy. All right, scary kids rule! De Niro decides they need to move to a house out in the middle of nowhere. Woo-hoo, a creepy location! OK, I must admit that I'm not so sure that moving to a spooky house located in a deserted place in the woods is really the best solution to help your daughter get over her mother's horrific suicide, but hey, it makes for an unsettling atmosphere so I'll roll with these dice.What next, ah yes, the eerie next door neighbors who recently lost a child. We all know something strange is going on there! Then Dakota notices a spooky looking entrance to the woods, along with an even spookier looking cave. Shades of Pet Sematary anybody? This is getting' good, folks. And they just get better when Dakota comes back from the woods with an imaginary friend, Charlie.Cue the tense music, throw in some strange and threatening comments that Dakota claims Charlie told her, add De Niro's nightmares waking him up and leading him to several grisly scenes in the bathroom (no, Taco Bell was NOT involved), and I'm hooked, baby! I was eagerly waiting to see what would happen next. But then I started thinking...Oh no. Please don't let my theory come to fruition.My friend turned to me and said, "I hope (spoiler deleted) doesn't turn out to be (spoiler deleted). That'd be awful." Sigh. I replied, "Yep. I hope that's not the case, but I was thinking the same thing." Then Stephanie turned to me and said, "I think I know." To which I replied, "I hope it's not (spoiler deleted)." Stephanie confirmed that's exactly what she was thinking. We watched in dread.Then the revelation came. I'm sad to report that all three of us nailed it.And unfortunately, it's all downhill after that. I sighed, sat back in my seat, and proceeded to not care anymore. And what's worse is that there was about 20 minutes left! It's like watching your favorite sports team play its guts out for most of the game, but then they start getting blown out. You know there's no chance of them making a comeback, but for some reason you continue to watch anyway.I just don't get it. The first 2/3rds of the movie is very effective and very well-done. Dakota and De Niro are very good and very convincing in their roles. I've used "very" way more times than necessary in any one review. But then the big "twist" is revealed, and it's pretty much the same thing I've seen in at least three movies within the last year that have been as equally disappointing.To make matters worse, we're treated to a series of inane and completely ineffective flashbacks that try to show us what was going on the entire time. They don't make any sense because none of the pieces fit in the puzzle that has been created. I don't mind being manipulated by a movie. The Sixth Sense did a great job of convincing us that one thing was happening, but then completely turning everything around and showing us what was really going on. The flashbacks actually worked within the context of everything we'd already seen. Sadly, that ain't the case with IL' Hide and Seek.Nope. The writers just decided to make up stuff at the end of the movie that contradicts everything we've already seen just so they could try to explain their stupid plot twist. It's a cop-out, and my intelligence doesn't appreciate it.I think I figured out why the movie is called Hide and Seek. It looks like the writers decided to hide about 2/3rds of the way through, and nobody bothered to seek out good writers to finish the script. They should've just called the movie Thriller by Numbers because after the big revelation, somebody just opened their copy of The Big Book of Thriller Clichés and started checking them off the list. It's just so frustrating.Come on, if you show up at a house and notice an empty police car outside with its lights flashing, you might be alarmed, right? Well, what would you do if you then walked inside the house and saw a bloody shovel lying in front of an open door that leads down to a dark, dingy basement? You'd walk up to the door, peer into the darkness, and call out someone's name, right? OF COURSE NOT! So why are we expected to believe Famke Janssen's character would be so stupid? Sigh.Note to Hollywood: If you're gonna give us an effective set-up, then please LEARN HOW TO EFFECTIVELY END THE MOVIE! For thrillers like this, the payoff is everything. I'm so sick of this disappointment.THE GIST Hide and Seek is an effective thriller for about an hour. Unfortunately, when it comes time to give us the big revelation, the movie becomes entirely predictable and clichéd. I suppose if you haven't seen any Sixth Sense rip-offs within the past couple of years, then you might not see what's coming, but that's highly suspect. Wait for the rental. Maybe there will be deleted scenes or an alternate ending that will help the movie find some sort of redemption.3 (out of 5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hide and Seek (2005) * 1/2 (out of 4) Robert DeNiro plays a psychiatrist who moves his daughter (Dakota Fanning) to the country after the suicide of his wife. Soon his daughter, still traumatized by her mother's death, begins talking with an imaginary friend but soon this friend might be up to evil deeds. Having seen this and Godsend it's clear to me that DeNiro needs to stay away from the horror genre that involves any kids. Both of these movies feature the legendary actor turning in bland performances and the movies themselves are way below his talent. This movie never really warmed up with me but I kept watching just to see how everything worked out and when that third act happened I was left even more disappointed. It's true this type of film needs red herrings and it needs twists and turns but at the end of the movie we should be able to look back and see what we got those twists and they had better line up. That's not the case here because the ending is so downright stupid simply because it isn't possible. I heard that Fox was real hush-hush so that no one would give away the ending but to me it really wouldn't have mattered. The DVD offers up four alternate endings so that should have told me something. With that said, the movie was lacking in various areas including the direction, which was flat from start to finish. There's never really any drama during the first hour of the movie and the end, which itself runs nearly thirty-minutes, never packs any suspense. There are several moments where things will jump out at you but they're so obvious that I couldn't help but laugh when they happened. The performances are also rather disappointing considering the talent involved. DeNiro sleepwalks through his role and it struck me that he was rather bored doing it. Fanning was okay in her role but the screenplay really didn't give her much to work with. Elizabeth Shue, Amy Irving, Dylan Baker and Famke Janssen are all wasted in their roles. The thriller genre has so many titles to it that it's not too hard to find a great one but it's also quite easy to find a bad one, which is what this movie is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is only one thing stopping me from giving this movie an A. The problem lies in it's plot. It's another movie with psychological problems. Everyone is doing that now that it's getting boring. Movies like secret Window or Fight Club have the same thing going on! It's so boring now and common, but the plot itself was good, the direction going into the problem was good. The actors were very good, Melissa Leo is such a great actress that i actually believed her part, if it were anyone else, i would have thought it was sad. Datoka Fanning is so good, that she will be an excellent actress in the future. I was extremely impress with hers and Robert De Niro, considering his films have been becoming stale lately. Famke Janssen, there are no words about how great she is. In fact, i would advise other people to put her into more movies. Her bit was great, she just is! Can't wait for X3. Elizabeth Shue. Finally, she dies! I have been waiting for a movie where she finally gets Death's cold hands. Hollow Man, whatever it would have been without her and Kevin Bacon. The twist was great, in fact, it was better than The Village's twist. But sadly not better than The Others. That will never be beat. All and all, the movie had finer points and some stiff but yet it is a guarantee that it will be in the highlighted part in my list. B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had many bad things, but i want to start with the good ones. Robert Deniro gave a great performance. The movie created an insanely creepy atmosphere. The little girl is very creepy at times. And, surprisingly, it had its funny moments. Which is more than I can say for Deniro's last movie, Meet the Fockers. Alright, now that we have gotten the good things out of the way, we can start on the reasons why I gave this movie a three. The plot, it is nonsensical, yet predictable. The characters are all poorly developed, and with the exception of Deniro and the little girl, poorly played. Though, it is creepy, it is not scary. Dramatic music and lights turning off take away the whole surprise element. They hid the killer's identity well, for awhile, but any one with half a brain needs to see forty five minutes of this film to solve the mystery. There is nothing redeemable about this movie. I regret seeing it almost is much as i regret seeing Meet the Fockers, and I am a man who hated seeing Meet the Fockers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the critics would have us believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd really been looking forward to this one, so I was rather disappointed when my favorite critic roasted it as have others as well. (Of course these are some of the same people who thought "The Ring" and "The Grudge" were masterpieces.) Although I would like to see the movie a second time to see if in fact the pieces do fit once the viewer knows the secret, my initial impression is that they do.SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER This is one of those films that contains all sorts of elements that seem inconsistent or not quite right initially, but when viewed from a different perspective in fact prove to be the foreshadowing for the twist (i.e. very "Sixth Sense"). I was bothered at first by little things -- David (Robert DeNiro) tells everyone he wants to be a full-time dad to Emily (Dakota Fanning), but then leaves her by herself for seemingly hours as he retires to his study, puts on his earphones and goes to work, although he no longer appears to be a practicing psychologist. He also seems to be the most inept psychologist around in dealing with his daughter's grief by insisting on carrying out the dead mother's rituals, inviting an attractive woman to dinner much too soon, and otherwise showing an incredible lack of empathy as either a psychologist or a father.I would have to see the movie a second time to see if it cheats in anyway. The problem is that when a twist changes an entire perspective on a film, the point-of-view itself becomes unreliable, so things that might otherwise seem unbelievable may simply not have occurred. I keep wrestling with the problem that Emily is presented as an intelligent, sensitive child who at a much earlier point might have reacted to her father's aberrant behavior by reaching out to her psychiatrist, neighbors, or even the "love interest", Elizabeth (Elizabeth Shue), and would certainly not herself have become creepy. But I give the film the benefit of the doubt in that it may have given us the clues that Emily's behavior is no more being portrayed accurately than is David's. For example, the handling of Emily's alleged attack on Amy's doll seemed incredible to me in that neither Elizabeth nor David ever indicated Amy was upset, suggesting the incident never happened but that perhaps Emily did not want to play with Amy again because she perceived her as being in harm's way.One thing I can't fit together is the story of the neighbors, which feels like it was meant to be longer or more developed. Certainly it makes sense that the husband out of his own grief in having lost a daughter might have picked up on something when Emily talked to him in the yard, thereby justifying his coming over to David's house and insisting on seeing her to make certain she was all right. But the scene between David and the wife didn't ring true (of course again, if presented via David's perspective, it didn't have to be true.) All in all, I did enjoy the movie, especially as it gave Dakota Fanning a chance to stretch her skills to play both a truly creepy and utterly sympathetic child.</fullReview>

Acting was convincing mostly but the little girl reminded me of the little dweeb from "A.I".Overall though this mish mash of successful horror films ("the shining" and "The 6th sense" mainly) is boring and the reward for the monotony of a full viewing is a lame ending that most people can see coming from the 1st 30 minutes of the film.A big waste of time.</fullReview>

It was simply a rip off of The Shining in New York, with a daughter, and no wife. absolutely horrible. I mean, the plot was pointless. There were pointless parts that were sloppily written in for extra content. There was of course the typical horror part where you're supposed to realize the plot and what's going on, and of course it didn't, in fact it made the movie more confusing. I suggest for a good laugh, you see this. But not only was the movie not scary, it didn't make sense. This movie was awful, the epitome of bad. DeNiro was a bit cool by the end of the movie, but not scary. How can a person remember something else, but do something else entirely? A person cannot be writing in a study and go to a cave in the woods about 1000 feet away in mere seconds.

Problem was, the mood continued throughout, IE : a snooze. From the opening, the movie promises us a psychological thriller, beginning with bedtime games. But then sadly, it turns to tasteless overuse of the standard spook stuff: dark and hidden cellars and caves, bloody bathtubs and writing on walls, rattling doorknobs, exploding closets, and so on. Yes, DeNiro can act, carrying off the most unbelievable character morph in recent memory. Yes, Dakota can act, struggling her character through the many cracks and knotholes in the fragile plot. Sorry. A Stephen King wannabe movie that just doesn't make it. Maybe rent "Stand By Me" to view at home. No, I don't need my money back: The snooze was worth it.</fullReview>

Dakota Fanning is an outstanding actress. She reveals that she is one of the most dimensional actresses and can outdo anyone's performance. This movie for Robert DeNiro is a good chance to see what other talents he has! His acting, to me, is one of the best seen yet compared to his other movies! This movie was amazingly made and should receive the maximum amount of stars! It will for sure be a popular classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-done horror thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hide and Seek is a solid thriller. It is well-acted and well-photographed. It has been some time since I wanted to say anything nice about Robert DeNiro. His lowlifes and tough guys and neanderthal gangsters were getting very stale. He was very good in this. I like the way he relates to his troubled daughter. Dakota was excellent as was the underemployed Famke Jansen. Unlike the Shyamalan efforts,which have never failed to bore me to distraction, this movie is actually entertaining. The ending of Signs had me shaking the seat in front of me and howling like George C.Scott in Hardcore. The good reviews that followed it made me doubt the integrity of professional critics. Take it from someone who has no axes to grind, who is not connected to the movie industry in any way,no behinds to kiss, no under the table pay offs expected, Hide and Seek is better than most of the movies that I saw last year. See it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pathetic piece of dog turd!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did I even think about watching this movie? Why did I even tell myself that this film was going to be good? Answer: Robert De Niro. I love watching films that star De Niro and my brain was telling me that Hide and Seek was going to be a horror-packed, creepy, and a smart film. But sometimes even respected actors tend to be greedy and star in pointless movies just to earn a million bucks which obviously turn out to be sh*t. Just ask Ray Liotta that. I can't even begin to say how truly pathetic this film was. Pardon me, you can't call even call Hide and Seek a good film, more like a stupid project by a director with a kid brain. The film, as everyone knows, has copied the same idea from a Stephen King book a.k.a Secret Window. There were many things wrong with this film, one of them being the film itself, and that stopped the good stuff from reaching the surface. The twists were predictable, annoying, clichéd, and stupid but above all unnecessary. The idea for the film "had" great potential but John Polson, director, decided to turn it into a brainless horror-thriller. My sister was begging me to watch this as soon as we came from the video store and after a couple of no's, I gave in. The beginning starts out slow and it remains like that the whole way but at the end it begins to pace up and just as soon as I realized the connection between this and Secret Window, my hopes die downed. They just fell like a lump of sh*t from anus. Pardon my French! One thing to whoever is reading this review, don't watch it and make a mistake like I did. I am begging you and if you are still waiting to watch it, prepare to be bored or worse, sleep! The acting was horrible and it is clearly evident that Famke Janssen was wearing a lame act and Robert De Niro didn't even bother to try but you have to give it to him that he is still better that most actors when he is not trying. He earned one star from me*. Dakota Fanning demolished everyone in acting and she delivered a good strong performance, that is really good for a six-year old rookie. Another star!** After his wife commits suicide in her bathtub, David Callaway and his daughter, Emily Callaway, move somewhere upstate to have a new fresh start in their lives. It would be good for Emily because she saw her own mother die and maybe she can recover from the shock with all the fresh air. It all seems easy but when Emily makes a "new" friend, her father decides to investigate. He finds out that she is taking comfort in an imaginary friend called Charlie and her personal doctor advices him to get through to Emily from Charlie. From boredom to bad acting, this film is full of it and believe me when I say, FULL OF IT!The bad script writing, probably written by a two year old, also is a downside to the acting because it makes the performances look worthless and brainless. The script is a cliché itself and is no different from any other crap movies' script. It just doesn't match the scene from time to time. There are scares in this movie but very seldom. The movie probably made me jump two times during the whole time and that is a total shame because now you can't even call this a horror film. Hollywood and other companies should stop wasting their money on bullsh*t because at the end it WILL be crap. My three-year old sister can make a better movie than this and the funny thing is the budget will be ten bucks. HAHAHAHAHA! Not funny! The atmosphere gave this a dark moo-dish look but even that could not make up for the sh*tt*ness. But still it deserves another star from me.***. So here is my comment, to read more reviews click my name which is highlighted in BLUE. 3/10 - Worthless and please avoid it."Over and Out" 26 January 2010.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can be predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hide and Seek (2005, Dir, John Polson) After the sudden death of his wife, David Callaway (De Niro) takes his traumatised daughter, Emily (Fanning), away to find peace and to start their life again in a new home. Emily fails to settle in well, with David becoming concerned as Emily identifies with Charlie. Someone who David has never met before, but who likes to play Hide and Seek.Decent thriller which can end up being predictable, as the story is very similar to other films. Casting and acting is good, but not a lot is featured to make it great viewing after the first time.He doesn't want me to talk about him. ? Emily Callaway (Dakota Fanning)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God Awful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood felt it was time for yet another creepy kid horror, so courtesy of Fox we got Hide and Seek. The only redeeming factors for me were that it stared De Niro (although why he is still a factor is becoming less and less apparent as he had not made a good film since Cape Fear and Heat), however, star on the rise (Fanning) who had yet to put her foot wrong seemed like a better bet. Now, I'm all for creepy kid thrillers (from the brilliant The Sixth Sense to the mediocre The Ring) but this film seemed like it just had nowhere to go. It was an ending (albeit a ridiculous ending) searching for a story. Nothing ever seemed to happen as the film tirelessly labored on and got more and more implausible till finally when the ending arrived I couldn't help but laugh out aloud. I had been promised a thriller, been bored to tears and now was fits of hysterics as the credits rolled. And no, I was not a happy person as 90 minutes were lobbed of my life sitting though this pure and utter drivel. Avoid at all costs 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Easy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be too easy for me to say that this was a bad movie. It would also be too easy for me to say that it was predictable and poorly directed. See, easy. That, however, is not what I will say. Instead I will say that the actors Dakota Fanning, and Mr. De Niro were both excellent in a film that didn't do them justice. They are both wonderful actors and did the best they could under the circumstances. The movie's plot was just too easy to figure out. If you saw the previews and didn't know the killer was De Niro's character, well I won't say anything insulting. I saw the preview two times and I knew that it was her father (De Niro). Also the filming was heavy handed, the clues given throughout the movie were so blatant one might believe the director thinks that we are all idiots. The mirrors everywhere, Dakota's cryptic messages to her father, De Niro's character waking up at 2:06AM every night, his weird dreams, etc. The director tries to throw you off the scent of the true Charlie by adding characters like the weird neighbors, the freaky cop, and Dakota's therapist but it just doesn't work. The premise of this film was flimsy at best. While there were a few moments of "freakiness" such as the cat in the bathtub, the lady going out the window, and of course Dakota's increasingly strange behavior the film just couldn't be saved, except by ending. Which by the way was actually kind of cool if lacking in finesse. Overall I could take or leave this film. If you are a fan of De Niro, or Fanning (aka Caulkin Jr.) you may want to see this film. Otherwise wait until it comes out on video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Bad Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hide and Seek has to be the worst movie I've had to sit through recently, It's awful, Easily the worst performance by Robert Deniro BUT, all that said, it was a good performance by Dakota Fanning, She really is a talented little young actress, she plays the creepy child role really well, she was the only plus sign, for this movie apart from the Gorgeous looks of Famke Jansen. She looked awesome.I've watched a lot of Horror's, Scary movie's, and this along with Godsend are the worst both by Deniro! I found a lot of the creepy parts really funny, they were so laughable, the things they said, they weren't scary, it was a joke, everything horror like about this movie is a LOL, i was laughing my bottom off watching it! i had to check and try to find out if it was a black comedy or not.Save yourself money, if you fancy it, Rent it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the critics who are WRONG again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it amusing that so many of these professional critics can be so wrong on so many movies. Hide and Seek is just another case where these movie experts fall on their faces.Well done and acted, Hide and Seek is the kind of film that should rank along side The Sixth Sense. One sits back and thinks of all the things that could possibly explain the strange new "friend" who has suddenly popped up in the midst of a devastated family. And, only until the very end, is a satisfying answer giving.However, there are some problems that should have been edited on. Granted, this is not a perfect movie (name one that is), but the problems are not enough to drag it down.9 out of ten</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look I am not going to come to these boards like others and use fifty dollar words and catch phrases. Because I think thats lame, thats a shout out to the first poster here. Blow hard , know nothing movie critic.Now on to the film at hand, this movie was shot wonderfully. Editing and pacing of this film was right on target. The director got the very best talent out of his actors and actress's. The script was great as well.it gave you the creeps in all the right places, and always kept you guessing until the last twenty minutes or so, to what the hell is going to happen next. The film in the last few frames will have you questioning a lot, nice twist in the end.go see it with someone you love</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come out and see this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I like to see thrillers when they come out on video, mostly because there's always one jerk in the movie theatre who laughs at the tension and just ruins the mood. And that jerk is always sitting behind me. But this movie was so gripping that I only noticed the jerk when he shifted and kicked my seat and even with that interruption every 5 minutes, I still found the movie scary.We were told in the preview that the final reel was not given to theatres until just before the first showing so that the ending would remain a secret. Still, if you want the ending to be a surprise, go see this movie in the first week otherwise some jerk (no doubt related to my movie jerk) will talk about it loudly on the subway or at work. The acting was very good and the actors were all well cast.I gave it a 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worst film of all time! makes a feeble attempt to be clever when really it hasn't got a clue.This film isn't even worth watching.the narrative is a joke and the characters as forgettable as an episode of Star Treck. Really can someone please tell me really what on earth was the point of this film.I really can't find one and wish to God that I could have the time that I spent watching it back.What a completely terrible film.Don't get me wrong I tried to find the positive elements from the film not even Deniro's acting was worth any long amount of focus or attention.Really this truly is one of the worst films of all time.Its right up there some off the other Turkeys of the past 50 years of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it had a really good story line and a twisted ending... I'm really happy i saw it today! Its awesome how all of it came together at the end, and it kinda leaves you wondering... Wow... i cant wait until it comes on DVD, i am so going to buy it. Oh and if you haven't seen this movie i really recommend you do, Its good, and Dakota Fanning is such a great actress. Same as Robert Denero. Most of my friends thought it was okay, but if you like movies that are scary but not really scary you will like it. Also if you like movies that end in an unexpected way. Just please go and watch it! I'm sure you will enjoy it! Don't worry i didn't spoil anything...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hide and seek was ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>hide and seek was a pretty good movie. the plot was somewhat like the sixth sense and like a few other horror movies i've seen. hide and seek was never boring , a lot of it was more pop-up scary then reality scary. it wasn't very believable but the twist at the end was pretty good because having the neighbor being around Emily a lot made you think that he was "Charlie" and also how the neighbors wife said the same sort of thing that Emily said when she talked about Charlie. Dakota fanning was excellent but Robert Denero could have been a little more convincing as Emily's father and as Charlie, sometimes it didn't really look like he was really her father , he wasn't selling the role and when he was Charlie he didn't really act crazy he acted too normal which made the scene where everyone finds out that he is Charlie less scary and less surprising. in conclusion Hide and Seek was a good movie and pretty scary, definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deniro's Last Chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deniro is desperate. He knows a few things about himself: that he once had power, that he just isn't interesting enough as a person to transport us now by mere intensity, and that the world of acting is going over to actors that can "fold." Folded acting is the ability to present two characters or two layers or perspectives at the same time. The absolutely simplest case is a character with a double personality. So our man commissions a script so he can at least do just that.If you watch this, you'll have to sit through a whole bunch of setup that is there not for us, but for him. If you are willing to donate an evening to his attempt, be aware that he fails. Along the way, he borrows extensively from Jack's character in "The Shining" down to the helo shot driving to the "cabin."Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The set up is kind of fun, then the center of the film gets a little boring, then secrets are revealed and you realize you've been lobotomized by stupidity. Elizabeth Shue's cleavage is the best supporting character in this otherwise teeth grindingly dumb movie.The movie is about as light an R as you can get. It tiptoed past the PG-13 with a little bit of blood, but I have to wonder if they wanted the PG-13 and were surprised by this rating.Here's a question: what is the tipping point in DeNiro's career that took his from greatness to these crap dwellings? Even Angel Heart is a masterpiece compared to most of the schlock we've been getting from Bobby during the last DeCade. To the real Robert De Niro: Come out come out wherever you are!</fullReview>
