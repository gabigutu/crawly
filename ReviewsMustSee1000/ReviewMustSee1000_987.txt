		<shortDescription>A Comedy-Suspense Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eccentric millionaire Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) invites five of the world's greatest detectives, each allowed one guest, to dinner and a murder. Can the detectives, who turn out to be even more eccentric, stop the murder before it happens, and solve it if it does?I first saw this film as a kid in 1976 with my parents at the theater. Although I could remember I liked it at the time, I hadn't seen it since, and it was at best a vague memory. I certainly didn't remember it being so hilarious and entertaining. Written by Neil Simon and directed by Robert Moore, Murder By Death is a very funny spoof of some of literature/filmdom's most famous detectives, set in a beautifully designed, creepy mansion, and at times, becoming a fine mystery film in its own right.The jokes fly by very quickly and range from subtle to over-the-top, so attentiveness is required, and multiple viewings are rewarded. The cast is incredible, as you should expect by combining such luminaries as Peter Sellers, Peter Falk, Alec Guinness, James Coco and David Niven.A comic masterpiece--10 out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will make myself out to be a lover of films with absolutely no point, i especially love this film. The cast alone should make this a film on everyones watch list, never before has so much quality been brought together on one screen. Peter Sellars, at the height of his comic brilliance. Sir Alec Guiness, brilliant in any role, a credit to English acting, possibly the greatest ever actor. David Niven is a brilliant actor, then there are the other roles filletted out with the likes of Dame Maggie Smith, James Coco, Peter Falk, i could go on but i am running out of superlatives to describe the talent on view.The film itself is a pastiche of great detectives brought together to prove, who is the greatest? Added to the good script the talent of the actors, i am surprised the IMDb has rated this film so low, but i must accept that there are people on this earth, though inferior to me who are allowed to vote.Watch it, it is worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An amazing ensemble cast who must have all had their tongues most firmly planted in their cheeks to produce their performances in this highly amusing murder mystery spoof.By incorporating plots and characters from your favourite classic crime genres and gently poking fun at them all it is both funny and comfortingly familiar.So if you want great visual gags (blind butler, deaf maid), superb one liners (especially from Maggie Smith &amp; David Niven) and to escape for 90 minutes back into the gentler, less realistic Golden Age of Crime then you need look no further.If only there were outtakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Comic Ensemble Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a wonderful example of what you can achieve when you combine a great script with a fantastic cast. It is one of the great comic ensemble films, ranking up there along with Its a Mad, Mad, Mad World and Clue. I have loved this film since I first saw it back in the 70s and still find it just as funny today. I had hoped for sometime that a special DVD would be released to mark this film and allow us to know more about how it was made and hear comments from the surviving cast. Sadly, the DVD does have a great interview with Neil Simon, but nothing else. I was also disappointed to see absent missing scenes, especially the one showing Sherlock Holmes showing up at the end. Still, it was great to retire my dogeared video tape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crazy comedy-mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Murder by Death" is a comic murder-mystery done in absolute lunacy. I mean this is one screwball comedy that made me laugh out loud quite often. And yet, there are so many confusing moments that I didn't know what on earth was going on. It seems that writer Neil Simon was trying to complicate moviegoers with his screenplay to this movie which pays homage to detectives of old classic movies such as Charlie Chan, Miss Marple, Sam Spade, and Hercule Poirot. In "Murder by Death", a mysterious man invites the 5 greatest detectives to his home for "dinner and a murder" as he describes it. An all-star cast is featured here and all of them are very funny. The best: Peter Sellers in the Charlie Chan take-off. Sellers is of course best known for playing the inept Inspector Clouseau in the "Pink Panther" movies, but his role here as Chinese detective Sidney Wang is a hoot. He made me laugh the hardest. Just looking at him made me laugh. The way he talked made me laugh. He's naturally funny everytime he's on screen. Also funny: the great Sir Alec Guinness as a blind butler. I thought he was supposed to be a serious actor! I don't think I've ever seen Guinness in a movie comedy, but he makes the most of his character here. He comes second behind Sellers in the laugh department in "Murder by Death". Two other funny performances are turned in by James Coco and James Cromwell ("Babe" and "L.A. Confidential") as the Hercule Poirot sendoff and his chauffeur. It's funny to watch a younger Cromwell here speaking with a bad European accent. David Niven, Maggie Smith, Peter Falk, Eileen Brennan, Elsa Lanchester, and Nancy Walker also register laughs too. But the most downright goofiest character in "Murder by Death" is the host orchestrating this crazy game, played by Truman Capote. He's very funny too. Another major factor in the film are the sets of the old mansion the movie takes place in. They're marvelous. But at times the story gets real complicated and seems to get parts dislocated. It bothered me a little the first time I saw this. Now I just sit back and let the movie play on. Neil Simon intended on this to be a crazy comedy and in that way he succeeded. "Murder by Death" is all-in-all a very enjoyable movie.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Hoot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An all-star cast, superb dialogue, effective lighting and editing, great production design, and interesting costumes rev up the technical quality of this cinematic spoof of literary whodunits. An eccentric genius named Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) invites the world's five greatest fictional detectives to a dinner party, at which time someone will be murdered. The detective who solves the crime first gets $1 million.Everything in this film, from the acting to the sound effects to the plot ... is deliciously exaggerated ... hence the humor. For example, mystery readers accept that Hercule Poirot and Charlie Chan are so observant as to spot the most obscure clue, which conveniently points to the solution of the puzzle. In "Murder By Death" writer Neil Simon exaggerates that gambit. A guest detective draws the most outlandish conclusion from the most irrelevant fact, which in turn is shot down by another guest detective who points out the flaws, and then proceeds to do exactly the same thing.The dialogue is marvelous. In one scene the blind butler serves non-existent soup from an empty bowl, to which Miss Marbles (Elsa Lanchester) protests: "Murder by starvation, maybe that's his game". In another scene, Inspector Perrier (James Coco) reads from a list, and then concludes: "Everything here has been rented for tonight". Miss Marbles responds in a melodramatic voice: "You mean?" "Yes", answers Perrier momentously: "this entire murder has been -- catered".And then there's the scene wherein Sam Diamond (Peter Falk) ruminates: "I don't get it; first they steal the body and leave the clothes; then they steal the clothes and bring the body back. Who would do a thing like that?" To which Dick Charleston (David Niven) responds in a serious tone: "Possibly some deranged dry cleaner".The film's casting is wonderful. Truman Capote may not be much of an actor, but he brings to the film a personality that is appropriately eccentric. My only problem is that the amount of screen time for the cast is uneven ... too much for Peter Falk and Peter Sellers, and not enough for Elsa Lanchester, who arrives late."Murder By Death" is a wonderful film classic that still holds up thirty years after it was made. The film conveys no heavy-duty political or social "message", no great insight into the human condition. But when you're in the mood for lighthearted, escapist entertainment that provides some laughs, this film is a great choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sellers Shines In This Wild Spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most fun movies I've ever watched but I liked it better 20 years ago, frankly, than today. In a recent viewing, it seemed a bit sleazier than I had remembered. Nonetheless, it still has tons of laughs.This film has one of my all-time favorite characters: Sidney Wang, played by Peter Sellers. The late English actor did a fabulous job of imitating Charlie Chan. He is the highlight among a very talented cast that includes Peter Falk, David Niven, James Coco, Elsa Lanchester, Alec Guinesses, Maggie Smith, Nancy Walker and Truman Capote.Today, the character oddest for me to view is a young Cromwell who speaks with a French accent! I've never seen him in any role remotely resembling this. The other actors play roles typical of them, such as Niven and Smith's dapper "Thin Man" couple and Falk's, Columbo/Mike Hammer-style American detective.This a spoof of all the great detectives and the story has a purposely exaggerated amount of twists, particularly at the end....but, despite some of the typical crude 1970s type sexual innuendos, it provides entertainment start-to-finish with absolutely no lulls. It's a classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious whodunit spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an utterly hilarious parody, spoofing detective stories. Much of the humor is verbal, some of it relies on stereotypes and such related (mainly) to the crime story genre. Some of the humor is a tad dirty, and a bit of it is quite dark. Personally, I loved it, but if you have anything against such humor, you may want to skip this one. It doesn't try too hard to make you laugh. The laughs roll in quite naturally, as it parodies a few of the most well-known fictional detectives; Agatha Christie's Mrs. Marble, among others. The setting is one typical to detective stories, and the atmosphere is simply perfect. The plot is very good, and develops nicely while still remaining interesting. The pacing is mostly flawless, but it seemed to lose momentum some, around the last third. The acting is all good, especially from Alec Guinness, Peter Falk and Peter Sellers. One wouldn't expect particularly good performances in a comedy, but this manages. The film is well thought out and equally well-executed. The only thing I didn't like, was that the ending, or maybe the entire third half of the film seemed a bit anticlimactic. At this point, all the action is done, and we're just waiting to find out who's behind it all. The very end is quite good though, a very funny and entertaining twist to say the least. And everything leading up to it is incredibly funny. The characters, while admittedly based somewhat on stereotypes, are all entertaining and each have their own shtick; among them are Milo Perrier, the perpetually hungry and ridiculously sensitive Frenchman, and the *very* British Dick Charleston, played to perfection by David Niven, and last but most definitely not least, Sam Diamond(Peter Falk, doing his Columbo thing), borrowing from noir and Bogart, complete with nonsensical, lengthy rants. I recommend this to anyone into detective movies and/or spoofs. Do keep the humor I mentioned early in the review in mind when considering whether or not to watch. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Murder by Death is a fun movie that will no doubt be more enjoyable for fans of detective fiction and detective movies. The plot is about a group of detectives that are invited to a spooky house to solve a murder that hasn't been committed yet. The cast is star studded. Peter Sellers steals the show as the Charlie Chan character Mr. Wang. David Niven is typically classy and fun as the Nick Charles ripoff and Maggie Smith is great as the Nora Charles character. Peter Falk does his best Humphrey Bogart impression as Sam Diamond and it's pretty good. Elsa Lanchester makes a decent Ms. Marbles and the age factor is nicely aped when Estelle Winwood is mistaken for her character. James Coco is great as the Poirot character and overacts brilliantly. Truman Capote is extremely annoying but funny in spots as Lionel Twain. He's given some great lines to work with. The atmosphere is thick and the music is cool. The plot meanders toward the end and some of the "solutions" are pretty ridiculous but the rest of the movie is extremely enjoyable. 6.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting cast make interesting spoof!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing 'Murder by Death' once as a kid, so I thought I might rent it again. Unlike my numerous viewings of 'Clue', watching 'Murder By Death' seemed a new yet reminiscent experience.'Murder by Death' is written by Neil Simon and directed by Robert Moore. It stars Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, Maggie Smith, James Coco, Peter Falk and David Niven. It's about five of the world greatest detectives that are invited to a mansion for dinner and a murder. It's basically a spoof of the on the mystery genre and the great detectives of literature and film. I am not familiar with Neil Simon's written work but the script did have some funny but also repetitive moments. Robert Moore's direction was adequate and the performances were good- most notably from Peter Falk and Peter Sellers.Made in 1976, it's hard to imagine comedies being produced like this today. The main problem with 'Murder By Death' is that it seems to forget it's visual medium, and most of the gags come from the script. It's safe to assume that anyone could have directed this film, as it was the scriptwriter (Neil Simon) who was credited alongside the title. I felt that the mansion wasn't explored enough and therefore the mystery element was lacking. But then again, it was a comedy/spoof! I particularly liked the blind butler (Alec Guinness) and deaf cook (Nancy Walker) interaction! Peter Seller's Wang was very funny too, but I'm afraid some of today's politically correct audience will have a hard time separating racism from the obvious stereotypes in the portrayal of Wang and the other characters in the film. One must understand that the humour isn't based on race, rather Sellers was portraying a modern (at the time) 70s comic take on depictions of stereotypes within the character displayed in earlier detective, Charlie Chan. It was an obvious spoof on stereotypes already established in the famous detectives of the early era of film and literature.There is also a really interesting performance by a young James Cromwell in this film, which was pretty funny. 'Murder by Death' is an interesting film, if only for it's cast in an unusual spoof on the unique mystery genre. It's fairly enjoyable to watch but it isn't a laugh-a-minute experience. *** out of *****!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Words fail me, no single word can describe how funny this is!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is arguably one of my all time favourite films. A dream cast, a hilarious script and a cracker of an idea make for what is utter comedy gold! When you have Peter Falk, Peter Sellers, Alec Guiness, Maggie Smith, David Niven how could you fail?? Every member of the cast delivers their lines with slick brilliance. Which detective will prevail as the best, and who will solve the crime? It is impossible to pick out the funniest bits as there are so many. Estelle Winwood is sensational as Jessy Marble's Nurse and has some side splitting moments, incredible to think she was nearly 90. Nancy Walker's silent screaming too, brilliance. If I had to pick standout performance it would be Sir Alec Guiness, he is utterly sensational, when he takes on the different persona's at the unravelling of the murderer scene he is a true joy to watch, genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When murder can really be funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Murder by Death," is the best and funniest parody of mystery movies ever made. Neil Simon's premise is simple, yet ingenious. The world's greatest detectives ? from movies, of course ? come together to compete to solve a murder that has yet to occur. The plot has many twists. The cast is exceptional. Major stars of the past and present imitate major stars of the past and present (in 1976). It plays on words in the names of the characters. It has witty dialog and very funny lines throughout. I'll have more on the cast below. The direction is superb. And, the set for this film is marvelous. Columbia built the castle on a huge stage. Simon threw into the mix of the five super sleuths and their companions, three other characters. Truman Capote plays Lionel Twain, the host for the farce, and he does it quite well. Nancy Walker plays the temporary kitchen maid hired to cook the dinner. She is a deaf-mute. Alec Guinness is a blind butler who has worked for Twain for a time. Watch for all the fun over his name, Jamesir Bensonmum. Simon devised a plot with the butler at the center. And, Guinness provides more laughter than anyone else in this laugh fest. The opening has Twain writing the invitations to his murder-mystery dinner. No date is given, but it's to be Saturday at 7 p.m. The invitations are addressed to the super sleuths in New York, Catalina, Brussels, San Francisco and Sussex, England. So, in less than a week the five sleuths all receive their mail, book their travel reservations and make it to 22 Lola Lane, wherever that is. The invitations don't give the city and state. And then, the blind butler licks Eisenhower 8-cent stamps to put on all the invites, including those to Belgium and England. But, wait! He misses the envelopes and pounds the stamps on the desktop. Twain says nothing to him as he walks off to post the invites. It just gets better and better from there on. Outside, the house number is "22 Twain." This is a loaded play on words. First, Samuel Clemens' pen name was Mark Twain (for two). Second, it's a parody of Lionel toy trains -- the host's name is Lionel Twain. Third, when Charlie Wang and his adopted Japanese son pull up in their car, Charlie asks, "What number of house?" His son says "two, two." Charlie says, "Correct. Two-two Twain's house." I laughed so hard as Peter Sellers said the line that resembled a little child saying "choo-choo train." A very funny scene is the arrival of the deaf-mute maid. The Butler can't see her, and she can't hear him or speak. She holds up a note for Guinness to read while he says, "Speak up woman. Oh, a little shy. Well ?" and he hands her a menu and tells her to get cooking. Her note gives her name, Yetta, and says she can't read English. So, she sits down at the kitchen table and just waits ? to the end of the movie. This will be the source of much more humor when it comes time for Guinness to serve the dinner. Another great scene has Guinness escorting Dick and Dora to their room. Bensonmum, "Ah, here we are. The late Mrs. Twain's room. She died in here." Dora, "Oh, dear." Dick, "Died of what?" Bensonmum, "She murdered herself in her sleep, sir." Dick, "You mean suicide?" Bensonmum, "Oh, no. It was murder all right. Mrs. Twain hated herself. We keep this room locked." Dick, "Why is that?" Bensonmum, "Mr. Twain loved her very much. He's kept her room just as it was the night she choked herself nine years ago."Many people today may not know some of the parodied characters. So, here's a brief rundown. Peter Sellers plays Sidney Wang and Richard Narita plays Willie Wang. Wang is a parody of Charlie Chan, a Chinese- American detective created by American novelist Earl Derr Biggers. And, Sidney Toler was one of 13 actors who played Charlie Chan. He had the most roles -- 22 of the 58 films. Charlie Chan held the record for films based on his character until the late 20th century when Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot overtook him. Peter Falk plays Sam Diamond, a parody of Sam Spade. (He might have been named Sam Heart or Sam Club.) Dashiell Hammett created him in "The Maltese Falcon." Falk parodies the character that Humphrey Bogart played in the movie. Eileen Brennan plays Sam's sidekick, Tess Skeffington. David Niven and Maggie Smith play the roles that parody the Thin Man series of films in the 1930s and 1940s. William Powell and Myrna Loy starred as Nick and Nora Charles. Here, the sleuths are Dick and Dora Charleston. James Coco plays Milo Perrier, the parody of Hercule Poirot, and his sidekick is James Cromwell as Marcel. The last sleuth is Jessica Marbles, a double parody in hindsight. Jane Marple was another Agatha Christie creation, and Jessica is the name of a later sleuth, Jessica Fletcher. She was the TV character from the 1980s series, "Murder She Wrote.," that starred Angela Lansbury. How could Simon know her name so far in advance? Elsa Lanchester plays Jessica Marbles, and Estelle Winwood plays her nurse Withers. That's a spoof of yet another famous female detective of the early 1930s, Hildegarde Withers. She was created by novelist Stuart Palmer.This is a wonderful comedy, but it's not for the whole family. Kids ? even most teens won't get the witty lines. Most won't recognize or be able to appreciate the parodies. And, some of the language toward the end is unsuitable, including profanity, disrespect, and crudity. Most adults can tolerate the small amount of off-color language for the overall humor of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five known private eyes undertake an investigation and a millionaire offers a million dollars to the one who can solve the murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This popular charade deals with a fistful of famed stars incarnating notorious detectives . By the time the world's greatest detectives work out whodunit, you could die laughing! Five famous literary detective characters and their sidekicks are invited to a bizarre mansion full of secret passages and spinning rooms to solve an even stranger mystery , as James Coco as Milo Perrier who looks like Hercules Poirot (by Agatha Christie), as Peter Falk as Sam Diamond who looks like Sam Spade , Elsa Lanchester as Jessica Marbles similarly to Mistress Marple , David Niven as Dick Charleston as Nick Charles (created by Dashiell Hammett, whose Nick Charles and Sam Spade were the basis), Peter Sellers as Sidney Wang or Charlie Chan (written by Earl Derr Biggers). They are received by a blind butler played by Alec Guinness as Bensonmum and the eccentric millionaire Lionel Twain performed by Truman Capote invites them to dinner , offering one million to the one who can resolve the night's killing . As the popular characters must unravel a night of murder at a spooky country house , including a blind butler, a deaf-mute maid (Nancy Walker) . Exactly at midnight, a killing is going to take place. This rendition of a Neal Simon's novel in an entertaining and fun spoof of Agatha Christie , specially from books titled ¨Ten little Indians¨and ¨And then there were none¨ . Neil Simon remained on the set to take care of re-writes, as he did with this picture's sequel, The Cheap Detective. Simon took such a shine to Alec Guinness during the picture's production that he told him if he did not like anything in the film, he'd immediately rewrite it for him, but Guinness assured him it was great fun for him. The screenplay is funny and high quality in which it's not difficult to work out on which murder-solvers each of them is modeled ; furthermore , stands up Alec Guinnes as a botcher and hyperactive blind butler and a suitable eccentric James Coco as Poirot lookalike and Nancy Walker's last movie , ironic in that she does not utter a single word throughout the entire film. In the opening credits, each character's eyes move except for Peter Falk's (which may be an in-joke reference to his glass eye), and Alec Guinness's blind butler . It is in fact an amusing imitation of Crime Story including enjoyable and sympathetic performances by the entire cast . Well-known actors have the famous sleuths at large in a sinister country mansion , then appears amusement and entertainment , as all of them running around and taking place murders , who's the killer? . The entire cast seems to be subsisting on sugar with wild eyes and frenetic movements the order of the day . You'll enjoy enormously the impersonations of legendary detectives of cinema and fictions . Lively and fun musical score by Dave Grusin . Evocative and colorful cinematography by David Walsh. The motion picture was well directed by Robert Moore . Rating : Better than average . Followed by another hammy spoof titled ¨Clue¨(1985) a pale imitation of the earlier parody , being directed by Jonathan Lynn with Tim Curry , Christopher Lloyd , Lesley Ann Warren and Madeline Khan .</fullReview>

I loved the ending, it didn't make sense but it was still awesome!!!The characters were amazing, especially Milo Perrier and Jessica Marbles but I can't stop laughing about how amazing the character of Inspector Wang was. If you ever see this on TV, WATCH IT because it will leave you feeling so good about everything. This is probably one of the best movies of the '70s and needs more recognition, because everything about it was funny and clever.Lionel Twain was good but evil but confusing.....Aggh I don't know what to say about his character, but the butler creeped me out and cracked me up from the moment I saw him.</fullReview>

Like other mystery films, you cannot speak much about it to others who have not seen the film - least you ruin the entire movie for them. All I can say is just watch it if you love mystery and/or comedy films.The good thing about not watching a mystery film in a long time is that you may forget exactly whodunnit. I have done that with a few mystery films and this one is no exception.This is a great film to watch from time to time - after you forget exactly whodunnit!! Good companion films to this movie would be "Clue", "Deathtrap", "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid" and "Sleuth".9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Murder By Death is not a murder mystery. It is barely a spoof. It is, however, an homage to the writers, performers and producers of those trustworthy detective movies of the 40's and 50's. Neil Simon trucks out the gallant cliches of the film noire and presents them in the context of a gathering of the finest detectives from film and literature.Don't look for realism, rationale thought or logical sleuthing. You won't find it here. You will find one liners, silly scenes and a thoughtful thanks to those early mystery writers who gave us Sam Spade, Nick and Nora, Miss Marple and Charlie Chan. By the way, to truly appreciate this movie, it helps to be familiar with "the Thin Man", "Casablanca", "Murder on the Orient Express" and most of those other glorious films of the 40's.Let your expectations fly away, sit back and listen to the banter. Murder By Death plays like a radio drama with silly twists, fabulous characters and a little whimsy.</fullReview>

From Maggie Smith's sharp, hilarious one liners, to Peter Sellers' "roll around on the floor laughing" Chinese fortune cookie stories, this will keep viewers amused, dumbfounded, and amazed at the amount of talent crammed into one film. Eileen Brennan's husky, yet sexy, voice; Truman Capote's first ever screen appearance in a roll that seems suited only for him; James Coco's French accent and his capers with his chauffeur; Peter Falk's "Humphrey Bogart" send-up; Alec Guinness fumbling around as the blind butler; Elsa (bride of Frankenstein) Lanchester as the prim and proper Miss Marbles (who seems to have lost a few of her marbles); David Niven's impeccable comedic timing and charm matches perfectly with Maggie Smith's perfect comedic talents; Peter Sellers in a role that makes Inspector Clouseau look like a genius!; Nancy Walker as the deaf mute maid is fantastic (or fanatical); and finally the amazing Estelle Winwood, who was 93 in this picture and still manages to make the viewers smile with her childlike Miss Withers. All in all this film is one that should really be more well known, but sadly isn't. Its a very funny film, and intriguingly well put together, a jewel!</fullReview>

It got me to thinking, y'know those movie trailers that tout the Oscar achievements of their stars: "Academy Award winner, so and so; Academy Award winner, so and so; Academy Award nominee, so and so?" Just look at the cast's accomplishments here and imagine the whopping trailer it would take to promote the actors!In alphabetical order:Eileen Brennan - nominated for Private BenjaminJames Coco - nominated for Only When I LaughJames Cromwell - nominated for BabePeter Falk - nominated for Murder, Inc. and Pocketful of MiraclesSir Alec Guiness - won for The Bridge on the River Kwai, nominated for The Lavender Hill Mob, The Horse's Mouth, Star Wars, and Little DorritElsa Lanchester - nominated for Come to the Stable and Witness for the ProsecutionDavid Niven - won for Separate TablesPeter Sellers - nominated for Dr. Strangelove and Being ThereDame Maggie Smith - won for The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and California Suite, nominated for Othello, Travels with My Aunt, A Room with a View, and Gosford ParkThis spoof-fest of famous fictitious investigators - Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, Charlie Chan, Sam Spade, Nick and Nora Charles of The Thin Man fame - has the most ridiculous plot but that doesn't matter since the thrill here is watching the best in the biz showing off their acting chops and playing off each other for laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.The mystery is like no other narrative device because it challenges the viewer to a duel. You the viewer or reader are invited to outguess the detective character, the crook and even the writer. But since the created world depends on the writer, we count on them to `play fair.'On the written page, there is nothing so modern, so engaging, so prone to experimentation as the mystery. It is remarkably malleable. But movie mysteries are something else: the eye is relatively unambiguous and that screws many of the basic mechanics of trickery. TeeVee mysteries are even worse, because that viewer is peremptorily lazy -- there can be no engagement.So it is common in TeeVee and often in film to totally surprise at the end. Sometimes the result is savory (think `The Others,' or `Usual Suspects'), but mostly it is just junk storytelling. Here is a wonderfully self-aware script that uses all the bad habits of film mystery to give us a movie about the writing of film mysteries, those same bad habits.The performances are comically stereotyped. But here it is intended. There are some funny straight jokes here, but the much funnier ones are the self-referential ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stellar cast, lame movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With such a distinguished cast I had reasonable expectations for this one, but on the whole it's just not funny. The jokes involve a blind butler, a deaf maid, racial stereotypes etc. Most of it made me groan rather than laugh.The main characters are send ups of classic detectives, including Ms. Marples, Chan, Poirot, the hard bitten American PI and an English upper class type. The performances are reasonable as you'd expect from such an ensemble, but the script is poor in the extreme. It's saddening to see such a cast wasted on such drivel.If you enjoy watching simple send ups being stupid, you might get something out of this, but Clue was better, and that's not saying much. Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Murder by Death is a spoof of the detective murder mystery, 5 famous detective are challenged to solve an impossible murder. The detectives are played by some very famous faces David Niven, Peter Falk and Peter Sellars star and Alec Guiness makes an appearance to. The film in itself is a fun piece of entertainment but I cant help feeling with the stars involved it should have been better. Some of the gags are signposted a mile off and the resolution is a bit sudden for my liking. But it's still very enjoyable and a fun watch.As a note if you enjoyed this you may well enjoy another murder mystery comedy called Clue.7/10 - Good but with the stars involved should have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a hot chocolate and warm blanket movie. It's great fun, with a completely irrelevant plot that makes no sense except to bring together wonderful actors who obviously had a ball in the process.David Niven is one of my favorite performers, and he is in his element here. He was "to the manor born" and brought class to every part he played, yet could say "Is someone in the kitchen with Dinner?" smoothly, with no hint of a smile. The fact that none of the actors is a comedian (except Peter Sellers) makes it all the funnier. Each character is understated and all the better for it.Truman Capote often referred to what he considered his poor acting in this film, and publically apologized for previously denigrating the acting profession. Personally, I thought he was perfect for the overall feel of the movie. Since nothing fit, he was excellent. After all, how does one make sense of continuingly falling gargoyles, a wife who "choked herself to death", and the avoiding of decapitation by "being extremely well bred"?This is a wonderful movie anyone can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world's greatest detectives are invited to a creepy old mansion to a dinner and a murder.Although not the comic masterpiece I was expecting after reading countless reviews, Murder by Death is still a very entertaining murder/mystery comedy. The cast is simply perfect, there's no way to decide one better than the other, but I personally think Peter Falk steals the show as Sam Diamond, a spoof on Bogard's Sam Spade.The set design is gorgeous, the atmosphere delightfully "comic/creepy" and the script by Neil Simon is filled with great lines and scenarios. I personally thought the ending was a bit of a letdown but up until then (if the film is viewed as pure campy fun) the film is highly enjoyable for the most part. Maybe some re-viewings will help me to appreciate it even more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neil Simon broadens his horizons... And it's hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone familiar with Neil Simon knows that he usually strays away from movies and plays that take the Zucker Brothers/Mel Brooks approach and concentrates on finding the hilarity in ordinary people leading everyday lives, usually to hilarious affect, like in the original Odd Couple and the two "Suite" movies. "Murder by Death" is different, however, it is Neil Simon's attempt to poke fun at murder mysteries and broaden his horizons at the same time. It works extremely well in both cases.Eccentric billionaire Lionel Twain (author Truman Capote, wisely cast considering he was just as eccentric as his character was made out to be) invites the five greatest living detectives to dinner and a murder, the winner's prize money being $1,000,000. These detectives are Sam Diamond (Peter Falk), Sidney Wang (a hilarious Peter Sellers), Inspector Perrier (James Coco), Dick Charleston (David Niven), aided by his wife Dora (Maggie Smith, who often made a good female choice whenever Simon had a British woman character), and Miss Jessica Marbles (The Bride of Frankenstein herself Elsa Lanchester). All of the actors playing these people are brilliant, and Neil Simon successfully conveys the mad genius of Twain, who is as murder mystery bad guys often are. A lot of critics complained that the mystery in the script made little sense, but this is without logic for two reasons: 1. Murder mysteries often make little sense, 2. Neil Simon was obviously fully aware of this and used his own nonsensical mystery as his own way to parody them, which is exactly what critics don't seem to understand, mysteries aren't supposed to make sense.Find the DVD and check it out. Funny as hell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Casts Ever Assembled for a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This very funny murder mystery spoof is a hoot, and the kind of movie you want to own so that you can pop it in whenever you're in the mood for something lighthearted and reliable.A mad genius millionaire (played by Truman Capote, of all people) gathers the world's five best detectives to his spooky house over a weekend and challenges them with a murder he doesn't believe anyone can solve. An insanely impressive cast provide dead-pan comic caricatures of some of the most iconic characters out of crime/mystery fiction. David Niven and Maggie Smith are Dick and Dora Charleston, stepping in for William Powell and Myrna Loy. Peter Sellers is Sidney Wang, not to be confused with Charlie Chan. James Coco is Milo Perrier, a grumpier and much hungrier version of Hercule Poirot. Elsa Lanchester is Jessica Marbles, a dead ringer for Miss Marple. And, best of all, Peter Falk is Sam Diamond, snatched right out of a 1940s film noir, who sleeps in his trench coat and fedora.In addition to these crack comedians, the film features Eileen Brennan as Sam Diamond's girl Friday; Estelle Winwood, absolutely hilarious without doing anything as Jessica Marbles' 80-something year-old nurse; James Cromwell, who dons a priceless French accent and at one point mesh pajamas as Perrier's chauffeur; and Nancy Walker, as the deaf and dumb cook who doesn't do any cooking. To top it all off, there's Alec Guinness, as the blind butler, who threatens to steal the show away from everyone, no small feat given who he's up against.A very silly, very fun, very enjoyable movie.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witness A Lovely Murderpoo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neil Simon got seriously silly for once when he penned this lovely, pitch-perfect send-up of the classic whodunit.At the manor of the eccentric, wheelchair-bound Lionel Twain, six of the world's greatest detectives are assembled at Twain's invitation to solve a murder that hasn't taken place yet. Among the notables: Inspector Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers), who might easily be mistaken for Charley Chan; Dick and Dora Charleston (David Niven and Maggie Smith), dead ringers for Nick and Nora Charles of the Thin Man series; Miss Marbles (Elsa Lanchester) and Milo Perrier (James Coco), who slightly resemble the Agatha Christie creations Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot; and Sam Diamond, played by Peter Falk as only he (or Humphrey Bogart) can.Trying to explain this delirious mess any further is an exercise in futility. Forget spoilers; there are about seven different endings and none make enough sense to present with a straight face.Simon's script is uncommonly good, and uncommon for Simon. Other Simon comedies from even this, his best period, explore the pitfalls of relationships and aging with a (sometimes heavy-handed) nod at real issues and drama that doesn't always age well. "Murder By Death" is Simon's spoof film, and shows when he wanted to, he could be just as funny as those other writers he cut his novelty chattering teeth with on "Your Show Of Shows." There's so many good lines here, and we "Murder By Death" fanatics have them branded in our brains. "Let's face it, as a man you are barely passable, but as a woman, you are a dog." "I can't help it, I'm old." "I'm not a Frenchie, I'm a Belgie." "We're going to have a murder-poo." "You look more like a number two to me, know what I mean?" "Mr. Twain had him fixed, and he didn't like it." "Have you ever made it with a big fat blondie waitress?" "You're sure about the scorpion, Dicky?" "Your little jest escapes me." "You have the best tush in high society." "Idiot! Didn't finish mushroom story!" You can just go on and on.Even better are the performances. These are some damn fine actors on display, and they all seem to have a great time cutting up and playing to the farce. Just watching the great Alec Guinness doing blind-man slapstick with TV Rhoda's mom is pretty cool. As far as picking a favorite detective, I have a different one each time. For a while, it was Peter Sellers as Wang, given Sellers is a personal fave and he has fun playing up the Chan stereotype. But lately I'm down with James Coco's Perrier, and his wonderfully bitchy back-and-forth with his chauffeur, played by a then-unknown James Cromwell.Small caveat: Could the script have incorporated Miss Marbles more into the proceedings? We don't see her or her nurse either arrive or exit the Twain mansion, and they seem to get the scraps from the table in terms of dialogue. The incidental music is weak, except for the terrific titles theme. The ending is fun, but I wish the DVD people kept the scene of Holmes and Watson's arrival, which I remember from telecasts back in the day as being one of the funniest parts of this very funny movie.The only sobering thing about this movie is how many people in it are dead already. Death is a sad thing. Except when it comes in the form of a naked butler sitting at a table with a bill for a catered murder clenched in his hand. Then it's funny. Very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Comedy Most People Have Never Heard Of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I once read in an Entertainment Weekly magazine article that you can judge how good a comedy is by counting the "yucks" per minute. A clear top choice would be Murder By Death. There are so many jokes you have to watch this movie over and over again (as I have done so many times). Sure the plot makes no sense and there are plot holes the size of Shirley from What's Happening. But the brilliant cast parodying famous fictitious detectives is better than any spoof I've ever seen. Petter Sellers as Inspector Wang ("Treacherous road like fresh mushrooms...) and Peter Falk as Sam Diamond ("Nobody move, I gotta go to the can again...") steal the show. The movie is timeless and is a must see for anyone who needs some serious laughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than average takeoff on detective mysteries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Murder by Death" recently, in a back-to-back with "The Cheap Detective", both Neil Simon scripts that were written directly for film and both spoofs of particular film genres. "Murder by Death" is the superior of the two, although considering my low opinion of Neil Simon, superior here means watchable on a rainy day. This is a sendup of the distinctly styled Agatha Christie whodunits, the sort on which the game of Clue was based (Colonel Mustard did it in the kitchen with a revolver). The five greatest detectives in the world (Sam Spade, Charlie Chan, Nick and Nora Charles, Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot) are invited to the home of Lionel Twain (get it?) to solve a murder that has not been committed but will be before midnight. Twain is out to prove that he, and not they, is the greatest detective in the world and tries to stump them all. The price to the winner: one million dollars. But when Twain himself turns up as the victim, the game is really on. Peter Falk gets to do his Bogart imitation again (although this movie precedes "Cheap Detective") and comes off a lot better. Simon writes Sam Spade with a twist- he is a crude lout, openly rude and insulting to the other guests. ( Twain: "I'm the greatest detective in the world. I'm number one!" Spade: "You look a little like number two to me, if you know what I mean.") It's a subtle shade in characterization that goes a long way in getting laughs. Peter Sellers is terrific as the Charlie Chan character, spouting off absurd proverbs and profundities, David Niven and Maggie Smith are acceptably droll as Nick and Nora, and Alec Guinness does a nice turn as a blind butler. Falk and Sellers absolutely steal the movie, as does Truman Capote, in his one and only film, as the redoubtable Twain, he has one great scene that nearly brings the film to a halt. The weak link in the cast is Jimmy Coco as Poirot, who is just plain ham-acting instead of bringing out a natural humor from within the character. His pathetic comic French makes Inspector Clouseau sound like DeGaulle. The screenplay has the requisite twists and turns, and then some, until the murderer is finally revealed, or is he? It's an amusing ride, although some great performances beat Neil Simon's jokes by a country mile. And, by the way, why wasn't Clouseau invited? It's not like Peter Sellers hasn't played multiple roles in a film before. 3 *** out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Murder Has Been Catered!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a time during the 1970s writer Neil Simon was so hot that his name alone was enough to ensure box office success--and one of the results of that fame was MURDER BY DEATH, a parody of murder mysteries of earlier decades.The concept is quite clever, bringing together celebrated detectives of fiction and film: Dick and Dora Charleston (based on Nick and Nora Charles of the celebrated THIN MAN films); Milo Perrier and Jessica Marbles (Hercules Poriot and Jane Marple of Agatha Christie's celebrated novels); Sidney Wang and son Willie (Charlie Chan and son of the fondly remembered film series); and Sam Diamond (Sam Spade of THE MALTESE FALCON.) Each has been invited for an overnight party at the home of the eccentric Lionel Twain--but upon arrival their hosts seals the mansion and informs them that a vicious murder will occur at midnight. Can the world's greatest detectives solve their way out of this one? The casting is inspired, particularly so re Lionel Twain, who is played by Truman Capote, an individual every bit as eccentric as the character he plays. David Niven and Maggie Smith do the honors as Dick and Dora; James Coco and the ever-memorable Elsa Lanchester appear as Perrier and Miss Marbles; Peter Sellers dons Asian attire for Inspector Wang; and Peter Faulk runs wild as tough-talking Sam Diamond. Alec Guiness, Nancy Walker, Eileen Brennar, and Estelle Winwood also offer memorable support. The dialogue is quite clever, referencing the various source material of the characters, and is quite often laugh-out-loud funny in its absurdity.What is not particularly interesting is the plot. After a certain point the film becomes distinctly one-note, and to describe the conclusion as unfortunate would be an understatement; indeed, it would be difficult to say that the film has any conclusion at all. Even so, the performers make it a fun affair, and it will particularly appeal to murder mystery fans who recall the original characters fondly. The DVD offers a choice of pan-and-scan or widescreen, trivial notes, and more interestingly a brief interview with Simon himself. Don't expect too much of it and you'll enjoy it quite a bit.GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Neil Simon's Funniest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simon is good at barbed exchanges, as in most of "The Odd Couple." But he has a tendency to get serious sometimes and it rarely works, even when the serious ones have some occasional good one-liners in them. His drama tends to be dull, and his comedies funny, especially in domestic contexts and when they're dialog dependent.This is different from his other familiar works. He really lets go here, forgets all about serious undertones, "meaningfulness," depth of relationships, domesticity, continuity -- everything except the comic effect. He's the Edgar Allan Poe of comedy here. He hasn't written such a funny script since "After the Fox."The plot itself, after the broth is reduced, is simple enough. Truman Capote invites five of the world's most famous detectives to a weekend at his spooky country mansion, tells them a murder will be committed at midnight, and challenges them to solve it or lose their reputations.What follows is hilarious. Not just sharply funny exchanges but entire situations that are in themselves outrageous, so that the verbal elements are like icing on the cake. It's the kind of movie in which a line like, "My chauffeur was injured by a falling gargoyle while standing outside in Chinese footprints," makes an idiotic kind of sense. A movie in which a character can offer this as an explanation for his having been found in a gay bar: "I hate them queeries. Lots of dames go in those places anyway. I never kissed nobody. And I never done anything to a man that I wouldn't do with a woman." A movie in which two old ladies are about to fall asleep in bed when one of them sniffs and says, "I smell gas." The second says: "I can't help it. I'm old." The first says, "No, no. Not THAT kind of gas. The other kind. The kind that KILLS." And the second begins a reply with, "Sometimes MY gas . . . ." I could go on with these gags but why spoil it? And anyway there are sight gags and situational discombobulations that are just as funny but would take far too long to describe.Not all of the gags and situations are equally funny. (How could they be?) Nancy Walker plays a mute maid who's purpose in the movie eludes me. And some of the gags are silly rather than funny. But the weaknesses are minor and more than made up for by the movie's many virtues. Especially good is Peter Falk's Sam Diamond, who does an insane impression of Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade. The actor played the same character in the later, less-successful "The Cheap Detective." Simon even allows himself to play with the frame at the end. Falk and Eileen Brennan ("my secretary and mistress") are driving away from the mansion and Brennan says, "I guess this means we won't be seeing each other anymore, Sam." Falk: "Well, Angel, you can never tell. I'll be around. And if you need me, all you gotta do is whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you?" Brennan: "Well, of course I know how to whistle, Sam. What a silly question. Everybody knows how to whistle --" Falk looks disgusted, turns away from her to stare into the camera, and says, "Allright, alright. Forget it. You ruined it."I won't go on any longer about this sometimes extremely amusing film. Anything I would say would ruin it, although I must add that this is one of those movies you can watch and enjoy repeatedly, and without necessarily being in exactly the right mood for it -- unlike, say, Marx Brothers movies or W. C. Fields. It's one of the most laugh-ridden products of its decade. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly, Wonderful Simon Spin on Classic Murder Mysteries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neil Simon is a writer of extremes. When he is good, he is great. He can be extremely funny as in the Odd Couple. When he is bad, he is really bad and can be terribly unfunny as in California Suite. Murder by Death, while certainly no Odd Couple, is very close to being extremely funny. Some of the greatest and most entertaining actors of our time are gathered in this (9 times out of 10) hysterical film. Peter Sellers and David Niven (both of whom were terrific in Casino Royale) are wonderful as 2 of the 5 great detectives invited to a dinner by a mysterious Mr. Twain (Truman Capote)who wants to outsmart them. Peter Falk plays Sam Diamond (hehe, get it?) and suspiciously sounds a lot like Humphrey Bogart. Hmmm... Also on hand are Mrs. Marbles and Inspector Perrier. In the characters you can see what the movie is like. Sellers steals the show (as always) as a spin on Charlie Chan named Wang. All of the characters have equally funny material to work off of, yet some jokes work and some don't. (Most do) Also appearing in supporting roles are James Cromwell and Alec Guiness. This is a very amusing, silly, witty film that might not make you laugh at loud, but will make you smile for sure.

		<fullReview>This movie begins with a mysterious man name "Lionel Twain" (Truman Capote) sending out invitations to the five greatest detectives in the world to come to his house and solve a crime. When they get there he tells them that at the stroke of midnight one of the people at the dinner table will die at the hands of the murderer--who will also be at the table. He then adds that he will give $1 million to whoever can solve the crime first. Sure enough, someone at the dinner table is indeed killed at midnight and all five detectives soon scramble around feverishly looking for the clues necessary to break the case. But who will finally be able solve it? Now rather than answering that question I will just say that this movie has a number of twists and turns along the way which results in a very peculiar film overall. There is a great deal of humor even though some of it falls rather flat. Likewise, there were some pretty good performances along with some that were a bit over-the-top. Personally, I liked Peter Falk (as "Sam Diamond") and James Coco ("Milo Perrier") the best. But in any case, this was a decent enough film even if it was both odd and somewhat uneven. I have rated it accordingly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have loved this movie for the longest time. Where else can you find? Maggie Smith, Peter Sellers, David Niven, Alec Guinness, Nancy Walker, and other great stars playing the most famous movie detectives in the world. There are all kinds of jokes and most of them are really funny.All of the main characters are invited to solve the ultimate murder crime, and each of them is also possibly the star of the celebration. All kinds of strange events happen, and all of the confusing trickery that one can find in the different bestsellers is fair game. It's indeed a riot to see Guinness doing broad comedy, and the dry humor of both Niven and Smith is a joy to behold. Peter Falk is hilarious as he exchanges lines with his "girlfriend", and there is nothing P.C. about Seller's treatment of his adopted son, but it's another decade, and people can't help but at least give a shocked reaction to how comedy evolves through the year.Back then, they were aiming for big laughs, and sometimes the jokes worked. Much depends on chemistry, acting, and being familiar with the style of the writers and the inspiration for the characters. It's not sophisticated but quite creative and like I said before a page of times long gone when you were treated to spectacles and productions with many stars who were willing to celebrate an art, tell a story, or in this case, tell a good joke."Murder by Death" will live on forever because it is like a photo album, telling a story, showing a snapshot of a time long gone, a series of scenes when the actors winked at you as they had a ball.Four stars!!!</fullReview>

They didn't know who Sam Spade, Charlie Chan, Nick and Nora Charles or Miss Marple were before they saw MURDER BY DEATH. But after seeing this hilarious tribute to the great murder detectives, we began watching the original classics featuring those characters, mainly because they saw how much fun a murder mystery could be. MBD brings together a terrific cast and a great script by Neil Simon. It is filled with clever situations and truly funny lines. I've never been a huge Peter Falk fan, but this role is perfectly suited to him. The other actors appear to be having fun as well, but never at the expense of perfect deliver of their lines. The only reason it gets 9 of 10 stars instead of a perfect 10? Truman Capote's performance is a step behind the other actors. He wears sunglasses most likely to hide the fact that he's reading lines off of cue cards. Capote was a famous writer and celebrity, but is a weak actor especially when compared to Alec Guinness, David Niven and Peter Sellers. That being said, MBD is a great way to introduce your children to murder mysteries with fun and humor and a little bit of suspense as well. You'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a fan of mystery novels this movie will strike a chord with you. This is a spoof of many famous mystery sleuths.The stars who appear are numerous. The sleuths they portray will be known to you.Alec Guinness as the butler is priceless.I've just learned that Faye Wray is the "voice" of the doorbell. You will learn the sound and feel Faye's voice compliments the "role".The storyline is hilarious and involves the sleuths we have come to know and love.Turner Classic Movies (TCM) showed this tonight so I was able to relive the memories of when my then boyfriend (now hubby) went to the theater to see this movie back in the 1970's.I've watched it a few times since the first time and have laughed just as much as that 1st time.This movie is great fun and will have you laughing and applauding for its humor and creativity.Thank you Neil Simon! Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The logic in Neil Simon's mystery spoof is completely circular but always hilarious. Goofing on just about every paperback sleuth imaginable, MURDER BY DEATH is a classic. Peter Falk is the Sam Spade character, Maggie Smith &amp; David Niven play the very Nick and Nora Charles-like Dick and Dora Charleston, Peter Seller is Sidney Wang (Charlie Chan), Elsa Lanchester is Miss Marbles and James Coco is Milo Perrier (both tipping their hats to Agatha Christie). They're invited to the home of mysterious millionaire Lionel Twain and challenged to solve a murder before the night is through. All the actors are priceless thanks to Simon's acid tongued script but in casting choice alone, Truman Capote as Twain takes the cake. He's playing Lionel Twain, but he's Capote through and through (note his recipe for staying so young looking). Alec Guinness and Nancy Walker are the household staff, he's blind and she's deaf. The always quirky Estelle Winwood appears as Lanchester's nurse, now so old and infirm Lanchester is saddled with taking care of HER. It's all ridiculous but very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Comedy Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years I missed this film and really appreciated viewing great actors from the past and present who were able to perform Drama as well as, COMEDY. The story starts out with all the famous Hollywood detectives from the past namely, Charlie Chan, Nick &amp; Nora Charles etc., who were all called different names in this picture. They are invited to a dinner where a murder is going to be witnessed and of course there will be clues to the guilt person or persons. Eileen Brennan,(Tess Skeffington), was a partner to Peter Falk and was very young looking in 1976, she was the Sgt. in "Private Benjamin", and gave a great performance in this film as a tipsy blonde gal. Truman Capote, (Lionel Twain),"In Cold Blood", made an appearance but his acting was horrible, but funny, considering he is an author and not in the acting field. This is a great film to view and enjoy, even if you have not seen it in a long time. Nancy Walker was a maid and did a great job of saying not a WORD !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like its backwards title, Neil Simon's detective spoof "Murder by Death" is completely silly...and over-the-top even on a comedic level. However, it is so well produced and directed, colorfully cast and written with such a flamboyant ear for character-oriented chatter that it can strike you very, very funny on the right night. The world's greatest detectives are invited to an eccentric millionaire's mansion for dinner--and a murder! The address: 22 Twain. Neil Simon's weaknesses as a writer are--as always--flagrantly apparent (he milks a running gag like nobody else, and he's awfully fond of juvenile smut, such as a gay bar story which goes on too long). Still, he's far more aware of character-content in a situation such as this than, say, Mel Brooks would be. There are jokey patterns that get stuck in a rut, yet this crazy collection of satiric oddballs usually gets the picture up and running again. Best of all is Maggie Smith as a Nora Charles-type; with her dry delivery, droll sarcasm and decadent dirty mind, Smith is the belle of the ball. Peter Falk, doing a Sam Spade, and James Coco's snarling Poirot get possibly too much screen time, though Peter Sellers, David Niven and (most especially) Alec Guinness have some really terrific moments. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hysterical and confusing detective movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amusing detective spoof movie by Neil Simon, where millionaire Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) has invited the five greatest detectives to a "dinner and murder." The detectives and their sidekicks are asked to solve a murder in the bizarre mansion, which is full of mysterious features like a blind butler (Alex Guinness), a deaf-mute maid (Nancy Walker), identical rooms, secret passageways, falling statues and deranged animals.Mixed in with the chaotic fun are unforgettable characters like the prim but pompous Dick Charleston (David Niven), the sarcastic wise-guy Sam Diamond (Peter Falk), the thoughtful and eccentric Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers), the sultry Tess Skeffington (Eileen Brennan) and the elegant Dora Charleston (Maggie Smith). Each and every of the characters' humorous, thoughtful, cynical and sometimes racy dialog will send you tearing up with laughter.The detectives solving the alleged murder will intrigue you, providing a somewhat suspenseful "whodunit" plot. But, the extensive and bizarre plot twists and turns leave this film unpredictable and may even confuse you if you're trying to solve the case on your own.There are plenty of laughs and suspense and, throw in a stimulating and attractive music score by Dave Grusin, you got an enjoyable weekend movie.Grade B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent spoof of several genres of fictional detectives - the hard-boiled San Francisco detective, the thorough thinker from Belgium, the inscrutable Oriental detective, the amateur lady detective, and the rich,debonair, dilettante detective invited to a weekend adventure by a wealthy eccentric to solve a murder that hasn't happened yet. As the film progresses, the clues, are, shall we say, interesting, and don't fit together quite as well as they should.A word of warning, if you are not a nominal mystery buff, you may not catch some of the things that are being spoofed.Nevertheless,if the viewer doesn't watch and listen carefully, he will miss some priceless gags.The first time my wife and I saw this on TV, she dozed off after a long day at work, because she was exhausted.When she woke up, she asked me, "How did it end?"I told her "You wouldn't believe me if I told you" and I didn't.She was slightly miffed for a few days.A couple of years later, Murder by Death was on again and she watched it clear through.Her comment - "You were right, I wouldn't have believed it, if you had told me how it ended!"And if you haven't seen it, neither will you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whodunit? And who dies laughing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Murder by Death" represents what is probably the greatest concept for a parody film ? ever! The story gathers the five most brilliant fictional sleuthhounds of the world (each of them plus one companion) to solve a murder that has yet to be committed. They are all invited to the estate of the mysterious and eccentric Lionel Twain, where a murder is due to happen at midnight on Saturday, and the culprit has to be unmasked before the end of the weekend. All detectives eagerly accept the challenge, especially because this is the ideal opportunity to discredit the others and to finally determine which one of them is the world's greatest crime solver. You simply have to admit that a movie formula such as this is pretty much a guaranteed success. Not only does it allow five of the most recognizable cinematic stereotypes to interact, but with a little bit of decent writing, this could also make a compelling whodunit murder mystery! Particularly the first full hour of "Murder by Death" is damn near genius. It's not only the sleuths that have hilarious one-liners and witty remarks, but also the supportive characters like their partners and ? most of all ? the blind butler Bensonmum. I thought I had already seen all the clichéd jokes linked to a blind character, but this film sets a new standard. Of course, it has to be said that the film wouldn't even be half as triumphant if it weren't for the impeccable acting performances of the entire ensemble cast. Each and every single individual in this film, male or female, delivers a stellar performance and I honestly can't single out a favorite one. "Murder by Death" is non-stop funny and simultaneously builds up curiosity and even suspense towards the sequence at midnight, when the infamous murder is bound to be committed. Admittedly the pace and integrity of the film decreases a little bit and the screenplay always remains focused on comedy whereas writer Neil Simon and director Robert Moore ought to have aimed for mystery after the murder. Or at least that's what I personally think. What follows next is a serious anti-climax but, given the parody concept of the film, it's actually the most fitting conclusion imaginable. "Murder by Death" is a must-see for all lovers of good detective stories, film-noir and thrillers. Along with "Clue", this is the perfect film to relax a little bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Elaborate Practical Joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Murder By Death has a solid cast of seasoned players, I have to say I was less amused by it than I thought I would considering the talent involved.I think Neil Simon when he does comedy from real life as in The Odd Couple or The Sunshine Boys is so much better at his vocation. Here he's taken some of literature's most famous detectives, made more famous by the many films they appeared in and satirized them. It doesn't quite work and the film has some good moments, but falls short of its goals.One of the good moments is with the satirical incarnations of Dashiell Hammett's famous detectives Sam Spade(Diamond) and Nick Charles(ton) played by Peter Falk and David Niven. I've often heard that Hammett's Communism came out in Sam Spade who he saw as the virile proletariat against the decadent criminals like Casper Guttman and Joel Cairo. If that was true, I've often wondered how Marxists interpret Nick Dharles, the upper class boozer living off his wife's money and solving mysteries on the side. Simon saw the contradiction in those characters created by the same man and made Falk and Niven rivals.Agatha Christie saw two of her celebrated characters get into the act here with Elsa Lanchester as Ms. Marbles and James Coco as Hercule Perrier. Making a fifth is Peter Sellers as Inspector Sidney Wang, Simon's satirical version of Earl Derr Biggers Charlie Chan. All five and one companion apiece get invited to the mysterious mansion of eccentric millionaire Truman Capote. Much like the set up of one of Agatha Christie's best known stories, Ten Little Indians.Of course in the end it's all one huge practical joke and I can't say more because some of you might want to see this film because of the A plus cast in it. See it for them, but I think the results will be less than you anticipate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neil Simon's parody of murder mysteries with top cast...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With PETER FALK doing a superb turn as Sam Diamond (a Raymond Chandler type of detective with Humphrey Bogart characteristics), and EILEEN BRENNAN as his moll, quick with the humorous sarcasm, this is a clever parody of every murder mystery ever written. In fact, everyone concerned with this Neil Simon parody is having fun in their offbeat roles.Most offbeat of all is NANCY WALKER as a ditzy mute maid and ALEC GUINESS as a blind servant--and, unfortunately, TRUMAN CAPOTE as Lionel Twain, the host of a dinner party designed to trap a murderer. Too bad Philip Seymour Hoffman wasn't around at the time to do justice to Capote's embarrassingly bad interpretation of Twain who, despite all the Capote mannerisms, seems stilted and unrehearsed.David NIVEN and MAGGIE SMITH do wonders as a Nick and Nora type of couple, ELSA LANCHESTER is eccentric as Miss Marbles, and JAMES COCO has fun with his interpretation of a Belgian detective modeled after Hercule Poirot.All the requisites for mystery are present: the thunder and lightning, the heavy rains, the dark old house, the group of dinner guest suspects, and a plot that gets sillier with each scene. True, there's a bit of a letdown at the revelation of the killer, but it's all done with such high spirits and witty lines that you won't care much about that.Delicious parody of all those who-dun-its we all grew up on, stylishly directed by newcomer Robert Moore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder by Laughing to Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Sellers as an old wise-guy Chinese man already has me laughing. 'Murder by Death' is a brilliant spoof of murder/mystery. I was at first reluctant to sit down and watch it because I am not a fan of mystery, but when it was finished my sides were still hurting. It was so over-the-top ridiculous you can't help but laugh. Between the blind butler, deaf and mute cook, and disgustingly confusing conclusion I think I will always think of this film when I hear the words murder or mystery. It is appealing on so many levels as well. There is physical comedy, witty remarks, incredibly stupid traps and escapes, and hilarious characters. I would recommend this film to anyone and everybody, those who like mystery and those who don't because everyone can laugh at it.</fullReview>

Peter Falk deservedly gets most screen time as a Bogart-like Sam Spade type. David Niven and Maggie Smith are never without a cocktail as the urbane Dick and Dora Charleston. Peter Sellers' costuming is a bit over the top, and not Chanlike at all, but Sellers cannot help but be funny in any part he plays. James Coco hams up the Poirot character, apparently unsure whether he is French or Belgian. Elsa Lanchester could have been left out of the cast with small loss. Truman Capote is embarrassing in a part that calls for Vincent Price. The second half of the movie where they all do their "detecting" and "solve" the murder falls down badly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this on HBO way, way back in the day and the first thing that caught my attention was the great introduction done by Charles Addams (creator of the great Addams Family). Already having been a fan of the late great Peter Sellers, I never cease to laugh at the pearls of wisdom of Inspector Wang. Other than Peter Falk, I was not too familiar with the other actors. However, the cast works great together which is a reason why this Neil Simon work really shines.The story is like your typical mystery yet is presented in a way that's clever and witty. There are so many memorable lines of dialogue which are so funny on so many levels. Each character gets their chance to shine. Heck, even Willie Wang (what a name!) is hilarious as the inspector's adopted son with a very American accent. Alec Guiness is superbly funny as Bensonmum the 'visually challenged' butler. The sets are great too as the castle is almost as eccentric as the owner Lionel Twain himself. After repeated viewings, it's great to find new things ..such as a young James Cromwell as Milo's height advantaged assistant. Plus, Nancy Walker as the subdued Yetta is a total gem in this classic.I always wondered if Murder By Death had any influence on the movie Clue? Maybe it's just a red herring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world's greatest detectives get to meet for the first time when millionaire Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) summons them to his mansion to solve a murder. Most of the movie has everyone's personalities bouncing off of each other, and various mishaps ensue. Probably the funniest character is Alec Guinness as the blind butler, having to deal with the deaf-mute-illiterate cook. Can this combination of detectives solve the case? Watch and find out.This is what all star casts are all about. Maybe it's a little unnerving to see Peter Sellers play a Chinese person - in this case a Charlie Chan spoof - but it mostly comes out OK. Also starring are Eileen Brennan, James Coco, Peter Falk, Elsa Lanchester, David Niven, Maggie Smith, and James Cromwell (in his debut). A great comedy.Somewhere up there, Truman Capote must be proud that he has this to his resume, especially now that Philip Seymour Hoffman has won an Oscar for playing him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know, it was bombed by both critics and box office. But it is right up there on my favorites list. Where else can you see Peter Sellers, David Niven, Alec Guiness and Peter Falk together? True, there are some stereotypes but, don't you get it? They are supposed to be! This is satire. Sometimes all I have to do is think of a scene or line and I can't help but laugh. "It's the cat sir, Mr. Twain had him fixed and he didn't want to be" And if we ever eat buns of any kind.. "Buns!! You have buns and you didn't tell me??" And the immortal "White Wang." Oh sure, some juvenile jokes, but pros delivering them. I can't say enough about the cast. I adore the old nurse as played by the dear Estelle Winwood. So many of the cast are gone now which makes viewing somewhat bittersweet. It's great to see James Cromwell has gone from comic sidekick to distinguished actor - Oscar winner, no less! (Have you noticed how many times he's played a President?) I make no apologies. This is a damn funny movie and nostalgic at the same time. Neil Simon and a great cast -- you can't go wrong!</fullReview>

Visually speaking, the mansion is wonderfully creepy and Alec Guiness is masterful as the house butler. It's a style of movie I doubt we'll ever see again. To me it's in that same kind of wacky genre as " It's a mad mad mad mad world " and others from the late 60s and 70s. I own this movie (on VHS) and I watch a couple of times a year.

		<fullReview>Probably one of the funniest comedies ever made was Neil Simons' 1976 comedy MURDER BY DEATH in which Simon assembles his own versions of great fictional detectives who are brought together by a flamboyant millionaire named Lionel Twain (Truman Capote), who end up trying to solve Twain's murder. Peter Falk plays Sam Diamond who is accompanied by his secretary, Tess (Eileen Brennan). David Niven and Maggie Smith play Dick and Dora Charleston. Elsa Lanchester plays Jessica Marbles, Peter Sellers plays Sidney Wang, and James Coco plays Milos Perrier. The film also features Alec Guiness as a blind butler and Nancy Walker as a deaf maid (they have the funniest scene in the movie when they are trying to communicate with each other which because of their respective handicaps is impossible but it's funny to watch). Smart script, great performances and watch out for that triple whammy reverse ending. It's a doozy.</fullReview>

The stars are all out in this minor masterpiece with David Niven, Maggie Smith, Peter Sellers, Truman Capote, James Coco, Else Lanchaster, Alec Guinness and Peter Falk all providing the goods in this admittedly daft but reassuringly quaint spoof on the traditional Agather Christie who-dunit. It opened to mix reviews who complained that the script wasn't up to standard, but reflecting on the film now, it's hamminess just adds to it's charm. The film contains so many stereo-typical roles - the blind Butler (Guinness), the chocolate eating Frenchman (Coco) the Chinaman with three sons (Sellers) and the English upper-class twit perfected by Niven here and his aristocratic wife portrayed marvellously by Smith - it all adds up to make a nice, gentle little comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that I mentioned this before, but I truly love detective movies. I also love a good laugh and a good satire of detective films is sure to catch my attention. I still remember going to the theater to see this movie and I was quite excited about it. The cast alone makes it is a worthwhile viewing area. For me, other standouts were Peter Falk as a Sam Spade type character with Eileen Brennan as his girl Friday, and Peter Sellers as Mr. Wang, a short of combination of all three of the great Oriental detectives in detective film history. (For all of you that at keeping score, those who would be Mr. Wong, Mr. Moto and the new rule Charlie Chan.)It is amazing that Estelle Winwood at age 100 was alive to do this movie. In fact, I still remember the original trailer with narration by comic giant Mel Brooks saying, "Is she still breathing?"Much has been made of the deletion of the Sherlock Holmes scene but what is even more interesting is the reason for the deletion. Apparently, at least some of the actors felt that they would be overshadowed by the appearance of them the world's greatest detective, and so it was cut from the final print. Fortunately for me, when the film was playing simultaneously that month on cable and broadcast TV, I had taped both versions and marked where the scene would have been and stopped the taping of one of the cable viewings, then dubbed in the "Holmes scene" and later taped the rest of the cable version after it. Now that I find that the DVD copy has not restored the scene, I will hold off on buying the DVD.But back to the film. For a guy who grew up on "Mad Magazine," I almost knew where every punchline would be, yet I still enjoy it. Without giving any spoilers, I will say that the ending was a bit unsatisfying. There seems to be a trend in some comedies (not to mention some Saturday Night Live skits) to have a great premise and not know how to end it so they peter out at the end and some sort of hastily constructed ending is tacked on. Still, there are so many great moments in this movie and the cast makes the ride a fun one.The plot is really unimportant here. Basically, a bunch of detectives are called to a rich man's home to solve a murder. Considering that Neil Simon wrote this on a weekend, the non ending is somewhat forgivable. But then again, Neil Simon is a professional writer with some standing even when this film was new. Yet, to be too hard on this film is a futile exercise. Who committed the crime and why makes no difference. Just laugh and have yourself a good time.</fullReview>

I find it interesting how they have taken some of the gratest detectives (well reflections of them) and put them all in the same place to solve a murder.I think my favourite bits tend to include the nanny, although she is only and extra to the story, her fingering palms and apologising for smells just make her all the more interesting.It is a shame they do not show this film more often as I think its ease of story telling and simple gags make it a must for all crime buffs with attitude.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wickedly Clever Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great comedy in which the world's greatest sleuths are invited to a mansion to solve a murder. The victim? The guest of honor. VERY enjoyable comedy. Where else can you find a blind butler (Alec Guinness in a very funny part),or a deaf and dumb maid(Nancy Walker)? Peter Sellers, David Niven, Peter Falk, and James Coco play so well off each other that you can't pick which one is your favorite. Also great supporting work by Maggie Smith, Elsa Lanchaster, Eileen Brennan and (surprisingly) Truman Capote. Favorite line? When Smith asks Niven what someone would want to do with a dead, naked body (And he whispers it to her), she says, "Oh, that's tacky. That's REALLY tacky!"A must have in your collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If one considers the format of the movie as caricature of the mystery film genre - it's a perfect 10. The cast is outstanding in its performance, and one gets to see Truman Capote in a black, black act: A writer playing a wheelchair driven host who decides to deconstruct and re-arrange the detective motion picture adhering to every rule of literature in pure Agatha Christie style. Loaded with layers of narrative representation, "Murder By Death" is a must see. Not only for writers who need visual inspiration for their own ideas in constructing the ultimate "haunted house", but also for script writers who might find a literary perspective of "Film vs. Writing" non-offending. Sir Alec Guiness as blind butler Bensonmum is my personal favorite: with his nonchalant and cool manners, Guiness manages to steal the show. Watch it today!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The situation, the setting, the characters parodied, and the stars themselves are all so familiar and well-loved that from the start, you expect a good time. And the movie is often better than you expect - with lines that you don't expect. (E.g., the revelation of Sam Diamond's secret or Truman Capote's outrage at Charlie Wang's speech). Some of Neil Simon's work has pleased me (e.g., the autobiographical trilogy)- and some not (I still don't see what others saw in Plaza Suite or The Goodbye Girl). I love this one. In fact, I was amazed at how well one man could both drive a plot and create such a different way of speaking for all these characters. It's really an achievement to be able to parody such varied people.It's hard really to think of anyone who wouldn't like this movie. It's just plain funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the first movies I actually saw when the first Beta machines were coming out in the late 1970's. I couldn't stop watching it over and over, and still think it is one of the most enjoyable and well-made film comedies ever.Except for Truman Capote's sometimes laughable attempts at acting, almost every moment of this comic masterpiece is just an utter joy to behold, with Sir Alec Guiness just stealing the show as a blind butler who has a splendid tour de force in his last scene, where he plays various characters one after the other in homage to how he did the same in his classic comedies of the 40's. Funny too that Peter Falk as Sam Diamond NEVER gets anything right throughout the movie. The other "legendary" detectives all have their moments where they do make at least one brilliant deduction which turns out to be correct or at least make sense (with Peter Sellers' Charlie Chan ripoff guessing right more often than the others). On the other hand, Sam is just plain wrong all the time, and it is a wonder how he ever became known as a good detective.At a mere 90 minutes or so, it is certainly worth watching. Highly recommended. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be an understatement to say that this is a great comedy.No, seriously.The plot itself is simple. The five greatest detectives in the world (parodies of other fictional ones), and their trusty sidekicks, are invited to the home of Lionel Twain for dinner and a murder. He knows who is going to die, he knows who the murderer is, and he knows the exact time when the murder will take place. Whoever solves the mystery gets a million bucks. Easy!Unfortunately, Twain's the murder victim.You can expect a real all-star cast in this one, each one giving brilliantly funny performances. Honestly, this beats "Blazing Saddles" for madcap slapstick. If you're a fan of Mel Brooks, and you find the idea of Peter Sellers arguing with a moosehead funny, this is definitely the film for you.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delightful Comedic Parodic Romp Through A Classic Who-Done-It! Cleverly Witty! I'm not saying this movie is for intellectuals. It's for anyone who loves the old 30's - 60's Mystery Theater-type movies. Neil Simon hits another home run with this genuinely clever parody of the Thin Man mysteries, Charlie Chan, Sam Spade of the Maltese Falcon and Jessica Marples and Sidney Parole of Agatha Christie creation. With Sir Alec Guiness as the blind butler and Nancy Walker as the deaf cook/mannequin, it starts out making you laugh and certainly doesn't stop there. "You mean suicide?" "Oh no. Mrs. Twain hated herself. It was murder, alright." Jamesir Bensonmum. With this star-studded production, this movie delivers a solid performance from the entire cast. Definitely not the least of which is Elsa Lanchester (Queenie of Bell Book and Candle, 1958) as Jane Marbles. The jokes, even when obvious, still make you smile and the wit is truly ageless. As you greet the guests, five of the world's most famous detectives each with an assistant or companion, who have been invited to a mysterious mansion for a weekend of murder, you are introduced to each of the characters and each actor's marvelous ability to parody the original personality after which they have been modeled. The approach of Sidney Wang and his #3 son (Why did I have to drive the car, Pop?..."Because I smart enough to get out first!" Sidney Wang) is hilarious and makes me laugh every time I watch it. Eileen Brennan as Sam Diamond (Peter Falk)'s "personal secretary" just shines. She shows how marvelously diverse are her talents as an actress, in going from submissive, to highbrow to seductive in her performance and in the end, shows the pluck to save Sam's life while he stands there and cries.The direction is wonderful, the cast is the BEST, the script is classic Neil Simon and the production as a whole is very Mel Brooks-ish with its clever wit and adorable innuendo. Wonderful comedy. The twists and turns are clever, the dialog is witty and entertaining and the sets were lovely. I often comment on the setting of a movie. I find the background sets and props very enriching in a movie, when there is even the slightest attention to detail. The house they used or created in the making of this movie was beautiful; artistically furnished/decorated and beautifully architected. The cornices and moldings are classic post WW2 architecture exhibiting an almost lost art in this, the post-modern United States. You just don't see that kind of lavish woodwork anymore. Quite lovely. "The Haunting" quality.Rent It, Watch It, Buy It. If you like this movie, you may also like Death on the Nile, Murder On The Orient Express, Private Detective, Ten Little Indians, the Pink Panther movie series, or Clue. One of the Fiend's favorite movies. It gets a 9/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

Neil Simon is able to develop genuine interplay among the various cast members, while allowing them to be funny individually, as well: Peter Falk does an excellent Bogart imitation (if you close your eyes, you'll swear that you're listening to Humphrey himself), Alec Guiness and Peter Sellers also stand out. And although the script makes no sense, it is so full of gimmicks and surprises and bizarre twists, that the film becomes thoroughly engrossing.

		<fullReview>Take the murder mystery movie greats of the 40's and 50's bring them together for a vacation weekend at a bleak castle in a mist filled swamp, with a murder or murders about to be committed to themselves or their host and they have to find out who the real murderer is before they leave. Now add in a blind butler and a deaf maid. Got the picture, good. Try not to laugh too hard or long or you may miss the next line or gag. The cast is incredible and the story is a series of one-up-manship of who is the better sleuth. This is a movie you, your family, and children will want to see again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Neil Simon's Murder By Death is a great movie that manages to succeed as both a comedy and a mystery. It has a great plot, great dialogue and hilarious performances from its all-start cast (Peter Sellers, David Niven, James CoCo, Peter Falk, Alec Guinness). It's a favorite comedy of mine that's just as much fun with each successive viewing. I give Murder By Death a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wicked Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five eminent detectives are invited to a fog-bound mansion for a sleuthing contest, presided over by a blind butler, a mute maid and a lisping mastermind. What follows are a series of goofy gags and loony deceptions.What a treat for old movie fans. Sure it's an outrageous send-up of some of the popular amateur detectives of the period. But, thanks to writer Simon and a wickedly funny cast, the movie's a real hoot. I especially like Falk's no-nonsense Sam Spade, when he stomps on everyone's civilized pretensions. Then there's Sellar's Charlie Chan who can't seem to arrange his grammar to suit the snobbish Lionel Twain (Capote). Fact is that there's no telling where the next throwaway line will come from given the all-star cast, even as the gags just keep coming. One thing for sure, production didn't have to pop for more than one or two sets. Ordinarily, that would mean a cheap, boring movie, but not here. The appeal is all in the parody and gag lines, plus seeing notable stars in improbable roles. However, pity poor Guiness (the blind butler) who thought the movie would flop and so sold his share. Instead, the funfest was a major hit and I enjoyed catching up with it again, though I could have done without the very last twist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers for those who have never seen this movie. In the kitchen when Marples, Chang and Perrier first found the dead butler - Marples asked Perrier's opinion on the liquid in the cup that was on the table in front of the dead butler - he said Nes pa and Marbles replied no cocoa (Perrier is played by James Coco). Lionel Twain's address as seen at the beginning of the show as stated by Chang is 22 Twain. Get it? Lionel trains and Choo Choo trains. I also remember Chang seeing Sherlock and Watson at the end. Thought it odd that a butler opens the front door and moves left but closes it by moving farther left than right - since he seemed to recall the little steps up and down it must have been written solely as a sight gag. Neil Simon is a genius! Good clean fun and writing that is still upstanding. It is also interesting to note the words that in 2013 get bleeped out when it was OK in earlier regular TV broadcasts. Same thing occurs in Ghost Breakers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie boasts of top-notch actors- Peter Sellers, Maggie Smith, Eileen Brennan, Alec Guinness to name a few. All and sundry give terrific performances, fisted with humor,jabs and pretty puns. Every situation is so farcically represented that a viewer simply can't resist but fall off his chair ( I was on the verge of falling off my couch during the climax).This movie could have been a Jason Friedberg &amp; Aaron Seltzer baby, but with Robert Moore's dexterous hands and intellect, it mercifully doesn't, in turn becoming a thoroughly revitalizing experience. The acting is great all round: 1) Truman Capote: Glitzily glamorous performance with pouting puff-puff! 2) Alec Guinness: Never should one play blind-man's buff with this guy! 3) Nancy Walker: A hearing impairment can cause so much distress... and laughter! ( Cream of the crop: when she enters the room screaming mutely and the others keep guessing what she's doing!) 4) Maggie Smith: Toning down her superciliousness for this film as compared to some other roles (Gosford Park), Maggie still is sharp, nimble and bull's eye in delivery. 5) Peter Falk: Not the funniest but has moments of brilliance! 6) Peter Sellers: In performance hierarchy, he stands straight on top as a stereotype Chineseman (not that the others are original)Ever person is handed at least one memorable gag, be it the servant, the butler, the adopted son or the chauffeur. No one is sparred. And the cherry on the cake is Estelle Winwood who at such an senile and tender age, proves that humor requires no age, just heart and proper timing. Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable and well-performed film, that is letdown by a confusing ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this film. It isn't my all time favourite movie, but there are some very good things about it. The script is very good with lines such as "Sorry Wang is Wrong", "Son will get bags. That is why I adopted him," and "Probably some deranged dry cleaner." The acting, from an all-star cast was what made the movie, especially Peter Sellers as Mr Wang(I warmed to the character, as I didn't like him as much when I first saw it), David Niven and Peter Falk(who I've loved since Colombo). Maggie Smith, Alec Guiness and Eileen Brennan were excellent too. The only actor I didn't like was Truman Capote as Lionel Twain, he just wasn't to my liking. The scenes with the murderer trying to kill the guests with moving walls and what have you, were very silly, sometimes at an advantage in comedy, sometimes not. Here they were hilarious, very like Clue. The plot was not too complicated, about a number of guests invited to solve a murder that hasn't yet been committed. My only other complaint was the rather confusing ending. I would appreciate it, if someone helped me with understanding what was the truth, because all I remember were accusations of false identity, Truman Capote and a strange woman laughing. All in all, a very good film, though not as funny as Clue(which is one of my favourite movies). I also recommend Clue and Gosford Park if you like Agatha Christie-style murder mysteries. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Mystery/Detective Genre Spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with what someone else said about Neil Simon. When he's good, he's very, very good. I really like "The Goodbye Girl", for instance. In the case of MBD, he was in top form, as funny as Mel Brooks. It's been a few years since the last time I saw this gem, so my memory is a little hazy, but here goes. A millionaire named Lionel Twain, (Truman Capote in his only film), has invited the world's five greatest detectives and their guests to dinner at a creepy looking mansion with the address 22 Twain. The detectives are: 1. Inspector Sydney Wang, (Peter Sellers), the Charlie Chan character, who arrives with his adopted number THREE son, Willie (Richard Narita). 2. Dick and Dora Charleston, (David Niven and Maggie Smith), are polished, sophisticated society types modeled on Nick and Nora Charles from the Thin Man series of films. Their excellent breeding gets them out of a few scrapes during the course of the weekend. 3. Milo Perrier (James Coco) is a take on Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, and arrives at the house with his chauffeur, Marcel Cassette (James Cromwell in his first feature film role). 4. Sam Diamond (Peter Falk) represents the hard-boiled, American-style detective, a pastiche based on The Maltese Falcon's Sam Spade and Richard Diamond, Private Detective. He is ably assisted by Tess Skeffington,(Eileen Brennan), his tough but loyal secretary and mistress. 5. Jessica Marbles, (Elsa Lanchester) a hearty, tweed-clad Englishwoman, with a frail, seemingly gaga companion, her ancient "nurse" Miss Withers (Estelle Winwood, over 90 years old at the time), for whom she is now caring. Rounding out the ensemble are a blind butler, Jamesir Bensonmum (Alec Guinness), and a deaf maid called Yetta (Nancy Walker). As the guests are sitting around the dining room table waiting for the host, Twain comes in. Twain announces that, as a test of their sleuthing prowess, they are expected to solve a murder which will take place in the house at midnight that very night, with a reward of $1 million to the winner. He then leaves, and everyone waits for dinner, where some very funny things happen. First of all, the blind butler comes in with a soup tureen and starts serving the soup. Only there's one small problem. There's no soup in the tureen! He comes around to Milo Perrier, and the first of many hilarious conversations takes place: Milo Perrier: "One moment. Where is the soup?" Butler: "In your dish." Milo Perrier: "There is nothing in my dish but my dish." Butler: (sipping from empty ladle) "I see what you mean, sir. I'll have a word with the cook." The butler then goes into the kitchen, where he complains to the maid, "Ten people for dinner, and I'm serving them hot nothing! You can't get good help today." Meanwhile, the guests are getting hungrier by the minute, and speculating on who the murderer and victim might be. At one point, Jessica Marbles says, "Murder by starvation. Maybe THAT'S his game." Every now and then, Inspector Wang comes out with proverbs like, "Conversation like television set on honeymoon?not necessary." Finally, someone asks a question, to which Sam Diamond replies, "Why don't you ask the moose on the wall. He's been watching us since we came in." Realizing he's been found out, Lionel Twain comes back in, and Milo Perrier says, "Monsieur Twain, we have been here nearly four hours and there has not been a hint of a hot dinner or a cold corpse. I must therefore bid you adieu." And Inspector Wang has a few words with Lionel Twain: Sidney Wang: "What meaning of this, Mr. Twain?" Lionel Twain: "I will tell you, Mr. Wang, if you can tell me why a man who possesses one of the most brilliant minds of this century can't say his prepositions or articles. The, Mr. Wang. What is the meaning of this?" Sidney Wang: "That what I said. What meaning of this?" Just about this time, the clock strikes midnight, the lights in the room start flashing in multiple colors, and the next thing anyone knows, Lionel Twain is lying on the floor with a large knife in his back. This prompts another funny conversation: Dora Charleston: "Is he dead?" Sam Diamond: "With a thing like that in his back, in the long run, he's better off." I won't go on any further with specifics, except to say that the rest of the movie is just as funny. I'll also repeat something someone else said in their post, "Don't even try to figure out the ending. You'll only give yourself a massive migraine." But don't forget, this IS a mystery/detective spoof. You're not SUPPOSED to figure out the ending. But, don't let that stop you from watching this movie, or you'll miss out on one of the funniest movies you'll ever see. Let me end this with one more conversation from the movie: Willie Wang: "I don't get it pop, was there a murder or wasn't there?" Sydney Wang: "Yes, kill good weekend! Drive please." (All dialog quoted herein came from Wikipedia, which has a great article about this movie.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The man who gave us "The Odd Couple," and "Barefoot in the Park" scores again with this loving comedy spoof of the murder mystery. When a reclusive man invites five of the world's most famous detectives fro the weekend, with the promise of dinner and a murder, who can refuse? To start things off there is a blind butler, played by Sir Alec Guinness and the deaf cook played by Nancy Walker. Add to the mix Truman Capote as the diabolical and sometimes maniacal Lionel Twain. For good measure add David Niven and Maggie Smith as Dick and Dora Charleston, James Coco as Milo Perrier and James Cromwell as his chauffeur, Peter Sellers at his finest as Inspector Sidney Wang with Ricard Narita as his son Willie, Elsa Lanchester as Miss Jane Marbles, with Estelle Winwood as her nurse, Miss Withers, and finally Peter Falk as Sam Diamond and Eileen Brennan as his secretary. Whats not to like. The dialog is witty and fast paced, the setting is delightful and the comedy is over the top. All in all a delightful romp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is very much a film of sequences. It follows a super silly plot of challenging the world's greatest detective's to solve an impossibly silly murder which seems to be committed but yet, doesn't seem plausible. It stays short &amp; right on the mark &amp; seems to present a surprise abet implausible ending.What is so pleasant about this is seeing the cast. Alec Guiness &amp; David Niven are very good in late career &amp; limited roles. Truman Capote is himself in a late career performance. Peter Sellers does a brief but excellent turn as Inspector Wang. Peter Falk &amp; Eileen Brennan are good too.I like this one better than CLUE, a film much like it because the humor in this is very tung-in-cheek &amp; subtle. The film has a fast but steady pace. Clue gets too frantic in its conclusion &amp; it really doesn't offer the subtle humor. This film has some great throw away lines that it takes a second viewing to catch. Great diversion for a brief stay &amp; not boring in the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mysterious Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) invites five of the world's greatest detectives to his huge estate on a dark and stormy night (of course). All the detectives are parodies of famous literary characters: Maggie Smith and David Niven are doing Nick and Nora Charles; Peter Sellers is doing Charlie Chan; James Coco is spoofing Hercule Poirot; Peter Falk does Sam Spade and Elsa Lancaster does Jessica Marple. Also add a blind butler (Alec Guinness), a mute and deaf maid (Nancy Walker) and others--throw in a murder and set things going.Hilarious Neil Simon movie. The movie looks just great and there's non-stop one liners--almost every single one is great! The cast is obviously enjoying themselves (especially Guinness and Smith) and the mystery itself is very interesting and complex. It all ends very strangely (I can honestly say I never got the VERY end) but it moves quick, is consistently entertaining and there are plenty of in joke references for mystery film buffs. A great film--highly recommended. A definite 10.</fullReview>

I didn't realize that it was the same movie but i rented it anyway and was very surprised when i saw it again. The all star cast is fabulous, especially Peter Sellers as Sidney Wang. I also thought Truman Capote did a grand job as the mysterious Lionel Twain. The only problem with this movie is that the ending is a bit confusing with the many exclamations to who the murderer is. It would have been nice if Neil Simon didn't leave us hanging with whether it was the cook or Twain himself. I highly recommend this murder mystery to anyone who either like detective movies or wants to laugh really really hard!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Muder by Death is one of the most beloved whodunit comedies of all time. While the film doesn't necessarily live up to that hype, it's a joy to watch all the actors have a lot of fun with these roles. First of all, you have many top actors and actresses making appearances here. Maggie Smith, Peter Sellers, Eileen Brennan, Peter Falk, Alec Guinness, James Cromwell, and even Truman Capote all nail their respected roles.I think the best part about the film is that the actors aren't taking anything too seriously. It's important with a screwball like comedy like this that nobody over-overacts. Because lets face it, everything is exaggerated. Sellers as an Asian detective was a bit too much to handle and at times very racist, but Breakfast at Tiffany's, one of my favorite films of all time, also has a similar character. So I guess I can forgive this film, especially for the time period in which it was made.There's nothing too much to be critical or even analyze with the movie. It's only 90 minutes and it races by. It's a fun little film for people enjoy goofy comedies. It's nothing special but I can recommend it purely for the likability of the actors and the obscure performances.7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 100% perfect comedy that is crying for a stage adaption.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I say that not because this is written by one of the great playwrights of the 20th Century (Neil Simon), but because it represents a modernized version of what stage audiences in the early 20th Century were seeing. Already a variation of "The Cat and the Canary" and "The Old Dark House" thrillers that had scared audiences back in the days of gaslights and flame illuminated stages, "Murder By Death" is also a perfect parody of some of the most famous detectives of our time, filled with witty dialog, ingenious plot twists and one of the greatest ensemble casts ever assembled for a film. Not since "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" had such a cast been presented to a movie audience with the job of simply tickling its funny bone while presenting a purposely far-fetched caper with all of the twists and turns we'd come to love through Charlie Chan, Nick and Nora, Sam Spade, Miss Marple and more recently Hercule Poirot.I could sit here and quote the entire movie but that would deprive you of finding for yourself the delightful witty dialog uttered by such pros as Maggie Smith, David Niven, Peter Sellers, James Coco, Peter Falk, Elsa Lancaster and Eileen Brennan. Then, there's Truman Capote, writer extraordinare, who at 70 stays youthful looking thanks to a total vegetable diet, lots of sleep, and tons of make-up. Giving a dead-pan recital of the eccentric character who assembles the world's greatest detectives, Capote is Lionel Twain (who lives at 2-2 Twain), an egotistical recluse who has a blind butler (the hysterically funny Alec Guennis) and has hired a deaf and mute cook (Nancy Walker) for the occasion. Some critics have said that Capote seems like he is in a different movie. I won't disagree except to say that Twain is simply living in a different world. He runs his Macadamia Manor (Nut House) with all sorts of weird gadgets and doesn't seem to quibble when Guennis prepares to mail the invitations by placing wet stamps on his desk rather than on the letters. Comic music abound for every hysterically bizarre situation, it only gets wackier as each guest arrives.First, there are Dick and Dora Charles, a British parody of Nick and Nora of "The Thin Man" series, so sophisticated and classy. Maggie Smith totally resembles Myrna Loy in her delightful performance where she grins with delight at each of the unclassy remarks of the other guests. ("Oh, that's tacky. That's really tacky", she marvels when hearing about what people do with a dead, naked body.) David Niven will never be compared to William Powell's Nick here (he's far too urbane as well as sober) but every move he makes is total perfection. Who better to play Sam Spade than Peter Falk, who had been basically doing that while playing Columbo? References to other Humphrey Bogart characters are utilized to comic effect, and Eileen Brennan couldn't play her role any funnier or more long-suffering. Be sure not to drink a beverage as she unravels the results of her investigation of Twain, especially when she reveals how she acquired the information.Some people may be offended by Peter Seller's spoof of Charlie Chan, but he has the character down pact, and having a Caucasian actor playing the role is a salute to all of the non-Asian actors who played the Chinese detective from the late 1920's through the late 1940's. Richard Narita adds a "gee, pop" innocence to his "Number One Son" spoof and is hysterically funny as he does it. Slightly less amusing are James Coco and James Cromwell as Poirot and his side-kick, but the material for them isn't as funny as it is for the others, only more obnoxious. Adding vintage fun are Elsa Lanchaster and Estelle Winwood as Jane Withers and her nurse (who is appropriately in a wheelchair!) who bring in much delight. Lanchaster's character is a smarter version of "Bewitched's" Aunt Clara, and Winwood's mutterings ("Sicky Poo") will have you adoring her.I have seen this movie over and over so many times, and will continue to watch it every few years or so just to remind myself of what a gem this is. Comedy is an individual taste, with slapstick, farce or screwball taken differently for different people. When all three are mixed together so professionally and the result is as clever as this is, it is bound to create a cult following. You too will find yourself quoting this movie, especially lines like "Conversation like television on honeymoon. Unnecessary."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reclusive eccentric Lionel Twain invites five of the world's greatest detectives to his remote country house and promises them a murder to solve. But why is he doing this and what are they to believe when Twain himself is the one who turns up dead ?This is an extremely amiable and silly pastiche of the conventions of crime fiction, with affectionate digs at Charlie Chan, Sam Spade, Nick Charles, Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot in particular. The best thing about it is the cast, all of whom get into the almost Pythonesque tone of it with aplomb. Where else could you see Falk frisking Guinness, or Sellers and Smith in the same picture ? It also features the only film appearance of cult author Capote, who looks and sounds like a cartoon character and has some wonderful moments where he chews out his guests for the backhanded methods they use to keep their readers guessing. I reckon Falk and Sellers come out tops, but Lanchester (who was in her mid-seventies) is also a scream, and Guinness is obviously having a whale of a time as the irascible blind butler Bensonmum. Neil Simon's script is very funny, and the venture was so successful that the production team made an equally enjoyable follow up, The Cheap Detective (also with Falk, Brennan and Coco) a couple of years later. The production design by Stephen Grimes is first rate, Ann Roth's costumes are gorgeous and the opening credits feature some nice illustrations by Charles Addams (of The Addams Family fame). I like crime fiction a lot, but every genre deserves to be spoofed once in a while, and this is good goofy fun all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are three movies that, for whatever reason, I have watched literally 100s of times. Murder By Death is one of the three movies. The great thing is that I never get tired of it. It never gets old with me. The comedy is as fresh today as it was in 1976 when I saw Murder By Death in the theater. I think the movie appeals to me because I grew up reading Agatha Christie and watching Charlie Chan on The Late Show. Later, when I discovered the Humphrey Bogart movies and the Thin Man movies, I became an instant fan. I get a real kick out watching Neil Simon poke fun at the characters from these books and movies. The screenplay is clever, intelligent, and, most importantly, funny. I all but laugh out loud every time I watch the "dead, naked butler" bit or listen to Peter Selles arguing with the "cow" on the wall. It's good stuff!In addition to Simon's writing, the acting in Murder By Death is a real highlight. The cast is a Who's Who of some of the best actors of the 60s and 70s. David Niven, Peter Sellers, Alec Guinness, Peter Falk, and every other member of the cast (including the usually annoying James Coco) are all wonderful. Their parodies of the famous detectives are dead-on perfect. But the best, in my opinion, is Maggie Smith. It's amazing that in a group of such renowned actors, Smith is able to steal almost every scene and become the center of attention. She is simply amazing in Murder By Death. I could watch her all day.So, here's to another 100 viewings of Murder By Death! I can't get enough of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enjoyable Romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this when it was released 30 years ago ( Oh God That long ago) and roared with laughter, even though there was an element of bafflement left at the very end. Since then I have seen it on numerous occasions and each time it is tremendous, even down to the fact that I have the glorious Maggie Smith as a .wav file on my PC with the immortal line "That's tacky That's really tacky" All the actors in this enjoyable romp seem to be having an absolute ball in their respective roles that it brings a real sense of joy to the screen. I would recommend that all see this when they get the chance. The setting of the film is highly eerie and atmospheric yet with an underlying sense of fun. If you have not seen the films of the various detectives the characters are based on then it is worthwhile searching them out and then watching Murder by death with a new sense of fun. It is a wonderful way to enjoy a couple of hours of pleasurable escapism</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know that old movies were that good. I hesitated at first before watching it but I'm not regretting this decision because I actually liked it. The characters were comedy enough to make me laugh. And the story was pretty good. The events were interesting and pulling you to continue watching till you know what will happen next. I really didn't like the idea that none of the 5 best detectives world-wide solved the mystery. However, I loved it and recommend that you watch it too. After watching it I now want to watch all OLD CRIME movies that are out there. Those guys made good movies in time when there was no technology, no computer graphics and no high quality special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Convulsions Predominate a Happy Termination of a Ludicrous Plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Golden Age of detective stories from the 1930s and '40s was abound with images and characters which are now a dime a dozen: no-nonsense flatfoots, blue-blooded connoisseur snoops, and cultured novice visitants grew outside the limits of the words of Agatha Christie and Dashiell Hammett to thrive in our pop culture corridors and ministries. So naturally someone would ultimately lampoon the whole thing. Here it's playwright Neil Simon, who wrote the screenplay for Young Frankenstein-ization of the traditional country house whodunit to spoof at the famous characters and scenarios he took pleasure in during his boyhood. Sam Spade, Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Charlie Chan, and Nick and Nora Charles are all given a broad comic farce by an all-star cast comprised of Peter Sellers, Peter Falk, Alec Guinness, Elsa Lanchester, David Niven, Maggie Smith, Nancy Walker, Eileen Brennan, James Coco, young James Cromwell in his first movie, and even Truman Capote, author of one of the most emotionally moving American classic novels, Truman Capote, who was 42 but nonetheless not aging so well.The world's most renowned sleuths, and their second bananas, are solicited to a dinner party at the ghostly estate of bizarre fat cat Lionel Twain (Capote), who cautions them that a murder will be committed at the stroke of midnight, and he gambles one million dollars that none of the detectives can determine the killer. When the very shanked carcass materializes on time, the detectives bring all their own distinguishing quirks to convey against a murderer who stages impossibly elaborate hoaxes among them. It's all played for laughs and a few basic scoffs come from the parodying. The best parts involve Peter Sellers as Sidney Wang, Alec Guinness with impeccable timing for anyone who connects him with Obi-Wan Kenobi rather than the Charles Crichton capers, and Niven and Smith doing a pristine job as the obviously dignified Dick and Dora Charleston. Sadly, the most pivotal element of any time-honored murder mystery is the Big Reveal culmination, and that's the part in this self-referential screwball pastiche that's left in the lurch the most. Even as a joke it's a runaround, though saying it's contrived is missing the point, leaving the few lingering minutes to merely dwindle instead of anchor into an actual denouement.So it all doesn't consist of much, especially coming from the writer of Brighton Beach Memoirs, Barefoot in the Park and The Goodbye Girl, and ? besides some low-brow gags ? it's still more Scooby-Do than The Thin Man. Nevertheless, it's a funny service tray of a mockery with an insatiable cast. This was the first big-screen directing assignment for TV veteran Robert Moore, and perhaps it all performs more crisply as home entertainment than it ever did at the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good idea - first class stars - mediocre script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mysterious stranger invites a set of classic historical detectives to his retreat in order to solve a murder. The only problem is that the murder hasn't actually happened yet!This is one of those films that survives on star power and good performances rather than script or gags. It is a thin gimmick and despite a certain amount of plot twists - all you have is a set of skits that you either find funny or you don't. Moderate titters was all I could muster.Alec Guiness (as a blind butler) and Peter Falk (as a Bogart Style detective) stand out among the stars. Some of the guests really don't have any funny lines at all - strange to see Peter Sellers getting outclassed as a Charlie Chan style character whose only gags are silly proverbs. He plays most of these gags off his adopted son - who seem to have no real role other than being a silly stooge. I don't use the words "comedic genius" much - but he was one, if not here!They could have created a more believable plot and laid the comedy over that. But that would have been too much work for ageing script writer Neil Simon who seems to have settled for silly-silly rather than clever-silly.There is too much talent onset for corny mediocre gags about old ladies farting and deaf and dumb waiters. Could have been great if you had locked Simon in to a room for year and told him to come up with material as good as the on-screen talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder by Death: 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually don't read murder mysteries, but watching murder mysteries is my idea of a good time. Neil Simon's Murder by Death is a perfect example of that genre. Not only does it have the required twists and turns for a murder mystery, it also is hilarious (which is good, because it's a parody of the genre as well as being one of it). Although the plot was used again in Clue about 10 years later, this has less of a plot and has a more frenzied feel to it, not unlike some British comedy from thirty years ago that you'd find on PBS.As I said earlier, I don't read mysteries, but I did recognize who the parodies were. For example, Peter Sellers plays Sidney Wang, a parody of late 30's, early 40's detective Charlie Chan. He's arriving at Lionel Twain's castle for a weekend with his Number Three Son (another spoof of the Chan movies). Other guests include Dick and Dora Charleston (as in Nick and Nora Charles from The Thin Man movies), Milo Perrier (as in Hercule Peroit from Agatha Christie books), Jessica Marbles (as in Marples), and Sam Diamond (Sam Spade from The Maltese Falcon).When I first popped this movie into my DVD player, I expected a snooty British comedy, not unlike a movie such as Gosford Park. I was surprised. Not only does it have famous actors, it has a quick pace, some slapstick, and lots of one-liners. It was never boring, and not only was I laughing out loud a lot, I was also enthralled in the mystery that Twain puts upon us: one person is going to die, and whoever solves it will get one million dollars. I had no idea who was the murderer, and when we found out who actually did it, that was the weakest part of the whole movie, although, yet again, it spoofs the genre.The cast is very big, too. Sellers, as Wang, is hilarious, he is a versatile actor. Peter Falk plays Diamond with stunning accuracy. He's also very funny, especially when he's with his secretary Tess Skeffington (Eileen Brennan, who is funny by herself, also). Dick and Dora are played by David Niven and Maggie Smith. Although I've only seen part of a Thin Man movie, they looked just like them, also, and acted like them. I think that's what makes this movie so good, is how closely they parody the genre without totally divulging into it.My rating: 8/10Rated PG for some language, violence, and suggestive themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead Flat in Translation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neil Simon's satirical dig at the "best detectives in the world" belongs on the stage where its wacky characters can be endeared to an intimate audience. Robert Moore had no chance to convey Simon's screenplay as it should have been; a manic, frivolous, frenetically out of control nonsense about a non-murder and the dissolution thereof. "Murder by Death" is dead flat on screen.Comedy is corny throughout too, with Peter Falk sending himself up badly, David Niven lacking comic timing, and Alec Guiness, Elsa Lanchester, Eileen Brennan, Maggie Smith and Truman Capote all wasted. Only Peter Sellers, a natural comedian, is able to make anything of his role as a Charlie Chan spoof.As for whodunit, I can tell you now, you won't care.Sunday, January 11, 1998 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Neil Simon is a true genius. Here he lampoons the Murder Mystery, most especially the writings of Dashiel Hammet, Agatha Christie, and Earl Derr Biggers. Hammet and Christie rate two parodies of their famous creations Dick and Dora Charleston are obviously a parody of Nick and Nora Charles, the American débutante detectives of the Thin Man Series. Sam Diamond is a stand in for Sam Spade, the protagonist played best by Humphrey Bogart in the Maltese Falcon, although most people often mistakenly claim that Falk's portrayal as Sam Diamond is an homage to the Raymond Chandler creation of Philp Marlowe. Christie's two characters are lampooned as well, Milo Perrier is a take off of Hercule Poirot, and Miss Marples' stand-in is Jessica Marples. Finally the most outrageous spoof here is Peter Sellers performance as Chinese Detective Sidney Wang (Charlie Chan substitute). The basic plot is that the most renowned detectives in the world are invited by a reclusive millionaire to an isolated estate for a murder mystery weekend. The payoff, if one of the detectives can outwit the host and solve his puzzling murder mystery, they will be undoubtedly crowned the Detective of all detectives. Lionel Twain (a one of a kind performance by the ever so bizarre Truman Capote), is a frustrated mystery reader, tired of investing time in the stories of these great detectives, only to be flummoxed by the fact that the crime solvers are privy to clues and information that we the readers are never given. A truly unfair advantage, giving the detectives the illusion of superior intellect. This send up is full of slap stick humor and wise cracks. The all star cast is truly amazing, and their performances show they really enjoyed the entire process of making this film. James Coco, Alec Guiness, Peter Falk, Peter Sellers, Maggie Smith, Elsa Lancaster, Eileen Brennan, David Niven, and James Cromwell all diverge from their usual roles to give this madcap affair a certain legitimacy that otherwise wouldn't have been achieved had Simon chose to employ professional comic actors. Here these accomplished actors give performances that highlight the seriousness the detectives hold, in sharp juxtaposition to the light we the audience see them in; as buffoonish, silly, and quite inept people "playing detective" rather than being the iconic intellectuals the authors stories portrayed them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious film if you're up on the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is absolutely hilarious but those who aren't into the detective genre might find their enjoyment diminished. I say this because if you have watched any films involving the characters that are being spoofed you will appreciate how dead on the satire is. Peter Sellers' Charlie Chan alike is particularly well observed and the host Lionel Twain's constant correction of his grammar really points out the terrible acting of the actual films. Having said this however much of the film is just out and out funny to almost anyone, I particularly liked the revelation of what motive Sam Diamond has for the murder. My one tiny criticism is that the scene where the murderer is revealed would have been much funnier if it had stopped 3 revelations earlier (you'll see what i mean when you watch it)! Overall i'd give it a 8 out of 10 generally and a 9 out of 10 if you're a detective fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dinner and a murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Murder by Death" is a parody of murder mysteries written by Neil Simon. Lionel Twain, a strange millionaire, invites five characters based on famous detectives to his home for dinner and a murder mystery.This film has a prestigious cast that delivers great performances. Truman Capote is amusing the mysterious and eccentric host at the mansion. Peter Sellers delivers a number of hilarious one-liners as Inspector Wang with a clichéd Chinese manner of speaking that mocks detective Charlie Chan. James Coco plays Milo Perrier, a comical send-up of Agatha Christie's famous overweight detective Hercule Poirot. David Niven and Maggie Smith are amusing as the socialite Charlestons, based on the Charles couple from "The Thin Man" (1934). Peter Falk effectively covers the hardboiled detective angle as Sam Diamond, a reference to detective Sam Spade. Alec Guinness also has an entertaining role as a blind butler and the rest of the performances are solid as well.The story effectively parodies the Agatha Christie mold of murder mysteries set in mansions. There are a number of eccentric turns that support the film's performances and keep the story amusing. Ultimately the mystery itself proves interesting even though its primary function is to facilitate the cast's enjoyable performances. "Murder by Death" is an excellent comedy for those that want to see the mystery genre portrayed in a humorous light.</fullReview>

A nice game with detectives and surrealistic characters, chimeric victims and secret ambitions, ambiguous atmosphere and crazy gestures.But, more important, a film with Truman Capote in a charming character's skin. Charming because his acting is ironical message about himself. Capote is not only a famous writer, cultural legend or gay icon but a subtle character (the two movies about his work for "In Cold Blood" writing are good pledge for define a delicate and sarcastic man for who life was the Adventure and the others -object of precious research).His character is an ironical self-definition.

Its the only comedy film i can think of which is based on crime novel characters staying in a supposedly haunted house waiting to solve a murder{which hasn't yet happened},the story is totally original along with the jokes. Charlie Changs name is turned into Charlie Wang,Miss Marple is Miss Marbles,Sam Spade becomes Sam Diamond and so on.The whole setting is like what you would expect in an Agatha Christie novel,lavish surroundings,stylish costumes and eccentric characters,the whole setting looks expensive and classy.what other film has a blind butler and a deaf cook ,a door bell that screams,and a host like Lionel Twain,the jokes are very fast coming and you can easily miss a lot of them the first time you watch it.Another good reason to watch Murder by Death is the star cast,When you see Alec Guiness and Peter Sellers in a film together {The Ladykillers}you know its going to be good,and here you have also got David Niven ,Maggie Smith,Peter Falk and a host of other well known faces that all play their part to perfection,know one lets this film down its as funny now as to when it was first released. Its a shame this is the only comedy of its type as i cant think of any other comedy film like this one.I wished there were more made like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was impressed enough by this film (originally a play) to investigate the literary precursors to it. Single-detective satires have been around almost as long as their progenitors but the idea for multiple sleuths on a single case was something new in the late 1920's. The immediate precursors appear to be Agatha Christie's 1929, Partners in Crime and Anthony Berkeley's 1929, The Poisoned Chocolates Case.The earliest of the true "multi-sleuth" spoofs may very well be the anonymously published, 1935 satirical spoof, The Smiling Corpse, written by Philip Wylie (an original staff member of New Yorker magazine).I have written a "Primer" on my findings and had some fun with Neil Simon with this limerick in his honor.Neil Simon wrote a play they claim / that casting the film led to fame. / Do you remember the rave / for the moniker they gave / Truman Capote as "Lionel Twain?"</fullReview>

They were all excellent. Truman Capote was suitable camp and waspish, Peter sellers was outstanding as was Peter Falk and David Niven. I very much liked Nancy Walker's deaf and dumb maid, the scene where she comes in and screams is just brilliant. Elas Lanchester did a good job with her Miss Marbles though it was Estelle Winwood as her nurse that stole the acting from this partnership and all with only a few words, murder poo indeed. James Coco and James Cromwell, who I almost didn't recognise were a great double act. Maggie Smith was well Maggie Smith, very good but nothing truly outstanding. The film for me though belonged to Alec Guinness, as the blind butler so funny and such perfect comic timing and when towards the end he is exposed as various caricatures it just gets funnier and funnier until he takes on the persona of Twain's daughter, what a magnificent actor he was.The plot twists and turns without really becoming a murder mystery but that is not the point, this is about laugh out loud gags that come along so fast that more than one viewing is recommended so you don't miss anything.</fullReview>

Five instantly recognizable spoofs of famous detectives (Named Jerry Wang, Dick &amp; Dora Charleston, Sam Diamond, Jessica Marbles and Milo Perrier - try guessing who they really are) with amazing associates, a blind butler, a deaf and mute maid and a mad millionaire out to destroy their reputations to round off.The millionaire (a surprise casting of Truman Capote - he is actually quite good) invites the detectives over for a dinner and murder, which if one of them solves, s/he gets 1 million dollars and the book and movie rights for the case. As the best in the field pit their wits against the diabolic madman, the plot throws up a couple of murders and a lot of laughs. The cast is so good - each and everyone living up to his/her own reputation. My personal favourite was Maggie Smith - she manages to make you laugh just with a look or a word.

		<shortDescription>"That can only mean one thing. And I don't know what it is."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Murder by Death (1976)' is a murder mystery that makes absolutely no sense, and why should it? For years, mystery novels and films have confused and exasperated readers and audiences, introducing major characters in the story's final moments, inconceivably resurrecting characters who were almost certainly dead, and revealing murderers whose motives make no sense at all, and were only chosen to be the murderer because the writer knew full well that we'd never see it coming. Written by Neil Simon and directed by Robert Moore, this spoof mystery brings together warped versions of the finest detectives ever to tread the pages of fiction, as each party attempts to solve a murder that makes less sense the more you try to understand it. Boasting a wonderful cast of venerable comedy performers, including Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers and David Niven, 'Murder by Death' is a singularly absurd, and rather pointless, piece of cinema, but it provides more than enough laughs to keep you thoroughly entertained during a dark, stormy night in the country.The enigmatic and eccentric Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) believes himself to possess the greatest criminal mind in the world. In order to officially demonstrate this assertion, he invites society's most revered investigative minds to his spooky country house: husband-and-wife detective team Dick and Dora Charleston (David Niven and Maggie Smith) drag along their scruffy, Asta-like terrier; Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers) is accompanied by his adopted Japanese son (Richard Narita), and makes sparing use of prepositions and articles in speech; proud and hungry Belgian, Milo Perrier (James Coco), is aided by his clumsy French assistant (an amusingly young James Cromwell); the old but energetic Jessica Marbles (Elsa Lanchester) is forced to care for her ancient, wheelchair-bound nurse (Estelle Winwood); Bogart-like private eye Sam Diamond (Peter Falk) is fast-talking and no-nonsense, and treats his loyal secretary, Tess Skeffington (Eileen Brennan), as though she were just some dame he found on the street. In addition to creaky door hinges, cobweb-decorated rooms and a constantly shifting floor-plan, Twain's old house also sports Bensonmum (Alec Guinness), a blind butler whose polite courtesy is often wasted on people who aren't actually there.Neil Simon's creative assembly of literary stereotypes, along with each actors respective interpretations, are always entertaining, even if some jokes are a lot more successful than others. While maintaining a silly tone throughout, the ensemble of respected performers gives the film an undeniable class that would otherwise have been lacking. Interestingly, an original cut of the film had Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson arrive uncharacteristically late to the house, but this scene was subsequently removed for copyright reasons. I couldn't possibly speculate on what Agatha Christie and Dashiell Hammett would have thought about the film, but I imagine they would have appreciated the way in which Simon's screenplay both satirises and homages each author's famous characters, and there's an air of affection to be detected in the film's parody of the classic "country house murder mystery" scenario. As the 90 minute running time transpires, the mystery at hand steadily increases in incomprehensibility. By the time the end credits have begun to roll, not only are we still uncertain of who the murderer is, but we're not even sure that a murder was even committed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an unexpected surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazon recommended this to us and when we ran across it at the video store and saw the cast list, we just had to pick it up. It had us still laughing over the lines and situations and the actors' performances an hour later. Some really great quips and digs at the mystery genre, and some absolutely wonderful character (and actor!) interactions. For anyone accustomed to Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Alec Guinness characterization done here is a hilarious departure from his accustomed seriousness.My only objection to this film was Peter Sellers as Sydney Wang. Wang tended to ride the fine edge of funny/offensive; more often, he was just offensive. I was put off by the Caucasian-playing-an-Asian stereotyping, and just about every character aside he uttered was either racist or sexist. He did have some hilarious lines ("Putting many detectives on case like making lamb stew: all go to pot!"), but for the most part, I found his presence grating rather than funny. Sellers DID do a good job with the character, but I just plain didn't like the character.Overall, I prefer the movie "Clue" to this one, but this is definitely a fun time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Affectionate genre spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MURDER BY DEATH is both a send-up of the whole detective genre along with a riff on the classic haunted house movies of old. The plot, like that of CLUE and others in this sub-genre, is simple in the extreme: a group of detectives arrive at a creepy old mansion and must club together to solve a murder.What I liked most about this film was the quality of the writing. Although the producers didn't have the rights to use real-life literary detectives, they're all obvious spins on the famous names: Poirot, Sam Spade, Miss Marple, et al. The jokes come thick and fast and there's barely a slow moment as these guys bumble their way through the plot and drop the ball on regular occasions. Not all of the jokes work, but there's a noticeably higher success rate here than in other spoofs and it never flags at any rate.And what a cast! David Niven's role as a plummy toff is a highlight, but I also have a soft spot for Peter Falk, coming across as a cross between Columbo and a '40s era pulp PI. Peter Sellers stands out as the Chinese detective, and before you cry racist, it's worth noting that he's spoofing the western actors who played Chinese detectives back in 1930s and 1940s cinema. Elsa Lanchester (THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN) is also a hoot as a batty older lady. With the dialogue in the hands of such reliable stars, it would have been hard for it to all go wrong, and thankfully it doesn't. It's great fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched this movie for years on TCM, and I remember the ABC broadcast with its extra footage with great fondness. The stars of the film are clearly Peter Sellers, David Niven, Peter Faulk and Maggie Smith. They literally steal the show with their performances. Eileen Brennan, James Coco and Elsa Lancaster also do a fine job. Sadly, Alec Guiness, Nancy Walker, Estelle Winwood and James Cromwell are practically wasted.The problem I have is not all the cute little character-driven lines, and some of the reactions are perfect.The problem lies within the mystery. The story itself is terribly flawed. Having watched it over and over, it's clear to me that it's so contrived that it's just, well, bad. (And I also think that Dora Charleston actually solves the crime, and no one notices. A fact that should have been highlighted.) Over all, I will continue to watch the movie whenever it's on, but it's not as good as many make it out to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't believe so many users gave this top kudos, so I came by to try to even the score a bit...I agree with the reviewer who reasoned that just because it is a Neil Simon play-turned-movie with a star-studded cast, this does not necessarily add up to a good movie, even for murder mystery enthusiasts who enjoy parody. Sure, we had a few laughs (mostly at the beginning) but out of the three of us watching tonight none of us liked it by the end. The over-the-top jokes were offensive and took away from any of the lighthearted humor Simon seemed to be trying for, and the plot didn't even remotely make sense, even for its genre. I would like to take a look at the play sometime to try to see 'whose fault it was', the writer or director. I'm sure it wasn't the actors' fault as I like most of them in other venues. It did make me want to watch a Charlie Chan movie though!, and also gave me a new respect for Peter Seller, who seemed to be the only one who could do something with his character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Murder By Death" is a very silly and often stupid film. Now this is NOT meant as criticism--just an observation about the type of humor in the film. So, if you are looking for an arty or sophisticated film, then you should definitely not watch this film! But, if you can simply watch and accept it as it is, then you probably will have a nice time watching.The film begins with several detectives being invited to Mr. Twain's house. All the guests are caricatures of literary and movie detectives--such as Miss Marple, Sam Spade, Charlie Chan and the like. All are played rather broadly--again, this WAS the intention of the filmmakers. Their host (Truman Capote) then enters in a VERY dramatic fashion and challenges them all to solve a murder that is ABOUT TO HAPPEN! What's next is, naturally, nonsensical and silly....but who cares? Overall, the film is filled with bad jokes, puns and a few genuine laughs. It's not brilliant by any means but it will most likely make you laugh. And, for that reason, it's well worth your time provided you can enjoy such a fantastically stupid film! By the way, the ultra-politically correct might blanch at some of the film's humor--such as the blind butler (Alec Guinness) and the Chinese detective (Peter Sellers). It's all in fun but with today's changing sensibilities, you may want to avoid showing it to your friends and family members as there is a lot to potentially offend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whodunnit spoof, largely based on Agatha Christie's 'And then there were none' and 'A murder is announced' A murder occurs at a country house - someone in the house is a murderer, but who? And can the crime be solved before the murderer strikes again. The difference is that the world's greatest detectives are the guests, and a million dollar prize has been put up by the host.The concept and plot are well thought out and with a wittier script this could have been a very funny film, but despite the quality of the actors involved, the characters remain stereotypical parodies of the fictional detectives they represent. Only Maggie Smith as Mrs Charleston really comes alive, though there is the occasional flash of brilliance from Alec Guinness. Most of the humour made me smile rather than guffaw, too many jokes were done to death, for example the fortune-cookie words of wisdom from Peter Sellers as Wang.Final verdict: watchable but don't go out of your way to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildly Offensive, Mildy Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you rent this comic trifle from the 70s, don't expect a gutbuster. It was written by Neil Simon, who despite his film and theater pedigrees is actually the father of the modern sitcom: his comedy relies on one-liners and innuendo a la "Everybody Loves Raymond," not the obscenity-laced raunch we enjoy at the multiplexes nowadays. So his scripts can seem a little tepid, especially when he abandons standard plotting in favor of parody as he does in "Murder by Death." Still, it's pretty funny if you've ever read Agatha Christie or Raymond Chandler. The comic scheme consists of eccentric millionaire Lionel Twain (millionaires were still fairly exotic back in 1976) inviting the world's five greatest detectives to his mansion for a weekend of mystery and intrigue. If you recognize the fictional sleuths being lampooned - Miss Marple (Jessica Marbles), Sam Spade (Sam Diamond), etc etc - you'll have a good time. If you don't, well, there's some decent fart jokes. ("I smell gas!" "I can't help it, I'm old!") There's also a staggering cast. In the mid-70s, Simon had the clout to convince a herd of esteemed British actors (Alec Guinness, Maggie Smith, etc etc) and major American stars (Peter Falk had won a couple dozen Emmys by this point) to wear silly costumes and make cheap jokes ("where's my Dickie?") in an low-budget quickie that plays like an extended "Carol Burnett Show" sketch. Speaking of "Carol Burnett," Harvey Korman must have been busy the weekend they shot this flick, since the producers cast Truman Capote as Lionel Twain. Truman Capote was a socialite and a writer (and a damn good one many years ago), not an actor, and the best he can offer in this film is a second-rate impersonation of Harvey Korman imitating Truman Capote. Still, his fat little face and prissy mannerisms make him funny to watch so you don't mind his lack of talent. And it should be said that as Sidney Wang, Peter Sellers is not perpetrating a racist stereotype, he's ridiculing a racist stereotype perpetrated by the Charlie Chan movies. But Sellers was never the subtlest comic actor, so his overly broad performance transcends mocking borderline racism and becomes, well, borderline racism. (At least he's not as bad as he was in "The Party.") And at least the producers cast an actual Asian as Wang's # 3 Adopted Son. Whatever, it's not high art, just good if slightly mean-spirited fun.</fullReview>

I was left with an attempt at pop-culture comedy and something of a dry feeling in my mouth. I like how it ends (well.....kind of) and the "message" it gives. Something that probably felt better at the time than nowadays. But it still doesn't disguise the spicy bits of dialogue and the weird plot. Everything considered, if you want a dinner style murder-mystery-comedy you'd be better off with the hilarious Clue. And you get to see 1 particularly funny performance from that guy who plays(ed) the principle on Sabrina:The Teenage Witch. I don't know if he's still there...but so what.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever for awhile, but lifeless acting, and just plain silly by the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Murder by Death (1976)The original play was probably better--except there was no original play. Playwright Neil Simon did write the screenplay for Murder by Death, and he keeps a Broadway quality to it all in its constrained location (an old mansion), its declarative writing (each phrase is clearcut), and its theatrical self-satisfaction (it's a farce, deliberately shallow). But I'll guess a play version would carry forward an artifice into something wholly unreal, a true stage production with all its detachment from the world, and that would help this movie a lot.Director Robert Moore is functional in every way. So we have mostly a script, and a cast of hugely famous actors, to keep it going. Which it does for awhile. The funny lines and endless references to famous fictional detectives are really funny at first. We laugh because we remember Nick and Nora, or Sam Spade, and we see the new incarnation as a caricature of appreciation. The whole plot is a send up on the murder mystery at its most classic--and most predictable. As if to compensate for all the clichés it wrings out for their charm, it tosses in a few completely beyond the edge twists at the end that might, in a theater, be a good laugh, but here we are so tired of the lighthearted nothings all along, it's kind of just silly and indulgent. The actors are fun to have in one room--Peter Falk, Alec Guinness, David Niven, and Peter Sellers, for starters--but don't expect real acting from them, either. Just kick back and be amused. And when it's over, you might yearn for a real Agatha Christie or Dashiell Hammett.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Murder by Death is a stupid comedy about a group of the smartest detectives welcomed to the home of a mysterious man for a dinner and murder. The plot involving the first person to solve the crime is stupid and confusing. The ending of the film is slapped together for dull laughs and the acting is far off perfect. The actors though put in good effort, my props go to Peter Sellers as the only man who cracked me up in this entire mess! The one liners are the only things keeping this wreck a pulling. The characters are all set in different tones, I liked Sam Diamond and Wong but all the others seem like normal people in a bad setting. The special effects, wait there is no special effects. If there are I must of been to bored to notice! The jokes are horrible! No good laughs from any of the cast except for Wong played by Sellers. "Did you see that?" "No." "Neither did I." Good joke! But soon when the murder has happened the film goes down hill, I mean solving a murder when being invited to dinner and a murder to figure out who did it is pretty obvious. This horrid film called funny gets the 3 out of 10, good for getting a few winks of shut eye. But if you want a funny who did it comedy, stick with Tim Curry in Clue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, just terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On paper, this should have been a comedy smash. A cast to die for (pun intended), comic legend Neil Simon in the writers' chair, and a set up that offers many funny possibilities. Sadly, this promise is wholly squandered. Do not believe the stories you have been told about Murder By Death - it's HORRIBLE. Clearly, 99% of the small budget went on hiring Peter Sellers and David Niven, leaving nothing for anything else. The story - the world's greatest detectives assemble at a spooky mansion to solve a murder that has yet to be committed - should have been the springboard for great fun poked at the sleuth genre. But, instead...nothing happens. The cast sit in a room and talk, then split up and talk somewhere else, and then reassemble to talk some more. NOTHING HAPPENS. I actually had to check the timer on my DVD player when the closing credits mercifully spelled the end of this atrocity - I couldn't believe that just 90 minutes had passed or that in those 90 minutes the cast has effectively *not done anything*.A fascinating cast, to be sure...David Niven, Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers (who had starred alongside one another in the past but had never been a trio in one film) together in one film is noteworthy in any case. Niven is his usual elegant and genial self, Guinness is fine, but Sellers seems oddly subdued. Perhaps it is the character he is playing, the serene mystic detective Sidney Wang (Charlie Chan), but my money is on him merely sulking because he's just one star among many for once. Elsa Lanchester, the Bride of Frankenstein herself, appears as Jessica Marbles aka Miss Marple - and she's pretty bloody awful. Stick to Man From UNCLE guest spots and mute roles, Elsa, you have all the screen presence of a goat cadaver. James Coco, who is never anything but HUGELY annoying in any film, overacts like crazy as Milo Perrier (aka Poirot), while th4e normally great Peter Falk as Sam Diamond (Spade) is just flat out offensive. A worryingly young James Cromwell plays Perrier's assistant, and as a character is just as redundant and pointless as Wang's Japanese 'Number 3' son. Said son has the negative honour of delivering the worst of all the film's many ghastly lines - "Holy Shanghai!". This is symptomatic of a movie that is racist towards Asians in general, as well as homophobic and misogynistic...basically everything Sam Diamond says ticks one or more of those bigoted boxes. Eileen Brennan, whom director Robert Moore seemed to believe was very attractive, is wasted in a pointless role in which she has maybe eleven lines...as is Nancy Walker, whose role as the deaf and dumb maid gives us one of the movie's few genuine laughs - the silent scream. Truman Capote, bizarrely cast as the host of this murder mystery dinner, seems to have done all his scenes in an hour and then fled the set. The same seems to apply to Alec Guinness, who doesn't bother to disguise his boredom with the terrible script. I don't blame them. Talk about a voyage of the damned! This film was a ponderous trial to get through...ideas such as the shifting house rooms are brought up and then are not actually dealt with. The murder's twists and turns make no sense on any level, and you are left wondering at the end what the point of it all was. Every time it seems as if the story will actually start going somewhere, it immediately shuts down and goes back to the cast talking in the dining room. (No money, you see) And it's just NOT FUNNY. There are literally about six good lines in the whole thing, and even they aren't great. It's hard to believe Neil Simon, creator of such comedy classics as The Sunshine Boys, thought this drivel was worth filming. Robert Moore's direction swings between competent and inept with dizzying speed, and his job is not helped by the fact that all of the movie's very fake-looking sets appear to have been erected on one tiny soundstage.Avoid this movie like the plague...do not trust anyone who says this film is funny. It's not. It's absolute garbage. A complete waste of the talent on screen, and any Peter Sellers movie that makes Where Does It Hurt? look like Blazing Saddles in terms of jokes must be bad. The pits. You have been warned.</fullReview>

The five super-sleuths are: hard-boiled Peter Falk (as Sam Diamond as Sam Spade), buck-toothed Peter Sellers (as Sidney Wang as Charlie Chan), portly James Coco (as Milo Perrier as Hercule Poirot), dapper David Niven (as Dick Charleston as Nick Charles) and elderly Elsa Lanchester (as Jessica Marbles as Jane Marple). Their companions include chic Maggie Smith (as Dora), sexy Eileen Brennan (as Tess) and senile Estelle Winwood (as Withers)...Blind butler Alec Guinness (as Bensonmum) and deaf mute Nancy Walker (as Yetta) attend to the guests. Butterball criminologist Truman Capote (as Lionel Twain) offers one million dollars to the winning detective. There are fewer funny moments than there should be when this Neil Simon story works, mainly during the early running time. Those figuring out the ending should receive the million dollar prize money - probably, it has something to do with confusing and unsatisfactory endings.***** Murder by Death (6/23/76) Robert Moore ~ Peter Falk, Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, Nancy Walker</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Droll but often broad spoof of what I like to call the "mister murdery" genre by Neil Simon with a big name cast having fun with their characters and accents in a big old country house. Simon brings together five famous fictional detectives, slightly re-named no doubt for copyright reasons, with sidekicks in tow, to solve a murder at midnight for a prize of one million dollars to whomsoever solves the crime.It sounds funnier than it actually is and though well cast and reasonably enthusiastically acted, it stutters rather than races along, failing as it goes to deliver a really big belly laugh. Of the players, Sellers is mildly amusing as Charlie Wong (read Chan), with his perennial problem of pronoun pronunciation (see what I did there?,) Niven and Smith make a suitably aristocratic Thin Man and wife, but the actors playing Marples and Poirot barely register and oddly old Columbo Peter Falk seems wrongly cast as Sam Diamond (read Spade), but isn't as bad as Truman Capote, who can barely act at all. Eileen Brennan, as she often did, steals what little show there is as Falk's long-suffering, lovelorn secretary.The sets and costumes are fine, recreating the requisite mood and atmosphere, but the film refuses to take off and would have benefited from an infusion of some really good jokes to help it stand up. This genre definitely deserves a hilarious comedic spoof but this isn't it.</fullReview>

It read more like Mel Brooks than Neil Simon with its heavy-handed treatment, sometimes filmed theatre in long and medium shots interspersed with sight and sound gags that were predictable but seldom as well-executed as they could have been and deserved to be. The prestige of the cast alone easily equals (or surpasses) many of those Agatha Christie block-busters with their glitz and over-production. I'm not familiar with the director at all but he stuck verbatim to the script with very, very few additions and the whole thing came out curiously rather predictable and even stale. When I think of comedy/murder mystery and Agatha Christie there's always the incredible lightness of Rene Clair's "And Then There Were None" which is endlessly fascinating to see over and over.Curtis Stotlar</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We we watching the same film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let's deal with the logic of the thing. A "great" cast is not the same thing as a star-studded cast. Acting is an interactive art, and what makes a cast good, whether it is star-studded or not, is how well the ensemble works together. Logically speaking, simply populating a film with terrific actors does not inevitably result in a good film. Likewise, while Neil Simon may have been a terrific play and screen writer, it was not impossible for him to have written a bad script. And, in the case of this script, he most assuredly had.The utter randomness in this pastiche of many terrific (and a couple less than terrific) actors tells us that the perpetrators of this film, loaded with a Neil Simon script and a ton or two of money, dialed their way through the directory of top agents, picking up any and every top actor they could with however much dough it took to attract them. Given this cast, and considering the silliness of this script, it must have been one awful lot of dough.It has been a long time since I saw this film, but the memory of disappointment and of feeling cheated out of a couple hours of my life, I recall to this day.Even the title of this film, "Murder by Death," is a stupidity in and of itself, and it should serve as a warning that one will be in for a distasteful experience, much in the way that gaudy colors on some insects and frogs announces to their predators that they are foul-tasting and possibly poisonous. "Murder by Death," indeed. Simon should have blushed with embarrassment even to have penned such a title on a draft, let alone to have allowed it somehow to have slithered out of his study into the light of day.Then there is the matter of Peter Falk. He is among such exalted acting companions for no other reason than his then-popular role as Columbo, because, let's face it, he is not an especially good actor. He may even be an especially poor one. He was at his level of ability with Columbo. In every other thing I've seen him in, his limited range and abilities are only too evident.Not to put to fine a point on it, this film is not funny, it is not interesting, and it is not memorable for anything other than how truly pointless and bad it is. Literally choked with too much fine talent, it fails, anyway. Someone among the perpetrators of this fiasco must have actually believed that stuffing all of these fine, but utterly disparate, actors together in the cramped quarters of Simon's worst-ever script was going to save the thing from itself. Or perhaps the producers simply felt that by paying all of those stars to co-conspire in the thing would trick enough people into seeing it as to allow them to recoup the fortune they'd squandered.But the real shame of it is that it took time out of the careers of greats like Peter Sellers, Maggie Smith, and Alec Guinness, when they could have been doing something more useful -- like getting some rest, or playing bridge, or even reading more scripts, so as to find one that was actually worthy of their talents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up loving Agatha Christie novels and I grew up loving this movie. The idea is great, the execution is fun in many places but the overall "mystery" in the movie is A+ terrible. Where to begin? The Perrier character is, of course, a take off of Hercule Poirot. Poirot is, of course, a Belgian character that is constantly correcting people who think that he is French. In Murder by Death, Perrier also corrects a character (Sam Diamond) who calls him, "Frenchie." Perrier than says that he's "not a Frenchie...I'm a Belgie." This is fine and funny. However, TWICE later on in the movie, Perrier says that he is French! He refers to himself when he says to "never underestimate a Frenchman's nostrils" and that a character came to "France every season", which is where Perrier was! Was anyone paying attention? The final solutions make zero sense and the "mystery" is full of more holes than can be believed. The movie is pure camp meant to ape great detectives of fiction and, in that, it succeeds. Peter Sellers, genius that he was, is great as Inspector Wang, David Niven is fun and classy as always, Maggie Smith is great, etc. The cast is tremendous. The mood and atmosphere are tremendous. The plot points are beyond ridiculous in spots. Maybe it was the idea of those involved to make the movie ridiculous and nonsensical. If that was the goal, than they succeeded. Still, the movie is fun for mystery lovers of fiction. Otherwise, it's mostly gibberish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Murder by Death is just about as confusing as the title makes it sound. The idea itself, having a multi-millionaire invite the worlds five greatest detectives over for dinner and a murder, is pure genius. But the way it was done was incredibly un-thought out and could have been written better by a mystery loving eight year old. Murder by Death needed more characters from the house and at least a few murders. And the whole time I watched this movie I found myself begging the television to let them explore the mansion instead of going back and forth from the kitchen to the dining room. On the bright side though, there were a few, and I stress the word few, good points in the movie. The scenes between the blind butler and the deaf-mute maid, did force one or two laughs out of my mouth throughout the movie. And the acting of Maggie Smith and especially Eileen Brennan was near perfect. But if you are a real murder mystery lover who enjoys a little comedy along with it, than the 1985 movie Clue, also staring Eileen Brennan is definitely the better way to go. Clue is a spoof off of the popular Parker Brothers board game where all the suspects, weapons, and rooms come to life. Clue has better acting, a better script, and an ending while may be a bit confusing after the first time you watch it, at least leaves you understanding what just happened. Unlike Murder by Death. So next time you go to the video store and are looking for a murder mystery/comedy, rent Clue. Unless your the type of person who enjoys a movie with a confusing and unimaginative ending. In that case go ahead and rent Murder by Death. I give it 1 star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hated the movie. The movie is about the worlds greatest detectives who get invited to a mansion where they are challenged to solve a murder which hasn't been committed yet. The plot has some holes, they are quite annoying, but it isn't the plot that made me hate the movie. The core concept is actually not that bad.The biggest problem I have with this movie is the dialogue, the acting, the depiction of the characters and that it is not at all funny.Lets start with the funny part. The key to a good joke is timing. Some of the jokes could have been funny but there is no timing. The jokes go on and on and sometimes the joke is even explained by the detectives. There are many possibilities to make jokes around the blind servant and the deaf housekeeper but they are making more or less the same jokes over and over again. Many of the jokes are outright offensive to the Chinese and women.Every single character is a stereotype. Which isn't so unusual in this genre but they are all played so over the top that you can't connect to any of them at all. The Chinese detective (Mr Wang) is insulting. He speaks this stereotypical Chinese accent and is an insult because he mocks the culture of the Chinese people. He frequently says offensive things. He even says he bought his sidekick. Slavery wasn't a real thing in china at that time. I know racism wasn't such a big deal back then, but even at that time this was considered downright offensive.The writer tried to make fun of the cliché characters in detective literature and movies but didn't know where to stop. None of the main characters are likable. I hated every single one of them.Sam Diamond, an American detective, (I believe he was from Chicago) has this silly accent. I didn't really understand how this character fits in the movie. He is kind of a distraction from the general style of the movie. He is kind of a mockery of film Noir detectives. That doesn't really fit into this kind of detective story. He is extremely offensive towards women. Well I know it was most likely intended as humor because the film noir movies of the 40s and 50s are often considered sexist. But what is funny about a man mistreating women.I could go on about the characters but I just wanted to give you an example.Most of the movie the characters do nothing at all they are just annoyingly talking to each other in silly accents. When I watched 20 minutes of the movie I lost all interest and was suffering through it. I really don't understand why so many people like it.Not a single one of the jokes is funny every single character is so over the top idiotic. It is racist sexist. It was just insulting.</fullReview>
