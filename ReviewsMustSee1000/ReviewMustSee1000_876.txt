		<shortDescription>not as light as I totally expected, but with enough life and vibrancy to keep it from being dark either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder what Freudians would think of the relationship between Laurent (Benoit Ferreux) and Clara Chevalier (Lea Massari), son and mother, who for half the film are basically on their own as the son gets treatment for a heart ailment. Maybe it's hard to think anything about this, or to put such an easy label as 'oedipal' on this whole psychological criss-cross. But what's hard to deny is how much liveliness is in possibly Louis Malle's best film (that I've seen yet at any rate). It's a tale of innocence lost, but then again in a family where it's not a high commodity anyway. Laurent is surrounded by older brothers who get him into parties with alcohol, and even to a brothel where he awkwardly loses his virginity. He also is a choirboy, does excellently in school, has an intellectual side that runs deep, and goes to confess his sins (from time to time) for the priest. But then there's something about his Mother, when he sees her get into a car he doesn't recognize or rides off with someone mysterious, that ignites his confused flame of first-hitting-puberty sexual jealousy. And it all leads up to Bastille day.Murmur of the Heart is not a picture really bent on anything with a solid plot, as it's more concerned with the kind of European 'character study' (not that there isn't a story there to look at it). I read Ebert's review and he mentioned that the picture is more about the mother than the son. I could see where that viewpoint comes from, but I have to think that it's more about both of them, and while I watched it (as opposed to now thinking about it once its ended) it seemed more concerned with the son and perpetually through his point of view. He doesn't totally understand why his mother feels the way she does, and why she runs off to her other man, torn between leaving her gynecologist husband for him. But Malle makes it seem torn between each side when Laurent is left at the hotel while Clara is away for two days. His confusion leads him into a kind of disarray that's been hinted at before, and its made all the more clear in the tension- very underneath their games and witty remarks- that builds up.But even with such an idea for the film, it is never really ugly or trashy. If anything, Malle does the best thing possible by making such a taboo subject realistic around the situation of family and the period. It's really wonderful seeing how Malle directs the smaller scenes, the bits that a director usually wouldn't bother with for emotional sake, or the little bits of dialog that do go on in the real world that don't necessarily have to do much with the rest of the story (one of those is when Laurent is getting washed down with a hose at the medical clinic, and the woman washing him goes on a long tangent of talk, not conversationally, just to hear herself talk). It could be tricky dealing with such mundane aspects of life such as brothers hanging out and goofing off, but there's layers of masculinity that get thrown in the mix (what are we to make of when the boys measure 'themselves' with a ruler, much to the angry housekeeper's dismay, or when Laurent tries out her mothers make-up I wondered).All the while Malle bases these characters in an entirely plausible environment and with a cast that works very well. Massari is almost TOO alluring a woman to be anyone's mother, least of which the headstrong and vulnerable Laurent, but this works to show what her frame of mind must be too, as she gets as much attention (in a different way of course) as Laurent does from the teenage girls. The actor playing Laurent is a first-timer here ala Leaud in 400 Blows, but I even got a Bresson feeling from him, of there being a lot of emotions buried underneath his usually calm and poised expression, the kind that can be felt even with just the slightest hints. He's perfect for the kind of kid who's still a bit much in his own desires and wants to see what may happen from all of this in the long term. But the psychological implications are left even more to chance by the ending, which is one of the best moments Malle has ever directed as the family all laughs together. Not to forget to mention another big plus, the film is filled with one of the best jazz soundtracks ever put together (including Parker, Bechet, Gillespie among others), and an exquisite use of period and very tasteful way about the more 'graphic' parts of the film. Murmur of the Heart shows in tragic-comic detail the sophistication and lewd sides of the French, and draws a lot to ponder about a boy's crossover in that rotten period of 14-15 years old and of a woman who has the same mixture of unstable emotions and child-like ideals of her own blood that pull the two into what happens. In totally unconventional terms, it's 'magnifique'. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sophisticated naughtiness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all-time favorite films.Young Laurent Chevalier, his mother &amp; his roguish elder brothers break every taboo known to small-town 1950s Dijon: underage drinking, underage sex, blasphemy, incest, petty theft, adultery, art forgery, whoremongering, drunk driving... What more can you ask? Malle treats their escapades with such lighthearted sympathy &amp; wit you can't help liking them.Before I first saw Soufflé au Coeur, I read a blurb for it in the monthly listings of my local repertory cinema that ran something like this (I quote from memory): "This film does a lot to restore the French to their former reputation for sophisticated naughtiness." I can't sum it up any better than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Murmur of the Heart' is an experience that sneaks up on you like the combined years of one's youth. The subject matter is what the repressed might reductively characterize as simple incest. That is NOT what this film is about. It is about the elastic moment of adolescence. The strange, ugly, and beautiful contradictions of familial intimacy. A boy deperate to taste the pleasures of being a man - while stuck in an awkward inbetween physical, and pyschic geography. This is one of the strongest films in all of French cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malle's finest....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's high comedy. It's French bourgeois lifestyle. Louis Malle's delicate style of working with taboo subject matter reached a personal plateau with a dysfunctional household in "Murmur of the Heart", an early reach back into his own garden of memories and familial idiosyncrasies that he has stringently plucked from over the years. He approaches it with an innocent intent, cheeky, but still innocent nonetheless. Through the nostalgic and mean-spirited jibes at the domestic help, clergy and stiff-lipped crust of high society, it commences on a journey of an adolescent male, Laurent Chevalier (Benoit Ferreux) in Dijon, France circa 1954. He longs to break free to that stage of enlightened adulthood that seems just within reach but yet so very far. But within its pith, it's the very antithesis of melodrama. Taking on its inviolable subject matter's horns with both hands, it wrangles it to the ground while giving us something to think about. It's definitely not about exorcising ghosts of the past but to let them regale us with stories of unforgettable youth.After 35 years, "Murmur of the Heart" still rings truer and closer to home than most contemporary comedies (and even dramas) revolving around the "coming of age" and "sexual awakening" in a young teen. It's also more daring and liberal in its construction of key family members being part of that very natural formation of sexual DNA and identity. They discuss philosophy. They discuss suicide. They discuss "The Story of O". Laurent and his 2 older brothers consort in disrespectfully petty behaviour contrary to what their upbringing holds sacred. Laurent's a top student, an intellectual that sees the world around him as a playground. It's a smalltime superiority complex as he defines his sensitive sensibilities with discernment beyond his years and a haughty disregard for divergent thoughts with a self-important air.Revolving primarily about Laurent and his mother, Clara ("L' avventura's" Lea Massari), it's a refreshing look at a parental relationship based around adoration and fondness (coming under constant mocking by his brothers) than the contemporaneous and contemptuous notion of disdain and rebelliousness surrounding the authority figures and generational gaps. It underlines the idiom of a mother being her son's first love. In its essence, it encapsulates many complicated mother-child relationships including the emotional Oedipal issues that do crop up. And through that, a lovely parallelism is wrought with its interpretation of a woman who wants to be a girl and a boy who wants to be a man.Conforming to an almost sitcom style, its self-dependent, autonomous scenes and situations just about start to border on farcical proportions. Its characters place sex and carnality high up on a pedestal, while Malle condescendingly films it as something so pedestrian and run-of-the-mill, not worth the hype and excitement over it anyway. He makes the patient, inevitable buildup to a key sex scene that had caused controversy when it was first released, to seem more natural and accepting than he does the sexual encounters that actually do seem the norm in society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving, controversial but lovable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Louis Malle perhaps has directed his most controversial film about Laurent and his complicated relationship with his mother. Because he is the youngest of three boys, he is still a virgin and coddled like the family baby. The film seems to last forever but in a beautiful moving way. We watch as his beautiful Italian vivacious mother seems to attract admirers even her own son. Without discussing the film's oedipal issues, the film has some very pleasant scenes and some that are not so pleasant. Maybe Malle is trying to bring reality of a young body's sexuality. His two older brothers are not the sympathetic or kind older brothers to him especially. Laurent is truly the film's most important character but his mother is definitely the most important figure in his life. As he comes of age, she has to grasp with losing him to another woman, the inevitable outcome of any mother-son relationship. We learn a lot about Laurent's mother too in this film. While sexuality is another theme in this classic film, there are touching scenes between the Laurent and his mother. As he finds himself attracted to other women, he becomes daring, insulting and even unlikable. I won't give away the ending of this film. But it's worth watching even today more than 30 years later, I cannot believe it's older than me. It seems like it could have been done today and that's why it's a classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaking taboos.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A French film about the relationship between a teen-aged boy (Ferreux) and his mother (Massari). Well, I guess more generally it is about Ferreux' coming of age, a kind of Bildungsfilm, because other characters play a part in his development -- a girl his age, a priest and tutor, and so forth.Ferreux and Massari are a little closer, a little more playful together than a boy and his mother should be, and there are little warnings along the way that his budding sexuality is budding in what most people would consider not quite the right direction. The bud bursts into bloom at the end but nobody seems to care very much. Massari says it was a sacred and secret moment but will never happen again. And one supposes that afterward Ferreux takes off after that winsome blonde of his own age rather than rifling through his mother's underwear.The performances are fine. Man, Ferreux looks as if he might have grown into that English actor who played James Whale in "Gods and Monsters" but whose name escapes me. It will come to me sooner or later but too late to use it here. The story of my life -- we'll call it "Plus Tarde." He's a pretty good actor for such a young kid. Totally natural, though a bit serious. Listens to Charlie Parker, of whom we hear a few shards during the story. Whew, what blistering runs, what genius.Lea Massari is just about the right age and temperament for her role. She was a lot more dangerous before she disappeared in "L'Avventura," with her fulgurating sexuality. Here she's matter of fact about things, candid in her discussions with her son, clips his toe nails for him, sings happily while accompanying herself on the guitar, shrugs everything off. I think this is called "savoir-faire". It's kind of like having a constitutional Prozac-generator. She's just old enough for the part but has lost none of her foxy edge.The priest senses something may be a little bent but his warning hints go unregarded. There are no moments of high drama. Nobody seems to worry too much about anything. Maybe it's the Dijon mustard in their diet, but whatever it is we should all have more of it. A genuinely good-natured movie about taking things just seriously enough -- not too little and not too much. Bird plays under the closing credits, a thoroughly apt petit cadeau.Enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelous Malle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Touching coming-of-age story focuses on the youngest of three sons of a French gynecologist and his wife in Paris in the 1950s. Malle does a wonderful job of showing the relationships between the family members, helped by fine acting by all, particularly Massari as the beautiful mother and Ferreux as the gawky 15-year old son. As with Malle's "Pretty Baby," issues of sexuality are handled without hangups, even if it involves children. It is well known that one of the central themes of this film is incest but rather than being disturbing or exploitative, it is presented in a surprisingly tender manner without being judgmental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Laurent is the youngest, smartest, most sensitive of three boys in a wild bourgeois French family. His brothers are amoral and hysterical. His father could not be more uptight. And his mother is full of laughter, beautiful and irresistible.The brothers drink, steal, and even replace a valuable original painting just so they can watch their father's reaction when they casually start cutting it to pieces during dinner.This is the ultimate French counterculture movie. Somehow the way Laurent pleases himself with books and bebop recordings is simultaneously sophisticated and innocent.The Charlie Parker score is mesmerizing. Some people won't get it. Others will find it evokes everything wonderful about growing up and discovering yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificently Provocative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La Soufflé au Cour really manages to make you question well-established values. Made in 1971 I can really imagine how it deranged the society and made the French film censure think twice before allowing it to be published. As a provocative film there's no doubt it's still timely. Louis Malle breaks taboos with a spontaneity that makes me as a viewer question if I've missed something growing up.Malle seems to me to be above all a magnificent story-teller. There is no apparent message in La Soufflé au Cour, instead Malle let's the viewer make his own assumptions, based the deceptively realistic happenings and surroundings.It's an unforgettable film, but watch out. You might be influenced by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a beautiful coming of age story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been a million coming of age stories in the history of the world, most of them probably in the film medium. What a pathetic thing to have to endure something as trite as the American film American Pie when something like The 400 Blows exists. Murmur of the Heart will remind most of that classic, and, akin to French films such as Zero for Conduct, The 400 Blows, and Malle's own Au Revoir Les Enfantes, it is excellently acted, both by the adults in the film and the children (here, though, they're teens), and it is infinitely more truthful than most American films of the same genre. Murmur of the Heart falls just short of The 400 Blows, but it is a worthy successor to it. Beware, though. This film's main theme is sexuality, and there are some very disturbing scenes, even thought the mood of the film is quite light-hearted. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming of Age Was Never Like This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laurent is an obnoxious fourteen-year-old boy who has two brothers almost as obnoxious as he is and a father who is not bad in the obnoxious department himself. He also has a mother, Clara, who seems to be a nice, warm-hearted, loving person. She needs to ditch that family, but when she gets the chance to run off with her lover, who is just as obnoxious as her family, I guess she figures, "What's the point?"Because Clara is so affectionate and sensual, and because she and Laurent end up having to stay in a hotel room together, we quickly figure out that we are being prepared for a little oedipal hanky-panky. Now, in a movie in which a boy has sex with his mother, we figure one of two things will happen: either he will turn into some kind of Norman Bates psycho, or the incestuous affair will be a deep, meaningful, transformative experience for the lad. Since the movie is French, I anticipated the latter. I assumed that as a result of his having sex with his mother, he would stop being obnoxious and start being nice, warm-hearted, and loving, just like her. Nope. By the end of the movie, he is still his same old rotten self.Before they have sex, his mother says that they will just do it one time, and then they will never talk about it again. Oh sure. For all her worldly experience, she does not seem to know much about men. You can't give them a taste and expect them to go away and forget about how good it was. She had a husband who was very jealous when they were first in love, and she had a lover who was very jealous, and now she thinks her son won't end up being a jealous lover too? Of course, the movie indicates that they will forget about the fact that they had sex, because Louis Malle, the writer and director, wanted it that way. But it's not realistic, so don't try this at home.Not that I would know personally, but I suspect that having sex with your mother would be enough excitement for one evening. But as soon as Clara falls asleep, Laurent gets dressed and heads on down the hall for little action with someone his own age. He wakes up one girl, propositions her with his usual obnoxious manner, and when she runs him off, he heads on down the hall to the next one, where, for some mysterious reason, he actually succeeds.In a time when gender equality is the ideal, the double standard regarding the sexes is looked upon with disfavor. This movie makes us realize that in some respects, the double standard will never be completely eliminated, nor should it. Just imagine a similar movie, but one in which a man has sex with his fourteen-year-old daughter, which the movie would have us regard as being a meaningful act of love. I say imagine it, because you know darn well you will never see such a movie.Finally, because Laurent is Catholic, I could not help trying to imagine how his next confession is going to go. I wonder how many Hail Marys you have to say for having sex with your mother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming of Age Story with Oedipus Complex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1954, in the Spring, the fourteen year-old boy Laurent Chevalier (Benoît Ferreux) lives with his Italian mother Clara Chevalier (Lea Massari); his father, the gynecologist Charles Chevalier (Daniel Gélin); and his teenager brothers Thomas (Fabien Ferreux) and Marc (Marc Winocourt) in an upper-class neighborhood in Dijon. Laurent is fan of jazz, and Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie are his favorite musicians. He also likes to read Proust and other prominent writers. Laurent is very close to his mother and he discovers that she has a lover named Jacques. However, Charles ignores his younger son. Thomas and Marc take Laurent to a brothel but while having his first intercourse, he is interrupted by his drunken brothers. When the doctor finds that Laurent has a murmur in his heart, he suggests that the boy should go to Bourbon-les-Eaux to heal and Clara stays with him in the same room. Along the days, Laurent befriends the teenagers Helene (Jacqueline Chauvaud) and Daphne (Corinne Kersten); on the Bastille Day, Jacques dumps Clara and she celebrates the holiday with Laurent. They drink a lot and when they return to their room, they have an incestuous relationship. "Le Soufflé de Couer" is a coming of age story with Oedipus complex of a young boy in France in the 50's. The story of Louis Malle is politically incorrect in accordance with the present standards of Hollywood but absolutely acceptable in 1971, the year of "Summer of 42". The fourteen year-old boy has an incestuous relationship with his mother; is molested by a priest; smokes; drinks; shoplifts; has sex with prostitute; cheats; drives reckless on the road with his brothers, but all the situations are credible and developed very naturally. The sexual tension between Laurent and Clara is present from the beginning to the end and Lea Massari is extremely beautiful and sexy. The first half is quite pointless but the second half is a very provocative film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Sopro do Coraç?o" ("A Murmur in the Heart")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A place in my heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A French coming-of-age comedy-drama I've known by reputation, Murmur of the Heart (1971) by Louis Malle has been on my must-watch list for what feels like a long time now. I finally had a chance to see it this week and it at least matched, if not exceeded, my expectations. Supposedly, Malle claimed it as a semi-autobiography- quite a thing to acknowledge when his protagonist, a stand-in for himself, goes to bed with his own mother!Murmur of the Heart follows the French boy Laurent, almost-15. A precocious intellectual, he reads, gets good grades and is described by his mother as very sensitive. His mother, Clara, is sort of an opposite, an Italian anti-intellectual who never went to school and doesn't vote. Despite this, Laurent and Clara share a bond, and she is more like a friend to her three sons than a mother.Much of the glimpses into the Chevalier household are slice of life, feel authentic and have real humour to them. Things like the spinach tennis are hilarious; the boys also pull an outrageous prank, switching a priceless painting with a copy they demolish in front of their parents. They're mean to their servants, but this has a sort of dark comic value as well.The film reaches its special status when Laurent falls ill and gets a heart murmur. After his mom cares for him and sings him songs, they check into a hotel where a misunderstanding leads to them sharing a bedroom. Laurent has recently been pushed into losing his virginity by his brothers, and Clara is a real babe. The Oedipal sexual tension between the two becomes apparent and delicious. Their friendly banter turns to talk about sex, she walks around in her underwear, and they talk about her affair, which she ends. At one point, he spies on her in the bathtub. Clara has such an amazing shape that this is a truly beautiful moment. You almost want them to make love. After a night of heavy drinking, Laurent does go from momma's boy to motherlover- but this happens sort of accidentally, innocently. The film doesn't exactly endorse it- Clara says it'll never happen again- but she also tells him not to regret it, an interesting perspective. Immediately after, he goes to search for a girl his own age, moving on and realizing his sexual identity.Murmur of the Heart, while maybe appearing sleazy, has heart- honesty, humour, life, and two loving and usually-sympathetic protagonists. This is a rather perverse piece but beautiful in its own way, and is not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Young To Cut The Mustard? Pas du tout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Louis Malle thought nothing of mining his childhood/youth for films such as Au Revoir, Les Enfants and in most cases these quasi-autobiographical entries are among his finest work. This is no exception; set in Dijon, perhaps best known as the centre of the moutard (mustard) industry, it features a family very like his own, a protagonist very like himself, constantly ragged by two older brothers, obsessed with Jazz and literature and crucially sharing a hotel room with his mother. Stated as baldly as this it's not going to have a line at the box office but as always it is what Malled does with these basic facts that makes this an outstanding film; beginning with the period 'feel' which is spot-on and on to which he grafts some brilliant ensemble acting so that although Benoit Ferreux and Lea Massari carry the burden the weight is distributed equally between the very fine supporting actors. One to own on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another kind of Risky Business</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow this movie reminded me about Tom Cruise's "Risky Business". I guess it tackled the dark subject lighthearted successfully.I found this movie from Roger Ebert's review of "Damage". I guess it must stir quite controversy at the time of release like "The Graduate". I just saw this movie the first time which I would say if I would have seen it at my teens I probably would not get the most of it. There are a list of movies might give you impression strong enough to make you go back to see them again later in live. This one would be on it. There are some elements audience might take into consideration which led to the incest incidence. The first one is the young, passionate and attractive mother who did not act like a rigid parent to her youngest son. She became pregnant at 16 and was forced to marry to the much older man subsequently. I don't think the incest would have happened without such a prelude. Teenager boys fascinating about older women is considered normal. It would have serious consequences if adults take upon their fantasy nowadays. However, the movie is not about moral issues or judgments. It's about the teenager boy lost his innocent. Another arch is the grumpy, older and neglecting father. He had no interests or passions toward his family. I would say audience will see it's not uncommon in the relationship. The director put them together and led us to the dark place which we are able to see such a serious subject in a different point of view.I indeed like this movie. We all lost our innocent at some points of our lives. However, most of us probably would rather forget about it and lives go on just like the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Le soufflé Au Coeur (Murmur of the Heart)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Louis Malle (Atlantic City, Au Revoir Les Enfants), this film featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die when I read more about it sounded like something with a risky subject, which of course intrigued me more. Basically, set in the 1950's, this is the adventures of fifteen year old school boy Laurent Chevalier (Benoît Ferreux) as he grows up in middle class surroundings in Dijon, France. Throughout these experiences he experiences almost no real emotion or shattering of self-esteem like any normal young man, and these are not all regular things to happen to someone his kind of age. These include him starting a smoking habit, getting drunk, having his first sexual experience with an older woman prostitute in a brothel, having a priest make a pass at him, and with a bout of scarlet fever he finds out he has a heart murmur. But the most prominent, and controversial, events involving Laurent are his relationship with his mother, she loves him very dearly and he vice versa, but she is in fact smothering him and he feels strongly for her, they have an incestuous relationship that does turn sexual. Also starring Lea Massari as Clara Chevalier, Daniel Gélin as Charles Chevalier, Marc Winocourt as Marc, Fabien Ferreux as Thomas, Moonraker's Michael Lonsdale as Father Henri and Ave Ninchi as Augusta. Critics obviously had the highest concerns about the incest storyline of the film, more so than anything else going on, but this is understandable bearing in mind the mother-son relationship and the age gap, however it is both shocking and fascinating to watch, it was for me what made the film a very interesting drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Murmur of the Heart is an astonishing work of drama combining the elements of coming of age and sexual initiation. Realistically told is the tale of a 15-year-old boy from a well-off family learning about love and sex and growing up in general.What makes the film more successful than other similar work, I think, is the appropriate setting of the tone. It is adjusted to a moderate level to prevent a too light or heavy script. The performances, especially the leading actor playing the protagonist, are promising and multilayer.There is much to discover and explore in this drama.

		<shortDescription>Good, in somewhat of a disturbing way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie on the Independent Film Channel, and decided to watch it, not knowing what it was about. And I was very shocked but the end. It tells the story of a young teenage boy, Laurant, as he quickly grows up. He's somewhat forced to lose his virginity via prostitute by his two older brothers. Afterwards, he goes to a scout camp, and becomes ill with Scarlet Fever, and also has a heart murmur. His doctor suggests a sanitarium for him to visit, and he and his mother stay at a nearby hotel for some time. He meets a couple girls his age there, whom he likes. He and his mother has a very close relationship. They have to share a hotel room, and one morning his mother is bathing, and he watches her through the door until his mother sees him and slaps him across the face. Later on in the movie, it is obvious that his mother is having an affair, and when Laurant discovers this, he is somewhat upset. His mother decides to leave with her suitor for two days, and Laurant is left at the hotel, and acts very rude and raunchy to the people at the hotel and sanitarium. Laurant also dresses as his mother, and places her close on his bed, as an outline as her. When his mother returns, it is obvious that she is very upset, and Laurant tries to console her. They go to a Bastille Day celebration soon after, and when they arrive home, Laurant and his mother have sex. They vow never to speak of it again. Laurant scores the hotel, looking for a girl his age to have sex with, and he does. When he returns from the young girl's room, his father and brothers are there, and they tease him for being out all night. I have to admit, the scene where Laurant and his mother have sex was very shocking to me, but I'm not going to let that decide whether this was a good movie or not. I think this movie shows the raw truth about some boys experiences during their adolescent years. Also, it can show how unhealthy a relationship between mother and child can be sometimes. You have to love your child, but there are obvious limits. I really respect this movie for not being afraid to make a film with such subject matter in 1971.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really think there's much to say about this film that this film doesn't clearly say itself. It's a coming-of-age story, more importantly a sexual one. A fifteen year old Parissien boy discovers girls of all ages and types, has to figure out what to do with them, and also has to figure out how to come to terms with his relationship with his mother and the fact that she's female too.It's one of those films that's very true-to-life but not something you can really show to someone of that age without confusing them more. It takes a lot of maturity and retrospective understanding to totally relate to the characters and what's going on, and in a few cases it's still likely to easily be misinterpreted. But overall it's a remarkable look at that age group and the things they have to go through to understand themselves and their bodies.I also personally relate to it because of how much the main character tries to be intellectual. That in itself carries its own connotations and sort of leads me to believe that anyone who at one point thought that intellectualism was key to personal transcendence may enjoy somewhat more this film's specific approach to something shown quite often in cinema history.Finally, I love how iconoclast this film is and the almost flippant approach it has to society's ideals of art, beauty, and spirituality. That said, how many films do we need with pedophile priests? --PolarisDiB</fullReview>

The actors don't need to have a tic or a physical disability to stun you.The pacing of the film is often very slow and doesn't have much direction, but that doesn't matter.This is a subtle film, one which I am sure you will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite French film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Louis Malle's Murmur of the Heart is my very favorite French film because it was the first French film I saw long ago and the one that at the time, made a deep impression on me. I saw it again last night after several years away from it. Laurent still has that bird-like quality to him and his mother (in a strong performance by Lea Massili) is still the girl-woman with flexible boundaries. His rougish, despicable older brothers and his very detached father make for one of the more unsympathetic family portraits on film and yet, as we see in the end, they are still a family. The film makes hay with the Catholic Church in a big way . When the incest scene finally comes, it is more about breaking the taboo of an overly constricted religion than breaking the general social taboo. The event is presented without sentimentality and you are left to draw your own conclusions. The very end was unnerving to me, though, and I am not sure why Malle made the choice that he did. It is an important, realistic and not particularly sentimental film which foreshadows the direction of much of Malle's l</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malle Influences-more questions than answers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My overriding impression of at least the first half of this film was that Malle had drawn extensively from Roger Peyrefitte's novel Les Amities Particulieres. The smothering Catholicism, cute younger boy, pedophile priest, passing of notes in church, cuddling and sexual implications all seemed to be drawn whole cloth from the Peyrefitte novel. It seemed to me though, that after the camping scene Malle abandoned that relationship very abruptly without developing it further.Too bad, because it would have been interesting to see where that relationship would have gone. However, Malle seemed to switch gears all of a sudden and the main character becomes exclusively and aggressively heterosexual.If I were able to interview Malle, I would ask him firstly if he had read Les Amities Particulieres, and if it had influenced him in the making of that part of the film. Secondly, I would ask him why he dropped that particular plot line. I also wild have been interested in finding out how much of this film was autobiographical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought the Criterion DVD edition of this film, having been an admirer of Louis Malle for a long time, and having heard that this was one of his very best films. I thought that if it was as good as Pretty Baby, Atlantic City, Damage, Vanya on 42nd Street - I could go on - then it would be worth waiting for (not to mention the high price).Well, it's not. I didn't like the way the film began, and although I kept expecting it to click into gear and improve, it never did.The rather anarchic household was tedious and not nearly as funny as it was no doubt intended to be; but that's not the real problem.The boorish elder brothers deserve a slap in the chops; but they're not the real problem either.The three brothers' obsession with sex is overdone, though not greatly so if I remember my own adolescence correctly; that's not the real problem either.And neither is the relentless "free-spiritedness" of the intensely irritating mother, although it certainly doesn't help the film.No, the real problem is the supposed resolution of what passes for a plot. Mother gets drunk, son undresses her, falls into bed with her and passion overwhelms them. Yeah, right. And then mother sobers up enough to have some deep and meaningful words with son about remembering and cherishing their secret moment of passion. And son says of course. Yeah, right.And then son slips out of bed, tiptoes down the hall, tries (but fails, in the one faintly believable scene in this ridiculous sequence) to rape one of the two sympathetic characters in the whole film (the other being the nice prostitute at the brothel), and moves on to spend the night with another girl, a willing one this time. As if.And finally, when he creeps back to his own room the next morning and finds his father and brothers there, fully clothed while his mother's still in just a dressing-gown, the film ends with everybody laughing.I've got nothing against sex, nothing against nudity, I love French films and I respect and admire Louis Malle. But this film misses the mark completely. As a comedy it is without a laugh in it from beginning to end. And the plot is so ridiculously unbelievable that if there's supposed to be some insight in the film, it is entirely lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still overshadowed by controversy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only in France would an otherwise typical coming-of-age comedy lead up to a tender moment of incest, and perhaps only Louis Malle could have filmed it with such grace, tact, and good humor. The director's adolescent alter-ego is a gangly, jazz-happy son of a wealthy gynecologist, teased by his two older brothers, coddled by his cosmopolitan young mother, and suspicious of his father confessor's less than spiritual attentions. The discovery of a heart murmur sends him and his mother to a distant spa, where fate and nature conspire toward a fleeting indiscretion. But because Malle takes the time to establish his characters, and does so with such obvious affection, the moment is not as racy or obscene as it sounds. Curiously, the young hero's growing pains are also linked to his country's problems in Indochina, so is it any wonder, with the adult world in such turmoil, that a boy would rebel against the conventional wisdom of his elders?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Les Fleurs du Malle? Deflower power? Le White Punks on Cognac?I suspect the French savor a scandal better than us Americans. For me this film was an interesting one, but might have been far more powerful with just a whiff of its forbidden fragrance? Eau d'affaire? In a way, I wanted the film to lean more towards licentiousness rather than lasciviousness.Juvenile sex confusion is less alien to me than some of the notions of the bourgeoisie. Of course I understand the concept and am aware of the historical disgust tossed by the "true" sophisticates at the cheaper rich. Isn't the last name of the family in this, Chevalier, somehow connected to the idea of class and nobility?A rigid sense of privilege just doesn't resonate well in California these days. But then neither do rites of passage, and that might be a big mistake for us. We've got teenagers in their thirties, and parents who want to be the kids' best pals...so that aspect in this film connected well.The introductory scene of Clara with her sons is an energetic one, and immediately a playful, loose and even oddly sexy relationship is established. Whereas the free jazz featured in this film has aged very well, such freedom in the family order doesn't quite hit the right notes in my opinion. An ever-humbling opinion...as a father of five-year old twin boys.So while I'll take even more freedom in my jazz, I'd prefer less in the latitude granted to the next generation. The film revolves around the relationship of mother and son, and Lea Massari was a revelation as the mother whose youth remains irrepressible. Meanwhile Benoit Ferreux has the tougher role. Not only is this his debut, he's the stand-in for Malle's remembrances evidently. On top of that he has to do this as a fifteen year-old playing a fifteen year-old written with an apparently much older soul.I think the compassion/conflict of the son for his mother is true, agonizing and often beautiful here...but in watching the trailer for this film that came with the DVD, I almost wonder if Malle felt a need to take his memoirs and season them with something a bit more salacious? Something stronger than the salicylate remedy prescribed.Peer pressure of French teen films??Smaller things made this film even more enjoyable1) the title alone, and the reason why Laurent and mother wind up at the hotel together2) the camp scene, where we sense Laurent wants to atone for the absent father in his life3) the forgery, and in general the rabid rebellion of the two elder hellion4) the parallel scene of Laurent "catching" his father (a gynecologist) with a woman in a state of undress to later set against his mother's infidelity6.5/10 Thurston Hunger</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decades ago, David Mamet wrote a play called "Sexual Perversity In Chicago", the base for the later movie "About Last Night..." The play's title was a come-on; all it was was about two men and two women, each man trying to have a relationship with each woman, and when said relationships fail, both men try to have relationships with the other woman instead. They're not even swingers as such.This movie is quite the opposite! The box indicated that this is supposed to be a comic coming-of-age story. There are some laughs, but those are offset by the growing weirdness and creepiness. None of the characters provoke either interest or sympathy. The father is ridiculous; the mother is shallow and silly, the protagonist's two older brothers are aggressive, obnoxious, and unlikable; and the young teenage protagonist is hardly better than the rest of his family. He meets girls, but rather than try to charm them, he simply gropes them and makes them uncomfortable.The title refers to the illness the protagonist gets mid-movie, and he moves to a hotel for a rest cure, his mother accompanying him. We learn of the mother's strange background, which would have been a source of interest, but she is never developed. And finally, mother and son drink and hit upon each other, and, well...that explains my review title. I didn't wait to see what happened next.One can make the claim that sexual standards may be different in Europe, but not THAT different! I suspect only because the director was so prominent could he dare make this sort of story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The subject of consensual incest has been examined in only a few films, almost all negatively, which is understandable. Malle's film was controversial because it allegedly depicts a mother-son incestuous encounter in a positive light, but I'm wondering what film people have seen! Neither the film nor the sequence is sympathetic at all. The boy is intensely dis-likable, his brothers are sleazy, and mom is an undeveloped character. The controversial scene of incest occurs only near the end, and does not hang over the whole film, contrary to reputation. In the scene, mother and son snuggle and accidentally have sex. Only in the movies can people "accidentally" have sex! I remain puzzled by the film's glowing reputation all these years, and wonder if it is just because Louis Malle is one of those artists that people feel obligated to praise. You cannot make a beautiful, sympathetic movie with a story full of unsympathetic characters. Therefore, when people use words like "beautiful" and "moving" to describe the film. I am perplexed.

Parts of the plot are similarly difficult to embrace: girls his own age (15)answering his knock on their hotel room door late at night, and one inviting him in to spend the night (and the parents wouldn't know?), 'hooking up' (at 15?) though they'd just met earlier in the day briefly, and he's hardly romantic or suave, but rather clumsy as he forces himself on them. I wonder if a no-name had written and directed this if the reviews would be so superlative.

		<shortDescription>MURMUR OF THE HEART (Louis Malle, 1971) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven years before PRETTY BABY (1978), Malle directed another controversial film about the sexual awakening of a precocious teenager - in this case, a boy. As with the later film, Malle's elegant handling - suffused with feeling and humor, even irreverence - brings no portentous message and certainly no sensationalism to this theme (which culminates in an incestuous relationship between the boy and his attractive, middle-aged mother!). Even so, the complicity that goes on here between the boy and select members of his family seems to me to be wishful thinking on Malle's part (who also wrote the script) more than anything else: the boy's sexual initiation is organized by his promiscuous elder brothers and, apart from the mother-son "liaison" - which happens when she's intoxicated and is, in any case, shot in the dark and quite sensitively handled by all concerned - he's compliant of her various affairs, which actually brings him to confess to her that he never loved his father and consequently doubts his own parentage!The acting by the entire cast - veterans and newcomers alike - is wonderful; still, watching professionals like Lea Massari (in perhaps her most important role apart from the girl who goes missing in Antonioni's L?¦AVVENTURA [1960]), Daniel Gelin (who has aged quite a bit from his 50s heyday!), Michel Lonsdale (as a potentially paedophile priest!) and Ave Ninchi (as the children's long-suffering, heavy-set Italian maid) is especially gratifying. The score by several jazz performers, including Charlie Parker, provides perfect accompaniment to the film.The only extra on the stand-alone Criterion release (it's also available as part of a 4-Disc Set with two other Malle films which revolve around children - LACOMBE LUCIEN [1974] and AU REVOIR, LES ENFANTS [1987]) - is the film's theatrical trailer which, amusingly, manages to incorporate in its publicity several of the most famous titles of the French New Wave!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A minor effort by an accomplished director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This coming of age story about Laurent, an adolescent French boy, has only one unique twist and that is a single act of incest, and that develops in such a natural and harmless way that it is just one more life experience in Laurent's maturation - in fact it unleashes in him the confidence to pursue a girl his own age.Most clichés about Western teenagers are here: smoking, drinking, prostitutes, masturbation, comparing penis sizes, reading pornographic books, petty theft, fascination with women's clothing, roughhousing, practical jokes, and so forth. And a pedophile priest is thrown in for good measure. The movie is well filmed and not without charm and it may have been groundbreaking at the time, but it seems rather timeworn some thirty-six years on.I found the behavior of Laurent and his two brothers bothersome. They treated their domestic help rather brutishly and in all respects gave evidence of behaving like the spoiled, inconsiderate rich kids they were. Take for example the scene at the table where they were playing "tennis" with the spinach.The movie takes place shortly after the defeat of France at Dien Bien Phu and France's withdrawal from Vietnam. One thinks that the background references to these events portend some plot theme later on, but nothing ever comes of it outside setting the time period.Then there is the illness referred to in the title. The official diagnosis was aortic insufficiency and dilation of the left ventricle. That sounds pretty serious to me, but after the diagnosis Laurent never seemed to suffer a single ill effect. Again a theme that is not subsequently developed.The young campers staging a version of Goethe's "The Erlking" was indeed a novelty - I wish there had been more such inventive, fun scenes. I somehow doubt that it would ever occur to a Boy Scout troop in the United States to undertake such a thing.The final scene of prolonged, forced laughter by all concerned seemed about as real as a laugh track and served to punctuate my opinion that this film does not belong among Malle's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is natural for us Germans to envy our French neighbors for their style, for their "Savoir-vivre" and for their cinema. However, this is one of the French films that remind me why I like being German. Although I admire French cinema (my list of favorites contains much more French than German films) and although I really liked the US-produced "Pretty Baby" of the same director, "Le Soufflé au coeur" was annoying and made me angry. With its "C'est-la-vie"-attitude it seems to say that life (and love) is a game, and nothing really matters, not even sleeping with your mother. I don't believe that's true. You may make a film that lets you laugh about life and the foolish things that people do. But ultimately life is a serious matter. An artist denying that fact is a liar.

		<fullReview>The best film by Louis Malle ( that's not saying much ) is a story about the awakening, sexual and otherwise, of a scampy 14-year old Parisian named Laurent Chevalier. He's a precocious teen, and lest we forget, someone is always ready to remind us -- each character sees the same Camus book laying around on his nightstand and says something like "You're a real intellectual!" One assumes Laurent, played with bandy-legged aplomb by Benoit Ferreux, represents Malle as he wishes he were at a younger age. Still, Murmur of the Heart gets a lot right when it comes to the depiction of a budding artist's development. Like most sensitive youths, Laurent is virtually estranged from his father ( who seems like an interloper in his own home ), and much prefers the company of his mother. But I'm afraid in this case "company" is a euphemism.Yes, Laurent gets a chance to revisit ye olde womb near the end of the movie. But Murmur of the Heart is not "about" incest, as its reputation would lead you to believe. It's an affectionate portrait of an unusually close mother/son relationship. They discuss her extramarital affairs, his schoolboy crushes, and The Story of O with complete openness and candor. They make an adorable couple. The sex is just a cherry on top, so to speak.One tiny problem for me was that Ferreux never truly seems RELATED to his mammacita, as played by Italian actress Lea Massari. This takes some of the sting out of their eventual coupling. We think, "Well, why not?" If the mother resembled Laurent even a little, maybe had his high cheekbones or pale skin... creepy! But there's just no way scrawny Laurent came out of that bodacious body. Still, this disparity shouldn't detract one iota from your enjoyment of Massari's warm presence. And hey -- if the casting is too cute to be convincing, at least it's not too cute to be cute.A much bigger problem, at least for modern audiences, will be the incest scene itself. Far too many movies have dealt with incest since this one -- notably Spanking the Monkey and The Celebration -- but to be fair, Malle was first. The hoary jokes about lesbians, gays, and gynecologists were also presumably more daring at the time. And the same goes for the soundtrack, which trots out jazz luminaries like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie in such a way that virtually carbon dates the movie as "SWINGING PARIS 1971!" Malle was always modish to a fault. But he was never again to be as intimate and personal as he is here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technically, this is a very good movie--with decent acting, lighting, direction, etc. The problem is that no matter HOW well-made the movie is technically, it cannot overcome the basic sleaziness of the plot. It was bad enough that the three brothers are sociopathic sex fiends--but in the end of the movie the lead character has sex with his own mother (a biological one, to boot). Sigmund Freud and the Oedipal Complex aside, this is just plain nasty! However, considering this is from Louis Malle, who brought us the lovely story "Pretty Baby" (about an 11 year-old who works in a whorehouse and is the object of desire for an old freak), this movie didn't come as a total surprise. Now I'm sure many of you are thinking I'm some sort of prude--fine. However, then it's incumbent upon you to justify this incestuous relationship instead of just dismissing my complaint. Yeah, some kids may DREAM of sleeping with their mothers (this must be true--Freud made a fortune after he came up with this concept), but to actually portray this in a movie?! What's next--necrophilia?!It's beyond me that so many people love this film and so far on IMDb my review has received gobs of "not helpfuls". The main character has sex with his own mother and this is treated in the film like a loving and sweet thing!!! And yet people see this is a good film?!?! Geez...sometimes I just wonder if there's any intelligent life on this planet at all. Folks,...he has sex with his Mommy!! What more can you have happen in a film before it becomes a bad film?!
