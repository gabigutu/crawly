		<shortDescription>The perfect balance of drama and comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film.The Tenenbaum's dysfunction (while amplified for the screen) is quite an accurate portrayal of family life. Families are, essentially, groups of people living in each other's pockets, and, invariably, those people who love you and hate you the most.Don't get me wrong, Royal and his (thermo)nuclear family of brilliant buffoons do not represent my family (or any other in the world I think!) but the family united against a miscreant father is a motif a lot of people can understand. It is this common humanity that really appeals to me as a film watcher, and what, ultimately made this film so very memorable to me.The ensemble cast is astonishingly proficient. They all lend a perfect quirkiness to the roles. Anjelica Houston is the perfect former Mrs Royal Tenenbaum, down to the smallest nuance, Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson turn in wonderful performances, and this is the only role I've seen Gwenyth Paltrow in where I actually thought she was someone other than Gwenyth Paltrow (this is not an insult, it's just that people don't always do it for everyone, you know...?). Bill Murray, Gene Hackman, Owen Wilson, all excellent, all the time.The black comedy counterbalanced with the drama of the issues raised in this film left me feeling like I'd witnessed a film event, rather than just another film. I loved every frame of it, from the Baldwin narrated opening, to the final tying up of ends. It never dwelled on melodrama, or the more potentially unsavoury elements, and it didn't sink into the schmaltzy "We all love each other" end it could well have. It began perfectly, and it ended perfectly.I can't recommend this movie more highly. It's a must see for anyone who loves quirky and emotive storytelling, great characters and beautiful dialogue.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's more than quirky!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 'The Royal Tenenbaums', Wes Anderson turns his lens to the American family, warts and all. The Tenenbaums are a dysfunctional family ? the parents have been separated for decades, and Royal (Gene Hackman) is a disbarred attorney who has long since moved out of the family's enormous house (in an unnamed city of course). The children, all geniuses and overachievers in their own way, are then raised by Etheline (Angelica Houston), an archeologist. Chas (Ben Stiller) is a financial wizard, Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), is adopted and was a published playwright at 11, and Richie (Luke Wilson) is a tennis prodigy. We are provided the family history at the start of the film, then are introduced to the family 22 years later. Chas is still a financial wizard, but, having lost his wife in a plane accident is now the paranoid father of two small sons. Margot is married to Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray, who is basically Anderson's muse), is depressed and hasn't written in years, and Richie, after having a nervous breakdown on the tennis court a couple of years earlier is traveling the world by boat. Still hanging around is Eli (Owen Wilson) a long-time family friend from across the street who is now a literature professor and successful novelist. Etheline is being wooed by her accountant, Henry (Danny Glover) and when Royal gets wind of this, he embarks on a bid to win his family back after not speaking with them for years.Wes Anderson has an unusual style of film-making that has been static throughout his career. Highly theatrical, almost in the style of a play, he presents the story of the Tenenbaums to us as if it were taken directly from a book, so much so that if you were to read the few sentences that are visible in the book that accompanies the beginning of each 'chapter', you would see that the written narrative follows the action to the letter. Anderson favors primary colors, and characters that are identifiable by very distinct appearances. Chas and his sons have their red track suits they always wear, Margot wears the clip in her hair, Izod dresses from the 80's and dark eyeliner surrounding her eyes, Richie wears the sweatband around his head, Eli is in cowboy gear and Raleigh looks like a Freud knockoff. One of the results is that there are varying degrees of recognition for the actor in 'real life'. When seeing Raleigh, it's easy to forget that it is Bill Murray, and Margot for that matter is so different from how we are used to seeing Paltrow. Certainly, this is Anderson's intent. Anderson also favors point of view shots, characters looking directly at or addressing the camera, and is also one of the few modern masters in the use of music. The soundtrack to 'The Royal Tenenbaums' features some classic songs (Ruby Tuesday, Hey Jude) but also has some obscure tracks that are bizarre and fit into the scene beautifully.'The Royal Tenenbaums' has a phenomenal cast, and all of the actors are excellent in the film. I get the strong impression that, since Anderson isn't a mainstream film director, A-list actors sign up to work for him because of his alternative vision and his obvious talent. When I watched this film recently, I asked the two friends I saw it with what they thought, and they both said 'It was quirky'. Since they are both film lovers, I was a little disappointed in this narrow (and obvious) assessment of the film at first. Upon further reflection, however, I realized that they both come from households that have parents who are still together. Coming from a 'broken home' I can relate to the high dysfunction of the Tenenbaums as an adult and embrace the story beyond the presentation, despite its highly stylized format. 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is a brilliant film that is both emotional and eye-catching, and truly cements Wes Anderson as an exciting and talented filmmaker. 9/10--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, hilarious and dark. A great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writing/Director team Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson follow up their wonderful 1999 film Rushmore with something not completely different but altogether more satisfying and a good deal more powerful.The Tenenbaums are a wealthy New York family of eccentric genuises, headed by Angelica Huston. The pater familias Gene Hackman has been kicked out and estranged from the family for twenty years. The film begins with a prologue detailing the lives of the Tenenbaum clan - Ben Stiller, the real estate genius and safety obsessive, now widowered with two boys. Luke Wilson a former tennis wunderkind, now an isolated, lonely character all alone in the world and Gwyneth Paltrow, the adopted daughter, playwright, depressive and all-round misery guts. Other players include Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Danny Glover.The excellent cast is testament to the fantastic script. Filled with one-liners, hilarious situations and visual gags, it is a real winner. However, it would be a mistake to take this for an out-and-out comedy. Two-thirds in, the script takes a turn for the utterly dark with a bloody, affecting scene, not to everyone's taste and at odds with the film gone beforehand. It's a brave move by Wilson and Anderson and one that pays off in dividends, elevating this movie above others in the genre.Hackman gives as good as he's got as Royal Tenenbaum, who takes a turn for the better when his kids wake him up to the kind of man he really is. His transformation from manipulative and selfish to a genuinely lonely and honest man is wholly believable. When he emerges as the only man who can bring the whole family together again, it really brings a smile to your face. The rest of the cast, with the exception of Luke Wilson, aren't given a huge amount to do but do extremely well with what they've got. Luke Wilson is superb, playing the confused and alienated Richie, at odds with himself and the rest of his family. His is possibly the best character in the film, symbolising all that is wrong with the Tenanbaum clan.&gt; As usual, The Royal Tenenbaums is rife with Anderson's distinctive directorial touches - 90 degree overhead shots, dialogue-free sequences played to classic rock anthems, and memorably, towards the end, a one-take canvas shot, as beautiful as it is inspired.Special mention must also be given to the New York painted in the film. All Georgian houses, tree-lined avenues and flat sky lines, it's one of the most beautiful depections of this city ever seen in a movie. All in all, a delighful tragi-comedy, with great characters, lush direction and great gags. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank you Wes Anderson! The film is brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think if someone tries to watch a Wes Anderson film, they have to have a certain kind mind to understand the real meaning of them. After being awed by the Royal Tenenbaums, I left with a certain kind of joy that only a great film can give me. It's like flying an electric kite, it's that hard of a buzz. As I began my travel down the stairs of the theater, I heard this couple talking about how stupid the movie was, and how they are going to ask for a refund. I suddenly smiled, because I hoped that they would get one. I think that I got something out of the film that they didn't. That inside the frames of the movie I felt like I was in good company and had a understanding for the material that they didn't. What is so good about the Royal Tenenbaums? The great detail in every frame, from the costumes (and they really are costumes)to the design of Chas, Margot, and Richie rooms and the house. This is brilliant film on every level, a delight for the senses and for the mind. This movie makes you think, and without giving too much away there is a lot of surprises that come from the characters dialogue and their past. High kudos go to Luke Wilson, I loved his performance as the suffering Richie. If you loved Rushmore, there is no doubt that you will love this film because it is at par with it, except that its a bit darker in tone. I think its funny that way that people look at film, we each love or hate a film based on our own perception(and mind there are people who just watch film for entertainment). So if you have a complicated mind and you enjoy watching a challenging film, then the Royal Tenenbaums is for you. As for me, I plan on watching it again so I find more things to love about it. Thank you Wes Anderson, so much. You made laugh, you made me smile and I cried. A thousand times, thank you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty found in comic places</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums, to put it shortly, is a weird movie. It is the story of a family longing for its heyday to return. It is the story of a man who wants to be accepted. It is a story of redemption, filled with small epiphanies and smaller details that make for excellent viewing. It takes delight in showcasing its brilliant characterizations and depictions of social oddities. Many will find it hard to relate to such strangers and therefore decline to revel in this film's cinematic glory. We can pity them.Those that enjoy Wes Anderson's films can be put into two categories. There are those that simply find them to be quirky joyrides and laugh them off as such. Then there are those who recognize the loneliness in all of the characters Wes Anderson writes - it is this sense of loneliness that Wes Anderson, as a storyteller, brings to the screen. It is this sense of loneliness that makes Wes Anderson one of the most visionary filmmakers out there today.The Royal Tenenbaums is an altogether thrilling experience. It is epic, filled with pageantry. Though categorized as a comedy, at times it seems darker then typical black comedies - a drama, or even a triumphant tragedy of life's unrealized outcasts. As Margot Tenenbaum (Gwenyth Paltrow) says in one of the last scenes: "Well, I'm sure he'll get over it." The Royal Tenenbaums is a rejoicing in the human spirit's reluctant but continuous march forward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow-burning masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film on TV and have never seen a director quite like Wes Anderson displaying his outlook on life so expertly. He and Owen Wilson have created a family beyond dysfunctional. Their underplayed script of various oddballs all with their own tale of despair is as left-field as you'll find, with each character, and I stress this, as pathetic as the next.Gene Hackman plays the lead role of Royal with huge confidence while Paltrow (Margot), Stiller (Chaz), and Owen and Luke Wilson (Eli and Richie), develop into fully fledged actors in their brilliant well-rounded performances. Anjelica Huston plays the strong matriarchal head of the family and gives the biggest whiff of normalcy from the film with Kumar Pallana, the knife happy friend/butler/colleague at the opposite end of the spectrum. Along with Pallana's inspired creation, comes Anderson's strongest hand - background players. Like the Coens, he truly adores every character and you feel background with each one. Whether it be Danny Glover's sombre turn as Huston's love interest, Royal's colleague and partner in deception or Buckley the dog. They carry the film and keep it fresh.The script is as above mentioned, slow-burning, letting its characters develop with ease and no constraints. This sits perfectly with Anderson's patient camera, and eye to present the story in a skit-type basis which it very well may be with its spot-on throw away one-liners. When pestered about the nature of his suicide note Richie replies wryly, "Of course it's dark, It's a suicide note."Its along with these, the acting and Andersons direction that Tenenbaums is promoted from simply a cult or indie classic into something so much more. The slow moments perfectly sober the funnier and give room for rest and perspective. It is also where the film delivers its most touching and poignant moments. The wedding scene is totally destroying and will levels the viewer flat. As with Richie's graphic suicide attempt and Royals ultimate demise in the company of his previously absent son.I cannot praise this film enough but I have tried.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favorite movie, even after several viewings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie with commentary, and after seeing how much care goes into each scene, I have fallen for the movie all over again.Even after watching this film 10+ times now, I love it all the more. I have never held this movie as my favorite, but now it has moved into the #1 position after a careful study, and realizing that even 50 more viewings would not unlock all the little treasures hidden within.You are doing yourself a huge disservice if you don't see this movie, or if you dismiss it after a single viewing. Watch it, again if necessary, and see what you are missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched The Royal Tennenbaums 3 times so far and just ordered the DVD. How can you beat the cast, the plot, and the humanity of this film?I dare you to find a better cast than Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston, Danny Glover, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, and the rest of the crew.The chemistry between them works magic on the screen.Without giving away too much of the plot, it revolves around the family of Royal Tennenbaum, a lovable rascal whose family hasn't forgiven him for transgressions of the past. When his estranged wife decides she may want to remarry, the games begin -- and oh what fun games they are. You have to laugh.Emotionally speaking, you will feel like you're riding a roller-coaster with no dead space. If you are into quirky characters, intelligent humor, and aren't afraid to stare painful aspects of human nature eye to eye, you will love The Royal Tennenbaums.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Quirky' Seems To Be The Most Popular Word To Describe This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a quirky film that surprised me, in that I liked it....at least twice. By the third viewing, I had enough but I got my money's worth out of it. That's what I would recommend with this movie: rent it before considering buying it. It's very different, and you might love but also might hate it.What it is, simply, is a portrait of a very dysfunctional family and the father trying to re-connect with his kids after a long absence. Gene Hackman is the father, Angelica Huston the mother and the wacko kids - and other assorted strange characters - are played by Ben Stiller, Owen and Luke Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Bill Murray and Danny Glover. This is mostly dry, dark humor with some funny lines delivered in deadpan style. Nobody is particularly likable but - with the possible exception of Paltrow's character - are not really unlikeable either. They are just strange.I enjoyed viewing the house with all its colors. For those who appreciate low-key absurd humor nd some pleasing visuals, you should like this film and I certainly recommend giving it a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only spoiler is that this film is rubbish! I rented this on the back of a friend's recommendation, but right now I just want to force him to go through two hours of water torture so he can know just what it feels like.The only time I laughed during the entire length of the film was when Gene Hackman's character fell into the pool. Hilarious, a 5 year old could have dreamt that one up. It's really quite worrying that so many people in Hollywood are paying hard money to finance this sort of drivel.Oh look, there's half a dozen alienated kids sitting around and fed up with the world at large. There's also some OK cinematography and scenery, but when the hell does that make a good film? Or at least one that averages 7.6 on the IMDb scale? It is dull, monotonous, and so slow that a Skoda would overtake it. This is clearly a film that belongs to a certain clique of people who consider themselves to have the 'inside joke' when it is readily apparent to most normal people that there is, in fact, no joke.Frankly on the whole I would have more fun detaching my testicles and selling them on eBay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging, ghoulish "Tenenbaums" is comic royalty at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They're creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and spooky, they're altogether ooky... Oops, that's the wrong family, isn't it? Oh well, no matter. The Royal Tenenbaums could very well be considered the First Family of Fright for the new millennium. Their utterly twisted and often hilarious exploits bring to mind memories of that other lovably weird clan. But in terms of the little matter of family harmony, the difference is like oil and water. Neat? Sweet? Petite? The Tenenbaums? No way. Director Wes Anderson's oddball showpiece opens in 1979. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman in a performance that is nothing short of amazing), a mustachioed chain smoker like Gomez Addams but nowhere near as attentive a father, is separated from his level-headed wife, Ethel (Anjelica Huston, who, ironically, played the always-cool Morticia in the two "Addams" films). They have three kids: Chas, Richie, and "adopted daughter" Margot. Royal's blatant lack of interest in his children is the cause of the separation, and he makes no bones about it either. He purposely shoots Chas in the hand with a BB gun and openly criticizes Margot's play, among other things. And his reasoning for the separation? "Well, we made certain sacrifices by having children." Priceless. After his departure, Ethel takes the children under her wing and they evolve into underage prodigies. Chas is a wealthy banker, Margot a successful playwright, and Richie a tennis pro sporting the nickname "The Baumer." Disbarred and suddenly kicked out of a hotel room he's occupied for years, Royal, accompanied constantly by his Lurch-like Middle Eastern manservant Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), decides he wants to make amends for his actions by attempting to reunite with his estranged brood...even if it means faking a terminal illness. And that's when this delight of a movie really takes off. However, things have changed during the 17 years Royal was separated from his family. The children have reached adulthood and are shadows of their former selves. Chas (Ben Stiller), constantly bedecked in red jogging suits - and black for funerals - is a widower with two young boys. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), complete with a Wednesday Addams-style blank glare, is married to a much older man, human study author Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), and she spends six hours a day locked in her bathroom staring listlessly at the TV. Due to a childhood accident, she now has nine and a half fingers. Richie (Luke Wilson), following a humiliating burnout during a televised match, has become a recluse, travelling the world by ship and communicating only through telegrams. Meanwhile, Ethel is engaged to accountant Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), a Teddy bear in a blue suit. Oh, and Richie just happens to be infatuated with his sister Margot. The well-paced screenplay by Anderson and Owen Wilson (who also has a supporting role as drug-addicted, self-absorbed Western author Eli Cash) does a great job of fleshing out each of the main characters, and as a result, viewers will empathize with some of them, no matter their motives. Although it's not an outright knee-slapping laugh fest, one of "Tenenbaums'" best selling points is its aspect of physical comedy, which actually provides more laughs than the spoken variety and adds to scenes instead of bogging them down, as opposed to random, pointless acts of slapstick that do nothing to advance the plot. The outrageous is turned into the subtle, and the results are hysterical moments such as Cash unexpectedly walking off the set of a talk show, Royal attempting to inject a little delinquency into Chas' straight-arrow boys, plus the funniest moment in the film: Richie's embarrassing swan song on the tennis court. Just imagine, say, Pete Sampras helplessly flinging his racket at his opponent's serve or removing his shoes and socks and sitting forlornly on the ground. Then there's also a tour of Cash's quarters, complete with a handy stash of marijuana plants, a multitude of adult videos bearing colorful titles such as "Dark and Dirty", and a collection of large, horrid paintings that even Salvador Dali would have considered repulsive. Throughout the film, nutty covers of books scribed by family members over time randomly pop up and cover the entire screen like wallpaper. In fact, the entire movie is played out much like a book, complete with occasional "chapter introductions" preceding cuts to different scenes. The opening credits are shown in an impossible-to-ignore bold font that nearly usurps the screen. Although the aforementioned physical comedy is a hoot, the verbal is definitely no slouch. The snappy dialogue is full of witty one-liners, such as Royal's innovative use of adverbs when he describes Chas' late wife as "a terribly attractive woman." When Margot informs Ethel that she's been a smoker for 22 years, Ethel calmly replies, "I think you should quit." It's a no-brainer to say that the acting is through the roof. For such a large cast, there is a striking chemistry among the actors as they become so immersed in their onscreen personalities. In turn, the script is effective at balancing these roles out. Although Hackman is undoubtedly the star of the show, the other family members are given their time in the spotlight, and they are just as memorable as a result. The execution of the diverse soundtrack helps set the mood for both humorous and foreboding moments, from the Rolling Stones' "Ruby Tuesday" to film composer Mark Mothersbaugh's inspirational cover of the Beatles' "Hey Jude." Royal's mischievous outing with Chas' sons is set to Paul Simon's classic "Me and Julio Down By The Schoolyard," while Elliott Smith's dark "Needle In The Hay" is used effectively in a very disturbing scene. There's also plenty of classical mixed in with the classic rock, including Vince Guaraldi's "Christmas Time Is Here" (despite the fact that the movie takes place nowhere near Christmas), and my all-time favorite piece, Erik Satie's "Gymnopedie No. 1." What took some points off the board was the fact that Hackman and Paltrow light up constantly. I despise smoking in movies, but here it's barely significant in the grand scheme of things. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is a terrific film that is easily recommended for those who enjoy quirky, offbeat yet intellectual humor, or for those simply in need of a good laugh...heck, it's great viewing for any warm-blooded human being, for that matter. Not since the Family Addams has household dysfunction been so much fun. Snap, snap. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most depressing comedy ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still remember the first time I saw The Royal Tenenbaums. Principally, it was the box art that drew me in - Ben Stiller dressed in a red tracksuit with two sons wearing the same clothing? Gene Hackman raising an alcoholic drink with a cheeky smile plastered across his face? Bill Murray? Both the Wilson brothers at the same time? Surely, this would be one of the funniest films of all time, with a cast like that, how could it fail? Well I have to hand it to the art designers and the hype machine because they fooled me completely, as The Royal Tenenbaums turned out to be one of those comedies that is "off-beat," "dark" and "intelligent," but forgets to be "funny." Still, I'm a bit of a glutton for punishment some times so I sat through the entire film and was rewarded for my perseverance with over two hours of utter tedium. Worse, it is so depressing that by the time the credits started rolling, I'd found myself suffering crippling emotional pains from a vast range of personal demons that up until that moment, I wasn't aware I had.The story consists of Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), patriarch of his clan trying to re-unite the family after years of mistrust and in-fighting. He brings them all together by feigning illness and sets about trying to rekindle family loyalty, while the rest of them try to overcome their particular neuroses. Consequently, pretty much the whole film consists of uninteresting, self-obsessed New Yorkers moping around feeling sorry for themselves. Gwyneth Paltrow's character Margot for instance is depressed because...well, because she is basically. Nigh on every character has but a single facial expression for the entire duration and can you guess what that expression is? It's despair. Agonising, gut-wrenching despair.In short, this is just about the most over-hyped, self-indulgent piece of hipster rubbish I've ever seen. Hackman possesses his usual charisma but even he is not enough to save this train wreck of a comedy. The first time I saw it I thought it was more depressing than being stuck in a room with a recently-dumped teenage Goth reading poetry aloud. This week I stuck it on again just to see if I was mistaken in that judgement but nope, I was right. If anything it's got more grim with age. Comedies are meant to be funny people!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hilariously tragic" is a great way to describe this outstanding, quirky comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of what you may have heard, The Royal Tenenbaums is a comedy. Most people you may have heard it from were probably expecting another Meet the Parents, which I can assure you, it is not. It is among the quirkiest movies you're likely to see. What other word other than "quirky" can accurately describe a movie that finds bizarre humor in the lives of a complete failure of a family?The plot is always fascinating, and consistently entertaining. The three Tenenbaum children, Richie (Luke Wilson), Margot (Gweneth Paltrow), and Chas (Ben Stiller), were geniuses growing up, who each accomplished more in their childhood than most people do in their entire lives. Richie became a champion tennis player by age 17, Margot wrote plays and won a Pulitzer prize in 9th grade, and Chas, a financial expert, started a real estate company in his early teens. Unfortunately, they lacked support from their obnoxious father, Royal (Gene Hackman), and when their glory ended, the family became estranged from one another, and each of the three kids became a neurotic mess of an adult, with Margot being unhappily married to a neurologist, Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), Chas being an overprotective father to his two sons after a family tragedy, and Richie spending all his time at sea. When Royal finds out that his ex-wife, Etheline (Anjelica Huston) is contemplating marrying Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), he fakes a terminal illness, hoping to find redemption and acceptance from his estranged family. Meanwhile, a family friend, Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) is struggling with a drug problem.It's a story full of tragedy and sadness, and yet the movie manages to be hilarious. It usually seems as if the movie isn't even trying to be funny, as the tone is always kept rather dark and often gloomy. The (extremely subtle) humor is all based around sadness. Each joke ends in tragedy, and each tragedy ends in a joke. Of course, ignorant viewers won't find the film funny, and be highly disappointed. After repeated viewings, gradually becoming one of my favorite movies, this movie makes me laugh out loud frequently. But once again, despite the presence of various comedic talents (Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Bill Murray), this film is NOT like most films they're famous for, and people expecting slapstick and toilet humor will hate the film. But if you appreciate it for the strange quirk fest that it is, you'll find a lot to enjoy here.The production design is truly brilliant, and the locations are fun to look at. The props in the film are abundant, and wonderfully strange, pointless to the average moviegoer. Wes Anderson dedicates himself to making every detail of the family's weirdness fully evident, and the family's house (particularly the kid's bedrooms) is full of stuff you'd be likely to find at most European art shows, and Sky Mall magazines. Add surprisingly beautiful cinematography, and you have one of the best looking movies of our time. The performances are all brilliant as you'd expect from a Wes Anderson movie. After the critical acclaim of Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, every big name in Hollywood seems to vie for a role in one of this geniuses movies. They must really want them, as they each play their roles with dead-on brilliance, showing real emotion, and each being funny in their own subtle way. Ben Stiller, and Owen Wilson (who co-wrote the script) are great examples. While still funny in this film, they step completely out of character from their usual roles, which would have been a challenge for any other filmmaker that I can think of, or it just may be the brilliance of the script. I believe it's actually the latter. And don't even get me started with Gene Hackman... (funniest lines)...I highly recommend this to anyone who's had enough Adam Sandler/Rob Schneider for a while, and is looking for something new and original, that they can feel smart for laughing at, and give it a 10.It is rated R Some Language, Sexuality/Nudity, and Drug Content Sex: 7/10 Violence: 5/10 Swearing: 5/10 Drugs: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very memorable film.Over 4 years have passed since I saw it. And I still remember it. I remember it as the worst film I ever saw.I saw it at the cinema, alone. I watched intently, I didn't miss a thing. Even when people started getting up to leave, I stayed and maintained my focus. Believe me, it was hard keeping my eyes propped open with matchsticks. But I did it. Maybe it's coz I paid 8pounds and I wanted to get my money's worth. Maybe it's coz I had nothing else to do. Maybe I had faith in the cast and the HYPE. So I stayed. And I waited. I waited for something to happen. And I was still waiting when the credits started rolling.I was close to suicide as I left the cinema.You want to laugh? Reading this is gonna give you more laughs than that God-awful sorry pathetic excuse for a movie.I've been reading reviews by people who enjoyed the film. All I see is praise for the soundtrack, the sets, the "theme". What? Praise for the acting. Who cares about the acting when there is no script? The comments are as meaningless to me as the film. Silly, pretentious, without any genuine substance or feel. Dry and cold and utterly fabricated. No plot, no story. No laughs, no tears, no excitement, no emotions, nothing. The film never connected with me. I feel like I need some sort of umbilical cord to force feed what's so special about this film into me.I'd love to talk more about this memorable film but.. there's nothing to talk about. You might as well sit in front of a potato and watch it for 2 hours, hoping it'll turn into potato salad or french fries. But no, it just stays a boring fat potato.I wasted 8pounds and 2 hours of my life on it. I feel completely cheated. Learn from my mistake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Anderson's previous work "Rushmore", "Tenenbaums" got tons of hype, and raves as being "groundbreaking" and "brilliant". I can't really see what the fuss is about. As a comedy, Tenenbaums simply didn't make me laugh. At all. I didn't even know what I was supposed to laugh at. As a drama, the story was mildly interesting. The characters were pretty flat, though, and really didn't do anything to make care a bit what happened to them.Great actors, especially the always great Huston, and Luke Wilson had some moments. Gwenyth Paltrow has depth, but again, in this film her character seemed one-dimensional. All I can guess, is that like the music of Tenacious D, and the films of Guy Ritchie, the hipsters amongst us have decided that Wes Anderson is cool, and his material is vague enough that these people can claim that there's more going on than actually is.There isn't. Zoolander is 10 times the comedy this thing is. I'm giving it a 4 to offset the dopes that gave it a 10. 6 is probably more fair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen and enjoyed 'Bottle Rocket' and 'Rushmore' I was really looking forward to 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. The previews made the picture out to be a comedy.After seeing 'The Royal Tenenbaums' I can't help thinking to myself 'why is this movie receiving any positive reviews at all? Is it me? Am I missing something?'I would not even recommend to people that they wait for the video to see this movie. My only recommendation would be; not to see it at all.The only humour in this movie takes place in the preview.Bill Murray is wasted as Ms. Paltrow's husband. I couldn't help thinking from his and Gwyneth's expressions that a funeral was about to break out around them. Ben Stiller has never been unfunnier (I know ?unfunnier' is not really a word). He seems shorter in this movie (can't blame the director for that I suppose). The recurring Dalmatian mouse gag is annoying, unfunny, and too obvious. When the movie focused on the relationship between Danny Glover and Anjelica Huston, it was even more boring than the other boring parts in the movie.?Rushmore' and ?Bottle Rocket' were clever and witty. 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is neither. Are peculiar characters alone funny? Anderson and Wilson seem to think so.By the end of the movie you really don't care what happens to the characters, you just want to get out of theatre and start warning people not to see this movie.I know people will disagree with my views regarding this movie, and so be it. But if you read this and go see the movie, you can't say Johnny Chill didn't try to warn you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't hate many movies, but this one comes close.Only Gene Hackman rescues this from rating a 1. In short, you might like it if you haven't seen many good movies, or if you're not expecting something very interesting.Simply put, a good cast is truly wasted in this dreadful and boring film, which is full of itself, full of sledgehammer social commentary, and full of all-too-cliched sentimental nastiness which passes for intellect and wit.And yeah--I do "get it." "It"--the contrived quirkiness, supposedly humorous morbidity and lightweight darkness inherent in the dramatic situation, the irony poured on as delicately and thickly as corn syrup over premixed pancakes--"it" you can't miss if you stay awake during the movie and have been alive past 20!Yikes! What a simply terrible follow-up to the precocious Rushmore (though can't we all agree now, after Lost in Translation, that even Rushmore owes more to Bill Murray's performance than to Wes Anderson's intermittent genius?).With the exception of Hackman's scenes misbehaving with his grandchildren--which are absolutely great and all too brief--the whole thing is about as interesting as watching lint. Make that "pretentious lint" :)In truth, Anderson may be a great director (he certainly hasn't created anything that would put him into my handful of choices yet) and Owen Wilson may be a great actor (ditto handful of great actors), despite his recent career trajectory. But neither of them are accomplished enough writers to pull this comedy of dysfunction off, and it shows all too obviously here.So is it fair to blame Wilson and Anderson for not being, say, Charlie Kaufman here? Yeah, I think so--they just can't write their way out of this mess--they write into it instead, if you get my drift, without really exploring anything new or interesting.So while all of the surface marks of literacy are shown again and again in the film(and played up all-too-ostentatiously), they all remain on the surface.And even a surface comedy or satire would be OK if the film was all farce or signaled its own problems. In the end, though, it asks us to believe that its own meanness is somehow insightful--not parody at all. And that's the final slap across the face to an audience--look how stupid we all are, taking these ciphers seriously! Wink, wink... In fact, nothing resonates here except how embarrassing this will all look in 10 years :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had all the best intentions of enjoying this film, as I have always admired the talent of Wes Anderson. That said, I can only state that as black comedies go, this isn't even beige. Did anyone tell Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson their screenplay was just plain boring? Mr. Anderson perhaps had something else in mind when he thought about this project. The idea of a dysfunctional family sounds great, but in the treatment of the material on screen, it doesn't materialize. It's about one of the dullest films of the year, in spite of the overblown praise from all critics toward this movie, which does not come up to Mr. Anderson's previous directing efforts.It's a shame because of all the talent amassed in this picture. The best thing in it is Gene Hackman. He is an actor that's always interesting to watch. His Royal Tenenbaum is not a fully formed character, but I would pay to see Mr. Hackman read from the Yellow Pages any time rather than to see him in a misguided attempt at comedy.Gwyneth Paltrow character is bo-ring. And so are the brothers Wilson, and Ben Stiller. Angelica Houston is very dignified in her role, but you don't believe for a nanosecond that after what she went through with Royal, she would walk to the altar ever again. Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman, who were so incredible in Rushmore don't have anything to do here. The narrative device is sophomoric at best. So the best advice to all the fans is to wait until it comes out in DVD. Who knows, it might even play better....</fullReview>

I really do think that sometimes its a case of emperors new clothes, some highbrow critics star saying how wonderfully clever and dark this film is and then when people start agreeing with them they probably snigger behind our backs. I have never left a film early but my god I wanted to in this one, this and unbreakable two lousy films praised across the board and I have no idea why.

There are some very off-beat, "arty" films that I enjoy a great deal. This was not one of them, though. To me, it was "okay", but certainly not great. The humor was very subtle. I got most of the "jokes" (or humorous aspects, really, more than jokes) that people have mentioned, but they just weren't all that funny, to me. Maybe I actually sympathized with the characters too much; the humor was overwhelmed by the sadness of their situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had almost forgotten about this movie over the last few years and then I watched it again on Sunday night and was instantly reminded how much I enjoyed this film. The cast is brilliant and whoever chose the actors deserves a round of applause. Bill Murray alone would have made this a good movie. I'm a huge Gene Hackman fan and he and Anjelica Huston have great chemistry. Danny Glover plays an excellent rival to Gene Hackman. Ben Stiller and the Wilson brothers show they have real acting skills and can do more than comedy. I don't normally like Gwyneth Paltrow but this is an exception and she shines as Margot Tenenbaum. Pagoda was a memorable character as well. This film went past the cliché family movies with everyone getting along in the end. The Royal Tenenbaums has heart and wit. The eccentricities Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson gave their characters helped me connect with them as human beings while making them hilarious. Wes Anderson should be proud. He made a film that people can watch again and again and still find enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would guess that if you enjoyed "Amelie" &amp;/or "Little Miss Sunshine" you'd enjoy this a whole lot too, for it contains similar elements to one or the other work when not both: in-depth studies of unusual characters and relationships,dark humour, great storyline, script, acting and music track and last but best, gorgeous visuals! Whatever film stock it was shot on produced rich, muted, luminous reds, which underscored a delightful conceit: that of the leitmotif red object (bag, padlock, hair-slide, whatever) in about 80% of the shots, right to the end, to the lipstick-red Mercedes.But more than this, what blew me away was the result of the painstaking set-up of nearly every shot in terms of the particular palette of colours and textures used, rendering even the mundane (chain-link fence, weathered paintwork, urban roof-scape, building site)things of beauty. I have enjoyed many films for the other elements referred to in the first paragraph, but it is a long time since I was so seduced by a series of such delicious compositions (some almost iconic, like Paltrow's character in front of the green buses). In fact, it would have been "Valerie and Her Week of Wonders" (a Czech film from 1970) that last hit that particular spot. There are too many examples of these set-piece frames to list from the Tenenbaums, but I want a copy of the film, not only to enjoy again as a deeply satisfying tragi-comic drama,but as a visual reference work and as a feast for the eyes.I've spent time rattling on about this aspect of the film, because no-one seems to have drawn attention to it and yet I think it adds immeasurably to the overall "feel" of the piece, but hey, maybe I'd had a couple of glasses of wine too many? (actually, probably more of a stoned thing, but then I don't do that any more - too risky!).Many of the other reviews are right on the money in terms of synopsis and critique, so there's no point in my duplicating these, but there's my two-pennyworth in respect of an element that might sometimes be overlooked, in spite of it being right there in front of us!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... so if you're a confirmed fan, "Tenenbaums" bears the hallmarks of a familiar style. Myself, I don't find it too accessible because his characters all decidedly inhabit their own particular universe. I found "Rushmore" and "The Life Aquatic" to be at the very least 'watchable' (I rate both 6/10... ) but I think the problem I had with TRT is that the two other films I mentioned had 'oddball' characters where you wouldn't expect to find them; a dysfunctional family unit is bound to have its unique members, because that's WHY they're dysfunctional! Family conflict isn't exactly a fresh theme, it's been done many times, so in the end it just felt like an excuse for the Wilsons to gather together their actor mates and get purposefully 'wacky'...Why not try crafting some characters I can actually relate to, for a change? Anderson's films always seem far too willing to metaphorically pat themselves on the back at the earliest opportunity...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kids in Animal Costumes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I probably should like this more than I do. I value filmmakers who do something unique in terms of narrative placement, who enlist their actors to the same end they see (a rare thing), and who cleverly employ self-reference. But the tone is too flat for me, and the mechanics too visibly artificial. But those mechanics are expertly engineered:1). Engineered Self-referential Irony. the creating duo on this film want to make flat, simple comic-book episodes. As literally designs on royal playing cards. That's a matter of design. In recognition of this, they decide to make their approach a specific part of the film: Margot's plays are a mirror of what this is: kids in animal costumes with no character development. She has a dry period (actually wet, in a bathtub) and then after the action of this film, writes it as a play, which is presumably what we see.Richie, who has always loved her, also wishes to be an artist. We see his art: it is also representative of the film's deliberate style: sketchy, minimal, `folk art.' This is the same art that illustrates the book we see that titles episodes. In other words, the film is Margot's words and Richie's pictures. The actual writers tell us this is their style.2). Engineered Casting. This is filmmaking in the Altman/PT Anderson tradition, but not as skillful. In this philosophy, you sketch a story thinly and let your actors find their characters and chemistry. It is all in the casting. And I must admire the skill with which this cast is engineered. Hackman is a type of actor that finds all his characters within himself. Which makes him `natural,' but has the undesired effect of always showing the same avuncular dope. All the men actors are of this internal type. They are always letting you know that they are acting, sometimes winking.The women! Angelica Huston is one of the most intelligent actress working. She is not a glamourgirl so doesn't get many roles. But she so far outclasses Hackman, it is the source of an in joke. I have no doubt that Hackman has no clue, and probably wouldn't care if he knew he was being goofed on.Gwyneth is growing as a real actress -- not like any of these guys -- someone who reaches outside for someone and adapts her soul. In this, you can visibly see her taking Huston's lead. This was a very clever choice which pays off well in the one central scene: after the suicide attempt in the tent with Richie. She's the writer, its clear.I saw Gwyneth do something similar in "Duets," a similar unconstrained situation. Its what you come up with when the director is weak that really shows who you are. She may become someone that matters. We can hope.And the narrator! This fantasy is of the type pioneered for the masses by Tim Burton. So we get it framed by the Beetlejuice guy.3). Engineered Music. Here's the most skilled part of the construction: All the music is old, from the 60s-70s. Beatles, Stones, Dylan, Morrison. Including a really cool insertion: the `Pat Garrett' theme, `Knocking on Heaven's Door.' One song from `Satanic Majesty's.' This stuff is from such a far away era (I hate to say) that it adds to the pretend nature of the skit.</fullReview>

The characters are the real juicy morsels in this visual pudding, however - each is as complex, contradictory and downright fascinating as you or I.

		<shortDescription>Independent film fan's heaven; but it also uses good characterisation and narrative to keep everyone else entertained.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A true friend stabs you in the front." Oscar Wilde.It seems people like to label this film 'quirky'; a word that doesn't complement a film and one that doesn't quite criticise it either. In this sense, quirky might be a good adjective to use to describe The Royal Tenenbaums but it's so much more than just that. The film was the third from Wes Anderson; a man who is perhaps rather quickly embedding himself somewhat as an auteur when it comes to film-making ? his most recent effort The Darjeeling Limited was also of the 'quirky' and off the wall style. But The Royal Tenenbaums is more than a film merely advertising a director/writer as the next Kevin Smith; it is a journey down an independent route that although isn't great; is certainly enjoyable and showcases what Anderson likes doing the most: playing with conventions most of us will have become accustomed to.Like every film, The Royal Tenenbaums uses its opening twenty-five minutes to set the scene but what a scene to set. I feel most people will either switch off before the opening half an hour; failing to keep their interest levels above a set standard whereas others will let the film roll on, the majority of which will afterwards claim it 'genius'. I appreciate what Anderson is doing here, as I could with The Darjeeling Limited but this is not a great film despite making us think and forcing us to observe everything on screen. The film makes, in my opinion, an early mistake by flashing over past major events in a way that will make us feel sorry for certain characters once the present tense takes over. Another film that made this error was recent Spanish effort 'Volver' which wanted us to feel an emotion within the first thirty minutes or so as characters suffer epiphanies over events that took place before the film's time. The Royal Tenenbaums does this when the narrator exclaims 'everyone was in the same house for the first time in 19 years.' Now, I suppose that's supposed to be a really big deal and it's supposed to make us 'feel' something; because I certainly would if it happened to me in real life, however; when it's just happened to a bunch of film characters I know nothing about then there is no reaction.This is, however; pretty much the only major problem I had with the film. Like Volver, I will remark here that this would've worked brilliantly had we had a film pre-showing these events hence The Royal Tenenbaums would've acted as a fantastic sequel as we would've now known everyone. But the film remains an entertaining and mildly amusing romp that announces itself as independent and never turns back in embarrassment. Anderson spreads his characters around this small filmic space and spends enough time showing us and building up an audience-character relation with each of them; royally shedding any protagonist or antagonist tag a character may inherit. It's worth saying here that the narrator is not in the film; in fact any of the film's character could have easily doubled up as the narrator thus ruining the idea of whose point of view this is told from: everything is being said as it happened, by someone neutral. The film is actually told aurally with apparent pages from a book popping up now and again as the film enters a new 'chapter'. This does not drag the film toward any fairytale tag (since often when a narrator tells a story they aren't involved in, it's a fairytale) but complements the film's breakaway approach.Instead, Anderson takes time to develop his characters in a very meaningful and enlightening way. Richie Tenenbaum (L. Wilson) is a disgraced ex-tennis player who obviously fell out of love with the game (yet still wears the tennis gear rather casually); Chas (Stiller) is an overprotective parent to his two sons; Margot (Paltrow) is the secretly disgraced daughter whose reckless life is kept secret and Royal (Hackman) and Etheline (Huston) are the parents whom couldn't quite work it out. Anderson has put a great deal of thought into these characters and not only shows us who's what but subtly tells us through body language and clothing what they're really like. Chaz is always wearing red and thus seems angry most of the time while Richie wears yellow and seems more at ease with everyone since yellow is a very calm colour. Likewise, getting back the apparent tennis equipment 'goof'; Richie only really removes it when he cuts his beard and his hair in an event that will no doubt count as a spoiler. After this very disturbing and well shot scene, the tennis equipment disappears as he has confronted his demons and is now, I suppose, liberated from his giving up of the game.Anderson sets up his compositions well: Margot is always in the background, hovering; perhaps detached from everyone else when the entire family is in shot. We discover what we need to know about Etheline's relationship; Royal's condition and Margot's past as well as everything else at preciously the right time in the final third whereas we remain interested up until this point due to good characterisation and that feeling of 'Who the hell are these people, exactly?' Make no mistake, Anderson has made a good film here with enough going on to warrant a watch and with enough brains to keep you perhaps noticing something new each time. Not many films these days can stand up and be able to say that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since the critical and commercial success of "Rushmore" (1998), Wes Anderson became a promising and talented director. He's even nicknamed "Hollywood's new prodigy". So three years after "Rushmore", he released a new movie: "The Royal Tenenbaums" (2001).This movie's got a whacky script (the Tenenbaums are all gifted) full of zany ideas and powerful cues: "he's not your father" says Gene Hackman to Gwyneth Paltrow about Danny Glover, "Neither you" she replies. But this on the level of the directing that Anderson's talent shines: it turns out to be inventive, clever and we can notice that he favors two devices: static shots and tracking shots. Moreover, it's obvious that Anderson put a lot of effort into the esthetic side of the movie: bright colors have been used on the sceneries and they're enhanced by a luminous photography. With all these advantages, "The Royal Tenenbaums" is a movie full of light and life.But in parallel, I thought that the performances were of varying quality: if Gene Hackman and Ben Stiller dominate the cast, on the other hand, Anjelica Huston and especially Gwyneth Paltrow make the movie a bit dull. Besides, her wild look annoyed me during nearly all the movie. I preferred her in "the talented Mr Ripley" (1999). Moreover, given that she's a playwright, could she be Max Fischer's distant cousin? (Max Fischer was the hero of "Rushmore" and in his spare time, he wrote plays too).Then, I think I didn't understand one sequence: this is the last one when all the members of the Tenenbaum family are gathered to attend Hackman's funeral. What do they feel? Happiness? Sadness? Indifference? Wes Anderson doesn't really reveal us the members' feelings about this dramatic event.Although, I don't really regard Wes Anderson as a genius,I'm obliged to recognize that he's got talent to produce movies which can be both funny and wit. So, once again: "the royal Tenenbaums", a good movie? Definitely. A masterpiece? No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only a truly horrible movie would compel me to get online and write a review. Congratulations to this absolutely awful film for inspiring me to do so.What a waste of celluloid!This tedious movie, which seems to go on forever, has not one laugh in it, not one single character that anyone could care about, and a story line that would be embarrassing if written by 8 year-olds.Plain and simply this movie sucks. It is, by far, the single worst film of 2001.Furthermore, the obvious ploy of selling a sound-track throughout the flick, only further annoyed me.I almost walked out and in hindsight wish that I had</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a load of crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What on earth is this crap? Was there supposed to be some sort of deep meaning or insight? Was this supposed to be a comedy? The cast was very impressive and I love most things that they do (except for Ben Stiller) and I watch a broad range of cinema from around the world, judging each film on its own merits, not matter the genre or style. But this was utterly pointless and boring junk; and I am amazed that so many people rave on about how good it was. I regard it as a perfect of example of a strong cast failing to produce a good film.And I am still waiting to see a film with Ben Stiller that I actually like!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`Different' comedy that uses it's quirks well to produce a wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Royal and Etheline O'Rielly raised three children to be child prodigies. However years later we find that all the children have fallen on hard times since their father left. Royal Tenebaum hears that his wife has been proposed to by another man and resolves to get involved in his family's life again with the support of his son Richie.Marketed as a sort of laugh a minute comedy I did feel a little tricked by this. However I never once felt cheated by this. Instead I was quite glad that I had been able to see something that is intelligent, funny, dark and yet totally off the wall. The story is told in story book fashion, with narrator Alec Baldwin talking us through the start of some scenes. The story starts years ago and then jumps to find all the characters messed up. The story is quite straight and downbeat. However the characters are so quirky that you can't help but get involved. Instead of hackneyed messages or points this story lets you decide yourself.The writing is superb. Instead of clumsy comedy this is clever ? full of witty clever dialogue and physical humour that doesn't take away form the story by being silly. The writing manages to keep us involved in a story that could have been far-fetched with characters far too quirky to exist. Anderson also excels in direction ? at times it all feels a little too stylised, but for the most part it works well. His soundtrack is different ? but is very well used.There is so much good to say about this that I don't know where to end. The cast is excellent with Hackman being the standout ? the only criticism being that some of the actors have little to do, Murray in particular is underused. Even the dread Paltrow is good here. Of course you can't hide talent ? and the Wilson brothers shine throughout.Of course it is very slow and feels a bit stilted at times. The comedy is dark rather than consistently laugh out loud funny, but there is still plenty for the multiplex generation to laugh at. The dark tone also is a little unsettling and some of the characters are hard to get involved with, and some of the symbolism is difficult to get (the whole thing with the bird feels corny and confused).However these are minor complaints. It's not one of the best films ever made but it's different, funny, clever and thoughtful ? that's good enough for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reinvest Your Time with the Tenenbaums</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow?All other dysfunctional family movies, including the serious ones, are put to shame. None are as crazy as 'The Royal Tenenbaums.' This movie is wildly original, wonderfully scripted, hilarious, well-performed, has a great soundtrack and score and is touching in an odd but satisfying way. Admittedly, I didn't like it the first time I saw it years ago, but thanks to a friend, I reinvested my time with the Tenenbaums. I'm glad I did. It's not a movie I want to watch over and over, but it's one I enjoyed tremendously this time around. Though, I will say, what we know today ? concerning a suicide attempt, it's probably hard to see the OTHER brother going through with it fictionally. Thankfully, real or not, it all worked out. Check in with the Tenenbaums. 4?/5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Royal Tenenbaums Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film in my college as a class project, and I went into The Royal Tenenbaums knowing almost nothing about the film, and after watching it, if I were to sum it up in one word, it would be; "Amazing!".From start to finish this film kept me both interested in each of the characters story line and entertained.For me personally, my favourite genre of film is 'mumblecore', and although not directly being a 'mumblecore' film, it defiantly set the standard for future films such as 'Little Miss Sunshine'.The greatest scene in the film I think is when Richie Tenenbaum attempts to commit suicide, while Elliott Smith's "Needle in the Hay" is playing over the scene.Overall, I think Wes Anderson did an great job on this film. I loved every scene, every song, and every story line, but, I think the first and second acts of the film were better than the third act, as, to me, it felt very out of place compared to the start, and while watching it, I was left wonder where the plot would go after The Tenenbaums find that Royal dying was a hoax, but I still enjoyed it overall.My recommendation would be if you haven't seen it, give it a watch but go into the film expecting a funny yet dark picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Royal Tennenbaums DIRECTED BY WES ANDERSONThe Good:GENE HACKMAN It takes a truly superb actor to play Royal Tennenbaum, a man who liesto his family, ignores them, demands their attention, constantly remindshis daughter she's adopted, breaks his family up, puts them in dangerous situations, and still manages to merit our undoubted sympathy.Luke WilsonA quite depressed character, the opposite of his brother. Luke proves to be an actor with some real talent unlike Owen.Gwyenth PaltrowGwyenth Paltrow has done some performances that didn't require muchacting talent, this however is not one of them. This is a dark characterwhich adds to the more realistically humorous side to the film.The Film ItselfThere's a great blend of humor in this, subtle humor, slapstick humor,black humor and witty humor. Each actor contributes to one of those certain categorizes. Wes Anderson uses great camera-work and cuts tokeep us involved and entertained. The darker and more realistic situationsmade the film more memorable than the absurd unrealistic situations. The sets are greatly detailed, especially the scene in the closet. However the best part of The Royal Tennenbaums is without a doubt the perfect cast.The Bad:Owen WilsonHe was over the top in his fairly uncomical portrayal of Eli Cash. I felt Owen Wilson's job in the film was to draw in a more mainstream audience that would come to see Owen Wilson films.Ben StillerThe character Ben Stiller played was unrealistic, over-dramatic and stereotypical. He's not a likable character, but neither was Royal Tennenbaum but if Ben Stiller was half the actor Gene Hackmanwas he could've made us sympathize him. He didn't.The Film ItselfOne part of this film that brings it down a little are the unrealistic situations. There's a fine line between an over-the-top situation that's funny and an over-the-top situation that's funny because you're stillin a state of confusion. There are a few parts in The Royal Tennenbaums that are an Olympic-gold-medal-of-a jump over that fine line. Another problem with this film is the originality of the concept. A comedy about a large semi-dysfunctional family has beendone many a time. But not necessarily as well as this.The Ugly:Billy Murray's BeardWhat more is there to say?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warm-Hearted Peek Into Human Imperfections</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A quirky film about family dysfunction in that distinctly quirky style that only Wes Anderson can pull off.Gene Hackman and Anjelica Huston play the parents of a collection of child prodigies, all estranged from one another and all reunited for a common cause. The fun, as with most Anderson movies, is in watching the talented cast of actors create eccentric, troubled characters that the actors and the script clearly adore. The film pokes fun of its characters, but it laughs with them instead of at them, which is a crucial difference that makes Anderson's movies glow with humanity and warmth and separates them from mean-spirited movies about human oddities churned out by filmmakers like the Coen Brothers.Nothing will ever make me forget the hilarious image of Ben Stiller and his sons in matching track suits practicing fire drills.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must-See Recommendation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is, in my humble opinion, an example of a great movie. I watched it for the first time a few days ago, and could not stop thinking about it. So much, in fact, that I watched it again the next day, and enjoyed it just as much, if not more.The plot takes a while to get going, but the opening scene and introduction are cleverly hilarious, giving you a look inside the life and childhood of the Tenenbaums. Characters such as: Eli Cash (Owen Wilson), Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), Dudley Heinsberger (Stephen Lea Sheppard), and Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), are used sparingly, but seem to make the movie complete.The background of each character is so unique, yet hilarious, with Richie (Luke Wilson) being a tennis-star, Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) being an extraordinary playwright, and Chas (Ben Stiller) being a mice breeder business extrodinare. Then, to top it all off, you have Royal (Gene Hackmen) who is the king of the deadbeats.The movie is tremendously well-made, down to the flashes to pictures of books or pictures to show past events or the different chapter of the book pages to symbolize the start of a new "act", if you will. The music is spot-on, almost making the movie, and the narration is done perfectly by Alec Baldwin.The movie, in my opinion, was very good up until the last scene with Richie, in which it became a great movie. For spoiler sake, I will not discuss this scene, just that it is a pivotal part in the movie and has quickly became one of my favorite movie scenes of all time. It was exceptionally well made and deserves more recognition.I would recommend The Royal Tenenbaums to anyone who has not scene it. It is packed with an All-Star cast, one of which each character brings something different to the table. It is hilarious at times, and at others sad and seeming more to the drama genre. In other words, it is a hard movie to explain, with no real genre, in my opinion, but it was one that deserves to be seen by movie lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great mix of comedy and drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer-director Wes Anderson knows how to amazingly mix the comedy and drama and have it work. But it isn't a laugh out loud kind of comedy. Anderson's work is funny, but it is much more smarter than most comedies and fits in the realm of smart comedies like the works of Woody Allen and Alexander Payne.Gene Hackman shows that can do some comedy as Royal, a man who finds out he is dying but doesn't know how to tell his family. Hackman plays each scene really well in making us feel for Royal Tenenbaum. I don't think any other actor can play this role like Hackman does.His children are played wonderfully by Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Rounding out the rest of the supporting cast are Bill Murray, Anjelica Huston, and Danny Glover.This movie is well worth a watch if you are a fan of Wes Anderson or want to see some serious performances from Ben Stiller or the Wilson brothers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite a touching movie. Some may find it awfully slow to begin with, and I'd include myself there, but, as it goes on, the interest levels are bound to boost up. Its a story of how a man, who's never really cared about his family, sort of atones for his wrongs, to help his family out of their misery. The long and short of it is that it's quite a different movie, one which might not have broken all sorts of records at the box office, or might not be cherished by many a people as their favorite movie, but I liked it, for it instills in the viewers, a real nice attitude towards life, and even in a sad ending, it ends on a positive note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second Time Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not like "The Royal Tenenbaums" the first time I saw it. It was subdued... so subdued you could call it muted, or even boring. There were no whip-crack punchlines... there were no outrageous revelations or shocking plot twists. The first time I saw the film all I could see was what was missing. It was like browsing through the pages of a novel before I learned to read.After falling in love with "The Darjeeling Limited," another of Wes Anderson's films, I decided to give "Royal" a second viewing, and it was an entirely different movie. "Darjeeling" familiarized me with Anderson's cinematic language and style, and now that I knew what to expect I saw everything in "Royal" I missed the first time... it was a rich, emotionally satisfying experience... and a much better movie.Gene Hackman is Royal Tenenbaum, the no-good father who all but abandoned his highly-intelligent, highly-sensitive children and wife. He comes back into their disastrous, fractured lives in an attempt to repair some of the damage. Hackman's performance is the heart of the picture, as he walks the fine line between being lovable and rotten with the grace that has become his trademark. I can't say enough great things about Gene Hackman... you know an actor is magic when everyone in the world is in complete agreement about his abilities. He's crisp and dense in dramas and painfully funny in comedies... in this movie he demonstrates just how artfully he can navigate between the two styles and how many subtle levels he's found in between. There's only one word for brilliant.The tragic childhoods of the three Tenenbaum children is told with a sincerity and commitment to detail that can only be known by someone who has experienced such pain themselves. Maybe this is Wes Anderson's genius... this and the fact that he seems to refuse to pass judgment on any of these troubled, sometimes bizarre characters. It would be so easy to portray the Tenenbaum children as spoiled brats who never got over Daddy leaving, but never once did I feel anything but genuine concern for their traumatic upbringing... in spite of the fact that the "children" are now in their mid-thirties Anderson is able to present them as the x-rays of the broken little boy or lost little girl inside. They aren't people so much as raw wounds unable to heal... and so the movie is really a character study as we watch Royal try to atone for his past.The movie is not perfect... one of the plot-lines deals with Richie Tenenbaum's tortured romantic love for his adopted sister Margot, a cinematic storyline that is all but impossible to resolve. The agreement they make in order to move on with their lives still feels like a cop-out to me. Owen Wilson's character is not fully developed... he may be a case of one kook too many... and Anjelica Huston's Etheline doesn't seem to have a flaw.But this is nitpicking... "The Royal Tenenbaums" is ultimately a great movie because it delivers genuine sadness and actual joy without resorting to a single studio cliché. I was forced to acknowledge the imperfection of the characters in the movie, the imperfection of human beings, while still being moved to tears by the realization of what had been accomplished. I don't get emotional at many movies- check my other reviews- but there is truth here, and beauty, and there's no avoiding it.I'm pretty sure that's why I started going to movies in the first place.GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky and highly original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson has been the face of a new brand of comedy ever since he burst onto the scene in 1996 with Bottle Rocket. He further established himself with the 1998 hit Rushmore. The Royal Tenenbaums is considered by many to be his finest work and it is kind of hard to dispute that. This is a rich, complex movie dealing with multiple characters that all suffer from serious trouble in one way or another. Gene Hackman plays the father of a family that was once quite prominent in the world of geniuses. The oldest son Chas was a successful real estate dealer, daughter Margot became a famous playwright in the ninth grade, and youngest son Richie went on to become a great tennis player. Still, all their talent couldn't keep their father from leaving them, and now he returns to see them because he tells them he is dying.This movie works, but not as easily as some other comedies. Being a Wes Anderson movie, the humor here is very dry and there are multiple scenes when you will ask yourself if you should be sad, angry, or laugh at the characters. The look of the movie is remarkable and it perfectly matches the feeling of each character. The acting is tremendous, especially by Hackman, as well as Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, and Angelica Huston. The whole movie is filled with weird and quirk situations, yet it all makes sense somehow. The story gives us these people and their problems and we watch as they try to piece their life back together after being apart for so long. If you are a fan of Wes Anderson, you owe it to yourself to see this. If you aren't, it still is worth seeing, but give it some time. Watching it a second time really helped me understand the characters and the story better. It may do the same for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging and brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson is a director I don't want to be seen talking about but this film by him, THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS. A comedy that isn't a comedy and a film turned inside out. One of the weirdest and most interesting films I've seen and could be a re-birth of 1964's DR. STRANGELOVE (in terms of the comedy of course).Royal Tenenbaum and his wife Ethleine are parents to Richie, Margot and Chas. Chas is a child genius who is heavily involved with real estate and finance and knows it inside out. Margot is a playwright and Richie is a tennis professional, winning the US Nationals three years in a row. When Royal and Ethleine separate, everything goes downhill. Royal looses the respect he deserves from his family, well so he feels (especially for Chas, whom he feels doesn't appreciate him at all). Royal then fakes a heart attack so all members of the broken family and get together to spend time together and re-bond as he fakes his sickness. The whole film is one speechless outcome.Gene Hackman (whom I fondly remember from THE FRENCH CONNECTION) takes on a very unexpected role as the bumbly Royal, Angelica Houston plays his Etheliene, the woman who left him and goes to have an affair with another man. Gwyneth Paltrow takes on the role of Margot, the character who is secretive and some what a loner. Ben Stiller goes on for the part of Chas, the over-protective parent of Ari and Uri, his two sons. There are certainly many more people who are credited for this film but these few actors made the film how special it is in terms of comedy.Director Wes Anderson did something with the genre of comedy I can't even explain. He twisted it in such away, it doesn't even become comedy. It's plain quirky and weird but I guess, this is what makes the film an eye-opener, it questions how hard do you intend to respect comedy?? Loved this film and though many might not like, for those who do, we certainly speak the same language. Throughly recommended anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is a film that needs to be seen several times over. I have done just that and reason is that there seems to be layers to the film and its characters that you just don't get the first time you see it.The Royal Tenenbaums is the chronicle of the Tenenbaum family consisting of the patriarch Royal (Gene Hackman), the matriarch Etheline (Anjelica Houston) and their three genius children - two sons Chas (Ben Stiller) and Richi (Luke Wilson) and an adopted daughter Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow). Chas is fitness-obsessed international financial wizard, Richi is a born athlete who has won numerous US National Tennis champions trophy and Margot is an avid reader and playwright who won a substantial prize for a school play. Richi's best friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) lives in the building next to the Tenenbaum's place and is more or less a part of the family.The story begins with Royal announcing to his young children that he is separating from the her and moving out of the family home to respect their mother's request. Overt the next 20 years all traces of genius of the Tenenbaum children is lost to Royal's abandonment of the family and several other events. Chas is still the financial wizard but has lost his wife dies in a plane crash. Richi (a.k.a The Baumer) has retired from professional tennis and Margot is married to an intellectual Raliegh St.Claire. Eli becomes a bestselling author.Chas is having a nervous breakdown after his wife's death which affects his two sons and their dog. Richi has retired from competitive tennis because of an on-field meltdown and is traveling around the globe on an ocean-liner and is visibly depressed. Margot's marriage to Raleigh is suffering. Eli's behavior is strange and Richi suspects that Eli has a drug habit.This is the information that the narrative (excellent voice over work by Alec Baldwin) provides us in the first 15 minutes or so of the film. That's the signature of the entire film - the reasons why each character is the way he/she is is provided slowly but surely in the dialogs and the narration.When I mentioned that every time you watch the movie, you will learn is that Etheline's character is very important and the first time you watch the movie the gravitas of the character is not quite revealed. She is the anchor of the family - the one dependable person in the family that everyone turns to. Even though Eli is not really family he keeps sending clippings of his work to Etheline to get some encouragement. When I watch this film I always think of an old Robin Williams movie - The World According to Garp. The story has strange twists, but draws the viewer to the sadness, loneliness, frustration and desperation that each of the characters feel and remains very sympathetic to each characters.The direction is top-notch none of the scenes are melodramatic, acting remains very believable. The normally over-exuberant Ben Stiller turns in a very solid performance. The depressed and heart broken Luke Wilson's Richi is by far the most humane character - he understands the pain that his siblings, parents, friends are going through and is always sympathetic to all of them, giving them another chance, never judging them realizing that he could be let down by them as in the past. Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent in her portrayal of the secretive Margot. Bill Murray's turn as the husband loosing his wife to reasons he dosen't understand and through no fault of his is very touching. Anjelica Houston's Etheline as the pragmatic, self-sacrificing Rock Of Gibraltor of the Tenenbaum family is the most understated performance of the entire cast. Danny Glover's Henry is not really developed to a great extent but he executes the role with great sensitivity to the pain of Etheline's children and understandably great distrust towards Royal. Finally, Gene Hackman as Royal, the brash, irascible, insensitive, conceited man who does not care for his family is excellent.All in all and excellent if script aided by equally great direction and excellent acting by a top notch cast making this a great movie experience.Trivia: I am sure I am not the only one who has noticed it, but every chapter in the movie always begins with Royal and how his actions affect the character of the chapter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragically Witty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS This film was profoundly melancholy. The subtle elements of comedy juxtaposed with the desperation of the characters such as Margot, Raleigh, Richie and Chas added equally to the humour and sorrow. Margot's frankness about being adopted/left out was an amusing trait to her character, but only exposed the sadness she felt; at her failed marriages, at her Faux family set up and the disappointment she faced at the hands of her marriage with Raleigh. But equally, and also brilliantly, I found myself saddened by the mismatch of she and Raleigh; neither of them were bad characters/people, they just needed things in each other that weren't there. All characters were superficially ruined by other members of their family, but ultimately it was their own insecurities which lead to the desperate situations they were in.Gene Hackman was extremely vibrant compared to the rest of the cast (excluding perhaps Owen Wilson and at times, Ben Stiller), but he in no way outshone anyone. I anticipated Richie to be irritating at first. The role of 'Tennis Champ' sounded off-putting, and regrettably I took to him with a closed mind. However, it was that facade which created a striking contrast between his inner and outer self. The way in which he embraced his father, tried to keep the peace, loved Margot for so long and attempted to forget her by selflessly going out to sea to avoid complicating matters. It was the moment he said "I'm going to kill myself tomorrow", which demonstrated a manifestation of all his complexities and longings. One would usually find characters such as Chas annoying; the overbearing strait laced father. But once again, character development allows the audience to put aside stereotypes, lending weight to the equal roles each family members had in the demise of the different relationships, and subsequently the re-union of them. Every moment with "cringe" potential managed to beautifully side step any clichés, embarrassment, or predictability; I was rooting for Margot and Richie to be united after his suicide attempt, for Chas and Royal to reconcile and even for Eli to overcome his emotional and chemical issues.Even the smaller characters such as Pagoda weren't there for mere tokens of humour; we see his loyalty to Royal as he helps his with the stomach cancer ploy and even his own background, when Henry confronts him about the cancer set up and in his room, traditional West Asian music is playing and there are religious pictures integrated into the background. The plot was so satisfying because of the acceptance of each undesirable situation, in terms of typical story structure. For example, Royal and Ethel did not reunite romantically at the end, Royal dies, Margot and Richie do not (as far as we know) fully embrace their love of one another. It's these quiet nods to reality and further dysfunction which makes the story so empathetic. Life does not always turn out to be perfect, the conclusion of the film does not tie up all the loose ends, because life cannot go on forever without something unravelling.The outstanding notion that this movie left me with was empathy; you could feel the pain of everyone, no matter how unlikeable they had the potential to be at times. The one and only criticism of mine would be the lack of development of Etheline. As the mother of the entire dysfunctional brood, it would have been interesting to see her feelings on Royal, her marriage to Henry and Richie's suicide attempt. However, this does not at all take from what's already there. It was the flaws that made it flawless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first comment on this site; I'm prompted to write to counter the bad reviews for this film. When I saw The Royal Tenenbaums, it instantly became one of my all-time favorite comedies. I suppose I understand how some people wouldn't like it; the humor is very dry and quick, and you have to suspend reality at times to accept the premise. But you have to do that for a lot of good movies, and this one worked for me. I have rarely laughed so hard as during the conversation in the hospital between Luke Wilson (in bed) and Ben Stiller and the one between Anjelica Huston and Gwyneth Paltrow in the tub.I enjoyed Rushmore as well; neither movie is a comedy where the heroes are extremely likable and cute people, like Eddie Murphy or Adam Sandler (except in Punch-Drunk Love, a slightly similar movie I also loved).The Tenenbaums and friends are quirky to the point of dysfunction, and you can get frustrated by the choices they make, but those quirks and obsessions are what make them such interesting characters. To the reviewer who didn't find Gwyneth's character's smoking habit funny, I guess you have never been a smoker or had a friend who smoked who, as an adult, still tried desperately to hide that weakness from their family - the reasons they give and lengths they go to to keep up the lie are fertile ground for comedy, to say the least! There is much ironic humor and some sadness inherent in the character's panicky attempts to hide her smoking, while the bizarre behaviors she displays openly don't seem to faze her at all.The movie is very, very funny with touches of regret and sadness, and a good dose of desperation; but ultimately redeeming. It might not be for you if you can't stand Fargo, Raising Arizona, Rushmore, Catch-22 and so on, but you should try it anyway, and I of course highly, highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums (2001/Wes Anderson) ***1/2 out of ****In motion picture history, there are classic examples of dysfunctional families, from the Corleones to the Roses. But "The Royal Tenenbaums" brings to the screen the most oddest dysfunctional family in the history of cinema. The Tenenbaum family is led by Royal (Gene Hackman) and Etheline (Anjelica Huston). They have three children: Chas, the financial kid; Margot, a young playwright (she's adopted) and Richie, an all star Tennis player. Before the kids become prodigies, their parents seperate, and they live with their mother. But when the kids grow up, that is when the problems start to happen. Chas (Ben Stiller) has just lost his wife, and is at the verge of a mental breakdown. He always fears for his twin son's safety, to the point of having all three of them wear the same colored Adidas Track Suits! All Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) wants is to be accepted. She has gone through many relationships since her childhood, including a Jamaican recording artist, a French woman, her husband (Bill Murray), and her most recent affair with her brother's boyhood friend, named Eli (Owen Wilson), who is now a successful writer with a serious problem. And the last child, Richie (Luke Wilson), had a breakdown during a Tennis match, and has been avoiding the family ever since. Oh yeah, he is also in love with his sister! And finally there is Danny Glover, the family's accountant, who has just proposed to Etheline.What keeps this above the level of your ordinary family comedy, is the colorful and rewarding style by director and writer Wes Anderson. The soundtrack is also very interesting. Gene Hackman and Ben Stiller turn in funny performances, but the rest of the cast is kind of goofy, yet at the same time, surprisingly likeable. The film's offbeat approach is what glued me in, and now I want to go out and watch Anderson's other film, "Rushmore". And Alec Baldwin does a nice job as the narrator.It's not really a laugh out loud comedy, but it shows the funny and some-what twisted side of a dysfunctional family of geniuses. And you thought your family was strange...-30-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intelligent. Funny. Creative. Ingenious. A rare gem in the movie industry. Gene Hackman stars as Royal Tenenbaum,a dead beat father who returns to his dysfunctional family claiming to have stomach cancer, and reuniting the separated clan. His family includes his wife (Angelica Houston) who is coming to terms with her life and pondering a marriage to her accountant(Danny Glover). Royal (Hackman) and Etheline's(Houston) children consist of a dazzling cast of colorful characters. The "family of genuises" contains Ben Stiller, a slightly obsessed and painfully strict father, Luke Wilson, an ex-tennis player who's inner pain is overwhelming, and their adopted daughter Gwyneth Paltrow, who is secretly the love Wilson's life, and a playwright who cannot come to terms with her marriage or life. Other brilliantly cast stars include Owen Wilson as an eccentric novelist on acid and Bill Murray cast as Paltrow's psychiatrist husband whose love is lost in an exceedingly empty life. All of these characters come together to construct the most colorfully delightful and creative cast I have seen in a long while. The performances are top-notch and the witty pastiche humor is fresh and welcome. This film contains a well-balanced serving of drama and comedy packed with an exceptional soundtrack and script. "The Royal Tenenbaums" has quickly become one of my favorite films that tragically has not received as much credit as it deserves. A definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not a whole lot to say about THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS itself that hasn't already been posted here, but one thing that hasn't been mentioned much is its wonky production design. Little details, from the chapter breaks to the closet full of retro board games, were delightful. I also liked how although it's set in the present, nothing in the movie specifically shows it. The odd wardrobes, rusty gypsy cabs, non-brand cigarettes and untrendy hairstyles created its own little world. And I appreciated that the only product placement was integral to the plot (Tic-Tacs); I get so tired of constant brand names in movies distracting me from what's happening in the scene. And those Dalmatian mice were priceless.Lemme include personal recollections. First, I couldn't believe how uncrowded the theatre was; I was disappointed that the audience for a Friday night showing was so sparse. But then again, the movie had been playing awhile maybe it's not the hottest show in town. However, my local theatre is in Queens, whose residents aren't made up of the type who'd appreciate this brand of quirky humor.Although it was a small crowd, it was a lively one. Everyone was having a ball (and I heard only one cell phone - it's a sad time when that's a compliment), and a rousing applause was led by yours truly when the closing credits rolled - until the stupid ushers turned on the flood lights before the song credits appeared and I had to hiss at them to turn them off until the movie was completely over.I may have slightly annoyed my boyfriend by quietly singing along to all the wonderful tunes by Elliot Smith, Nick Drake, Lou Reed and others; did Wes Anderson raid my CD collection when I wasn't looking? He and Cameron Crowe better ask next time. So, on the walk home after the movie my boyfriend mentioned that he's seen only a portion of RUSHMORE and that he didn't think much of it. At this point I naturally bitchslapped him twice and pledged to force him to sit down with me and give it another chance. Surely anyone who enjoyed THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS will equally adore a comedy similar in so many ways, no?Ok, enough rambling. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Estranged Wes Anderson's Best Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie expecting a comedy, like many others. With a end to end cast of Hollywood's finest I knew there would have to be some redeeming qualities in this estranged film. About half-way through I realized that this was no comedy, rather a dramatic tale of social development in a disfunctional American family. By the time the movie ended I was left with my 'Chi' disturbed. I knew I liked the movie but could not seem to know why. Later when I realized the prestigious film company 'The Criterion Collection' put this movie on their 'A' list of DVD's, I decided to buy it and re-evaluate. The second time through I realized this was one of the finest original dramas I have ever seen. Granted, it has its funny moments but they are painted with a dark brush. Wes Anderson is an odd bird. He places much faith in melodramatics and creates what almost rolls off as British humor. On paper his ideas may almost seem like a passage from a diary in a mental institute, yet with the help of Owen Wilson he manages to create a unique blend between cartoonish story telling and social realism. In all he manages to engross and entice the audience (even though half the time we think to ourselves 'Why am I watching this movie?'). New to the trade he has made each movie with meticulous accuracy allowing plot and character development to slowly bloom. By the time you see the whole flower, you feel as if you have witnessed a small piece of life unfolding.Regardless, he is an odd bird and his movies are not intended for all audiences. Those who prefer the overly processed Hollywood movies (available in Sharp, Monterey or Swiss) will undoubtedly criticize this movie. Those with a taste for the exotic in film making will delight in this clever blend of Storybook sets, witty conversations, and only the finest acting allowed in today's films.</fullReview>

So the next day I watched 'Tenenbaums' again, then again a few days later - each time i watched it I noticed more and more great moments - moments that you think about and grin to yourself at the thought. If you are prepared to commit to this film and watch it more than once then I hope you will be able to see the genius that I saw.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally pleasing, humorous cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Possibly contains spoilers*This movie is well-crafted enough to become a cult classic. The story and characters develop naturally, the music perfectly complements each scene, and the design is wonderfully whimsical (Alec Baldwin narrates the movie like he's telling a bedtime story). The Royal Tenenbaums is certainly not the mainstream comedy it was marketed to be; the humor is too subtle and off-beat. That's not to say that most people won't catch the humor, it's just not laugh-out-loud absurdities every minute like Zoolander--which also features Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. However, that is an advantage in this film because it leaves room for the characters to have real emotions and personalities. I really felt for Ben Stiller's character, who is obsessively overprotective of his two boys after his wife dies, and Anjelica Huston perfectly portrays a self-reliant mother who has raised her children alone and is now learning to love again. Every character forms some sort of emotional attachment with the viewer. Although the movie is strange and a little far-out at some points, by the end everyone seems to have grown more normal and well-adjusted, and the story draws to a satisfactory conclusion. I appreciated this movie more after a second viewing, since the first time through is a little confusing and unexpected.</fullReview>

The Royal Tenenbaums is a richly textured, layered film that yields something new upon each viewing. Every character is intriguing. The film's dialogue is amazing, and illustrates the fact that Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson (who co-wrote the film) have a deep-seeded understanding of basic human nature and a flare for subtle humor. The cast is stellar, and the performances are arguably these actors' best. After watching it so many times, it's hard for me to accept that Ben Stiller isn't really Chas Tenenbaum, and that Gene Hackman isn't actually Royal. The Royal Tenenbaums is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Royal TenenbaumsMuch of the success of the Royal Tenenbaums must be accredited to Douglas Aibel who is responsible for casting. The star studded cast sets the stage for a motion picture that strives on a family of intricately woven characterization. The film's introduction sets the stage for the famous actors to arouse audiences with their amazing acting capabilities. The premise of the film is quite simple; it traces the lives and strange nature of the Tenenbaum family. The family is made up of two boys, and one adopted daughter. Upon being deserted by their father (Royal), they're mother Etheline bestows her children with a vast array of knowledge and eventually turns them all into self-proclaimed geniuses. Filmmaker Wes Anderson (a genius himself) and his assistant Owen Wilson outlined the film as if a narrator was reading the story aloud. All the events occur chronological with the house on Archer Ave. as the primary setting. Now the family of geniuses is all grown up, they find themselves reunited under the same roof with their father. The key element of success for the films light-hearted comical brilliance is embedded in the character's irregular attributes. A potential message Anderson is trying to convey is that no matter how intelligent or special people are, they all have unavoidable insecurities. The youngest, Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson), is madly in love with his adopted sister, a situation that ruined his tennis career and sent him wondering the artic sea. Margot Tenenbaum (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a compulsive liar whose secrets are as melodramatic as can be. Chaz Tenenbaum (Ben Stiller) would be classified as the most sane, but do to his wife's death he has become crazily narcotic, temperamental, and edgy. All three of the children have traced they're insecurities back to they're cold-hearted father, Royal. Royal's deceit is often implausible. The supporting actors such as, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, and Danny Glover carry the plot along and underscore the sensation comedy. The `Royal Tenenbaums' provides a solid example that casting can often times make or break a film's success. The actor's in this movie dedicated their lives to each of their assigned character roles. No intricate costuming is necessary, but rather a simple display of unexpected abnormal behavior from individuals who are often misconceived as faultless. The `Royal Tenebaums' is a truly original display of comical artistic articulation. Ironically the film portrays a family of geniuses in an ingenious fashion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart, funny, and quirky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains spoiler Oddly enough, The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) reminds me a lot of the comic strip Doonesbury. Literate, clever, and often too smart for it's own good. Don't get me wrong, I like smart movies and there is definitely a lack of them out there. Like Doonesbury, though, I'm sure there are a number of people out there who were simply unwilling to put in the effort to understand The Royal Tenenbaums. Although often slow, I found The Royal Tenenbaums just as often humorous. Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is the music. Although I found the entirety of the film less obviously calculating than some critics have claimed it to be, the music (especially the non-original music) certainly seemed overly manipulative. While there are moments of slapstick in TRT, much of the humor is dialogue based. Consider the scene where Richie admits Royal his love for his sister. `Isn't that illegal?' says Royal. `No, I don't think so. We're not blood related,' replies Richie, to which Royal's response is `True. But it's certainly frowned upon.' Much of the film is like that: jokes so quiet or subtle that if you blink, you'll miss them. Some of the humor also results from the characters obliviousness to what they're saying (or doing). Whenever Royal introduces his daughter Margot, he makes sure to mention that she is adopted, which is in actuality really horrible and cruel, but Royal says it without any hint of malice or even awareness that he has committed a faux pas at all. Or there are Uri and Ari, the sons of Chas, who (in an attempt to compensate for the attention his father never gave him) warps their fragile little minds by making them do fire drills at three in the morning (and telling them they're all dead afterwards) and having them work out sixteen times a week. From the outside, as spectators, such things can be funny. While I found much of the dialogue and situation comedy very funny, the music usually made me cringe. It isn't because the music was bad, it was just that the music seemed extremely calculated. When Richie sets his pet bird, Mordeci, free, there is uplifting 70's pop music. When Richie tries to kill himself, there is a melancholy pop song. When Royal finally reunites with is family, there is happy music. As we find out about Margot's secret sex life, there is a raucous rock song. I am aware that all movies are trying, in one way or another, to manipulate the audience, but in a movie filled with subtle dialogue and intricate visual details, I was disappointed that the music was so.guileless. It often seemed like I was watching the scene with the music setting next to me yelling in my ear `Okay, this scene, it's sad! Here's some SAD music to make sure you KNOW it's SAD!' In the end, however, my complaints about the music are not enough to spoil the rest of this sumptuous film. The script is backed up by an outstanding cast (Gene Hackman probably being the best) and even the bit players get some great lines. While slow, it's usually funny enough to be interesting, and the slow portions often lead to a nice payoff (such as the wonderful scenes where the entire family is gathered together). Even with the often obtrusive music, The Royal Tenenbaums is smart, funny, and delightfully quirky. Plus, it has the best epitaph ever.P.S. 10 bonus points if you got the Charlie Rose joke.</fullReview>

This tale of a household of child geniuses (Chas, the financial whiz; Margot, the prodigy playwright; Richie, the tennis pro) who reunite as adults when their father, Royal (Gene Hackman) is supposedly dying of cancer, is as witty as it is warm.

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Film -- "Tenenbaums" is another Wes Anderson masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is the essence of the unique and (admittedly) unorthodox voice that Wes Anderson, as a writer and director, has brought to the film industry; Indeed, he wasn't named (by the Scorsese himself) as the world's next Scorsese for nothing. The beautifully shot, appropriately acted, and brilliantly written work of cinematic wonder that is "Tenenbaums" is a revolving door of sorts, a literal montage of emotion, intellect, and irony, neatly wrapped and tied in a bow of beautiful direction; a true gift to the film-watching community.Not only in this film, but in all of Anderson's three works (his other movies include Bottle Rocket and Rushmore), a melancholy, quirky undertone is nearly always present. Anderson's style as a director is, admittedly, off the wall. A slew of overhead tabletop shots, vintage Rock songs, oddly placed jump-cuts, and wildly eccentric costume and set design have not only placed Anderson among the forefront of new American directors, but also earned him a reputation as one of the most avant-garde. The Royal Tenenbaums is his most finely crafted work to date.The film centers around an estranged, emotionally stunted, New York City couple and their children (labeled geniuses at an early age) who bring fame and fortune to the family name (not surprisingly, Tenenbaum). Anyone who has seen the film is made perfectly aware in the unusually appealing prologue, exactly what accomplishments each of the children achieve early on: Chas Tenenbaum is a financial and real estate expert, as well as a scientist, Margot Tenenbaum (the adopted daughter) is a brilliant playwright, winning a braverman grant of 50,000 dollars in the third grade, and Richie Tenenbaum, by a very early age, is a champion tennis player. Their father and mother, Ethylene and Royal Tenenbaum, separate early on, and Royal's consistent insensitivity and emotional disconnection to the family (save Richie, who he chooses as his favorite child) causes much emotional angst to the children.The true meat and potatoes of the plot begins 20 years proceeding the prologue; it is apparent that the children "peaked early" and now live lives tattered with shame, depression, and emotional confusion. Royal hasn't spoken to anyone in his family in three years, and after being evicted from his apartment, announces that he has a terminal illness. It's a desperate attempt to, not only simply find a place to sleep, but also undo wrongs and past oversights within his own family. At the end of the movie, the film's true success can be judged on whether or not the audience truly accepts Royal at the film's climax -- as a character with a soul, with a conscience, and true feelings of remorse. Redemption is the underlying theme here, not only for Royal, but for his children and every major character in the film.Wes Anderson's penchant for limited but, still, meaningful and insightful (often humorous) dialogue is one-hundred percent present through this entire film. The screenplay is a brilliant piece of writing (the only facet of the film that the Academy simply /couldn't/ refuse a nomination for) that, like all his films, lends itself to interpretation on many levels, and creates a cast of memorable, multilayered, and ironic characters (the core of all Anderson scripts). It is Anderson's directing however, that is truly the savior of "Tenenbaums." Robert D. Yeoman's cinematography is flawless (with the exception of moderately poor lighting in certain scenes), and the actors convey the "blankness" (for lack of a better term) and stoicism of the characters with grace and humor, while still making the underlying emotions and depression of the characters visible; they are convincing and memorable. You can also expect to see the usual, recurring Anderson gang (Bill Murray, Seymour Cassel, Kumar Pallana, etc.) The plot is unique and quirky -- one of the films foremost tenants is that it's based on a book -- a book that doesn't really exist.This, perhaps, leads directly into the misinterpretation that has been made of the film on several occasions. There have been critics and fans alike that have perceived the film as one of Margot's plays, even going as far to say that Richie is the unseen director (a metaphorical allusion to Richie's failed painting attempts). This is not so -- the text that appears on the "chapter" subtitles is no more than text from the screenplay (what else could be provided?). The brilliance of "Tenenbaums" lies, not in the complexity and surprise element in the plot, but in the complexity and personal struggles of every single character, ensuing the kind of sad, melancholy humor (ranging from acts as slight as Richie punching a pane of glass, to something severe as Eli crashing his car into the Tenenbaum estate) that has been a trademark of Anderson films from square one.Like "Rocket" and Rushmore, "Tenenbaums" can be considered a fable of sorts; a modern fairytale. The setting is familiar, but far removed from any New York City we've seen or been exposed to. This kind of unique set design is another element to the overall feeling that the Anderson films convey.Although The Royal Tenenbaums has done well in both delighting and boring audiences, Anderson films don't particularly lend themselves to the entirety of an American film audience that always seems to prefer cheap entertainment over content, or the latest Adam Sandler gross-out comedy over the masterpiece playing at the local independent theater. Like all Anderson films, "The Royal Tenenbaums" is a post-modernistic masterpiece, written by an intellectual director who lends himself to a more intellectual audience. Wes Anderson's many influences are apparent here, from Mike Nichols to J.D. Sallinger, culminating in the most original, sadly funny, beautifully melancholy film to hit the silver screen in years. Anderson is a director for a generation, and The Royal Tenenbaums is proof that his impact is lasting. And although the film is neither as culturally affecting as The Graduate, nor as artistically poignant as The Catcher in the Rye, it is, never the less, an affecting work of art and a brilliant film. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Anderson, the director of Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, has brought us a movie that stands head-and-shoulders above your average, run-of-the-mill, jerk-father-becomes-terminally-ill-and-tries-to-spend-time-with-his-kids movies. Unlike the usual, tear-jerking sorts of movies that use that kind of plot format, this movie is a a biting satire and a moving black comedy.The movie starts out by introducing the characters to us- Royal Tenenbaum (Hackman) and his wife, Etheline, (Huston) and their three prodigal kids. Chas is financial genius who is buying real estate at the age of 14, Richie is a champion tennis player, and the adopted daughter Margot is a celebrated playwright. When the kids are in their pre-teens, their parents split up, and the children never really see their father again.Years later, kids have grown up. Chas (Stiller) got married and had two kids, but lost his wife in a plane crash that he and his kids were on but survived, and is now a bitter and paranoid safety freak. Margot (Paltrow) hasn't written a play for years and now lives in an unhappy marriage with psychologist Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray). Richie (Luke Wilson) quit playing tennis and lived at sea for a few years. He wrote a letter to his friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) saying that he is in love with his adopted sister. Eli is an egotistical writer. Etheline has been proposed to by her accountant, Henry Sherman (Danny Glover).After the Tenenbaum children come back to live at home, Royal tells Etheline that he has stomach cancer and wants to spend time with his kids before he dies. Richie accepts his dad's proposal with open arms, but Chas hates his father passionatley and wants for he and his kids to have nothing to do with Royal. Shortly after he moves in, Sherman exposes him of having lied about his illness, and Chas kicks him out. The following events include persue of love, attempted suicide, and waves of melancholy as the whole family comes together again in the end.This movie was a whole lot better than I expected. Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller have a horrible knack of being in bad movies (like The Haunting, Shanghai Noon, Meet the Parents, and Zoolander) but in this movie they were phenomenal. Gene Hackman, Luke Wilson, Anjelica Huston, Danny Glover, and the two kids are great in their roles too, though Bill Murray's character is a wee bit underused. The real star of the movie, however, is Wes Anderson's directing. His movies are very much in a one-man genre that he has created. His movies, this one in particular, works similarly to the way that Edward Scissorhands does- it's set in a world that is not quite our own, with characters that are finely exaggerated enough for us to laugh and cry with them. Sort of like a cinematic version of a J.D. Salinger novel. I thourougly enjoy Anderson's movies, and hope he makes more of them soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Royal Tenenbaums: 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A conniving old man, a safety nut, and a dog named Buckley live in the same house?. No, it's not the beginning of a bad joke. In fact, it's The Royal Tenenbaums, Wes Anderson's newest comedy. Back in their hey-day, which we don't know when it was, all three of the Tenenbaum children were geniuses, each in their own individual way. Chas was a Wall Street investor, Margot was a playwright, and Richie was a tennis pro.Gene Hackman is Royal Tenenbaum, the father of the child prodigies. He spilt with his wife Etheline ten years after getting married, but still siring the three children. He lives in a hotel, which he doesn't pay for, and he isn't exactly an honest man. Royal never spent any time with his family, and they all hate him.Anjelica Huston is Etheline Tenenbaum. She was a typical mother of a successful trio of geniuses. She always put them first. Since breaking up with Royal, but never divorcing, she has had many suitors, but has never considered marriage until Henry Sherman asks her.Ben Stiller is Chas Tenenbaum. His wife Rachael died in a plane crash a year ago, making Chas increasingly paranoid and safety-oriented. He has two boys, Ari (Grant Rosenmeyer) and Uzi (Jonah Meyerson), who do what their father tells them to do, even though they don't enjoy it. Chas also has a dog, Buckley. He decided to move back to his childhood house after deciding that his isn't safe anymore.Gwyneth Paltrow is Margot Tenenbaum. Whenever Royal introduced her, he said, `And this is my adopted daughter Margot Tenenbaum.' She's been smoking ever since she was twelve, although nobody knows about it. She is constantly depressed and lives in a marriage, unhappily, with Raleigh St. Clair, which caused Richie to give up tennis. She also has stop writing plays.Luke Wilson is Richie Tenenbaum. He quit playing tennis two or so years before he had to stop. He has been living the last few years on the sea, and states to his friend Eli Cash that he has fallen in love with Margot. Richie blew up at a tennis match after seeing her with her new husband.Owen Wilson is Eli Cash. He has always wanted to be a Tenenbaum, since he lived across the street from them. He is now a promising writer who also happens to be in love with Margot and is a drug addict.Danny Glover is Henry Sherman. He is one of Etheline's coworkers, and has hidden feelings for her. Once, he proposes to her, but she is still legally married to Royal. He has a bumbling sort of attitude. Henry helps Etheline run a bridge class every week.Bill Murray is Raleigh St. Clair. Raleigh is a famous scientist who is studying a boy who has amnesia, dyslexia, and color blindness. He is completely in love with Margot, but her feelings towards him are indifferent.Surely these colorful characters can't be connected. Of course they can, and don't call me Shirley. Anderson can create a wonderful world that is not unlike New York. However, something I adore about this is that we do not know which time period it takes place in. Also, their clothing stays the same for almost the entire movie.Royal claims that he has stomach cancer, which causes this family to reunite for the first time in 17 years. Of course, things don't work out the way he planned. If you're not a fan of `quirky', such as Ghost World, this probably isn't your cup of tea. If you like offbeat stuff, this is your best bet.The Royal Tenenbaums had humorous moments, poignant moments, sad moments, and awkward moments. This combination isn't easy to make, but Anderson makes it work. I laughed, I cried, and I had an Amsterdam good time. The music was upbeat at times, but also mellow and sad when the time called for it. It just worked in a great way. I can't think of anything more to say about this excellent movie, so just go to your local video disco and rent it!My rating: 10/10Rated R for some language, sexuality/nudity and drug content.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting gallery of the human suffering `The Royal Tenenbaum' can seems a comedy, but through the characters you can see all the pain provoke by the life. Even the movie narrate the story of a noble family, where the three sons are a baby genius, so seems that the life is more easy and beautiful, but doesn't so. The father, Royal, is a egoist and cynical play boy that leave the family for running his vices, the sons grow up and retinue to various disappointments have lost all of his quality and safety. Many years later Royal would back to home because he is heavily sick and ready to die. Nobody of his familiars would believed he, but it's true? At first sight the movie start as a comedy of the high society, for the serious also the rich cry, but during the developed it's ever more clear the impossibility of the happiness, and how it's true this better feeling. The movie put extraordinary people in ordinary trouble and understand we that the life is hard for all, and above all the money not do the happiness, and that the people going accept for who are without think too them bad quality, but exalting them quality. Wes Anderson, the director is one of the most original filmmaker and his way to see the life is touched and laughter at the same time and the laughter is ever better and reflective, but all of above the choice of the players is extremely hit on , each of them are excellent. In the leading role of the Royal we found Gene Hackman in great shape as a adorable rascal and rightly winners to the `Golden Globe', while in the character of his sons there are Ben Stiller as the finance genius, that had to little time lost his wife, Gwyneth Paltrow as the adoptive daughter comedy-writer married unhappily with the psychology Relaight S. Clair(Bill murray that inspired the character on the Business Man that in play in `Rushmore', but with less efficacy) and Luke Wilson as the sporting promises of the Tennis, desperately fall in love to his adoptive sister, eventually Owen Wilson as the complex neighbour. Each of them masterly manner by the `genius' Wes Anderson. My rate is 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you loved Rushmore you'll love Tenenbaums and vice-versa. Very, very funny (you will REALLY laugh watching these films), though not jokey at all. As in Rushmore, you are propelled forward by the characters and their inner and outer conflicts, laughing all the way and also empathizing with the characters and hoping for their successes...Tenenbaums is even more surreal and eccentric than Rushmore. Similar flavor and setting, a kind of dreamlike zen journey for meaning for various characters against a backdrop of the disillusioned/dysfunctional educated middle class, with themes of lost and found relationships/selves/trueloves. Plenty to think about, but don't get me wrong, meanwhile these films are just so funny. Surreal, and yet more real than most films you see currently, at times they really strike a chord. The characters are just so interesting, for one thing. The humor is unlike any other films being made currently, the Anderson/Wilson writing is definitely unique and after you see it you just want more. The characters in Tenenbaums are kind of like caricatures, almost like a cartoon, so how come we identify with them so easily... many shots are even shot in longshot increasing this cartoon effect, and the effect too of this kind of being a parable, and the characters maybe representing "everyman", and as you are watching you can't help but see yourself and others you know in the roles....it's a great effect. I got the feeling sometimes that these longshot views were kind of like a birdseye view of everyone (maybe Mordicai's). Anyway, very funny, totally entertaining, and touching, too. Many beautiful scenes. Visually unique. Super soundtrack, too. Not to mention the brilliant cast. You can see these films many times and not get tired of them. That's rare. I just look forward to seeing more films by Anderson and Wilson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps not the greatest film of all time, but my favorite regardless...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This stroke of cinematic brilliance is verifiable proof that Wes Anderson's genius and style of filmmaking will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on the entire filmmaking community in the future."The Royal Tennebaums" is a fun house mirror of sorts, a revolving door of seemingly unrelated plot twists, layered themes, and character discoveries that will do well in both making audiences uncomfortable and amazingly captivated.The film is a coming of age symphony for director/writer Wes Anderson, who gives us his third masterpiece in "The Royal Tennenbaums" (following the wonderfully weird "Bottle Rocket", and brilliant "Rushmore"). A darkly amusing fable about the nature of redemption and mellancholy, the film chronicles the mental, physical, and emotional journey of the famous and/or infamous Tennenbaum family.The family patriarch, Royal Tennenbaum (hence the name of the movie), is a savagely insensitive and arrogant man. He divorces his wife Ethel Tennenbaum early in his three childrens lives, Richie, Margot, and Chas, and his continual insensitivity and blatant absence in their young lives creates an invisible barrier between him and his children that is never fully overcome.A large portion of the film is devoted to explaining the fame of the young Tennenbaum family. Margot was a stellar playwrite with a pulitzer under her belt as a young child, Richie a championship tennis player, and Chas a brilliant real estate financer and scientist. Their father, Royal is a prominant attourney and their mother is a archeologist.The real story begins when Royal, after 3 years of no contact with anyone in his family, claims that he is on the precipace of death. This declaration leads to every member of the family living under the same roof for the first time in 15 years, and a slew of misadventures and tragedies.In short, "Tennnenbaums" is a sadly endearing and brilliant saga, quite simply the finest film I've ever watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This calls for a second viewing:First of all, you need to have the right sense of humor in order to enjoy this film. I had the right sense of humor, but the first time I watched the film, it did not do much for me. I laughed a couple times and I was impressed with the fine ensemble cast, but there were some things that I really did not find funny but just stupid. I decided to give it another try. Second time around, THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS made me laugh so hard I thought I might cry at some parts. Yeah, I know it wasn't *that* funny, but it was still very satrical. The cast is perfect and all of them give great performances: Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Danny Glover, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, and narrated by Alec Baldwin, who for the first time does not overact (probably due to the fact that he isn't really in the movie, he just gives a sarcastic voice-over). I still thought he did good though. There were some scenes that did not do much for me (like the end) but otherwise I felt that this was a really great movie. Good premise that starts out slow, but gets better. There was more drama in the film than I was expecting, but there was still comedy that had me laughing.I urge everyone who did like this film to give it another try, and if you still don't like it, shut it off. While I didn't really think the film was worthy of any Oscars, I still feel it is one of the better films of 2001. Recommendations: PASSED AWAY and MAGNOLIA. Both are somewhat similar.THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS gets 5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More heady goodness from Wes Anderson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third film by Wes Anderson is another testament to his ingenuity and original vision. There is a slight air of surrealism, hinted at by the made-up New York locations (the 375th St. Y, the Palace Hotel, Archer Ave.) that are actual New York locations in disguise. The (perhaps over-) abundance of detail is a treasure-trove waiting for repeated viewings. Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson have woven an intricate plot around intricately woven characters. These characters may irritate a viewer sometimes but are much more deeply drawn than they first appear: they are greater than the sum of their quirks. The score, by former Devo newwaver Mark Mothersbaugh, is a perfect amalgamation of Baroque and classical music and jazz-pop, in the same vein as his score for "Rushmore." I highly recommend this to anyone who ever thinks about his or her childhood for any reason.A note for viewers of the Criterion Collection DVD: Watch and be appalled by the "Peter Bradley Show" in which a man who looks vaguely like Charlie Rose incompetently interviews several bit players who seem either amused or very uncomfortable. Then, sharpen your eyes, switch discs and watch for "Peter Bradley" to appear in the movie in a couple of places. Finally, think really hard about the whole thing and what it might mean.</fullReview>

Along with Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, this is a film to be watched and re-watched by cinema fans. In an era where nearly every movie that comes out is a studio blockbuster. It is refreshing to see that someone is still making an attempt to tell stories, for the joy of it.Along with Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes, and a few others will keep the blood pulsing through this industry which becomes more and more placid by the minute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Birds are not meant to be kept in a cage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This an intelligent movie about a family that has lived in a sedated state of mind for many years. The patriarch of the Tenenbaum family defines it as: maintaining status quo. We slowly witness how each family member and their trusted family friend slowly leave their metaphorical cage and start spreading their wings. The movie is accompanied by a terrific score and is subtle in its approach to the interpersonal relations between the family members. This is necessary since the story consists of several different sub-stories related to each family member. This allows the viewer to understand what each family member is experiencing.Old man Tenenbaum starts out as a man who wants nothing more than to be a part of the Tenenbaum family (as strange as that me sound). He goes about doing this by treating his kids as adults and he is only able to establish somewhat of an affectionate relationship with Richie, the future tennis player. This has a profound effect on each family member and as we discover, they choose not to act on their feelings of frustration, love and fear but rather maintain an unhealthy status quo.Twenty years later we see what has become of the family. The outside world has labelled them a 'highly gifted family' and fails to see them for who they really are. Namely regular people who happen to be gifted in certain area's of their lives.During the course of the movie we witness how each family member slowly leaves his/her cage and confronts their fears and frustrations.Enjoy the liberalization of the Tenenbaum birds!</fullReview>

However, the Royal Tenenbaums is an artwork on film, not to take anything away from the acting, which is superb (I have a new respect for Gwyneth), the Art Director and DOP should have been nominated for Academy Awards.

		<fullReview>I will make this review short and sweet. You have heard everyone else's descriptions of the film, but I want to defend it. The first time I watched it, I liked it a lot, but felt it was missing something. The more times I watched it, I found it to be a beautiful and incredibly-well directed film. It is rarely ever laugh-out-loud, but more of a sublime kind of humour that is strange, yet so original that puts a smile on your face. To everyone who I know who didn't like the movie, I reminded them of all the humourous bits:Henry: Hello, Royal. How are you doing? Royal: Not too well, I'm dying.Chas: Was it dark? Richie: Of course it was, it's a suicide note.Not really a punch in the face, but try to watch it again, and try to really see it. It's like watching a foreign film with subtitles, much more demanding to watch, but it's the visuals and the bits and pieces that are so absurd and humourous. All of Anderson's films were a "second-time-around" for me, such as Rushmore. I wasn't a fan of it, but I watched it again after Tenenbaums. Now I adore it. Wes Anderson is a brilliant director, with actually something new to show us. If it's still bad, rent it with "National Lampoon's Van Wilder". I'm sure the dog ejaculate jokes will have you rolling over the floor.-Damien Ferland</fullReview>

From the intricate sets and the painstaking dedication to even the smallest peripheral details, I can feel the filmmakers' passion.Of course it's not the zaniest comedy ever made, but just as in life, sometimes it's the subtleties that are the funniest parts. You almost have to watch the film multiple time in-order to absorb everything that's going on and to really get to know the characters. This is not typical studio fare, and apparently that has turned a lot of IMDB reviewers off. I understand if it's not your bag, but you almost have to respect how well it's made. To each his own, but for me this is in the rare class of films that gets better with each viewing.Another awesome soundtrack, too.</fullReview>

Go there and you can watch him smash watermelons. But if you consider yourself an intellectual, one who finds humor in the little nuances of life and not the "slap me in the face" comedy this is for you. I am sorry if you did not like this movie, because you are missing one of the most intriguing films I have seen on many levels. I've never seen a soundtrack that intertwined with a film so well. The acting is top notch, and Royal Tennenbaum could be one of my generation's hardest roles to play. The small details are what make this film so well done. For instance, the `gypsy cab co.' and the fact that Henry Sherman has toilet paper on his face, from where he cut himself shaving, when he asks Ethel to marry him. Almost every word that comes out of Gene Hackman's mouth is something to laugh about. Wes Anderson has never failed to impress me. He creates his movies on experiences and topics that if you dig deep enough you can relate to. Sure no one has the life of a Tennenbaum but don't we all possess little quarks and characteristics that they present. Try making a movie about failed geniuses, suicide, divorce, family disaster, insect, drugs abuse, paranoia, lying, deceiving and misunderstanding that is labeled a comedy. If you did not like this, please watch it again... if that does not work, I would stick slap stick comedy, I would not want to injure your self actually thinking and analyzing a movie while viewing it. `Your True Blue Ethel, Your True Blue'</fullReview>

The script, locations, design and "feel" are all top notch. Most importantly, the cast is AMAZING. They all deliver rock solid performances, making you believe this movie is actually peering into the dysfunctional Tenenbaum household. The sets are constructed with such detail, you must view the DVD version of the movie to understand the pain staking efforts Wes Anderson and his brother took to complete every detail.

		<fullReview>Here is a film which can be so much a comedy, but deals with many heavyhanded concepts centered mostly around death, suicide, lovers betrayal, and a disfunctional family due largely in part to a failed father. The concepts are heavy, but it doesn't dwell on what's depressive, and although the film ends with a sad moment it leaves you on a high note. It's a big step up from Rushmore, which is also an excellent film.Also the shooting style blends new with old. Many shots refuse to cut and just keep going, then when it finally cuts you're often at a new scene.... it reminds me somewhat of david lean. Also incorporated are a couple zoom shots.... very rare in film these days, and some pivitol jump cutting.....

		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend watching this film. It has an all-star cast, great director, and is full of laughs. I saw it three times in the movie theater and have seen it on DVD three times since. If you don't enjoy this film, you do not know what real comedy is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Introversion at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I have never cared for the "If you do/don't love this movie, you are obviously a moron!" comments. I don't think anyone called "stupid" for not appreciating a movie is going to make much effort to elevate the plane of his/her interpretation. If all of us who think this is one of the most clever, insightful &amp; witty films made in recent years would speak positively about the film &amp; only mildly admonish others to take a deeper look, we MIGHT win a few converts. Of course, we might not, but it might be worth a try.That said, though, I DO have to agree wholeheartedly with one remark "AJ" made. He PERFECTLY summed it up by calling it "Introversion at its finest." I couldn't agree more. But, hey, we all DO have our own tastes. I have many VERY savvy movie friends who INSIST that Goodfellows is one of the best movies ever made. Whatever they see in it, I miss, seeing just a well-made mob movie, on par with Scarface &amp; dozens of other shoot-em-up, put-the-lasagna-on flicks. Not connecting with a particular film is not necessarily a sign of stupidity. (In some occasions, it may be a strong HINT, but "To each his own.")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who cares what this movie is categorized as? Does that even matter? This movie smacks of brilliance, and the idiotic reviews of the mildly intelligent members of this site only prove it. This movie is about genii, and only we genii can truly appreciate the privilege and subsequent pressures of a lifestyle like that (not on their level of course; excess is a powerful avenue to parody). The lab rat who got mad when all these stars didn't make him laugh is clearly not the kind of person anyone would hire to review movies. What's your favorite movie, "dude," Con Air? XXX? Gone In 60 Seconds? The subtle symbolisms and inferences of this movie require a scholarly mind and multiple viewings to appreciate. Anyone looking for a cheap laugh will be sorely disappointed, and probably better served going after whatever disposable waste of film Tom Green is in. This is a celebration of brilliance, and the nuances of every character only enrich it. There are 2 types of people in this world: People who can appreciate this movie, and stupid people. Introversion at its finest. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seldom seen a film generate such hot debate. It seems that whether you loved or hated this film (and seldom does an opinion fall between the two, in this case), it generates such strong reactions. A perfect example of how Wes Anderson is well past nearly anyone in filmmaking ablility. Take it from me, kids, this guy is smarter than any of us, and will continue to make films that are far beyond the emotionally constipated society he resides within. I can't even talk about how this film and the specifics of it affect me anymore. It's like trying to explain why you're in love with someone...you start listing things, but slowly realize that those things only mean something to you. Wes Anderson's films are living, breathing, entities--much like the greatest of paintings, or fine literature, a pure work of art. The film is unreviewable--it exists, and not to please you, but as pure expression. I pity those who went in expecting a raucous comedy, victims of Buena Vista's marketing technique--you left disappointed, even angry--perhaps because you knew that you were missing out, and subsequently you're the one who loses. Life isn't meant to make you happy, but to surprise you, which is how Anderson's films reflect life in his own eccentric vision. Depression, bitterness, pain, and loneliness are universal--but salvation can be attained with hope, faith, introspection, and a sense of humor. This truth is the link between the films, and you'll either buy into that premise or you won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie, confusing marketing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the main reason people get turned off by this movie is that they go in thinking it's going to be a straight comedy. With some of the members of the cast (Stiller, Wilson, Murray...) and the wacky costumes on the poster, it's not hard to see why. I really wish they wouldn't have marketed this movie as such. If you see the trailer, all they show is the funny moments of the movie. They really don't give you any clues that it's sort of a drama, romance, tragedy, comedy hybrid. The first time I saw it in the theater that's what I expected, and thus I was a little disappointed. However, on the advice of almost everyone I talked to, I saw it again and absolutely loved it. It truly is a wonderful little movie, if you take it for what it is. I'm surprised there are so many negative reviews of the movie on here, but I understand that it probably didn't turn out to be what they thought it was going to be. Maybe try seeing it again; it worked for me. But for anyone who uses the cheesy line "I want two hours of my life back," that's probably not going to happen (if your time is that vital, why are you watching a movie, anyway?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This most recent edition from the brilliant minds of Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson is pure comic genius. There was not a single moment throughout this film where i was not dazzled with brilliant visuals and cinematography, amazing and witty writing, and superb acting. The film tells the story of a disfunctional family of child prodigies, allowing us to witness the most obscure and simultaneously commonplace events within their life. This masterpiece is a post-modern rollercoaster that will leave you contemplating your viewing experience for days to come.

		<fullReview>Folks, if you're looking for a "comedy", don't see this film. Go see an Adam Sandler movie. Though *I* think there are many very funny parts, The Royal Tenenbaums IS NOT a comedy. I'm upset that it was advertised as such, because so many people went to see it expecting something else, and thus cannot appreciate it.That said, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. If you liked Rushmore, you have to see this one. Like others have said, it takes a brain to appreciate this movie, as well eccentric taste in film--it helps if you don't like most of the trash that Hollywood puts out these days. Some people find it pretentious but I simply enjoy it too much to see it as such. It is by far the best performance any of the actors present have ever done. Interesting side note: Bill Murray did this movie for free.Final synopsis: You'll either hate it or you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Instant Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums isn't just some corky comedy movie. Every frame is a piece of art. It is obvious that much time was put into the artistic side of this movie. The closet filled with board games, and the sailors walking past Margot(Gwyneth Paltrow) at the train station, and other scenes yet add to this movie. The soundtrack is amazing, the casting is amazing...and each actor/actress plays their part perfectly. This movie is able to be serious and hilarious at the same time. Much of the humor is only evident upon later viewings. It's refreshing to know there are still comedies being made that aren't geared toward slapstick toilet humor. Props to Wes Anderson and the rest of the cast/crew on making a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overlooked gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson has come a long way since his first film Bottle Rockets. Who said there's no film making talent in Texas? Alongside Anderson, Luke and Owen Wilson have also come along way. The Royal Tenenbaums is Anderson's first film in which he uses his unique view on movie making with an element of old school. A lot of the directing style in Rushmore and earlier in Bottle Rockets can be seen in The Royal Tenenbaums. Still, early in the film, we notice a technique in Hollywood film that many viewers have never seen since it was last used in many of the 30's Musicals like Gold Diggers of 1933 and Footlight Parade. The opening credits show each of the actors who are characters in the movie. What a wonderful use of something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue....like Danny Glover's jacket! A wonderful comedy and much much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I noticed that some of you people that choose to review movies on this web site do not even realize the fact that film is art. Hence all those trashing The Royal Tenenbaums. It's possible that it was too intellectual for some of you, and in that case I suggest that you go rent The Fast and the Furious, a movie that only an extremely close-minded person could enjoy.The Royal Tenenbaums was the first movie that I have seen in a very long time that I truly enjoyed, but then again there haven't been many good movies since around 1995. About 15, which is very, VERY sad. So those of you that believe that it truly was a bad movie, I would recommend that you actually pay attention to the small details and dark comedy in movies like that, you might enjoy it, unless like I said before, you are extremely close-minded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one you can watch over and over for the subtle yet hilarious lines you may have missed a previous time. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I was expecting another Ben Stiller schtick, but it is different (not that there's anything wrong with his other movies.) It is so whimsical, yet very realistic at the same time. The scene where Gene Hackman's character confronts Danny Glover's in the kitchen is so true to life. Owen Wilson who plays Eli Cash is the co-writer and I believe producer of this movie. What a great job! Also, Gene Hackman is completely flawless in this movie. Heck, everyone is excellent in this movie. Can you tell I liked it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An understated delight (contains spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone else commented on how stylised this film is - and I think the colourful and over-the-top 70s feel and the soundtrack (not always 70s but retro in flavour) work as the perfect foil to some of the most subtle performances I've seen in a comedy.However 'kooky' the characters appeared, their actions always remained believable: for example, I liked the fact that, after Baumer's suicide attempt, noone got hysterical. I think it demonstrated perfectly how the most serious events in life can sometimes seem mundane &amp; even humorous and the lesser incidents (e.g. Royal criticising Margot's play) can take on such huge significance in someone's life.I don't really see it as some Addams Family farce - the comedy came from the script and the meticulous attention-to-detail in the sets and costumes (e.g. the dogfight spectators 25 years' on, black tracksuits at the funeral), but the dead-pan performances added an element of pathos which made me want to watch it all again to see what I'd missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Tale of Sympathetic Characters that I Thoroughly Adored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched Bottle Rockets, Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums - but I believe that Royal Tenenbaums could be the pinnacle of Wes Anderson's career. It is a story told sympathetically about a family of geniuses - each with his or her own quirks. There is a feeling of magical reality in the way the story unfolds. The narrator and the story book images contribute to this feeling. What can I say - I loved this movie. I've had family and friends comment that they thought it unfolded too slowly. I, on the other hand, wouldn't change a thing. Each scene is so well thought out - so perfectly planned. It's a movie to be savored and watched over and over again. 10/10/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One line summary of this film? I can't do that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again director Wes Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson have assembled a cast of slightly left-of-centre characters and turned out a brilliant ensemble piece. Like the same team's earlier Rushmore, the whole thing has a feel that you can't quite put your finger on but which sets it apart from just about everything else today. Rushmore improves on every viewing, and I suspect this will too. I am writing this a couple of days after first viewing and I can't wait to see it again.The cast in this story of a family at war with itself, from leads to smaller parts, is uniformly excellent but if I had to pick one out it would be Gwyneth Paltrow ? I'm not normally a fan of hers but in this I found her almost totally unrecognisable. The soundtrack too, mainly 60s and 70s hits, is once again a standout ? whereas lesser film makers seem to throw any old hit onto a soundtrack and hope it fits, Anderson gets the perfect one every time. Unique and unmissable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family dysfunction at its most quirky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is possibly the real best film of 2001. I hate it when certain works by awesome directors are put into limited release. Wes Anderson hits an out of the park home run with this movie. Again, he takes a plot concept that has been made into umpteen zillion other films and he breathes new life into it. This time he tackles family dysfunction. His subjects are a detached, disenchanted family where the three kids are prodigies. "The Royal Tenanbaums" contains intelligent writing, very offbeat and quirky characters and an even more bizarre story line. The camera work, costuming, settings, and makeup also made this movie a pleasure to watch. The casting was also perfect for this film. The best performance in the film went to Luke Wilson for his role as a tormented tennis star in love with his adopted sister played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Gene Hackman had his best performance since "Unforgiven" as the wormy patriarch of the shattered Tenanbaums. Wes Anderson and Luke Wilson score another direct hit with their collective creative efforts. IMHO, this is their best film and one of the best comedies to have come out in recent memory. I give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting, A Fine Screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The screenplay by director Wes Anderson and actor Owen Wilson is confident, full-bodied and sharply observant but it's the exquisite deadpan acting that stands out in Anderson's story of a dysfunctional family struggling to reconcile a decades-long separation. There isn't one false note struck by the performers (a massively impressive cast, including Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Wilson and his brother Luke, Danny Glover and Bill Murray with a smaller role by Cassavetes regular Seymour Cassel) even though Anderson offers them only a limited range of emotion to work within; instead he allows them to be identified by their peculiar obsessions (Paltrow's omnipresent cigarette, Luke Wilson's sunglasses, which he puts on and takes off at significant moments, and Stiller's red workout suit) and brief biographical synopses. Where Anderson and Wilson fail is in their sympathies: while allowing plenty of compassion for all their characters, they concentrate heavily on justifying Hackman's determination to ingratiate himself back as the patriarch. Though he's portrayed as a cad, selfish father and a bigot, he's easily forgiven by the writers for some fairly unforgivable stuff and the primary conceit--that he's the only one who really knows how to live--is unacceptable given the effect his behavior has had, casting his family adrift over the years. Points, however, should be given for the intelligent comments on how dysfunction qualifies you for the world at large (the three children each channel their frustrations into business, the arts and sports); it's a fresh viewpoint, one of many the film offers. It's hard to tell how the film will change upon repeated viewings (indeed, it seems both better and worse the second time around) but, flawed as it is, it does warrant them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A most intriguing work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A most interesting, entertaining and perplexing dark comedy, The Royal Tennenbaums takes at least two viewings to get a grasp on. Director Wes Anderson-one of Hollywood's brightest young talents-has more going on than one can possibly digest in one setting.SPOILERS AHEADThe engaging little comedy focuses around a dysfunctional and estranged family somewhere in an older urban neighborhood. Royal Tennenbaum (Gene Hackman) has been a poor excuse for a husband and father, showing a remarkable lack of sensitivity to members of his family. Now, in his old age, he finds himself broke and out on the street-as well as missing his family, perhaps.Royal concocts a plan. He convinces his estranged wife Etheline (Anjelica Houston) that he is dying of cancer and has only six weeks to live. His one wish, he tells her, is to be reunited with his family.Meanwhile, the Tennenbaum children, unraveling for years, after meteoric success as adolescents, are also returning home. While Richie, a former pro tennis champion, returns home upon word of his father's imminent death, his siblings turn to their childhood home in desperation. The oldest son, Chas (Ben Stiller) was a financial genius in grade school and made a small fortune before adolescence by breeding `dalmation mice.' He was a millionaire before adulthood and later twice sued his father and had him disbarred and jailed. In the past year, though, his wife was killed in a plane crash and he has become fanatically protective of his two young sons Ari and Uzi (Grant Rosemeyer and Jonah Meyerson). He moves in, uninvited, with his mother. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) is an even more fascinating case. A child playwrite, she received a $50,000 grant in ninth grade and enjoyed a run of early successes. Since marrying stodgy psychologist Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), though, her life has been in collapse. She, too, flees to the protection of her mother's house. Richie finally has to admit that he has been in love with Margot as long as he can remember and that it was her marriage which led to the humiliating end of his tennis career.Royal has an additional incentive in getting back into the family home and the family mindset. Etheline, who kicked Royal out after 10 years of marriage and wrote a best-seller called `Raising a Family of Geniuses,' went on to be an archaeologist (as Anderson's mother was). She is now considering a proposal by longtime friend and accountant Henry Sherman (Danny Glover).With the help of longtime family servant Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), Royal engineers his return to the family home and begins working to regain the love and trust of his family. Since his sensitivity does not seem to have improved much over the years, this proves to be difficult. In the end, though, Anderson and Owen Wilson (with whom he wrote the script, and who also plays the neighbor, Eli Cash) bring home a satisfying and not overly-sentimental ending.Anderson, as he showed in Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, is not afraid to try some unusual techniques, such as rapid cutting, strange camera angles and a sophisticated use of light and shadow. Yet, trying to put a finger on just what Anderson is saying, can be difficult.The film gets much of its comic clockwork timing from the dysfunctional and disjointed family members and the way they interact (or fail to do so) with each other and the world. Paltrow, as Margot, is the most obvious example. Stunted by the stigma Royal put on her as a child for being adopted (`.and THIS is my ADOPTED daughter, Margot,' she still sees Royal introducing her as a child.), she has never developed full-fledged emotional outlets. While I am guessing some reviewers may pan her for a two-dimensional, bland performance, I am certain she gave Anderson exactly what they were both looking for. She stares vacantly, through eyes heavily outlined in black. Frequently Anderson uses lighting to give her solid black holes for eye sockets-as if reinforcing that her childhood has left her a one- or two-dimensional cartoon character with dots for eyes, like Little Orphan Annie. Alienated from her father and alienated from her loving but stodgy husband, she apparently has turned to passionate flings and smoking as escapes. Yet, Anderson's interesting camera work seems to tell us that this, too, leaves her alienated. In one of his more striking shots, Margot and Eli (with whom she has been having a secret affair) meet downtown. They stand far enough apart so that each is barely in the outer edge of the frame, with the towering, impersonal skyscrapers of the hostile city separating them and dominating the shot.There IS a cartoonish feel to the characters on one level. Like in a cartoon, violence is used casually (although not often) and without permanent consequences. Richie attempts suicide, hacking both wrists hideously, but slips out of the hospital and clandestinely returns home in less than a day. When an enraged Chas chases Eli after his car wreck prior to Etheline's marriage, the priest is knocked down the stairs, breaking an ankle. `That's not SERIOUS, is it?' asks Raleigh, who then asks if there is a priest `on call.'The emotional quagmires of the characters are addressed, to some degree, with resolutions that are acceptable and perhaps even satisfying. Yet Anderson and Wilson resist the temptation to get sentimental-and has the sense not to let the mutual infatuation of Richie and Margot reach consummation.Space is not sufficient here to go into a full analysis of Anderson's technique and possible intentions. Suffice to say, the film operates on several levels and is entertaining now matter which level one views it. (By the way, rewind and make sure you get to read Royal's tombstone inscription at the end!) The cast is outstanding, and Anderson's knack for using obscure 1960s rock, coupled with his emerging talent for film editing and storytelling, make The Royal Tennenbaums one of the more original and intriguing comedies of the new millennium.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very clever dark comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best "dysfunctional family" movies that I have ever seen. It is funny, poignant, and very interesting to watch. The humor comes from jokes that are clever, ironic and dark. At first, I just laughed at the witty and direct verbal jokes, but then I began to have a devilish grin on my face while watching some scenes. SPOILER- For example, when Richie tries to commit suicide, I felt sorry for him, but I also irrationally chuckled at the indirect dark humor. Richie and Margot were my favorite characters in this movie. I think their eccentric love story is the most interesting sub-plot in this movie. I really admire Owen Wilson's comic writing, because it is very unique. Instead of the usual slapstick comedy, he is able to create humor by satirically mocking people's eccentric sides.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above and beyond anything else out there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually have no problem rating 99% of the movies I see. "Das Boot" is a '10', the "Thomas and the Magic Railroad" is a '1,' and lots of others fall in between. But then, every so often, I come across a film that is beyond my ability to score. It's as if rating the movie, no matter what number I gave it, would somehow be demeaning --more so towards myself than the film. "Being John Malkovich" was unratable, as was "Microcosmos," "The Graduate," and a handful of others. Well, I've just added "The Royal Tenenbaums" to my list of films that defy my ability to rate them.I could tell you about the plot, but why bother? It's not really all that important. What is important is that Wes Anderson goes above and beyond the tremendous truck load of garbage that Hollywood dumps on us each year, and gives us something that actually makes us use our brains. Those who have been living the unexamined life will find this film boring and pointless, and will hate it. Those who rightly discern the cesspool that is modern film making will see this film, will also find it boring and pointless, then stand-up and cheer! Why? Because every single stinking film that comes out of Hollywood is boring and pointless, but they try ever so hard to be "meaningful." Here's a film the revels in extolling the virtues of nothingness, and never pretends to represent anything even remotely close to having a meaning.This film has one of the most amazing ensemble casts ever assembled in modern times. Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Danny Glover and Bill Murray all very willingly take part in this boring, pointless film. Why did they do it? Couldn't they read the script and see how stupid the whole thing was? Yes, they read the script, they saw the stupidity, and they JUMPED at the chance to play some small part in it. They weren't prodded or cajoled or bribed into making this film, and I think some of them would have gladly paid Wes Anderson to be in it.We are "outsiders" whose only connection to Hollywood is throwing money at the box office to see the next multi-million dollar summer blockbuster. We want to be entertained, damn it, and you clowns in California better get it right! More often then not, they do, and we get to watch such cinematic masterpieces like "Scooby Doo" and "Gold Member." But when you're inside of the Hollywood system, you get to see all the sewage which spews forth onto the big screen for what it truly is: crap. But of course the unspoken rule is that you NEVER say it's crap, instead you speak of the artistry, the meaning, the wonder that is a Hollywood film, but deep down you know it just another load of excrement for the masses.Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, though a million miles away from being anything close to a Hollywood insiders, understands that Hollywood is the King of Crap. It's not really all that difficult to figure out, but it does require some careful thought, examination, and critical thinking --skills which most Americans simply do not have. (More honestly, they do have those skills, just choose not to use them.) So Wes and Owen concoct a film that flaunts nothingness, but in doing so becomes something."The Royal Tenenbaums" is not a side-splitting comedy, it is not a special-effects extravaganza, nor is it an action-adventure. It is not any category of movie that currently exists. Well, there is this category I call the "comedy of the absurd," and that's probably the best label you can give it. If there is a point to this film, it is that life is pointless, and making films about it is even more so. Certainly this is a rather pessimistic take on things, but it is an honest viewpoint of the writer and director. They go out of their way to avoid anything that might make this film "meaningful." It just isn't there! Life is absurd, pointless, meaningless, a joke. The only character in this film who sees it in this light is Royal Tenenbaum himself, but he does not arrive at this conclusion through careful thought and analysis, but rather by the complete avoidance of anything even remotely close to self-examination. He's very happily, carelessly living the unexamined life, while the rest of the family does their darndest to make "something" of themselves, and fail miserably.Not only does this film speaking to the absurdity of life, but it is also a poke in the eye of Hollywood. That's why the film critics, actors and directors love this film while most of the public can't stand it. It is the ultimate "in" joke. To us, Hollywood is some magic fairyland where magicians wave their magic wands and produce fantastic entertainment that transports us to different times and places. To those who work there, it is a meat grinder and a whore house, but one that pays extremely well.The performances that the actors gave in this film where some of the best I've ever seen in any film. Gene Hackman is fantastic, and Gwyneth Paltrow is amazing. I've never seen the two of them shine so brightly. All the other cast members give equally brilliant performances, but Hackman and Paltrow have the meatier roles, and make the most of it.Please, don't see this film. You won't like it.My Rating = It doesn't really matter...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie seemed like a breath of fresh air. Amid all the cookie-cutter movies coming out of la-la land, this little gem is unique and interesting. It's not meant to be a laugh a minute comedy, but a sort of understated, quirky, chuckle to yourself movie. I liked this movie because it's different. The soundtrack is really good, too. If you like a good, odd movie, then this is the best and oddest to come along in awhile. There are a lot of reviews likening this one to Rushmore, and while it's similar in it's look and feel, I liked the characters in The Royal Tenenbaums more. I also thought that this movie had a better ending than Rushmore. All in all this is a very entertaining movie that I am going to watch again. In fact, I thik I'll go watch it right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It was so well written, acted, and directed. I have never seen a film like this before. It cannot be compared to any other movie, it stands alone. Gene Hackman was brilliant, I adored his day with his grandchildren. Anyone that loves hidden treasures will love this film. When I first saw this movie, there were two other people in the theatre, I thought that meant it would be awful. I never knew how how wrong I would be. I laughed and cried during this movie. I did not want it to end. Most movies I sit that and look at my watch wondering when will it ever end, I was sad when this was over. Go see it, you'll love it. It was great fun!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, let me say to all the people who thought this movie was boring, that maybe you should just stick to Zoolander and other movies of the same ilk. Because a movie is "boring" doesn't make it a bad movie (2001 is extremely "boring," but is one of the few movies I would consider perfect). This is not meant to be a laugh-a-minute comedy. It is (much like Rushmore) a comedic drama. From a movie-making perspective, Tenenbaums is top-notch. Great editing, cinematography, writing, and use of music. Likewise the acting was very good. The only place were this movie fell a little short was that it seemed to me that it tried to be like Rushmore too much (given it's the same director, but Bottle Rocket wasn't visually similar to Rushmore like this one is). This hardly detracts from the movie's good points, and there really is so much to love about the film in general. Overall, I give the film a 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent performances by a strong cast, great dialogue, a whimsical style and some emotional depth make this a satisfying, entertaining and endearing film. Gene Hackman and Angelica Houston deliver what we've come to expect, but Owen Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow surprised me with the depth and craft they brought to their roles. I was only slightly disappointed by Ben Stiller who's role and performance seemed a little unidimensional. The screeplay was excellent, giving the film the emotional substance and complexity of a stage play and along with the art direction, the whimsy of an Edward Gorey cartoon. One wishes one could be part of this eccentric New York family in their amazing victorian NY house, as much a character in the film as any actor, with all it's interesting stain glass windows, intricate staircases and pennant topped turrets. All the characters are both likeable, neurotic and complex, one wishes one could somehow become their friends and love them back to mental health overcoming the rend in their psyches from the breakup of the marriage of the patriarch and matriarch of this hurting but loving family. This film makes you appreciate your own family, your parents and your kids more, and forgive their foibles. This film could have benefited from a little more length used for some character development of some of the non-family roles (as hinted to in the cut scenes in the DVD).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this movie. The cast is excellent, the script is really good and the directing was great. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is a nice film that involves a big, terrific cast. Gene Hackman is real enjoyable as Royal. Anjelica Huston was pretty good as Etheline even though I would have liked to have seen more of her character. Ben Stiller was hilarious as usual. He was toned down a couple of notches for this film, but still funny. Gwyneth Paltrow fit the role or Margot well. I wouldn't necessarily say that she was anything great, but just good. Again, I would have liked to have seen a little more of Luke Wilson's character, but I'm glad of how much I saw because a little more may have been too much. Two thumbs up for Owen Wilson not only for his performance, but also for his work behind the cameras. Bill Murray and Danny Glover were alright, nothing great and surely not as good as the rest of the cast. I also really liked seeing Grant Rosenmeyer and Jonah Meyerson (Ari and Uzi). The first time I watched "Royal", I thought that it was very good but not exactly great. The second time I watched it, it had hit great. I don't know if I would rank it as (currently) #185 of greatest movies of all time, but it is one of the better ones out there. The different stories and backgrounds behind each Tenenbaum are clever and exciting. The characters are well developed and actually seem real. Isn't that strange? Not that this really had a huge impact on the film, but I did like the music that was used. It fit in so well to the story and really added that little magic ingredient. I didn't think that I would compare this film to "American Beauty" because that was terrible and "Royal" is so terrific, but I am going to say something real quick. The two are much alike in the same dysfunctional family plot, but "Beauty" was over-hyped and recognized so much that it turned out to be just talk. "Royal" on the other hand, has a lot of good things about it and I can't say that I've heard that much critical acclaim. Well, that just figures.So, final outcome of this film is that the script is very powerful and amusing and the cast comes together so well to work as if they were a real family. Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, nice work and I hope to see you two again soon. I definitely recommend this film for just about anybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am tempted to shoot at the nay-sayers with regard to this film by saying that if you didn't like it, you didn't get it. But, I won't. (Although, in essence, I suppose I just did.)There's a line in the DVD commentary, describing the action of Margot's play, where Wes Anderson points out that the Bear has apparently shot the Zebra and no one's really quite sure why. I think that aptly sums up why I can't stop watching this movie. I'm not exactly sure why I love these characters, but I do.These characters are at some points shallow and unsympathetic. Hell, Royal himself couldn't be a bigger bastard if he had a text book and a ten-week tutorial, but throughout the course of the film, I came to care about him and all the rest of the Tenenbaums and their inner circle of social misfits.A word to the wise: THIS IS NOT NATURALISM. If you want strict reality, go down to the supermarket and watch people pick out fruit. Real life is not without it's oddities and quirks, but personally I'd rather watch the Tenenbaums for two hours.The humor is very dry. It is also very subtle and at times bordering on genius.The actors were all outstanding. How Gene Hackman was not nominated for his work in this movie, I'll never know. I'll take Royal Tenenbaum over John Nash any day.As for Wes Anderson, there are vital organs I would gladly give up to work with this guy. "Bottle Rocket", for a first film, was outstanding. "Rushmore" displayed a growth as a film maker that was impressive. "Tenenbaums" proves that this guy has the potential to rise as one of the true unique cinematic visionaries of his generation. For his use of color and music alone he should be commended. To say that I look forward to his next film would be a drastic understatement.As for the nay-sayers...let 'em say nay, fewer persons to stand behind in line for the next one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much has been made of this movie humor (or lack thereof). I'll admit that there are not not an abundance of belly laughs in this movie. But this movie works beautifully as a comedy-drama. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I won't go into specific details. I will say that Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Luke Wilson and Gwenneth Paltrow all give superb performances. In fact, there's not a week performance in the entire movie.Special mention should be given for the first several minutes during which the characters are introduced by the narrator. This is possibly the best opening to a film that I have ever seen.Finally, I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates original, quirky characters and to those who do not need multiple explosions, high-speed chases, gratuitous nudity, gross out gags, etc. to enjoy a movie.I gave this movie a perfect ten stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Royal Tenenbaums is a beautifully melodramatic nostalgia that delivers laughs, cries, and pure joy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a summer filled with cliched franchise films such as The Mummy Returns and Jurassic Park III, it's always pleasing to see a movie directed by someone with a unique view and written by someone with true talent. I really enjoyed Rushmore (one of director Wes Anderson's two previous films, the other being an amateur cult classic named Bottle Rocket) and was looking forward to a new film made with his original style, which relies on wit and creativity rather than visual effects and aimless thrills. I got all this -- and much more -- in The Royal Tenenbaums, a film about an... eccentric father who ignores his three child prodigies as they are growing up, separates -- but does NOT divorce -- with his wife, and then returns to try and reconcile with his family. Anderson uses bright colors and nostalgic music to convey a timeless mood -- although, if close attention is paid, it is evident that the film takes place after the year 2000 -- and the dialogue is just plain brilliant! All performances are top-notch, and the cast (which includes Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Owen and Luke Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Bill Murray) makes a perfect ensemble. I also don't believe that anyone who has seen it can honestly say he didn't enjoy it. The movie is sheer pleasure! Yes, there are a few "gritty" moments: a suicide attempt is portrayed in it (I will not say by whom, but if you watch attentively I'm sure you will guess) but it is used in an artistic realm, instead of a gratuitous fashion. Another great aspect of the film is that every character has depth and realism and is developed to his/her full potential. In the end all loose ends are tied and the audience walks off with a satisfied mind. I suppose there is no other way to describe how excellent this movie is, so I will leave it at this: rent it... buy it... borrow it. Just watch it!Overall rating: 10/10</fullReview>

I loved the film that much that like Eli Cash (O.Wilson) I wanted to a be a Tenenbaum. The film is interestingly put together and there is a certain unreal nature to it. the two writers write such good characters that the film is a classic. Bottle Rocket was a good film, Rushmore was a cult classic The Tenenbaums is a bona fide classic. Long live Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson for making American indie cinema refreshing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the mediocre films that flood the cinemas now, this film was a refreshing break from dull scripts and soppy character development- like in Pearl Harbour and in other large budget mainstream films (this being the main problem). Hollywood is just getting too big and basic, relying on special effects and big stars like Russel Crowe to pull the crowds. However, in saying this, there are several big stars in the Royal Tenenbaums but the story is original, and complex enough to compliment the script development, which can be very sharp. Note the rather endearing underacting of some of the actors but, which fits the characters well and makes you like them even more.Despite not liking Gene Hackman much, his performance was very good and I may be influenced by my attraction to Gwyneth Paltrow, in liking this film but I would recommend this to people tired of the lacklustre hollywood films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films which I particularly enjoy, because I hope that I'm relating to it somewhat more than the majority of the audience, many of whom failed to laugh when I did; maybe they cried when I did, but I didn't hear 'em. This is not the greatest movie ever made. There are flaws, such as the some of the credits appearing at the start of the movie, and Luke Wilson's scars on his wrist are not genuine. I jest. There aren't any flaws at all! A great ensemble cast, although I still don't like Bill Murray, pull off a great, if offbeat comedy. The Wilson Brothers continue to impress with their upcoming talents. Danny Glover seems to be entering the Morgan Freeman school of quality acting. Ben Stiller seems tailor-made for this part; I can really imagine him living his life entirely in a red track suit. Gwyneth Paltrow has finally endeared herself to me, after several films which made me cringe. She looks perfect in her deadpan role, and sexier than ever before (except perhaps when singing 'Bette Davis Eyes' in 'Duets'. Finally, Gene Hackman continues to prove what a great actor he is. I can't imagine why he wasn't Oscar-nominated for this film. This is not a typical Hollywood movie, and I expect this cast knew they were on to a good, if unusual, thing when they saw the script. Oh, and I forgot Angelica Huston. She may be remembered for the Addams, but this family isn't far off as an oddball clan. I particularly liked the jokes(?) regarding all of the childrens' right hand deformities; and the same cab firm turning up all the time. I didn't understand that gag, but it was funny all the same. Told in 'chapter' form, it is already suited for DVD. Hard to imagine extras, though - it's such a complete piece of work that it doesn't need enhancements. I know that Woody Allen is of the opinion that a movie should stand or fall on its own. Well, this is one that does - and I guess is reminiscent of Woody's films at times. Very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is more than simply a movie, this is a film that is also a novel, which is also a series of images more reminiscent of striking portraits than acting scenarios.That is not to say that the film is style over substance, with an ensemble cast only matches by 'Ocean's Eleven', The Royal Tenenbaums is packed with fantastic performances (some their best ever) from Ben Stiller, Gwenyth Paltrow, Anjelica Hutson, Danny Glover, Luke and Owen Wilson and Bill Murray.But, of course, the standout is Gene Hackman in one of his greatest ever performance. Royal Tenenbaum is a bizarre and complex man who does have good intentions lurking somewhere in his body, but he just can't find them.It is packed with witty lines, laugh-out-loud moments, fantasticly rich and detailed characters and a soundtrack that is fantastic.This is so far my pick for film of 2002.</fullReview>

One with a steady tempo and many seamlessly blended harmonies. Most importantly, though, was its beautiful melody that was sometimes playful, sometimes serene, but most often simple and honest, making The Royal Tenenbaums pure poetry in film and a genuine, unabashed reflection on humility and humanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost, I would say that the Royal Tenenbaums mocks hyper-successful urban hipsters more than it celebrates or attempts to appeal to them. I mean, look at these people; they're ultimately not successful, they haven't done much with their genius, and their money has kept them so emotionally sheltered that they are 30-year-old wounded and alienated children.It's not a cruel indictment--there's little point in being nasty unless you're a Marxist. It's more of a modern half-parody like the Simpsons-we're morons, we've done some things wrong, but we're good people with ultimately typical problems (growing up, expectations, parents, sexuality, intellectual and emotional focus, loss). If the performances seemed strained, it was because these people were emotional midgets. And I also think that is why the music, scenery, location and wardrobe were all so ambiguous--the Tennenbaums were basically children living in a mess of experiences from the 70's, 80's, 90's, and 00's.I don't think this is a postmodern attack on literature at all. I think the book metaphor was just to highlight the gap between their intellectual and emotional selves. That's why they all ultimately failed intellectually--their emotional selves had never been looked after. And I think Anderson is trying to say that that sort of hollow intellectualism, that a heart without a head, is useless. It is a documentation and reconciliation with a way that a lot of people live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precocious Cult Comedy + Deep Emotional Resonance Excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I can see this style of storytelling begin to wear thin on plenty of jaded/cynical types, I think The Royals does an excellent job of presenting a John Irving-like "dysfunctional" family on the big screen better than any actual Irving film adaptation has.Plenty of people have bemoaned the precocious and cheeky nature of Anderson/Wilson's "off beat" characters in Rushmore &amp; The Royal Tennenbaums, and I can somewhat see the point; continuing in this direction/style may lead these two talented writers to inadvertently parody themselves. But in their defense, The Royals actually *feels* more like the big emotional opus that they might have written *before* their more accessible and popular Rushmore, and was realized with confidence as a result of their second films' successes. I'd love to read more on these fellows and see who came first, the Royals or Max Fischer.And anyone who has cited PT Anderson's Magnolia when evaluating The Royals hits on something solid. The *real* emotional resonance of Richie's suicide attempt and the *real* trauma inflicted on the kids' young &amp; adult lives by their father (not just simply the wonderfully comedic and laugh out loud bits by the stunning Gene Hackman, but the *true* ramifications of his actions/inactions) digs deep, and gives the film a seriousness that cannot be ignored. Relegating the kids to supporting players in the "Isn't Royal Tennenbaum The Funniest Dirtbag Dad *Ever*?! Show" would have been foolish and superfluous - Anderson and Wilson give the whole family such great depth and emotional tug that it may offset the verve and flow of the comedic aspects of the film, but it also pushes this great work into something more special, something memorable. Like Magnolia, people were walking out of the theater or sighing heavily at the alleged preposterousness of it all - but both films cut so deep and memorably that I can't help but hold both in the highest esteem. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be a controversial call, but I definitely think that Royal Tenenbaums is Wes Anderson's greatest picture. Bottle Rocket is both excellent and funny. Rushmore is hilarious, mature and complex. Tenenbaums is not only funny, mature and complex as well, but it stresses pure human emotion.The characters that are well rounded and seem to be acted genuinely (i.e.- Royal, Etheline, Chas, Henry) are done so well that you care about them even if they seem dispicable. The characters that seem deadpan are given a certain element, be it an entire scene, a certain look, or just having the benefit of others talking about them to make you feel what they feel, much like the people you know who do not seem to ever show emotion, but every now and then, they let on and you get a glimpse of how they really feel.It is a comedy that is stylistically clever and very touching.</fullReview>

It isn't easy to hum along, true. But it's like a masterpiece of painting you can stand in front of and think of each little brush stroke the artist made.I'd like to see how much each of the well known actors (many Wilson brothers...) has been paid for this film, but I don't think that any of them was in the movie for money. There are few films today, where you can truly feel that the actors wanted to be in the film just for fun (or art...).I recommend everyone who wrote those bad critics, to watch the cuts, the pictures, the images, the lines and the scenes of this movie and compare it to some music examples of the 60s - very suggestive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indie, or quasi-indie, American cinema is just as concerned with underexplored places and feelings as French or Iranian cinema (don't listen to the critics, American cinema is fantastic and rough these days). The Royal Tenenbaums, sort of caught in time and place (what decade is it really? where are they really?) and between their "thought and expression," (lots of VU on the soundtrack) are prime examples of that American mystery.Maybe the quest for auteurishness is self-conscious--it thematically and aesthetically fits together too well--and a bit distracting, but there are some fascinating, emotive things at work here. Some obvious symbolism, broken limbs, climbing up buildings, childish clothing, the book motif for people who don't know much about themselves, whatever, is still moving.And the humor, well, who wants to take the pains of rich geniouses THAT seriously. They're not starving to death. They're intelligent, but very normal. Well, Wes Anderson's normal. Second city America normal. You know, like us, emotionally infantile and brilliant or the other way around. No inbetween.And if you don't like it, I'll kick you in the gut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A subtle masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not every day that every element of a film comes together in just the right mixture-but this is such a film. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is being marketed as a comedy, but "Scary Movie" it's not. Those who are looking for belly laughs can keep looking. Instead, Tenenbaums revels in the type of subtle humor rarely seen in a mainstream release nowadays-the type that hurts beneath the surface.The film centers on the Tenenbaum family, who've been affected by irresponsible father Royal (Gene Hackman). While Royal and wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) are divorced when their oldest son is 12, Royal's involvement with his children is suspect from the beginning. He shoots his oldest son in the hand with a BB gun on a lark and trashes his adopted daughter's first play with a review more appropriate from a professional critic. After the divorce, Etheline pushes her three children to excel-and it works, for a while. The kids become famous for their precociousness-Chas as an entrepreneur, Margot as a playwright and Richie as a tennis pro. As adults, they fall apart. Chas (Ben Stiller) becomes obsessed with his health after his wife's death, overprotecting his two sons. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) stops writing and chain-smokes in the bathroom for hours on end. Richie (Luke Wilson) has an on-court breakdown and takes up residence aboard a ship, drifting around the world. For different reasons, all three move back into their childhood home-as does Royal, who's been kicked out of his apartment and feigns terminal cancer in order to regain access to his family's lives. The film is brilliantly acted by an ensemble cast that also includes Owen Wilson, Bill Murray and Danny Glover. It would have been easy to turn these characters into caricatures of a dysfunctional family, but no one takes the easy way out here. All, especially Hackman, portray real, sympathetic characters in spite of their many flaws.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As one who regards American movies as the greatest waste of resources on the planet bar none, and is never too bashful to say so, it does not come easy to say that The Royal Tenebaums is one of those occasional sparkles that tells the world that they can REALLY do it if they want to. A humorous, imaginative, original and creative exploration of that most mysterious human institution, The Family. Not a moral judgment in sight, no Cosby-inspired cheesy hypocrisy, no spotlight hogging "star" (all played well, Special Mention to Hackman), no profound philosophical speeches, no gratuitous cheap thrills. All class. The plot includes almost all vices that siblings of lying, deceitful, duplicitous and manipulating parents experience. There is absolutely no justification for this disparate bunch of misfits to relate to each other on any level, other than they belong to a common, and not even genetic, heritage. Even drug drenched hangers-on have a place by the fire, despite committing an heinous atrocity to a family member. This is a movie that can heal wounds, without surgery, and will say something to everyone with family ties. Go on....you know you want to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Anderson's Best Yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is that rare movie gem that leaves viewers thinking, "I shouldn't be laughing at this," in between their cackles and grins.Wes Anderson is the young and brilliant man in the director's chair. The Royal Tenenbaums towers over his last film, the superb Rushmore, leaving no doubt that more masterpieces are yet to come.The greatest part of the film isn't the story - it's the characters.Gene Hackman is exceptional as Royal Tenenbaum, the estranged father of three child geniuses who are now grown. It's beyond me how he wasn't nominated for an Academy Award.Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow and especially Luke Wilson are extraordinary as the three now adult Tenenbaums.Anjelica Huston shines as their mother, and Owen Wilson (who also co-wrote the screenplay) playing their childhood friend Eli Cash, is hilarious, as always. It is just impossible to name one performance as a standout, as all in the cast are absolutely radiant and deserve praise and honors.The characters are so out there, yet still believable and even familiar at times.They showed some traits that are likewise found in my friends and myself, which made me feel all the more guilty for laughing at their misfortunes.I suppose, however, that that's what this movie tries to do.Some people have told me that this film is too dark and "offbeat," but I think it tries to get us to take life less seriously and sit back and laugh at ourselves, even when everything is going wrong.Call it an utterly dark comedy or a hilarious drama, it doesn't even matter: The Royal Tenenbaums is an all-out masterpiece.</fullReview>

If you went to see this because Danny Glover is one of your favorite comedic actors, you'll be disappointed. If you like those moronic Jim Carrey movies (Truman Show and Man on the Moon excepted), you'll be disappointed. If you like any movies that are further away from a first sequel to an original movie, you'll be disappointed by this. If you don't like to think, you'll be disappointed. If you think the new Steve Martin movies are intellectual, you'll be disappointed. If you like crustless mayo sandwiches on wonderbread, you'll be disappointed.All that being said, this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. While I loved Rushmore, it's my opinion that this is even better. Anderson's camera angles are nothing short of an artform themself. The acting is great (even Ben Stiller didn't make me ill like he normally does). Anderson introduces new character in a unique way that proves to be efficient timewise and adequate enough to let you understand who these people are.In short, if you like the offbeat and arent afraid of thinking, you'll enjoy this film. If you enjoy the normal Hollywood fodder, stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rushmore was a highly enjoyable movie, but Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have really outdone themselves with this amazing piece of work. IMHO it's the best film of 2001, and while I don't think it's gotten the critical recognition it deserves I am thrilled to see that it's earned an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. The movie gives us a wonderful array of characters, and presents their intertwined stories in a creative and charming manner. Everything from the story book narration to the shots of magazine covers, book covers, etc. filling the screen to the slick editing to the mesmerizing soundtrack enhances the film considerably and that would still not add up to so much were it not for the superb script, the confident, skillful direction and terrific performances from top to bottom. I was really hoping the cast would get a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Best Ensemble, but although that didn't happen everyone should still be commended. Gene Hackman is exceptional as wayward patriarch Royal, Anjelica Houston earns sympathy as long-suffering Etheline, Ben Stiller, in a rare dramatic role, shines as temperamental Chas, Gwenyth Paltrow is compelling playing rootless Margot, Luke Wilson breaks your heart as empty Richie, Owen Wilson is remarkable in his limited screentime as self-loathing Eli Cash, and Danny Glover and Bill Murray lend great support as Henry Sherman and Raleigh St. Clair, respectively.

		<fullReview>Its works. Much in the style of 'Rushmore', the movie delivers the humor in a very plot based comedy. The twists and turns of the story has the jokes unraveling slowly over the course of the movie. I have to say, in comparison to many of the recent releases, this movie kept me entertained from start to finish. I couldn't guess the next line or coming plot twists once. Its the story of a very eccentric family dealing with the impact of change and the denial they have been living in. Anjelica plays a very dry character, deep in sarcastic wit. Ben a very complicated man dealing with the pitfalls of life. Owen and Luke show glimpses of the bizarre, yet down to earth. Hackman, what can you say about Hackman. He's always on in this type of comedy. Gwen was left as a complicated yet intriguing, beautiful woman. Don't expect lounge singing antics from Bill, he only plays a supporting role. This isn't slap stick but I would put one of the scenes at the top 10 of my "most hilarious sketch or scenes" from a movie. Its not necessarily the kind of movie that needs to be seen on the big screen. I thought to myself, "it would have been nice sitting on the couch with my honey watching this one at home". All in all, a light comedy with a couple harsh scenes of reality. Well written and a great cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing Rushmore when it first came out expecting a second Bottle Rocket, but I walked away feeling that Rushmore fell short. After another viewing the two films were on par, and after a few more Rushmore had become my favorite film of all time.I kept this in mind going into The Royal Tenenbaums. I couldn't help wanting another Rushmore, and I left feeling let down (as did a few other members of the audience who walked out during the touching final minutes). The film was much more up-front with it's human misery than Rushmore was, plus Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson's humor is so simple and so subtle it's almost as if you have to know it's coming to really laugh at it. I found myself thinking in my head during many scenes that the next time I watch this film I'm going to be dying of laughter.This was true upon my second viewing. I was anticipating moments and finding new details to enjoy. There was more than one scene where I was the only one laughing in the theater. The film really opens up the second time one sees it, due in no small part to Wes Anderson's brilliant ability to maintain continuity throughout the picture, both from the visuals as well as the music. Also, the misery seemed to give way to aching tenderness.Finally, the acting was amazing from the entire cast. Although I feel Danny Glover has been under-appreciated for his role as Etheline's love interest (and Royal's rival) Henry Sherman. I propose nothing short of an Academy Award for best supporting actor.I'm looking forward to future viewings of The Royal Tenenbaums as much as I have enjoyed repeated viewings of past films.

		<shortDescription>Much better than I anticipated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this isn't my usual genre of film, I was really suprized when I decided to go see this movie with a friend. I can honestly say that it was really enjoyable and it's been a long time since I have seen something that truly merits the word enjoyable. Rushmore, (I understand was written by the same people) was kind of wierd and I didn't really understand it, but this film is a new addition to my top ten. The characters were complex, cartoonish and human all the same time, especially Ben Stiller's character, Chas. He reacted the way I think I would have to the situation. True, I wouldn't sport a red sweatsuit everyday but his reaction to his father's favoritism was endearing and his character evoked the most empathy. I also liked Margot's outfit and even though it's from the 80's (my second grade teacher wore the same polo dresses she wore)I almost want to go out and buy one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic, Hilarious, and Definitely Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Royal Tenenbaums" is by far one of the smartest dark comedies ever made. Director Wes Anderson is back with his offbeat, oddball style, this time handling the subject of a seriously troubled, disfunctional family. Nearly every main character is played by a well-established actor. All-star casts can sometimes destroy a film, but in this case, every actor fits his or her part so well that you really forget you are watching Gwyneth, the Wilson brothers, and mega-stars like Hackman, Huston, and Glover.The movie follows the lives of the Tenenbaums. The father, Royal, is a deadbeat whose lack of interest in most of his children's lives has led to a long separation and almost non-existent relationship with them. When Royal and his wife Etheline separate in 1979, Etheline takes charge of the children's lives and education. Each of the three children turns into a prodigy in some way or another. Margot (Paltrow) is a young playwright, Chas (Stiller) is a financial whiz, and Richie (L. Wilson) is a tennis champ. Though each child achieves unimaginable success before the age of 20, in their adult lives they are unable to deal with any ordinary problems. All these problems seem to culminate when Royal abruptly decides he "wants his family back, damn it" and the entire family finds themselves living together for the first time in over 2 decades. As the story unfolds, the children's and Etheline's lives are shaken up by the scampish Royal. (Etheline's problems are further complicated by the fact that her friend Henry Sherman (Glover) has recently proposed to her.) It seems that Royal's dream is to restore his family, though he naturally goes about it in a very offbeat way. The results are so much fun to watch!The greatest thing about "The Royal Tenenbaums" is that everything is hilarious, tragic, desperate, and detatched all at the same time. You laughter is often interrupted with the realization that the subject matter really is very sad. However, even if you don't find the Tenenbaums as engaging as I do, it's still worth watching for the performances alone. I especially thought that Hackman, Huston, and Luke Wilson were absolutely amazing. Danny Glover, Owen Wilson, and Bill Murray also spice up the film with their supporting roles. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got my first dose of Wes Anderson when I saw Rushmore on television a couple years ago. I was amazed. It was one of the funniest movies I had ever seen and at the same time, the plot and dialogue were both extremely clever. A little while later I saw Bottle Rocket on IFC. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as Rushmore but it was still very impressive. So, needless to say, I was pumped when I saw my first trailer for The Royal Tenenbaums.As soon as I could get to the theater, I saw it with a couple friends. While sitting there, amazed at the intelligent plot, incredible acting, and great humor, one of the kids in front of me delivered the complaint "It never ends..." He followed this up by tapping his friend on the shoulder and exiting the theater with him. There was a good 20 minutes left in the movie. My friend and I were amazed. Both of us loved the movie. How could somebody possibly walk out of this film? Later on in school, I talked to some other people about the movie. To my surprise, they weren't too fond of it.I have come to one conclusion about this film. It isn't for everyone; just people that LOVE movies. The plot in this movie is actually pretty deep at some points and I've even heard the film called "pointless". I couldn't disagree more. This is an extremely intelligent film with a good message to it.On top of all that, there is the acting. Amazing. The Wilson brothers, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltro, and the mom who's name I can't remember all deliver amazing performances. Gene Hackman, however, really shines here. This is the best performance I have ever seen from him. I must say, everyone in this movie is great. Hell, even Ben Stiller's kids are entertaining.And who can forget about Hadji? I must say, he may be the funniest character in any movie, ever. I'm serious. That's whats really great about this film. The plot gets really serious at times and its really compelling but director, Wes Anderson always knows how to throw in some quick, extremely clever humor. It's just brilliant.Basically, all I can really say about this movie is that if you haven't seen it yet, please do so right now. This movie should be remembered for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS! SPOILERS!! SPOILERS!!! The Royal Tenenbaums, the latest from director Wes Anderson, director of Rushmore. I didn't relly see it as a comedy. I saw it more as a drama with some comedic moments thrown in there. Gene Hackman is Royal Tenenbaum, the patriarch of the family. He pretends hat he is dying so he could see his children he didn't see for years, Margot, Richie and Chas.To me the most touching moments was when Richie was in the bathroom and he said he was going to kill himself. He shaved and cut his hair and took off everything that reminded him of the past. He did it because of Margot but it wasn't her fault. The other touching moment was when Royal was in the ambulance and the only person in there and saw Royal die was Chas. The person who had so much anger towards his father. I reccommend The Royal Tenenbaums for people who love Rushmore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps fifty of us watched The Royal Tenenbaums. Me and four strangers had a good laugh. I noticed the five of us didn't always laugh at the same time. Forty-five didn't laugh much at all. Sometimes I was the only person laughing. I found that amusing.TRT is written and directed by Wes Anderson. Once again, Anderson collaborates with fellow Texans Owen and Luke Wilson. Like me, Owen and Luke are from Dallas.I'm proud of this Texas triumvirate. They have there own thing going. First they collaborated on Bottle Rocket. Some critics loved Bottle Rocket. Few people saw it. The Texans followed up with Rushmore. Rushmore was a critical smash. It received a larger audience.Still, I like TRT the best. It's not as funny as Bottle Rocket. Instead, TRT is the perfect balance between the humor of Bottle Rocket and the poignancy of Rushmore.TRT is about a strange family of five. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) may or may not be dying. He needs to reconcile with his wife and kids. Wife Ethel (Angelica Houston) raised their three children on her own.Daughter Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) is adopted. Like her siblings, Margot was a wunderkind. As a young playwright, she won awards. As an adult, Margot's talent seems to have dried up. She is secretive and cold. Margot silently rebels against the family. She's smoked cigarettes since she was twelve, but no on knows. Later, we find out Margot has searched for happiness in some rather unusual ways.Chas Tenenbaum (Ben Stiller) was a financial genius at an absurd age. Father Royal once shot Chas with a pellet gun. Sounds kind of cruel? Yeah, especially since they were on the same team. Chas is openly hostile towards his dad.Richie (Luke Wilson) is the most likeable of the Tenenbaum children. He was a successful tennis player until he had a nervous breakdown on the court. The scene is like many in TRT. If you're not laughing, you're either in the wrong mood or the wrong theater. Oh, and Richie is in love with sister Margot.TRT is the most difficult of comedies. It's more than a little grim. The characters are beyond eccentric. Symbolism is tossed around liberally. Entire essays could be written on individual wardrobe selections.But, if you like dark comedies, TRT is going to eventually suck you in. There's a priceless scene in a drug addict's apartment. The paintings on the walls are easily the worst paintings ever conceived. The art depicts nightmarish images of what appear to be zombies on riding lawn mowers. Then another wall features a cow's head with a lasso around one ear. I was in tears.TRT is one of the best films of 2001. The rest of the cast includes the following: Bill Murray, Danny Glover and Kumar Pallana. Pallana (an Anderson favorite) steals several scenes. The underrated Alec Baldwin narrates.Anderson handles his ensemble cast like a pro. Hackman again solidifies himself as one of the best American character actors, living or dead. This is not a whimsical or unreasonable statement. Houston made me wonder if she needs a new agent. Why isn't she up for these roles more often? It was good to see Houston again. It was good to see The Royal Tenenbaums.-Jurassic Mark</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very touching, interesting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm amused by the people who are dismissively claiming that they "get it", and then proceed to reveal how little they understand about the film. First of all, this is not a film to be "gotten". If you are leaning forward in your seat and squinting at the screen, trying your best to understand the method behind the madness, you need to relax. This is a simple, touching portrait of a family in (extended) crisis. What makes Gene Hackman's character so different from any emotionally distant father? Why is Margot so different from your neighbor's goth-style depressed sister? It's a very simple look at the dynamics of a family (presented elegantly in the odd sort of book form), that happens to involve some "geniuses", which in this case means eccentrics. Certainly, the laughs come most often from the quirkiness of the characters. But that's not the important thing. To say you "get" this movie, and then proceed to complain that it didn't make you laugh out loud, is silly. This is not Joe Somebody, or some brainless "look, man fall down" giggle-fest. This movie defies category. Rushmore had a similar quality to it, although that excellent film is a little closer to being a clear-cut comedy than The Royal Tenenbaums is. In regards to the "cardboard cutout characters" that you can't relate to: If you can't identify with Ben Stiller's character's loss, or Eli's longing to fit in, or Gene Hackman's revelation that he has wasted long years in self-imposed exile from his family, then you're looking to hard for laughs. Or you aren't human. I'm tired of movies that show me an average-guy protagonist that is supposed to be just like me, expecting that I will identify with his very blandness, and love him for it. I can identify with the Tenenbaums, because they have the same problems us "normal people" do, and the same family struggles. They just happen to be more fun to watch. That doesn't diminish the pathos at all. In fact, I think it highlights it. You want these amusing people to be happy. Because you yourself want to be happy. If you want to watch a "comedy" or a "drama", or a "thriller" or some other prepackaged genre of movie, pick out any of the usual patronizing Hollywood productions. That all being said, I obviously enjoyed this movie. It made me think, smile, feel, and want to go back and see it again. I gave it a 9/10, because it wasn't perfect, and I liked Rushmore better, but on a second viewing, that rating might increase. Please go see it. If you end up hating it, fine. But give it a chance. By the way, did anybody notice the odd ways they played with the size of certain characters in the movie? Especially Margot. In some scenes she would shrink into a corner and seem 1/2 her size, and sometimes she filled half the screen, while Luke Wilson seemed small. Very interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! Great acting and character depth right down to the children. I think it is very easy to 'overact' when portraying eccentric characters. Ben Stiller seems to do this a lot. But even he managed to pull off a precise image that still integrates with the other members of the cast. To me, no one seemed to over shadow anyone else. Each presence was poignant and meaningful to the scene and story. A perfect indicator of excellent direction of fine performances.This film appears to be marketed as a comedy. WHY, I have no idea. There are some hilarious lines and scenes, but this movie is not "The KLUMPS" or "Meet the Parents". If you are looking for a "fun" film that is meaningless, thoughtless, and imageless, rent JOE DIRT. If you loved AMERICAN BUEATY, or MAGNOLIA... this film may be for YOU!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't think one can 'not get' this movie and still be an intelligent moviegoer. Just because you claim to like "American Beauty" doesn't make you an intellectual, unfortunately. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is very similar to its predecessor, "Rushmore" which I suppose didn't do well enough to merit its being mentioned in the trailers for this new movie. So be it. "Tenenbaums", like Rushmore, IS laugh-out-loud funny, but not in the way most movies are. The things happening in the characters' settings are often so hilarious that it's impossible to pay attention to what's being said. The movie's evades weirdness-for-its-own-sake, and succeeds in giving the light-of-heart but intelligent viewer the perfect experience: a movie free of cliche.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it is getting mixed reviews from users of this site (although, not surprisingly, most people either really loved it or really hated it), and has been mostly ignored by critics, I loved this movie. Great acting from everyone, particularly Gene Hackman. I will be extremely disappointed if he doesn't at least get a Best Actor nomination at the Oscars this year. Anjelica Huston, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Danny Glover and Bill Murray all gave fine performances, as well, though I would have liked to see more of Bill Murray's character. It seemed he was about the most normal character in the film, which I found extremely strange.In any case, I'm not surprised that a lot of people really didn't care for this movie. It's one of those movies that's either for you, or it isn't. My advice to anyone who is considering seeing this, but isn't sure based on the mixed reviews they've read here is to rent Rushmore for $2, watch that, and if you really like it, give The Royal Tenenbaums a chance. They are very similar, but not in a sequel kind of way. Think Boogie Nights and Magnolia or Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and you'll know what I mean.I plan on seeing this again soon, but my first viewing of it had me giving it nothing but praise. In the meantime, I looking forward to Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson's next project together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My New Favorite Movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen Royal Tenenbaums 3 times already (all in the past weekend), I must say, I could definitely see it again. It is by far the greatest achievement in filmmaking of 2001. Having said that, I am quite surprised by the abundance of negative comments posted by users of IMDB. Who are these people? I have only come across one person, among the many with whom I have spoken, who did not love this movie.This film is superbly acted, bringing an excellent performance out of Luke Wilson and even more surprisingly, a very watchable performance from the otherwise annoying Gwyneth Paltrow. And then there is Gene Hackman, one of the greatest actors of our time who even when unmotivated turns out great performances. Well in this one, he was nothing short of stellar. He gave life to his many brilliantly penned lines, written by Wes Anderson and the underrated actor Owen Wilson. And speaking of underrated, Ben Stiller, who is oft noted for his slapstick, funny performances, delivers an excellent performance in this role. Danny Glover, Bill Murray, and Angelica Huston round out the cast beautifully along with a criminally underused Sam Cassel.Could it be that the naysayers don't get the humor? There are many posts saying "I get it, I just don't think it is funny." I believe that they are just looking for Stiller to be a bumbling fool like in Meet The Parents, or for Owen Wilson to reprise his role from Shanghai Noon just because the two characters share a wardrobe. This is not a film that smashes jokes into your head a mile a minute. The writers are not interested in creating nonstop laughter. This is a brilliant portrayal of a man trying to be accepted by the family he abandonned, just trying to feel some love. It is about 3 children who peaked at an early age and want to get their lives back in forward motion. It is about battling demons and trying to get better. It shows us the other side of that facade of success with all its ugliness. It is definitely not for everyone, but well deserving of my 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's kind of strange. I don't know what's in this movie that makes so interesting, so entertaining. It's a good, funny satire about a dysfunctional family, the Tenenbaums. The father, Royal, is marvelously played by Hackman. But the rest of the cast is equally good, even though I must give a few bonus points to Gwyneth Paltrow for an excellent performance. Royal reminded me of Le Z?bre, the father of Alexandre Jardin (a contemporary French author), and also the main character of one of his books. Live to the limit, live to have fun.Out of 100, I gave it 81. That's ** stars on a **** stars rating system.Seen in Toronto, at the Alliance Atlantis Cumberland Cinemas, on January 15th, 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a superb work by Wes Anderson, a film rich in detail and full of incredible characters. I have not seen a film this funny all year, nor have I seen a film this moving since Magnolia. Like Magnolia, it inspires such a genuine love for every person on the screen, because you can see that they are real people. It demands involvement from the viewer, people who just want to sit back and have an experience happen to them are going to be left in the cold. Every detail of this film is important because, as becomes clear, it is the details that the characters surround themselves with that give you the best clues and insight into their identities and inner-beings. This is also a highly personal film, in that it hits you on a personal level. People with open wounds from family tragedies (and really who doesn't have these) will notice that this hits very close to home and may be put off by this, but I promise that opening up to it and giving yourself over to it will yield an unparallelled cinematic experience.</fullReview>

With outstanding performances by the whole cast, especially Gene Hackman and Luke Wilson, not to mention Bill Murray, my personal favorite, this film will have the audience laughing until they plotz, not to mention the semi-sweet dramatic parts of this movie that add so much to this film. The soundtrack and score of this film, just as in "Rushmore", add so much to the story, one has to see it to believe it. There is nothing bad about this movie.

		<fullReview>I registered tonight just so I could comment on this movie. There were only maybe 20 or so people in the theater which is kind of disappointing. I laughed out loud harder than I had ever laughed at the movies, tears streaming from my cheeks. But then ten minutes later I would be on the brink of tears, coaxed by the incredible soundtrack. I found the characters to be extremely lifelike; all performances were flawless. I can't say I've ever seen a movie that took me from one extreme to another emotionally like the Tenenbaums. Even the very unique way the store is told, like from a book or directly from the score. I plan on running out to rent all the other Wes Anderson's movies, the only shame being that there are only two of them, Rushmore and Bottle Rockets. Some very unique movies aren't for everyone, usually hitting the wrong chords with movie go-ers just out to laugh, not expecting the wonderful roller coaster effect present in this movie. It's movies like this that everyone hopes for but never expects, like you've been waiting a long time to see such a movie, but never knew it. This movie was just what I needed at this point in my life. Like another reviewer said, take the gamble and go see this movie.</fullReview>

"Royal" is a tad darker than Rushmore in mood and characters, death is more of a subject here, but the characters as always will warm you inside eventually in their unique and quirky ways. Cinemagraphically it is shot like Rushmore, same muted backgrounds and clothing, I suppose to draw focus more on the characters. Beautifully dark and light movie at the same time.

This year its Royal Tenenbaums. A few years ago it was Rushmore. And is it me, or does Gene Hackman get better with age? He's on a roll, Heist, Behind Enemy Lines, and now Royal Tenenbaums. This film showcases the extreme end of the dysfunctional family and goes full forward like a runaway train, delivering full blown laugh after laugh. Unfortunately the train slows down towards the end and so do the laughs. Just not enough of the real stars, Hackman, Murray, Glover, etc...But still a barrel of laughs. I give this film 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a wonderful experience on so many levels. all the characters fascinate, I loved the almost fairy tale quality to it, the redemption of the characters, the mending of broken relationships. Gene Hackman steals every scene he is in, his performance is flawless. the movie has the feel of the comedies from way back, all the minor players are hysterically funny, Pagoda, the short, fat Indian almost wordless houseman, stands on his head for no reason and always wears pink pants and spies on the family and reports in monosyllables to Royal, the long gone father. The convoluted plot details and personal history of each family member add to the fleshing out of the characters. Anjelica Huston, in one of her best ever roles, shows how gracefully and wonderfully she has aged and relishing the part, brings a wonderful wit to her complicated character, it is amazing what she can do with a smile. 8 out of 10 for this great film, one of a kind.</fullReview>

Really people!? I mean, most of you are doing a pretty good job, but there were several that just ridiculed this work of art, basically screaming to the world what a simple-mided imebcile they are. Go watch some TV or something. I don't want to rip into anyone too much, although that guy who felt he was "tricked" by the advertising is tempting. Mister, if you are on the IMDB, which you obviously are, then you should be able to know ahead of time the type of film you are going to see. It is not a slapstick, lightheated, bring my little daughter to see movie (but in a way, its not NOT that kind of film). It isn't Shrek, or even Legally Blonde, God forbid, it is a WES ANDERSON/OWEN WILSON film. It is a serious piece of art.But fun. And I love it....sorry about the rant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too often people hear a movie is good, and the movie falls short of their expectations. Yet this movie exceeded even my high expectations. The filming was very unique and very high quality work. This movie was so good that I went back the next day to see it. I rarely see movies twice, and have seldom seen a movie twice in the theaters, let alone the next day. I admit not everyone will appreciate this movie. Yet if you like unique films that make you laugh, check it out. I think the reason I enjoyed it so much and why I would see it again, is that the humor was great, especially looking back after seeing the film.</fullReview>

This movie is quite possibly the worst movie of the last ten years. What a waste of Mr Hackman's talent. Owen Wilson must be really hard up for cash to have been involved in bringing this movie to fruition. I can't believe so many, supposedly, talented people agreed to be part of it.

That's because EVERYTHING is weird. From dalmatian mice to families in matching jumpsuits to incestuous relationships...it's overkill. At the beginning I was laughing, after 20 minutes I was chuckling, by the middle I sensed another hour of pointless oddities, and by the end I was bored.That said, this movie isn't terrible. It's worth watching for a few laughs. But a masterpiece? Never. Masterpieces don't try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums tells the story of an aristocratic family of gifted children that is full of dysfunction and heartache. Royal, the patriarch of the Tenenbaum family, is separated from his wife, Etheline, having left her with their children Chas, Margot, and Richie. In a desperate attempt to reconnect with his now grown children from which he is estranged after years of absence in their lives, Royal lies to Etheline, telling her that he is dying. As the story unfolds, the audience becomes familiar with each of their characters and their relationships to one another. Chas is an overprotective father who fears for the safety of his two sons. Margot, who was constantly reminded by her father that she is an adopted child, is depressed, despondent, and is married to a man who has great affection for her but for whom she feels no connection. Richie, an ex-tennis star, is deeply in love with Margot. The story of the Tenenbaum family is told with wonderfully dry wit that warms the heart, despite the sad situation being played out on screen.The Tenenbaums remind us that life is very messy. The past can be cruel. Childhood experiences can snowball until we reach adulthood, full of unresolved issues and empty places in our hearts. However, despite the messiness and the tangles of difficult memories, love, forgiveness and the beauty of life can still be experienced and enjoyed. We may never resolve all of our internal struggles and issues, but we can struggle together and find richness in our tumultuous, unpredictable lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very clever; so what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is a clever movie with a fine performance from one of my favorite actors, Gene Hackman. Other than saying it's clever, though, I'm not sure what else I can add. It's not a movie about people with quirks; it's a movie about quirks masquerading as people. When Gene Hackman's character is redeemed, it's not so much unbelievable as un-earned. The film might have been better if Bill Murray, relatively subdued in his minor part, had played Hackman's character and rejected redemption.As an example of how director Wes Anderson is clever to no apparent purpose, I point to the soundtrack, which is a wonderful melange of mostly-60s buried treasures like "These Days" by Nico and "She Smiled Sweetly" by the Stones. (He even throws in a cut from Dylan's Self Portrait; what is this s***, indeed.) While each song is welcome in my house any time, their purpose in the movie is never clear. They're good songs, and their lyrics generally fit the scenes in which they appear, but why a movie taking place in 2001 would use minor classics of the 60s is left unexplained. It does show Anderson's good taste in music, and perhaps that's it: everything about The Royal Tenenbaums demonstrates the excellence of the filmmakers, but precious little convinces me I'm watching a movie that lives up to that excellence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By all means, see this film if you're a lover of "independent film" and think that anything quirkier then quirky and devoid of anything resembling true humor is great art and you look down your nose sneeringly at "mainstream" Hollywood film-making. If you're looking for a good laugh or a good story, I would pass. It's not a comedy! There are great actors doing great acting here - Gene Hackman is the standout- but the film is all too precious and it's trying so hard to be art with a capital A that the performances are not enough to redeem it. There's also far too much background music, something that's probably necessary to sustain the "hip" feel. I'll bet if you removed the music, a lot of the people who love this film would take a closer look. This is to real comedy what a performance artist pouring Hersheys Syrup over himself is to a true comedian like George Carlin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can`t believe so many people have written so many positive comments on THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS , personally I absolutely hated this movie due to the simple reason it has a ridiculous script structure . If you`ve never seen the movie let me point out that the audience are subjected a very lengthy pre title sequence featuring character exposistion with a voice over that goes on and on . The opening credits come and go and then we`re subjected to more voice over . I can`t give a clear answer as to how long this narration lasts for but it seemed to go on for several life times . I`ve nothing against narration or voice over , indeed two of my all time favourite movies FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and APOCALYPSE NOW feature this technique which leads me to believe that it`s handeled wrongly . Another fault of Owen Wilson`s script is the characters who are members of a very very rich family full of extremely gifted children . Is it just me or are poor little rich kids the least involving subject for a film ? No doubt fans of THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS will counter act my criticisms by pointing out that the script was Oscar nominated . My reply to them would be so what ? The script was written by actor Owen Wilson and the academy voters are over represented by actors . Actor Colin Welland won a screenplay Oscar as did Emma Thompson and let us not forget Ben Affleck won an Oscar for writing GOOD WILL HUNTING . Likewise look at all the actors who have won Oscars for directing . If an actor writes down a shopping list and films their visit to the local supermarket they`d be in line for best screenplay and director . Come to think of it I`ve had more fun going to the shops than I had watching THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And it pains me to say it, but it's true. Please, Wes Anderson, don't go the way of "P.T. Anderson" and "Q. Tarantino" and get all precious and distant and hip. I was so looking forward to this film, and it has absolutely no emotional resonance to it at all. It does however put an end to several myths propagated by well paid publicity agencies; 1. That Ben Stiller can be funny. 2. That "the Wilson Brothers"- Owen and Luke- can act. 3. That Gwennie "don't hate me because I'm beautiful"- is beautiful.This film belongs to the older guys, Hackman and Huston and Glover, who seem to be the only ones NOT patting themselves on their shoulders with the self-congratulatory cocky hipness that seems to have infested the 'kids' of the story.And I use the word 'story' with extreme prejudice. There's not much of a story. There are a lot of camera moves. The music blasts in at odd places and for no apparent reason. The actors don't hold my attention. A big disappointment.</fullReview>

This movie is an entity of sucking that seems to be omnipresent and all powerful. No force alive that I know of could possibly prevent all those talented actors from being allowed to express their comic and acting geniuses so utterly. The worst scene in this movie is when two characters appear to be ready to engage in a serious fight and you feel that something exciting may finally be about to happen and they stop lie on the ground and stare at the sky. You feel that something, some force almost knew something good was about to happen and prevented it from happening in the most boring, lame way possible.The only real world analogy I can think of is if during the Cold War an acting troupe of America and the world's best talent was touring the USSR and taken captive and forced to perform Soviet run movies and plays.

I shall not repeat the plot as its done elsewhere.What I would say is that this film wastes the talent quite incredibly. There could have been a good story here, with good character development, but it fails on both counts.Never have I seen such an unfunny film. It really is bad. I'm not sure what the Director was trying to do with the film. Its fragmented with a range of unsympathetic quite weird characters that have no redeeming features. After the first 30 minutes a third of the cinema left. By an hour another third had left. By the end only 20 people remained and that sums it up. Maybe it works to US audiences but in England it fails. I really suggest you spend your money elsewhere. 0/10 its that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually avoid mainstream American so-called 'comedies', but went to see this one after hearing good word-of-mouth comments. I should have trusted my instincts. Described elsewhere as a 'quirky dark comedy', the director evidently forgot that quirky and dark do not on their own produce comedic elements. It is definitely quirky, but the 'quirkiness' feels forced, as though Anderson felt that to make up for tedious and virtually non-existent storyline he would have to inject another element into the film. It fails dismally. Even the quirkyness falls away towards the end as the inevitable American scenes of redemption are introduced. Where is the motivation for Royal to suddenly start to look out for someone apart from number one after apparently not having given a fig for the previous twenty years? The constant voice-over throughout the interminable introductory scenes is also most irritating.One may have felt some engagement with the characters had they had any genuine problems. Instead, they come across as merely indulgent rich Americans who need a good kick up the bum to get their life into order. What terrible crises precipitate their decline? If there are any, they are certainly not explained.One cannot fault the performances, and indeed Gene Hackman even manages to provide a spark of interest to his character. One day, however, Hollywood might discover the importance of a script rather than special effects, or in the case of The Royal Tenenbaums, merely a gimmick.1/10</fullReview>

After finding out about the proposal, he tries to inject himself into the family by telling them that he's dying.Director Wes Anderson starts his journey to discover his unique style.

		<shortDescription>Visuals and actors more than deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is a visual and narrative treat like most 'Wes Anderson' films; however, some of the movies characters seem half-baked and underdeveloped, even though all of them are acted out amazingly well. The plot of the movie revolves around the dysfunctional family of the Tenenbaums and how they try to bond and sort out their personal problems when they all have to live under the same roof because their father Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) is dying of terminal cancer. Recently I watched 'Anderson's' 'The Darjeeling Limited' and emphasized on how much I loved the visuals of the movie and the fact that I really needed to watch more Wes Anderson films. 'The Royal Tenenbaums' released before 'The Darjeeling Limited', however, seems to have equally amazing visual direction. Even though I know now that 'Wes Anderson' uses this particular style in almost all his movies, I cannot take this visual style for granted. This style of visual direction is utterly spectacular because it instantly sucks you into this world of the Tenenbaums. The rich color palette in this movie, the almost novel like feel, the sets, the lighting, the production design, the cinematography cannot be faulted one bit. And I can truly just watch this visual style of direction again and again because it is so effective in drawing my attention to this world of characters and tone of the movie. The narrative style of this movie is also very unique and that elevates the movie a few notches higher for me. The novel-style of a Prologue, Chapters and Epilogue really make this movie more believable and engaging, It helps the movie to easily transition between its multiple characters and story lines without seeming disjointed. I also particularly liked how each of these sections had narrations (by Alec Baldwin) inter-cut between the dialogues to make the movie feel much more like a novel, which gives the movie its own unique persona.The movie, as good as it visually and narratively, misses out a bit in terms of characters. The major reason I feel that happens is because there are so many characters and plot lines that need to be covered that we never really explore many of them properly. This reduced some of my interest in some of the stories going on in the movie and I kind of wanted to see more of some characters and less of the others. My favorite character in the movie was easily 'Royal Tenenbaum' played terrifically by Gene Hackman. Hackman's character is easily the most developed character and the one I empathized with the most. Hackman also gets some of the funniest dialogue and shares crackling chemistry with 'Kumar Pallana's' amazing 'Pagoda'. The other interesting characters include Paltrow's 'Margot', Glovers 'Henry Sherman' and Huston's 'Etheline'. Paltrow, in particular, acts really well as the most weird and unusual character in the movie. The rest of the characters in the movie are fine, but just not interesting enough to really explore. The acting is great all round, but the characters just did not engage me as much as I expected. The movie, also suffers because of some very ordinary dialogue. There is rarely anything (save for some of the dialogue between Pagoda and Royal) that makes you really laugh out loud or become really emotionally engaged (save for the last scene between Royal and Chaz) with the characters. The dialogue of the movie is not bad, but it just is not extraordinary or fresh like the movies visuals and some of its characters and this more than occasional imbalance, reduces the movies impact through its characters. Overall, I see The Royal Tenenbaums as a movie that could have truly been extraordinary if it found the right balance between visual and characters. Nonetheless, the movie still makes for a definite watch for its visuals, narrative and acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For my money, Wes Anderson just doesn't get any better than this. The Royal Tenenbaums is where he strikes that perfect blend of heartstring and humor, spontaneous weirdness and obsessive attention to detail. The family itself has enough history to carry an entire franchise, but the film doesn't bother to wallow in it for long; there's just too much going on in the foreground to spend more than a few savory moments on back story. Loaded with talent, it pulls everything from its cast. Whether it's Gene Hackman as the conniving, two-faced patriarch with a sudden need for intimacy, Anjelica Huston as his long-sacrificing ex-wife, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow as their never-had-a-childhood offspring, or the vast array of eccentric, colorful supporting characters, it's tough not to appreciate each as a leading-caliber performance. The Royals' tale is vivid and real, emotive and wounded but also spirited and playful. It resonates in a modern setting, especially, when so many of our friends' and family members' tightest circles are similarly dysfunctional. Layered and complex without feeling superficial or overstretched, it's a whole bundle of emotions, flavors, sights and senses smashed into a single, rich, evergreen portrait. I feel this one in my heart's private pantry and my stomach's deepest pit. Wonderful.</fullReview>

That's just my style."Far from the conventional comedy, Wes Anderson presents us the history of the Tenenbaum family and its close friends, with a premium cast: Gene Hackman, Bill Murray, Ben Stiller, Luke and Owen Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow (presenting us with one of the film's best scenes, coming out of a bus). Also Anjelica Houston is not to be overlooked, perfectly representing Etheline. Wes "geometrical" signature style pops out from the beginning of the film 'till the end, always with utter attention to detail.Creating a sort of parallel world, the film is set at a non-clear epoch and also in an unidentifiable city. The story develops taking its time, describing us the life of a quirky (at least) family where Etheline and Royal's children have a special childhood, becoming prodigies in the most diverse areas. However, their lives tend to fall apart, in some way due to their absent father, becoming depressed persons. When the family comes back together, new conflicts arise and old memories return and between the family dramas, always with Wes characteristic humor, this eccentric film entertains managing at the same time to be tragic and hilarious.Also worth mentioning is the excellent soundtrack with songs from Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Nick Drake, Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Clash, Ramones, Velvet Underground and others.</fullReview>

The film, which I first watched a handful of years ago, was at first just a good film with some laughs. After viewing more Anderson films, I came to appreciate it even more. The film, which had a safe spot in my favorite 15 movies of all time, made a case for number 1 after I took a course on the modern child at Pepperdine University. This film, along with Moonrise Kingdom, The Little Mermaid and Wall-E (as well as several books and short stories), were examined. How Anderson portrays the modern family in this film through an unbelievably dysfunctional family actually works very well. The film is acted superbly well by a cast that you would often expect to just see easy comedy from. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The price one pays for early genius...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson's "The Royal Tenenbaums", which he directed and co-wrote with actor Owen Wilson (who co-stars as neighbor Eli Cash), is dryly disengaged for a blithely serio-comic effect. It has a graceful style and a dark, sneaky undermining--and it juggles both light and heavy tones with great care--though it seems somewhat reminiscent of John Irving's "The Hotel New Hampshire" and, while "Tenenbaums" clearly makes for a better movie, there's an ugliness inherent in the film's conception that is never resolved. Designed like an epic novel, we are introduced to the three brilliant children (two brothers and their adopted sister) of a New York City lawyer and his archaeologist wife; she's the Rock of Gibraltar type (natch) who ends up raising the youngsters alone after Dad walks out, but she eventually questions her mothering methods once the kids grow into deeply troubled adults. Anderson has admitted many inspirations in his gestation of this unique family (namely J.D. Salinger and his Glass stories), and this possibly accounts for the film's compressed feel. Gene Hackman's patriarch is really the only character we get to know well. There are moments of straight-faced, absurdist humor in this family portrait (seriously-derived pathos, as well), and the eclectic soundtrack and lovely score are always around to keep the pacing fluid, yet Anderson intentionally holds the principals in check. They're a stultified group, in a creative rut and untouchable (as if under glass). Emotions never boil over in the Tenenbaum household (except for one funny instance where Hackman tells Anjelica Huston a lie about his health), and this unwavering approach may keep audiences from investing their heart in the people and the proceedings. It's an extremely well-produced film, nevertheless, with wonderful individual scenes and performances, but at times these attributes exist in a vacuum. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Wes Anderson presents the story of a dysfunctional family with gifted children in his film "The Royal Tenenbaums" (2001), which is told in a curious way, it has a linear structure with flashbacks and a narrator at first. All divided by chapters: each chapter like a book, as the film begins with a book that opens.It is a sad and funny story at the same time, it is about loneliness, because we see each of the characters involved in his own world and somewhat miserable, each in their own way, but generally they are a family involved in loneliness. The characters are well armed, as they have a great personality, everyone has something that characterizes them: their dress, particular things they have in their homes, etc.. Every detail speaks a lot about them.It is a deeper movie than it appears, it has comedic moments, has good music, good performances and a simple story, but the plot and how it affects the characters and how they carry all is what stands the film. Appears to be many things and surprises, which gives the film a lot of wealth, as keeps the viewer a little unsure on how to react to certain situations, because there are things that seem funny, sometimes cynical, sometimes sad, nothing is predictable and everything that happens is completely different from the above, does not repeat anything.His presentation of characters is rather long, the story itself takes to start, but the film works because every time something happens, but at times is confusing because it has many characters and many situations.It is a film that engages the viewer because it is a simple story told in an unusual way and with good performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just watched the movie and after that i took the usual comment tour. It seems the opinions of the movie are quite extreme, people either love the movie or completely dismiss it...and i was wondering what should one attribute that to?Well firstly i'm going to look at the positive comments - the part of the viewers that felt in love with the film, watched it few times and find a quality in every aspect are actually attracted by the atmosphere in my opinion. No, this is not a subtle dark comedy or anything of the sort, the feeling is quite different compared to other quirky comedies filled with dark humour, especially compared to the British style. But yet it has something to offer, it's most distinct in its manner of handling the drama, it doesn't dwell too much on it, nor doesn't it instantly resolve it. Even though the story is not very earthly it has some realism in it, characters are not of the type that grow easily on you, but yet they seem to show some complexity. Other then that i would say that some people just seek to hard and try to find things that are not there, i myself enjoyed the movie very much but i wouldn't say it's such a deep movie, that can show all there is to know about family and do it in a comedic way.Now i got to the current of comments completely destroying the movie, people with the self-confidence of true films critics, giving it a rating of 1-3 stars. What most shocked me was the argumentation of their low rating, they say that the movie doesn't cover it's comedy promise, or that it's rather distant than dark. They ask themselves the question- why didn't i enjoyed the movie, saying that they failed "forcing" liking of the movie. This just seems so wrong, they've watched it entirely through some genre, through some general opinion, forgetting that each movie is an unique experience. What was so wrong in the movie itself that would make it worth 1-3 stars? It's the fail of completing expectations, prejudices that really destroyed their view of the movie. I advice before reading any comments and hearing any opinion that everyone just watch the movie leaving aside every classification it has suffered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm just not really that into this movie. The plot about a dysfunctional family joining together and having quarrels has been done a thousand times before, and I've seen it done better. In my opinion the writing isn't as good as so many people have claimed. There are several interesting characters involved, but not a lot is done with them, and I also overdosed on narration. There's really a lot of narration in this movie, I wonder if some of these back stories couldn't just be worked into the dialogues. The ending is also really abrupt, though it's not without its charms. The saving grace of this movie is the incredible cast, that gives the movie its well-needed depth. All of these people are excellent drama actors, and they really bring the script to new heights, they turn their characters into people. I kept watching almost solely for the brilliant performances (especially by Gene Hackman and Gwyneth Paltrow), because for the most part this movie seems a bit overrated to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without having had the advantage of seeing his theory vindicated by "The Royal Tenenbaums",the late Mr Larkin had to rely on his own experiences to formulate his most profound nostrum.I can just see him leaving the "Odeon",Elysian Fields nodding primly to his companion and saying"Q.E.D." If ever there was a movie showing the baleful influence of the parent on the child,this is it. However well - intentioned Mrs Tenenbaum might have been in bringing up her children virtually single - handed,they have evolved into a bunch of neurotic former prodigies with enough complexes to delight the whole Faculty of Psychology at N.Y.U.When Royal,her husband - errant,decides to return to the family fold after a certain unpleasantness at the hotel where he has been living for many years,it is but one event in a series that sees her brood re - united - in the loosest possible sense of the term. I really wanted to enjoy "The Royal Tenenbaums",but it failed to engage me.It has good performances from Mr G.Hackman and Miss A.Huston,Mr B.Stiller is mercifully subdued and the soundtrack is outstanding.But... I don't know what it lacks...heart?Any semblance of believability? A single character even remotely likable?All three? Some of it is funny,but only to the extent that a man slipping on a bana -na skin is funny until you notice blood is trickling out of his ear. If seeing bullied and screwed up kids turn into bullied and screwed up adults makes you laugh fit to bust then "The Royal Tenenbaums" is just the ticket for you.It didn't do it for me - but perhaps I'm missing something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets better each time, but still feels a little short *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the most frustrating thing about the Royal Tenenbaums is that the movie is 80% close to perfection.*** SPOILERS ****To point out a few examples and to comment on other comments, there is really 2 main disconnects for me. (All in all I recommend the film)The first, is that I never really felt the transition from past to current status. That is, we need some visual clue that bring the fact that these Genius children failed misserably as adults.Maybe that could be with a short cut of Chas (played by Ben Stiller, not the kid), being happy with his wife and his millions, Richie (again with the adult actor) winning the US nationals, and Margot accepting the Pulitzer. As such, I never connected the adult actors with success, which made it difficult to feel the sense of failure.Secondly, the moment where Royal is thrown out of the Hospital and sees Ritchie leave and brush him off is THE pivotal moment of the film. I don't think you really get the feeling from the movie that, in that moment, the one child that Royal favored, who just tried to kill himself, brushes Royal off. In that moment, Royal should feel that all his kidding around, all his "You know I love you", just flat out failed and he finally figured out that no one is getting his 'joke'.Only after a few views did I realize that Royal really changed after that (the moment in Groundhog Day when Bill Murray finally gives up trying to be the nice guy, and become one). That this moment is never truely realized, I feel is why many people feel that movie failed. With all the detail Wes Anderson gave other scene, it really tarnishes the whole movie in that one critical scene failed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Correct me if I'm wrong here. Please, someone, I beg you. I'd like to see the greatness of this movie. I tried. it completely missed me.This movie features a band of excellent actors, who give a good performance each. Gene Hackman and Anjelica Huston play their roles magnificently. So do Ben Stiller and Gwyneth Paltrow. The rest of the cast are not bad either. The editing and cinematography are very nice, and so is the soundtrack. The narrator is a nice touch too.But one thing is missing in this movie, which is the first and most important element of a movie: A STORY. Most movies try to tell a story, which is the centerpiece of what this art tries to communicate to the audience. This film seems to try, in vain. There's no story here! It was so boring to watch, and on top of that, the dialog is so lame! I expect that's a result of trying to fill 105 minutes with something other than music.Film making is an art. I believe this art should tell a story, not just convey a still image of a reality. For failure to complete the most important role of a movie, The Royal Tenenbaums deserves a lower grade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cast overflows with talent, the setting rich and dysfunctional, and the situations wrought with possibilities -- so why is this movie so bad? The molasses pace, coupled with cutesy extended non-funny jokes (like the Gypsy Cabs), and the self-referential caricatures suck the life out of many scenes. The silly situations like the car crash scene at the end are devoid of higher meaning or purpose, and the results and ending all too predictable. The cast plays one-dimensional characters and there's not much depth to anyone and the scenes play out in a laissez-faire who-cares manner. This movie should have been edited to 90 minutes max.</fullReview>

Just a tasteless, insipid script. I just don't feel for the characters. What's special about them is just their peculiarities. I always try to find something likeable in every movie I see, even bad ones. But this time I really get nothing from it. Not at all impressed by the soundtrack either.

		<fullReview>This is a movie with a low grade temperature. You keep expecting it to get better but unfortunately it devolves into a weird strain of ebola. The first third of the movie provides the viewer with a quaint set-up regarding the history of an eccentric family of near-geniuses. One of the children "invents" dalmation mice, for example. The actors exist as set pieces for pretty funny dialogue, but have no souls, with the possible exceptions of Gene Hackman and Ben Stiller.In other ways, the good start leads to a disappointing 2nd and 3rd act, which involves a bizarre neo-incestous relationship featuring Gwynneth Paltrow, who exhibits all the passion of a zombie reject from "Night of the Living Dead." I'm sure it's not her fault that her character was given every line to be delivered in monotone, but she should be punished, nonetheless, for her performance. How anyone could fall in love with such a cypher is beyond me. There is also a shocking seriousness to the scenes in the second act, (one involving an attempted suicide), that really do not fit the overall tone of the movie, if you ask me. It sees to exist in a different realm than the rest of the film.The finale of the movie is a gumbo of working and non-working scenes frantically trying to paint itself out of a corner. For the first third of this movie I give it an 8. For the second act - a 2, and for the third, a 5. Overall - 5.That's my story and I'm sticking with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the director and writers of "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore" comes "The Royal Tenenbaums" starring the amazing Gene Hackman, the amazing Anjelica Huston, the amazing Ben Stiller...well, let's face it. Everyone involved in this project is simply amazing!To sum up this epic situation comedy, Royal Tenenbaum (Hackman) separates from his wife and his three children (Chas, Ricky, and Margot), returns some twenty years later pretending to have cancer and makes up a story that he doesn't have very long to live.The characters could each have their own films. Chas, the oldest Tenenbaum child, is a stockbroker at an early age. In the future, he has two kids (Ari and Uzi) and after his wife dies in a tragic plane crash, he's obsessed with safety.Ricky was once a great tennis player until he stunk up the court one game and never turned back to this profession, but he still wears that tacky trademark sweatband around his forehead. When the movie picks up, he finds himself falling in love with Margot.Margot Tenenbaum is the only adopted child. She lost one of her index fingers in a tragic accident and has a checkered life. She's married to unsuccessful child psychologist Raleigh St. Clair.Etheline Tenenbaum never legally divorced from her husband and is engaged to her black accountant, and of course, Royal has something to say about this. Owen Wilson is one of the film's highlights as the hilarious best-selling author who's books are awful.I absolutely loved this film. I'm a big fan of Wes Anderson (especially "Rushmore") and laughed constantly throughout. The plot was so intricate, and I think the art direction and set decoration should be at least nominated for an Oscar.I was thrilled was Gene Hackman (who was superb) won the Golden Globe for Best Actor. To sum up this whole review, go see this well-done comedic masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Anderson's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Royal Tennenbaums is auteur Wes Anderson's third film, and I admit to no critical immodesty in declaring that he will never make another film that exceeds it. Art found perfection in a Caravaggio and a Rembrandt. Music had Mozart, literature Shakespeare. The Royal Tennenbaums is a perfect achievement in cinema, a perfectly faceted jewel of the form, in the same way. What are these facets?The verdigris-toned narration by an unseen Alec Baldwin. The carefully chosen soundtrack, heavy on The Ramones, and Nico of the Velvet Underground, but also featuring a string piece by the composer Ravel, paired with delicious "bumper pieces" by contemporary film scorer Mark Mothersbaugh, and capped with Van Morrison. The cast. Oh but goodness, the cast. Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston, Bill Murray, Danny Glover, Gwyneth Paltrow, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, and Ben Stiller. And those are just the leads. Each takes their alloted time and makes a character that the viewer remembers. Each of them suffer and triumph in turns, and it is the most natural, happy/sad universally authentic experience, to watch them create slices of life that exactly depict life, in all of life's spicy and salty and bitter tones.Queue the scene where Margot is picking Ritchie up from the bus. Look at her eyes as she walks toward the camera. Look at the expression on her face. Or Chaz's final plea to Royal, as he hugs the firehouse Dalmation, "I've had a real tough year, Dad." Listen to the sounds in his voice. Raleigh's quiet hopeless stymied impossible love for his child- bride. Ritchie's utter confusion over which member of his family he can safely love. The bizarre propositional humor. Grandfathers taking babysat grandchildren to dogfights. Random stabbings among friends (with very small knives). Royal's magnificent instructions for an epitaph (should the need arise). Anderson's style is famously quirky, and his two recent films, Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel, nearly overdose the audience on quirk. Tennenbaums is full of this same quirky stuff, small characterizations, minute details the camera lingers on to alter your outlook on a man, a woman, a room, a house, a street. But the film's power overwhelms the quirk down into what it should be, which is flavoring. All of this is no guarantee you will like the film. It is fussy, demanding, complicated. But it is a masterpiece of the cinema made in my lifetime. It is a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film but not for the passive movie watcher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By "passive movie watcher" I'm referring to anyone who just wants to kick back and enjoy the ride, not necessaily a brainless romp but an engaging story that you can enjoy with little or no effort like Tim Burton's masterpiece "Pee Wee's Big Adventure". If that describes your state of mind then yeah... no this might not work for you.This would be more like if Peewee Herman and Citizen Kane had an illegitimate child who got shipwrecked on Gilligan's Island with maybe a visit from Jim Morrison from Oliver Stone's "The Doors". Sound bizarre? Perfect, because that's what you'll get. "The Royal Tenenbaums" does require a bit more work and patience than your usual flick. Not necessarily like a Godard film which requires the audience's work equivalent of sweeping up a 12-mile stretch of Interstate 95, but this movie definitely demands a few mental gymnastics.It is the humorous, satirical story of a 20th century New York City elite family. The narrative is told in vivid, fast-moving, short vignettes which, if you're not paying attention, could easily slip past you unappreciated. In that regard, it reminded me a lot of the film "Amélie", also released in 2001, by our French friends on the other side of the Atlantic. While, to me, not quite as memorable and iconic as "Amélie", this movie delivered a similar visual oddness (saturated colors with a nostalgic tint) and tongue-in-cheek humor (not quite "Airplane!" surreal but in that direction) that, from the first scene, sets it apart from your standard Hollywood fare.As with many Wes Anderson films, this movie is absolutely carried by an all-star cast of filmmakers' favorite actors. And by "filmmakers' favorite" I'm referring to actors who may not always grace the covers of People Magazine, E! and whatever star-du-jour the paparazzi are stalking, but these are solid, talented actors with die-hard cult followings. Each actor plays an absurdly extreme caricature of a particular personality type, and the meeting of all these weirdos is like a symphony of deadpan desperation. Don't expect laugh-out-loud hilarity, but it's definitely wacky enough to get a few chortles out.Plot: Well don't really expect a traditional plot-driven movie or you'll certainly be disappointed. The story is set up in the first 10 minutes (about a dysfunctional elite family whose father abandons them and suddenly reappears to re-take his place 20 years later), but from there it hops from episode to episode, quickly, quirkily and almost haphazardly. And that's the "work" I referred to earlier. I have to admit there were several times when I got mildly annoyed, thinking "Well that was totally random" or "That scene didn't really add anything", but I think that's the point. Rather than tell a neat, tidy, "Brady Bunch" tale with a structured setup/conflict/climax/denouement, Anderson gives us something more reminiscent of a J.D. Salinger book, and I'm not talking about "Catcher in the Rye" but instead one of his more obscure family-centered stories like "Franny &amp; Zooey" or "Raise High the Roofbeams" where, if someone asked you what it's about, you'd either spend 30 mins babbling like an idiot or just act like a pretentious snob and say "You just have to read it *puff puff*" (that was the sound of you puffing on your Boccetta smoking pipe)Ultimately, "The Royal Tenenbaums" is a comedy for people who take their films seriously. It is similar to Wes Anderson's other films (Rushmore, Life Aquatic) so if you enjoyed those don't hesitate to check this out. If you're not particularly a Wes fan, that's OK, I think this is his best film of the lot and more engaging than the rest, simply for its visuals. Other films I'd compare this to include: "The Squid and the Whale", an obscure Southern-Gothic dark comedy called "Septien" and, by far my favorite dysfunctional family flick, an obscure Canadian gem called "New Waterford Girl".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wacky, yet brilliant = Wes Anderson's opus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson has always been unusual among his films. He writes and directs with an abnormal yet original taste that many favor and many don't. So when his third feature-length came round in 2001, it was relaxing to say he'd deliver exactly that but with the hopes of introducing a few new fans. I can admit The Royal Tenebaums shaped me into a fan of Anderson.It's when where we're first introduced to the Tenenbaum family we realize they're a wacky bunch built up of Royal (Gene Hackman) and Etheline Tenebaum (Anjelica Huston) alongside their three children (Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson). If the family's all under the same roof together, things won't go gently - which is the basic premise of the story. A divorce between the couple lead to an abundance in time since the family were together - until now when Royal aims to reunite. And like that we have the unexpected and wonderful tale of The Royal Tenenbaums. Enter Owen Wilson, Danny Glover, Bill Murray, and say hello to a wonderful blend of actors. Always funny and always memorable. Don't forget Alec Baldwin who obtains perfect storytelling as the narrator. The cast fit their characters extremely well, so it's hard to mention flaws and easy to say, "Congratulations on a perfect cast."Next to be blown away by is the cinematography. It's out-there, yet simple and mesmerizing. Hail to that. It has one of cinema's most remarkable sequences to adore. Touching the cinematography is the fitting soundtrack featuring appearances from 60s sweetheart, Nico, and The (well-known) Rolling Stones. It miraculously fits the Tenebaum family; Outgoing, surprising and mildly doting.So if you think Anderson is too much a genius for you then ponder this: There's a Tenebaum in all of us. We'd like to shake our heads and chuckle at the statement, but it's hard to let go in our mind. It's Wes Anderson's unique charm that casts spells like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Royal Tenenbaums</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expect many will dismiss Anderson's Magnus Opus as one of two things. 'Quirky' or 'insubstantial'. They are, in no uncertain terms, wrong. Yes the film is offbeat, innovative and original, quirky even, and yes the production design is near saturated with wondrous stylistic flourishes. But, crucially, this is not a case of style obscuring substance. This is style begetting substance. For every Dalmatian mouse, we get a fantastically realised character, for every kitsch tableau, we get a wonderful moment of human interaction. The Royal Tenenbaums is a movie steeped in acute, ingenious, absurd observation. It's a deceptively complicated fable of human loss, grief and redemption, played out with beguiling subtlety by its all star cast. The screenplay (written by Anderson with long time collaborator Owen Wilson) somehow manages to give each character of the large ensemble cast immeasurable depth . It's a stunning achievement considering the relatively scant screen time each actor gets. When Royal (played by a twinkling Gene Hackman) confronts his estranged wife Ethel (Angelica Houston) , with the news of his imminent death it's a wonderful moment. With approximately eleven lines of dialogue, we are given an astonishing insight into the two characters. A lesser film would struggle to impart so much in its entire running time. Not only is this sequence informative, it is both moving and laugh out loud funny. It's a combination that the film pulls out of the bag often. Thematically The Royal Tenenbaums is supercharged. The witty banter, and recognisably comic actors conceal very dark undercurrents. Divorce, suicide, drug abuse, incestuous relationships and death all are brought to the fore, thinly veiled by sparkling delivery and a rose tinted camera lens. Surprisingly amongst Stiller, Hackman, Murray and Glover it is actually Luke Wilson who emerges as the films star. It's perhaps his most impressive performance and suggests that he is capable of depths that his brother couldn't dream of. As tragic ex-tennis player Richie Tenenbaum he shoulders most of the film's heavy lifting. It is he who embodies the film's darker subtexts, yet he does so in a way that is entirely affable, warm and affecting. This approach is synonymous with the film as a whole, and those who accuse Anderson of producing a film altogether too cutesy have clearly just not paid enough attention. His amalgamation of offbeat design and darkly comic tragedy makes for a film that is both sparkling and effectively introspective.Not only is The Royal Tenenbaums armed with an acute, deceptively profound script, and blessed with fantastic performances, it is graced with a soundtrack so perfect one is tempted to break down and weep. The Rolling Stones and The Beatles rub shoulders with Erik Satie and Elliott Smith, whilst The Ramones and The Clash do battle with Bob Dylan and Nick Drake. Like the film it's an eclectic mix, and its possibly the best soundtrack since Pulp Fiction. With so much going for it, it's hard to see how the haters could be so blind. There's not a character who's not endearing, there's not a line that's wasted. Suffused with delightful styling, impeccable comic timing and sumptuous melancholia, the film is wry, glowing, and finally, in its own very particular way, life affirming. See it, then see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the one of the best movies I've ever seen, if not the best.It's quirky sense of humor somewhat limits its audience, but it's so exquisitely filmed, made, written, acted, that it can easily be appreciated without getting all the humor. It's filled with so many subtleties you don't notice the first go-round that each time you watch it it gets better and better. It's been a family favorite for years and each time we see it we notice something new. Ever single aspect of this movie is done so creatively that it's hard to not be at least intrigued, if not captivated. It's more than just the story line.Watch it a few times and you'll see what I mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A brilliant story of family and the problems all of us have. Certainly it does best in the dark comedy area, but it also pokes at your heart through its soundtrack of simple music yet fitting music. The characters are where this movie really shine. Throughout the movie you start to understand and enjoy their quirky mannerisms. Ben Stiller shines in this film, but the undisputed star of this movie is the lovable Royal, played by the great Gene Hackman. He plays the kind of father that I'm accustomed to which strike me as yet another similarity this movie has with my family. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and ask what is going on and why am I even watching this. I recommend it to anyone who likes anything out of place. It's genius and it deserves at least a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great Film from Anderson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson has managed to find a style and voice that is unique in an industry of similarities. I first saw Bottle Rocket while in high school and talked about it for an entire year. I thought it was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen, then we were given Rushmore, which was another gift from Anderson, and finally we get The Royal Tenenbaums, which is the culmination of an incredible collaboration with his writing partner Owen Wilson and his cinematographer Robert Yeomen. I read a comment about this movie earlier that calls all the characters stereotypes, and I couldn't disagree more. I've never come across characters quite like this and I'd like anyone to disagree with me by pointing out examples of other characters that are so beautiful and comically flawed. I cared for each of the characters, I was rooting for Royal and I did laugh my ass off. I watch this movie often now, it's on my list of my top films. If you want something very unique, something is a great soundtrack, incredible acting, near flawless directing and writing, then you MUST see this movie. This isn't the comedy that is for everyone, mind you. This isn't some Cameron Diaz or Reese Witherspoon hand-feed you comedy using all the cliché conventions to rile a laugh out of you. It isn't slapstick, it isn't forced joke set-ups and pay-offs. This is intelligent, complex writing of situational humor motivated by very strong characters. If you want something that is not the conventional old comedy, then this is perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, just beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever watched. It might as well be a favorite. Wes Anderson is such a talented director with a brilliance that not many people realize. The acting, the cinematography, the formation of the characters and story, they're all so perfect. There's just one word to describe these - beautiful.I can't remember who, but someone I met before said the characters were lifeless and "dead." I disagree. The Tenenbaums are some of the best illustrated people I've ever met. You can tell who they are just by looking at their appearances and/or movements. Margot is probably the best example. Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't just give her a beautiful face, but also incorporates her movements with such a poetic grace that makes her who she is. It was a good choice to make her a playwright, having a style like this. Her casual hair and furcoat with the simple '70s dress underneath shows the maiden Richie fell in love with. Around her husband, Raleigh, her face is depressing and melancholy, but around Richie, she is a graceful goddess. The definition of a natural American beauty, she is. (pardon the Yoda tone.) Richie is probably the one I most liked. Luke Wilson plays him with a soft but not shy voice with plain expressions and casual eyes. His somewhat scrunched walking position shows that he's not okay, all that the audience needs to know. From the moment we see him, as child or adult, we can sense that he is special and important to the movie's story. He becomes a special connection between several members, including Royal, Eli, and Margot.Luke Wilson's vulnerable character just lost a competition of his career because of Margot and throughout the movie, he fights one with life, and almost loses that too, because of Margot. But she helps him at the end and he stands back up. Their affection towards each other marks a centerpiece in this movie.Though you may sympathize him a lot, I actually found myself pitying Chas the most. The only Tenenbaum offspring to have children, he tries to be a strong father for his two sons, Uzi and Ari, an effort that goes in vain. While he tries really hard to hide the mind weakness that results from the hurt and grief of the tragic accident that killed his wife, he can't help but show it. Symbols are his two sons and their beagle Buckley, who survived the crash. His mind weakness is finally gotten rid of when Buckley dies yet at another accident, replaced by a fireman's Dalmatian, symbolizing the hero that Chas will be in the future.Eli Cash, the boy next door who grew very close to the Tenenbaums, does so in a not-so-good result. Like all three Tenenbaum children, he becomes successful, but as a drug addict and holder of an uncontrollable mind. His cowboy attire shows his wildness, and throughout the movie he proves himself more than that. His desire to be a Tenenbaum only becomes a thorn at his side and it proves him unreliable and uncontrollable. He finally gets help at the end, and although his ending is inconclusive, the scene with him at the drug rehab leaves a good feeling in the viewer's mind.The Tenenbaums live in New York, the high class city of today along with the highest jobs and highest dreams, all which the Tenenbaums have. Anderson's choice to put no buildings give a traditional view, to make the Tenenbaums seem simpler then they really are, an action that actually is a good choice for the film. Overall, it gives a sense of modern elegance to the family, a position of aristocracy and nobility that they all live in: the royal Tenenbaums, American nobles.Overall, this film is not a bad sight for the eyes, literally. Films that reach this achievement are rare, and it easily could have won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (but not Best Picture, sorry) and I praise writers Anderson and Owen Wilson for that. Once again, I repeat: Wes Anderson has created a work of art. Well done, Anderson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spoilers to follow:is royal the grown up version of max? both characters lie in the same ways. the line from fischer to tenenbaum the elder is drawn most strongly in the scenes where they're both wearing berets and one is sitting in a stationary go cart, and the other is driving one.but onto the movie itself. this one is all about costume and production. margot isn't much more than fur coat, heavy eye makeup, and straight blonde hair. chas is entirely red adidas tracksuit, eli is all hat and fringed jacket. I feel like the strengths of bottle rocket and rushmore (the idiosyncrasies) become liabilities here. character development takes a back seat to how precious the visuals have become. how can you possibly care about a tweed jacket, full beard, dark glasses, and headband?though I do have to say, I laughed at the fishing hat, flip up sunglasses, and terrycloth shorts. which might be the entire problem. they could have made something great, but instead they made something cute. I never felt inside the world; it was too politely flat and contained, like everything happened under glass.plus, because it's so self consciously "pretend" it's too safe. so the tone is all wrong when the baumer attempts suicide.wes and owen have it in them to make a touching, hilarious, gorgeous movie. bottle rocket to rushmore made that promise, but the royal tenenbaums faltered a bit. it's still a good movie, but I am a bit disappointed in its preoccupation with how everything is supposed to look instead of how it's supposed to make you feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I'm not going to express my opinion about "The Royal Tenenbaums" as one everyone should follow, or as one that everyone should kick their own ass for not agreeing with. Different people like different movies. Lord knows I can't stand "The Matrix" or any of the Harry Potter movies, but everyone else loves them."The Royal Tenenbaums" is a movie you shouldn't disagree with in the sense of calling it a horrible movie. I myself love this movie, and it is slowly becoming my favorite of all time. When watching movies that don't concern immediate action or comedic values picked up by the audience, you have to actually take on an almost hidden mentality where you can decide yourself what message each scene is trying to tell you. Wes Anderson's films have a grand, refreshing and oddly independent feel to them. The continuum of his type of direction can sometimes reflect the characters in his movies: These people don't really seem to care, nor are they striving to break through in any mainstream way just because they care too dearly what everyone else thinks of their success. "The Royal Tenenbaums" really stresses the entertainment in actually "watching" movies instead of just viewing them. When I say "just viewing" I mean sitting down and going through a movie and not letting yourself comprehend anything further than the dialogue and action that follows. There are still a lot of people who don't care to actually expand their appeals further than today's filmmakers drawing every meaning and aspect of the film out in crayon.Wes Anderson strictly constructs this film in a very orderly manner that relieves today's true movie lovers. From the introduction of all the characters back in 1979 (and the violin laden introduction of all the characters 22 years later) to the ending of the film where Gene Hackman found his peace with his family and carrying it with him at the end of his life, the movie does a good job of leading on emotional value. People who say the movie is too serious and then too quirky don't realize that its nothing but a strong balance of a character study. The Tenenbaum family are definitely off the wall, and also emotionally challenged, but their parents didn't so much raise them on love as much as they did to deem them brilliant. Even the actors outside the family, such as Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, and Danny Glover, seem to add comedy to the film, especially Bill Murray, who doesn't even have to try to be funny in this movie. The Luke Wilson suicide attempt scene was probably the most compelling scenes I've ever seen in a movie because I understood through his character study just how twisted his life was at that point, and Elliot Smith's "Needle in the Hay" really added to the scene for a reason I'm not sure, but then again the whole soundtrack went with the movie so well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the perfect movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely do you see a movie that grabs you in such a way that you feel as though you have experienced something so unique that your entire defintion of a well done movie has changed as a result.The Royal Tenebaums, quite simply, changed my entire perspective on what makes a good comedy. Not since Peter seller's "Being There" have I seen a comedy that touches all human emotions as well as wes Anderson's "masterpiece". Never before have I called a comedy a "masterpiece", and, in fact, by calling the Tenenbaums a comedy I feel as though I might be shortchanging it. This movie is not a comedy. It is not a drama. It is everything wrapped together into a collaberation that meshes all genres together. The Royal Tenenbaums represents the arrival of a more sophisticated humor that touches more closely to human emotions than the typical slapstick or parody, and, furthermore, it represents a dramatic work that blurrs comedy as it asks you to see the humor and the tragedy of each character. Thus "The Royal tenenbaums" teaches us that human nature is both humorous and tragic. As Joni Mitchell tells us in People's Parties, "Laughing and crying you know its the same release."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson's "The Royal Tenenbaums" is a masterpiece of a film. Although "Rushmore" is still my own personal favorite, "The Royal Tenenbaums" deals with a large cast of characters and a combination of comedy and pathos in a way which few other film could. The film starts out with a brilliant montage scored with an instrumental version of "Hey Jude", which tells the family's history. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) abandons his family, which includes his wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston), who becomes an archeologist; and his three children: Chas, Richie, and "adopted daughter" Margot. Chas grows up to be a businessman played by Ben Stiller, Richie grows up to be a tennis champion played by Luke Wilson, and Margot grows up to be a depressed playwright, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, giving one of her finer performances to date. In the present day, Royal has been staying at a hotel for 20 years and is getting kicked out after now being short of cash. (Danny Glover). Margot is married to a quirky neurologist (Bill Murray)Etheline is proposed to by her accountant . Chas is still trying to get over the death of his wife. Richie, after having a meltdown during a match, travels on a yacht in the middle of the ocean. Royal, who hasn't talked to his wife in quite a while, visits her one day and tells her he's dying. The family becomes reunited and the film tells of a few month period in the life of this family. The acting is excellent, especially Gene Hackman and Luke Wilson. The use of music, as in Anderson's other films is perfect. The script is brilliant. And of course, Wes Anderson's direction is absolutely magnificent. I highly recommend "The Royal Tenenbaums". 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only film I've ever walked out of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would rather that my first submission to IMDB was a positive one. This year alone, I could and should have taken the trouble to pass on my praise for and recommendations of Monsoon Wedding, Iris, Last Orders, The Shipping News, Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner and, already this week, Charlotte Gray. However, maybe I'm happy to enjoy them privately, whereas here I'm posting not so much a criticism as a warning. Before this evening I have NEVER walked out of a film before its end. The Royal Tenenbaums forced me to change my ways. I don't know quite what possessed me to go and see this, most likely the impressive cast but now I am sat here dismayed and angry at an evening wasted... The Royal Tenenbaums is simply the most pointless, uncharismatic, unfunny and vacuous film I have ever paid money to see. If you love films, don't disappoint yourself by going to see this. It is absolutely dreadful. 0/10 doesn't begin to convey the antipathy I feel towards this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of talent, film stock, and time (especially the viewer's). I can't remember the last time I saw people walking out of a theater in the middle of a film, but I saw it happen with this film. The exit chatter of those filmgoers who endured the full film is well summed up by one woman's comment, delivered loud enough for us all to hear: "That movie sucked!" This remark provoked a general, if somewhat wan, chorus of agreement. Not since "Battlefield Earth" have I felt so cheated of two hours. The heck with the ticket price; I want my two hours back.Is this supposed to be a satire? A sly comedy? A drama? A character study? Who can say? What we CAN say is that it is filled with one-note performances of flat characters by actors who usually do better - and the camera lingers on them eternally, faithfully recording each long, dead pause between each dull, dead line of dialogue. (Gwyneth Paltrow in particular was the soul of lifelessness, and Owen Wilson's character was just, well, unexplainedly bizarre.) It's full of recurring quirks that promise significance but never deliver (spotted mice, jalopy cabs, sweatsuits, cowboy clothes, the color pink, etc.), leaving us wondering why such a point was made show us these things - they serve no purpose.I think this film aspires to the uncomfortable, alienated comedy of "The Graduate." Certainly the performances recall Dustin Hoffman's nervous, reclusive portrayal of Ben, but unlike that film, these characters never break out of their wrappings. The result is a film that has the "uncomfortable" and "alienated" parts down, but lands miles away from anything resembling comedy, drama, or a point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An All-Star Cast ... Wasted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a cast of 'big ticket' stars, including Gene Hackman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller and Anjelica Huston, I fully expected 'The Royal Tenenbaums' to be a killer film.But all it killed was two hours of my time. The plot centers around a dysfunctional, unhappy family of has-been geniuses who plod through the story like they just swallowed a bottle of Prozac. This movie may be about geniuses ... but it certainly wasn't created by any.Critics have called it 'quirky', but it goes far beyond that to become strange, peculiar, ponderous and largely boring. I admit that I did laugh out-loud at a few scenes, but humor is a rare commodity here. Comedy is far outweighed by boredom and the outlandishly pathetic characters, who no one could anything care about.If you want something that really blows, skip 'The Royal Tenenbaums' and buy a whistle. It's cheaper and won't waste so much of your time. If you love the cast, go rent some of their other movies. You know, the ones in which they were actually good!</fullReview>

And this is with a motherlode of potential comic material that others have mined for gold. Just about every dysfunctional family sitcom on TV has done a better job than this criece of pap.Only Gene Hackman's scene in Mississippi Burning, where he grabs the brute by the testicles, has saved him from being written off in my mindRewind, erase or delete , don't use up precious storage space.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Wes Anderson, and therefore excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say what you will about Wes Anderson, but there's one thing that can't be denied--when watching one of his movies, there's never any doubt about who made it, as he leaves his creative imprint all over everything he directs. And The Royal Tenenbaums is no exception. Sandwiched between the great Rushmore and the even greater The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, The Royal Tenenbaums provides yet more proof of Anderson's offbeat, textured genius. It's a typically witty and original piece of quiet desperation that follows the efforts of Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), an aging ex-lawyer and patriarch of a trio of former child prodigies, to get back into his family's good graces. We learn pretty quickly that Royal has made some major mistakes in his life, but he's still the sort of guy you root for as he tries to get back on track. In that sense, he's a characteristic Anderson protagonist--not everything he does is admirable, but his intentions are good enough that you can forgive his shortcomings.As Royal and his family try to piece their lives back together after a series of tragedies small and large (filled in efficiently via flashback), themes of betrayal, redemption, and family dysfunction run throughout, all handled by Anderson with a deft touch as the script juggles multiple personal stories with an eye on the bigger picture. The pacing, dialogue, and humor are mostly pretty low-key--Anderson doesn't pander to the audience with any shocking plot twists, pratfalls, or overwritten histrionics. That said, to describe this film as dull would be woefully inaccurate, as Anderson's gifts as a visual stylist are very much in evidence as always, along with his knack for music selection (never more so than in his use of Elliot Smith's incredible "Needle in the Hay" for one especially dark scene). More than pretty much any director I can think of, Anderson clearly devotes a great deal of attention to creating a distinctive look and feel to his films, and this movie demonstrates that tendency even more than Rushmore, as it's awash in retro color and the characters' appearances are plotted down to the smallest detail.The cast, as with pretty much any Anderson movie, is a murderer's row, and pretty much everyone involved is in fine form. The characters generally don't resemble anyone you'd meet in the real world, but in spite of what may initially appear to be one-note indie movie quirks, pretty much all of them manage to emerge as eminently human, if deeply flawed. It's especially nice to see Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller, who lately seem to be a competition to see who can appear in a larger number of mediocre Hollywood comedies, actually get to play somewhat layered and interesting characters who are worthy of their abilities. I was a little disappointed that Bill Murray, who plays leading roles in Rushmore and The Life Aquatic, wasn't as prominent here, but some Murray is still better than none. Everyone else--Luke Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelica Huston, and Danny Glover, to name a few--is at least solid, with Luke Wilson doing an especially impressive turn as Royal's son Richie, an ex-tennis star struggling with a forbidden love. On the surface it's not a huge departure from his typical regular-guy performance, but Wilson conveys his character's inner turmoil extremely well without a lot of undue emoting.Like anything Anderson has made, this movie isn't for everyone, but if you're willing to dig a little deeper than usual when watching a movie you should find a lot to enjoy. For those looking for something smarter than the average comedy and funnier than the average drama, The Royal Tenenbaums more than delivers the goods.</fullReview>

I much prefer to be entertained for my dollar. If I'm going to be frustrated by what I see on screen, I want it to be by people/characters I care about, or at least goals I care about, or commentary I care about.

I expected it to be hilarious as well. Now, granted, it had its moments which were truly hilarious - but those moments are few and far between.I understand that this film's objective is not to make you constantly laugh, but there were times when I felt that the film could been funnier than it was, and a little dry.Somewhat disappointing.</fullReview>

Watch for it at Blockbuster in a month and on Turner's SuperStation in six. The only character getting any audience sympathy was Buckley... so Wes Anderson killed him off. Nice touch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums was an appalling, pretentious movie with a good soundtrack. I don't understand why I didn't see it coming, what with the films that came before and after it. It just goes to show that even with a stellar cast, a movie may die a horrible death. What I haven't worked out yet is who exactly it's meant to impress. It was long and rambling, and without a point. The fact that it had Ben Stiller and BOTH of the Wilson brothers in it should have sent me running in the other direction. The only redeeming feature of this film was the soundtrack, and the mice were somewhat entertaining, even if the idea of dalmatian mice was that of a pretentious writer struggling under the delusion that he was funny. It was not quirky or funny. It just floundered under its own weight, and it caused otherwise good actors to flounder along with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was supposed to be a comedy? The director, or writer, or whoever is to blame for this bland boring fiasco seams to trying to inject a new type of comedy into the vein of film....this new type of comedy seams to be a non-comedy where humor is so fiercely under-stated and dry that the only thing that keeps it from being a depressing drama is an occasional quirk. Apparently this was made by the same person who did Rushmore...I found the plot of that film as about as entertaining as the characters in this film. I think "cry-omedy" might be a better genre title for this snore fest. Look, I'm not looking for "laugh out loud" funny, or "knee slapping" funny...but how about "at least a little" funny. I hope this style of comedy doesn't represent the comedy of the future or we might as well kill ourselves now....wait I'm sure that might end up being the next story line for this director. -Joe</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can I be impartial when it comes to "The Royal Tenenbaums"? I saw it with a great friend. It became 'our film', and if she'll put up with me that long, it always will be.Leaving my emotions aside (which I can't), "Tenebaums" is an excellent movie: stylish, witty, mellow and humane. Just like my friend, in fact.There are so many good scenes, but I was particularly moved by the flashback to Richie's tennis career. Having learnt that his beloved Margot has married Raleigh St.Clair, Richie goes to pieces in the middle of a crucial match, throwing his now-pointless life away in front of an audience of millions. I knew how he felt.The soundtrack is a superbly eclectic blend: Dylan, The Velvet Underground, John Lennon, George Enescu, The Clash, Ravel, Nick Drake and Paul Simon. I even liked the instrumental version of "Hey Jude".It must be love.</fullReview>

This supposed comedy/drama was painful to sit through and sometimes outright excruciating.I really had high hopes for this movie. It was nominated last year for the best screen play. It had a cast of great stars including Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Bill Murray and Danny Glover. It was co-written by Owen Wilson, typically a very funny actor whom I loved in Shanghai Noon and Zoolander.It was just sad. You couldn't care less about the characters and their "drama" was inane and contrived. There weren't any funny moments in this "comedy". Reservoir Dogs was a funnier movie.I'm just thoroughly disappointed and I want my 2 hours of life back.</fullReview>

Who would have thought a movie with Hackman, Anjelica Houston, and Ben Stiller would turn out to be such a stinker? I guess even the best and funniest actors can't salvage a script that has no substance, and that goes nowhere. Going nowhere fast would have been one thing, but this one goes nowhere all too slowly. It seems to never end, and the only payoff is that the whole, jumbled mess is finally over. Gwyneth Paltrow is especially annoying in this movie, as is Stiller. Hackman is as likable as he ever is, but a bad movie is a bad movie is a bad movie - even when it's got a great movie star at it's center. Skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of family betrayal and neuroses from childhood distinguished by staggeringly detailed set designs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After gaining attention with his quirky early films BOTTLE ROCKET and RUSHMORE, writer and director Wes Anderson was able to bring together a wide Hollywood cast for his ambitious 2001 effort THE ROYAL TENNEBAUMS. As the movie opens, we are shown the rise of the three children of the Tannebaum family, prodigies who excel in business, sports and literature respectively. The upbringing of these little geniuses is left to their mother Etheline (Angelica Huston) after their father Royal (Gene Hackman) leaves the family. We flashforward to the present day, where the family has fallen from glory. Chas Tennenbaum (Ben Stiller) is too crushed by the death of his wife to focus on business, Margot (Gwenyth Paltrow) hasn't written a play in years and sulks most of the day in the bathtub, and Richie (Luke Wilson) retired from tennis after mysteriously blowing his last game. It is at this time that their father returns, and the reconciliation between the family members is the story of the film.Wes Anderson retains his quirky sense of humour here. Though ostensibly set in the present day, the lives of the characters occasionally seem bound in traditions of a century ago, as when Royal has an Indian servant, and one of Etheline's suitors is a polar explorer, and this gives a certain charm to the picture. Another amusing Anderson touch is the sheer detail of the sets, with background items like newspaper clippings, portraits and bookshelf contents providing a feeling that these characters are fully formed and have a past. That immense detail in the design, too much for the eye to fully take in at once, gives THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS considerable rewatch value.Supporting roles are quite memorable. Bill Murray, who plays Margot's husband, was to go on to play this type of jaded, unhappy middle-aged man in several films until it just stopped being fun anymore, but this early go at it is quite entertaining (and watch him quietly explode into barely-contained rage at one point in the film). Owen Wilson's character Eli Cash is hilarious, an author of Western novels who gets so caught up in the mythology of the Old West that he starts taking mescaline and descends into drug addiction. In some respects, Cash is somewhat similar to Wilson's character Hansel in ZOOLANDER of the same year.In his next couple of films, Anderson would continue with many of the same themes and aesthetic found here, which was disappointing and felt like he was only repeating a formula to diminishing results. However, this first film in that vein remains impressive years after its release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what I was hoping it'd be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll preface this by saying before watching this movie, I had only seen one other film by Wes Anderson called Moonrise Kingdom. Although, I felt I was able to get a good impression on his style from that one film because it was s unique. With that said:The aesthetic in the Royal Tenenbaums is different yet very plain. It's hard for me to explain it. It had an almost warm, inviting feeling to it that pulls you right into the story. They did an excellent job developing each character enough to leave room for discovery. I mean, you got a general idea of who all the characters were but throughout the film you see them start to change and at the same time being tested in which they respond in their own ways. As I type this, I realize how hard it is for me to review this movie. All I can say is I thoroughly enjoyed it and have watched it twice since I got it not so long ago. The humor keeps you chuckling and the clever dialogue makes for conversations you wish to be part of. And be warned, you may start to fall in love with some of the characters. I know I did. Twice! But that's okay. It's perfectly normal to form relationships with fictitious characters. Right?Overall, I rated this movie an 8 because of how excellent the story was, how well developed the characters were, and the dialogue being so sharp and witty. I may even watch this a third time during the week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is certainly quirky, but it's not one of those movies that have nothing else going for them. It's honest more than pretentious, lifelike more than theatrical. The characters and their lives might be weird, but I feel it's a reflection of the weirdness of reality.The film details the attempts of old family patriarch Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) to get closer to his children and repair the dysfunctional family. The story deals with themes of distrust, accepting responsibility, coping with grief, fitting in, and even incest. The subject matter is rather heavy but the film isn't dark at all, rather it showcases the power of optimism. It is always possible to make amends.Luke Wilson makes the best performance here, outshining better-known stars with his quiet charisma and touching depression. Ben Stiller is surprisingly good, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dys"funny"ctional family is Anderson's finest focus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen all of Wes Anderson's other feature films, "The Royal Tenenbaums" strikes me as the one project with which anyone can connect to Anderson's work. Everyone can relate to a dysfunctional family and Anderson's colorful and unique cast of characters portrayed excellently by his all-star cast might make "The Royal Tenenbaums" his best work.The film is about a family of child prodigies whose patriarch, Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) ignores them as children and presumably causes all three children's lives to turn out poorer than expected twenty years later. When they are adults, Royal tells them he has a terminal illness, which reunites the family so that he can try and right his past wrongs.Hackman gives a praiseworthy comedic acting performance with his excellent portrayal of Royal. Danny Glover's character puts it perfectly when he says to Royal "I don't think you're an asshole, but your kind of a son of a bitch." You like him because you can tell he means well, but he's definitely a jerk in the way he behaves. Of all the children: Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwenyth Paltrow) and Richie (Luke Wilson), Paltrow shines the most. Her performance as Margot makes her the most interesting sibling and she truly excels in a role different from any that she has previously played. She excellently portrays the shy, personal, inward behaviors of her character, but you can see the desire for love and affection in her face and eyes. Angelica Houston as Mrs. Etheline Tenenbaum is also at her best in comparison to all of her other roles in Anderson's films, perhaps because it is the biggest role in all of them, but she's still very good at doing both the dry and the serious.Anderson really does a great job showcasing these brilliantly conceived and humorous characters of his and co-writer Owen Wilson's. His trademark single angle wide shots of scenes and full front mug shots of characters are both abundant and effective in the film, allowing you take in all the characters as much as possible. Even when a character is in the background of a scene, you're still learning about him or her.It's really the themes that stand out in this Anderson film. Anderson seems to do his best work when focusing on family and the desire for harmony as well as personal happiness. As the film progresses, it is amusing to see Royal turn from the character that is to blame to the only character who seems to have things figured out. Anderson shows that sometimes it takes a lot to get people to see what matters most, but he affirms that people can indeed find it and in turn make their lives better. With all this and still the dry, deadpan humor of Anderson's films, this proves a fine trademark work of his.</fullReview>

Since then, each of the three Tenebaum children had become grown adults and leading separate lives. Same goes for Mrs Tenebaum. That is until Mr. Tenebaum wanted to meet everyone in the family one day.Apparently his days are numbered, or is it really? If anyone needs some humour of the quirky sort, this movie is perfect.

This is my favorite of his films, because the serious overtones are more moving than those in Life Aquatic or any others. Also, I believe it has the best cast assembled in the last 15 years!!! Anderson likes to incorporate not-so comedic characters and situations into his movies(You probably won't laugh at Ben Stiller the entire movie). The way Gene Hackman is throughout the film as Royal Tenenbaums is priceless and he goes down as one of my favorite characters in all of film, although this movie prob wouldn't make my top 25. I respect and actually find intriguing Anderson's ability to have you laugh, learn, sympathize with, and love the characters. Overall, the movie is pretty entertaining.

		<fullReview>Wes Anderson's THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is about a very dysfunctional family that comes together as one of their members nears death. While not a masterpiece, it offers many small gems to be savored. There are robust performances by everyone involved, including Gene Hackman as the dying family patriarch and Anjelica Huston as his long-suffering mate. The script is not half-bad, and was turned out in part by a then-unknown Owen Wilson, who also appears in the film. TENENBAUMS is not a comedy for everyone, but it can be savored in small doses by just about everybody. It plays on TV at least once a week, so catch it at your convenience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is a good film...no its a great film when looked at in retrospect. One is reminded of the latter day comedies of James Stewart and Henry Fonda (E.g. Mr. Hobbs Takes A Vacation). The patriach part in this film goes to Gene Hackman, a two time Oscar winner and a powerhouse of a thespian. Hackman's part is critical and his experience guides him to play the bits with enough humor, nastiness and weakness to pull it off. Angelica Huston is brilliant as well, as Hackman's estranged wife. Ben Stiller and the Wilson brothers are also nice fits in the piece as well. The show stealer is of course the gorgeous Gwyneth Paltrow. Not always known as a giving actress, the beautiful blonde goes to lengths I thought she'd never venture into (I won't give it away...but there's one scene in this film in which Debbie does Dallas comes more to mind than Jane Austen's Emma). Anyway, even though I'm extremely attracted to Paltrow in this film, all the performers are A rate and the film delivers on the comedic and dramatic levels, not an easy thing to do in a Hollywood piece. Heck of a film.Written by Allan the genius</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A well written and highly polished fiction centering on the relationships both within and connected to, a quirky dysfunctional family. The father is the most chaotic member of the clan, but after realizing what a mess he has made as a narcissistic, self-absorbed, absentee parent, seeks to make amends by devious means. With that having been said, however, this is not a "realistic" dysfunctional family. Rather, it is a composite, drawn from a variety of such classes, combining them into one. That makes for an entertaining fabrication, but don't expect to learn much about the nature of "real" dysfunctional families, either in particular or in general.The story is very good at presenting extreme types of characters, none of whom has any insights. They are like puppets, imagining they are free to choose as they wish, while their strings are being pulled by forces they cannot comprehend. But the story doesn't know how to help them, or to offer any meaningful advice. No one has any answers beyond blaming the father, and everyone is equally neurotic and incompetent, even the "psychologist," who comes off as someone in need of one. There is so much dysfunctionality going on that there is no room for learning any lessons. It is in that sense a pot-boiler: sufficiently entertaining but not for that reason profound.</fullReview>

But you forget about Gwyneth, Ben, Luke, Owen, Gene, Bill and Danny to embrace a charming group of characters that remind you of "real" smart people; as opposed to being brilliant, inspirational and cute lil' geniuses, they are completely insane. Kind of like your own family. The theme seems to focus on who the characters are now- crazy nuts vs. who they used to be- bright, unusual children with promise, all held together by Royal himself, played excellently by Mr. Hackman. The humour isn't supposed to be slapstick, the plot isn't soap-opera dramatic. The movie is both more realistic and more caricature than most.</fullReview>

That is why I rate it so highly though it is very subtle it fits perfectly the soundtrack provides a perfect mirror to the film and it will leave you thinking for weeks. The film requires more than one watching to catch the highly detailed script in all its glory. Make no mistake this is not to everyones taste but watch it a couple of times before making your final judgement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Crisis of Brillant Production?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Royal Tennenbaums: A Crisis or Brilliant Production? The Royal Tennenbaums is one of those films an audience either loves or hates. There is very little leeway for those whom are not opinionated. One might claim that they neither loved nor hated the film but upon further analysis, a confirmation of new thought would be unfaltering. The script was extremely well written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson. The quirkiness displayed thoroughly through a star-studded cast lead to a reprimanding sense of dry-humor. With characteristics of the movie this acclaimed why then would some love this film and others hate it? Could it be the quirkiness was too over-the-top and much like a Woody Allen film, fans and critics debate its prominence within the industry leaving no chance for a middle ground. Just love or hate of the film. Possibly, it was something much more basic. Wes Anderson (Director of Royal Tennenbaums) had the resource of a cast that was perhaps, too superior for their roles. How was this cast of stars emasculated? The connections and reasoning is feeble when thought about chronologically. Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson co-wrote the film. Therefore, Owen was a shoe-in for one of the roles. Owen had the benefit of the doubt from a long time friend Ben Stiller. Both Ben and Owen starred in Zoolander, a movie made by Ben. The two of them are quickly forming a brother-hood in the industry that can be compared to Ben Affleck and Matt Damon throughout the 1990's. While on the topics of brother's Luke Wilson is therefore obviously a keen candidate for another role being Owen's actual brother. Owen Wilson and Hackman must have felt the groove in this film because they went on to shoot Behind Enemy Lines together. Bill Murray lured by the fact that it was another Wes Anderson movie. Both Murray and Anderson worked together on Rushmore, Andreson's sophomore film that was a tremendous success. Gwyneth Paltrow was available through association, knowing many of the actors from previous work and other events. With a cast compiled of this magnitude, it is no wonder that it was easy to bait Angelica Houston, Danny Glover, and Alec Baldwin. All of whom have had illustrious careers but are non-the less dwindling downward and may have possibly been looking for one final hurrah or a jumpstart back into the business. If Hollywood were a small town, it certainly is getting smaller. Much like Rushmore, Royal Tennenbaums' script is a brilliantly composed work that is full of dry humor. With exceeding pressure for Anderson to outdo his sophomore performance, he may have stepped out of his boundaries with this piece however. The cast are brilliant individually however the demand for a collage of talent to produce an irrepressibly amazing film was impossible. Wes Anderson might have been caught up in the good times due to the fraternity reunion of cast in which he was directing. This forced him to lose his focus and control over the production that he had sustained through the filming of Rushmore. Royal Tennenbaums maintained its success at the box office primarily because of the cast and not the plot nor Wes Anderson's direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eli Cash is Money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson's 2001 film The Royal Tenenbaums is a witty and well-shot film with a basic message: glory is fleeting. The film follows a group of former child geniuses as their father claims he is dying and returns to their lives. Each of the children had a different aspect in which they excelled as children, athletically, financially, and creatively. Each character also faced a melt down and is now a shadow of their former selves. Anderson uses several techniques to underscore this idea of glory. He uses a 70's theme and the characters of Eli Cash and Henry Sherman to demonstrate the effects of glory on a family. First, the film has an obvious theme of the 1970's. The 70's were the decade that the three children were successes. Royal, the father was also at his peak as a lawyer during the 70's before falling off during the 80's. It seems, however, that even though it is 20-25 years later, that the characters have a hard time letting go. For example, their wardrobe, principally Margot and Richie's, is the same now as it was in the 70's with Richie even refusing to give up his tennis headband and Margot her fur coat. Also, the soundtrack of the film is composed largely of music and musicians that would have been big during the Tenenbaum's peak. Key examples include Lou Reed, the Rolling Stones, and the Beatles. Anderson uses this soundtrack during periods in which the families fall from grace is especially pronounced, for example, during the suicide attempt. Incidentally, the cigarettes that Margot is smoking throughout the film are cigarettes that were discontinued in the 1970's. Next, the character of Eli Cash exemplifies the film's message the glory is fleeting. Eli admits that he also wanted to be a Tennenbaum. He is a regular at the house during childhood, dates Margot, and by the end, suffers a "Tenenbaum-like" breakdown. Eli does experience his share of glory with his second-rate literature and celebrity stature. However, this lead to his drug addiction and other eccentricities that ultimately lead to his demise.In contrast to Eli Cash is the family accountant, Henry Sherman. Henry is the model of modesty not only in his speech and manner, but also his average profession of accounting. Henry is the only successful suitor of Etheline, Royal's wife. All of the others, including Royal, have been successful and glorious men compared to Henry. It is as if Etheline has learned her lesson about glory in her failed marriage to Royal and does not wish to repeat the mistake. Even Royal, at their wedding, learns to accept the genuinely good Henry Sherman. Henry is an example of the opposite of glory and consequently becomes one of the most likable characters of the film. In closing, Wes Anderson's film, The Royal Tenenbaums, gives the audience a subtle but witty warning about the dangers of glory and how family, no matter how dysfunctional, is one of the most important things in life. He does this by using a theme of the 1970's and contrasting the characters ofEli Cash and Henry Sherman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Royal TenenbaumsThe Movie, The Royal Tenenbaums directed by Wes Anderson is a tongue-in-cheek comedy about a dysfunctional family brought back by together by multiple family crisis and their own failure to succeed in society. The Royal Tenenbaums provides a witty dry humor that aims to please the intellectual. Wes Anderson provides an A-list Hollywood cast to illustrate is comedy of the American Family. The Royal Tenenbaums is the story of the Tenenbaums, a Manhattan family lead by its overbearing mother played by Angelica Huston and the no-good scheming father played by Gene Hackman. The family does not stop there; the husband and wife have three child prodigies played by Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Luke Wilson. The Tenenbaums throughout the movie slowly reveal more about their dysfunctional lives through the comic flare Wes Anderson produces. The Royal Tenenbaum's effectively creates a dark comedy that becomes the prominent feature of unvealing of all their dysfunction. Wes Anderson provides situations such as Gwyneth Paltrow losing her finger and it being replaced with a wooden one, or Ben Stiller being shot by a bebe gun and having the remaining bullet still lodged in his finger. This strange mishaps are one of the central features in providing comic relief that is unique strictly to The Royal Tenenbaums. In Conclusion Wes Anderson provides a dark comedy with many witty phrases such as `why did you not sew your finger back on' `I didn't think I needed it' and many others that all end up creating a movie that is hilarious to watch no matter what age you may be. The Royal Tenenbaums succeeds in producing a comedy that can be watched over and over, and still be funny in the many years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums is unbelievably funny, witty, and overall just great to look at. The gorgeous set and costume design leave the film's date/time frame ambiguous, while making the film extremely visually stimulating. The film is filled with such warm colors, like browns, oranges, and pinks, with the exception of the one very blue bathroom suicide attempt. In addition to the great attention given to the colors used in the film, the costumes almost take on roles of their own. There aren't many costume changes in the film, making the select few very significant. Chas Tenenbaum (played as an adult by Ben Stiller) as a child cared about nothing more than his business and making money. He was never seen in anything than his suit, even when working out or when playing with the BB gun. Chas as a child is very professional and mature. He grows up to be an extremely immature man who stomps around throwing pity parties and picking fights. This change is expressed through his wardrobe with the change from his suit as a child, to wearing an ADIDAS jogging suit, always red except for once black at his father's funeral. Another effective use of costuming was with Gwyneth Paltrow's character, Margot Tenenbaum. As a child Margot seemed to wear nothing except her striped dresses and fur coat. When returning to the house as a adult, the first place of hers we enter is the closet were Eli Cash is waiting, and we can see the clothes still there, and then we see her wearing them again. Margot's character hasn't had much development since she was a child, and the costuming for her would infer that she is going back to her childhood dress because she is moving back into the house she lived in as a child. She's going back to that mindset and living with all the same people again.The set design also added a whole other layer to the film. From the warm pink walls of the Tenenbaum's home on Archer Avenue, to the closet filled with board games, to Royal's head stone at the very end, it all adds to the ageless, timeless, warm feeling we get from this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER*******bE AWARE SPOILER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER BE AWARE SPOILER`The Royal Tenenbaums' is a film about a dysfunctional family. A father played by Gene Hackman has treated his family very badly ever since he and his wife started to have children, and this film is about his desire to rejoin the family. However, part of the reason for this change is to have a place to live because he is broke, and in the process finds himself wanting to be part of the family again. The major characters for this paper are Ben Stiller, Paltrow, and L. Wilson which are the three children, and there is Gene Hackman This film uses many different filming techniques to make this film extremely exceptional. The first thing is showing the family when the children are very young, and using written cues on the screen to name the children, and show us their rooms. This is important because each of the three children have rooms that are tailored in a particular way. Stiller's character is a business man, and his room is tailored like an office, Paltrow's character is a play right, and shows her room full of books of plays; a generally more artistic room. Finally, L. Wilson was a tennis player, and his room is full of trophies and has a sportier look. This variation of the rooms gives the audience a feel for the different personalities of the characters. Stiller's character is very forceful, and relentless. Platrow appears to be very detached from reality, as most writers tend to be, and L. Wilson's character is always wearing a headband and arm covers as sporty people were. These overall differences in the characters make the film better because they each have their very separate personalities that show throughout the film. For example, when Gene Hackman's character wishes to return to the family Stiller's character is very suspicios, Paltrow is very detached and emotionless, and L. Wilsons character is more open to the idea. For Wilson this is probably true because when he was younger Hackman's would take him out and do things with him, while the other two were not allowed to go. Another important part to this film was the use of slow motion and music. There are two scenes that show this best. The first scene is when Paltrow is going to pick of L. Wilson from his arriving home, and when she exits the bus to and sees him it starts to play a very sedutive song that is about love, and has her moving a very slow motion pace. This is because L. Wilson is in love with Paltrow, his adopted sister, and this gives us more incite into his feelings of love for her which he proclaimed early in the film. This is a very powerful scene because the music with the slow motion envokes a response in me that I am not use to feeling, and I am sure that many other people probably feel the same way. This scene also goes back and fourth from her walking in slow motion, to seeing Wilson's face, to show that what we are seeing and feeling is what he is seeing and feeling. Another scene this slow motion in music is in is at the end when the cast is at Gene Hackman's grave site. As the all are leaving the grave it starts to play a song that is in a way sad and happy at the same time. With the song they all start to walk a way in this same slow motion, that appears to coordinated with the music. It makes you sad that he is dead, but happy that in the end he finally got to be part of his family, even if it was only for a little time. Overall, this film uses many different techniques to invoke emotional responses, and does it very well. In the end these techniques just make you feel good about the ending, even though someone in the family has died. This is a very awesome film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The devil is in the details, or so goes the cliché, but it really does hold true in film making. Wes Anderson is the first director to really open my eyes to this. Film is an art form that can be broken down to a synthesis of photography and literature. When the narrative of a film started to become the most important aspect however, the emphasis on composition was lessened. Composition is a broad subject, but it is part of the composition specifically that I want to discuss, the mis en scene. Wes Anderson uses the mis en scene in a way that really catches my eye. Sometimes it seems like films don't spend too much time thinking about mis en scene, how many times have we seen the same locations used over and over again? Wes Anderson manages to create his own worlds in film without being fantastical or clichéd. Every scene is so rich with detail that it is impossible to absorb it all in one viewing. Each room in the Tenenbaum house is so full of life and memories. One of my favorites is the game closet. All of the dusty board games hold so many memories. Also all of the paintings done by Ritchie in the film (actually done by Wes Anderson's brother) are the perfect fit for the film; sweet, innocent at first glance, but holding so much more. The films of Wes Anderson are exactly the same way. The soft colors, fun tunes, and quirky humor really bring you in to the movie, and when you are drawn in the characters begin to open up and you begin to see the dark side of things. In Rushmore Max's puppy love crush on his teacher seems sweet and funny, but when it turns into obsession filled with lies and attempts on his friend Bill Murray's life you aren't sure whether to laugh or not anymore. A similar situation happens with Ben Stiller in Tenenbaums. We all laugh at his jump suits and crazy mannerisms, but once the first giggles wear off we see through these quirks to the cause, his wife's untimely death, and see a sad neurotic individual who isn't so funny anymore. It this constant up and down between comedy and tragedy that really makes Tenenbaums special; we get both a hilarious family comedy and a serious epic chronicling the history of a family. Anderson is obviously referencing The Magnificent Ambersons and he succeeds in capturing the scope and feel of this classic, at the same time the movie manages to be one of the funniest I've ever seen. It's amazing that he can fit that much into a movie. Of course some may argue that he tries to fit too much into the movie. And to a point I agree. There is so much backstory and so many characters in Tenenbaums that it is easy to get lost as all of them attempt to have their own stories. There is a focal point though, and it is easily Gene Hackman. His portrayal of Royal is easily my favorite part of the movie. He is just a really loveable son of a bitch of a character, and Hackman plays him perfectly. I really like how the movie is presented as a novel. I found myself wanting to go out and buy this book. It was a nice way to segment the story and remind us of its literary lineage. My favorite is the reference to From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. All in all, I really love this film. It may be a little too ambitious, but it has so many things going for it. This is the only movie I've paid to see in the theaters more than three times. Every time I watch it I get something new out of it and spot another great little detail that makes the movie so much funnier or deeper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums is a bittersweet but heartwarming tale of a family who is more or less in shambles. The story follows an estranged father by the name of Royal Tenenbaum, played by Gene Hackman, who desperately tries to win back the affection of his three children after years of deceit, betrayal, and absenteeism. The children, three now grown former child-prodigies, and their mother come together under one roof for the first time in nearly two decades, each under a set of different circumstances caused by dissatisfaction with their current lives. What ensues is a hilarious and poignant story of trying to right the wrongs in one's life before it is too late. One of the central themes in The Royal Tenenbaums is finding one's own niche, especially a place in their family. Today more than ever, many families possess one or more dysfunctional aspects and the Tenenbaums seem to be more broken than a good deal of dysfunctional families. Each character throughout the film struggles with their personal hardships with fitting in the family to some extent headed by Royal (but more so Etheline, played by Anjelica Huston). Royal has troubles winning back Chas's (Ben Stiller) love because he has stolen from him multiple times and even lodged a round in his hand while back-stabbing him in a bb gun war when he was young. Etheline has trouble trusting Royal because he has emotionally damaged the children many times and left her to raise the children alone. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) despises Royal for constantly reminding her that she is indeed adopted as well as for treating her that way. Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson) has the best relationship with Royal of the Tenenbaum children, but his secret love for Margot leaves him feeling both rejected and lonely. Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) strongly desires to be a Tenenbaum which may be the source of his struggles in the film and the root of his drug addiction. As in his previous film Rushmore, Anderson meticulously places well selected songs to enrich the more emotional parts of the story and make those scenes stand out in the viewer's memory. The scene where Richie attempts suicide after feeling both rejected and neglected by Margot, properly accompanied by Elliott Smith's `Needle in the Hay,' puts a tear in my eye and sends a chill down my spine every time I view the movie. When Richie unsuccessfully tries to set things straight with Margot and finally lays his love for her out in the open, the scene is catapulted straight to the front of my memory as the Rolling Stones' `Ruby Tuesday' rings out over one of the more touching moments presented on film. Wes Anderson has a knack for film-making. His style involves focusing mostly on character development, giving them very real characteristics and emotions which make the individuals in the movie so real that the audience can make concrete connections with their inner-struggles as well as their sunnier moments. Anderson's use of pop culture songs also adds to the familiarity with the film and thus creates a more intimate and real viewing experience. With The Royal Tenenbaums, Wes Anderson has painted a gorgeous portrait of optimism and hope, not to be overshadowed by the pain and sorrow in the plot. The Royal Tenenbaums is one of the most beautiful films I have ever had the privilege of viewing and I anxiously anticipate the director's future projects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Royal Tenebaum's is a well written film directed by Wes Anderson.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaum's is a well written film directed by Wes Anderson. It is a story about a typical dysfunctional family: the main difference being that this family is compromised of out of the ordinary geniuses. The head of the family is Royal Tenenbaum. Away from his wife and children he makes a bid to make amends while his children coincidentally return home form a break from the mental anguish of being geniuses. Trying to win there love back he comes back into their lives and attempts to reach his goal by stating that he is dying from cancer. There is a scene in the movie where Luke is listening to an old Rolling Stones record on his player while he is also having an intense conversation with his adapted sister. At the start of the scene, Luke drops the needle into the groove and starts a sweet song. Luke and his sister share their feelings for each other and it is decided that she cannot return the love that he has for her, she feels that it has to be a secret. After the situation is final she leaves and Luke's heart is broken. This is just one example of the great stuff that `The Royal Tenebaum's' has to offer. Each character is different from each other. One is a distant mother, another is a troubled business genius, then you have a artist who is free spirited, a tennis champion and the want to be next door neighbor. This is very obvious a character driven movie that will make you question and laugh. Beside the characters mentioned above there are a few remaining weird ones as well. This movie is brought together by the help of a brilliant cast and a great director. Its worth seeing twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is about a dysfunctional family. The three children were world-famous geniouses until they became teenagers and their lives fell apart. Margo (Gwyneth Paltrow, "Shakespeare in Love") published many successful plays and then dove into secrecy around the age of 13/14. Chas (Ben Stiller, "Meet the Parents") was a highly successful buissness man in real estate, then he married, had two kids, and his wife died. Richie (Luke Wilson, "Legally Blonde") was a world famous tennis player. The father (Gene Hackerman) fakes a terminal disease to try and get his family to like him after his failure as a parent and husband. Anjelica Huston plays Etheline Tenenbaum, the mother of the three children. This movie was quirky and interesting. My favorite part was the beginning, the cast of characters and introduction. It was simple and direct about complex and secretive characters, telling the little details about the characters. The rest of the movie wasn't bland, but it was very quiet and dark. This wasn't a comedy, the parts that might've been funny were sad.Overall, this was a dark, quirky, artistic, and strange.**1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

It was a call out for help, but also a realization that he had people around him that he could trust and love. The people I saw it with thought I was a bastard for saying that (Although I did laugh a little, which probably influenced their disdain for my attitude), I think not.</fullReview>

When you watch this type of film what's interesting is that they're about the struggle we have to survive and to relate to each other, there's not going to be any fruit carts/green wire/red wire situations, presidents fighting terrorists etc. Approach these films from this direction and you'll start to appreciate them.

		<fullReview>I tried hard to watch this film and appreciate all the comments that other reviewers had left. Was it intense, funny, original? Certainly a degree of originality crept into the film but sadly that's where my interest waned. Nothing happens in this film, just because a film has good actors and an original plot doesn't make it an instant hit or a cult classic.I am not on the mainstream, looking for big explosions or gun fights, but there are better examples of acting making films, take `Once Were Warriors' or 'Citizen X' great examples of splendid acting saving what could have been mediocre films. But this film fails in every respect, it is not beautiful nor interesting, it is dreary, dull and has no redeeming features. It was only sheer laziness that stopped me turning off the film before the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many seem disappointed with this movie as a "comedy". Ben Stiller may be on the cover, but this is NOT "There's Something About Mary." Put your mind more on the works of J.D. Salinger et al. You're laughing when you realize just how very tragic and disconnected this family is; the odd, sudden, roundabout imagery is what you'll derive any humor at all from. I didn't go in expecting the style of the Farrelly brothers... if you've seen Rushmore you know what you're in for here. If not...When you think to yourself "what in the hell is going on?" think what you're doing. Laughing, smiling, getting aggravated, depressed? This could be your reaction to this movie. While most comedy films spell everything out for you in gags, this film lets some details slip by when you watch. This makes it the kind of film you can watch several times, catching something new each time.I enjoyed the film because the screenplay and acting is excellent, plus it's a Wes Anderson film so you know the soundtrack is great.

		<fullReview>This is one odd family. All the kids are prodigies, becoming messed up adults. Sure, the father abandoned them, and the mother seems a bit too orderly - but still, I see no clue either to the genius of the kids or to their adult misery.The film is a pile of jokes and absurdities, and that's fine with me. Like a Marx brothers thing. But the Marx never pretended to have a plot worth contemplating, whereas the Tenenbaum story does. It doesn't compute. Every new information we receive about anyone of the characters - and there's plenty of it - just raises new questions. Why? How?Although there is a lot of fun going on, right to the end, the shortcomings in the plot and the lack of penetration into what drives the characters, sort of makes the film evaporate at the very moment it ends, leaving no lasting aftertaste.The Tenenbaums should have been a bit less funny, to give room for their characters to take form - or even more funny, never once leaving the absurd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Genius! The Royal Tanenbaums is one of the best movies I've seen in a long while. Edward Gorey meets Days of Our Lives. True to form, Gene Hackman was scintillating. Owen Wilson was, well, Owen Wilson--delightful to the hilt. Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bill Murray, and Luke Wilson proved to be equally stellar. A star studded cast that built the perfect dysfunctional family.I waited almost a year until this film was out of the theatres before I saw it. I'm very skeptical of my friends' opinions, but had someone cued me in to this film's pure originality, I would have rushed to the theatres to see it.One reason this film is so attractive is its consistency. The characters are undeniably unique and don't deviate a degree from their established personality. The structure of the film is very fluid, a story built around chapters of a book checked out from the library about the Tanenbaum family (perhaps one of Eli's novel's or maybe one of Margo's plays) narrated by Alec Baldwin. Also, the grainy, circa 1970s cinematography creates the perfect ambiance for the film. It makes the story seem fictional, obviously a film that has jumped inside a book but hasn't blurred the sharp, crisp edges of reality (the library book) with the soft, rainy lines of the story.Completely delightful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances in a strange family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Royal Tenenbaum is the head of a family. He has a wife Etheline, two sons and one adopted daughter. All three children are successful in their own way, when they are still very young. He leaves the family but never divorces from his wife. Years later we see the daughter, Margot, married to Raleigh. She doesn't love him anymore. One son, Chas, has lost his wife and is raising his two sons alone. The other son, Richie, has stopped his professional tennis career and is now on a cruise ship for a long time. Luke has a best friend, Eli, and he says to him in a letter that he is in love with Margot.Then Royal comes back, saying he is very sick and will die in six weeks. Every Tenenbaum is called back to the house because Royal wants to make up with the whole family. His wife has fallen in love with another man called Henry and Royal is trying to get rid of him. He wants to band with the other members as well. The only one who still seems to like Royal is Richie.The story may sound a little complicated, but it absolutely is not. The thing you learn during the movie, is that none of the characters is really happy. They will be, we guess. Another thing we see is that the family members all have their strange things. Being in love with your adopted sister is one. Being loved in return makes it even stranger. They all have something, not only Richie and Margot. Because they have strange things some sad things happen. A lot of funny things happen as well. The movie is a comedy in its own way.The writing is clever, direction good. What I think is taking the movie to a higher lever is the acting. Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum is truly great. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow (Margot) and Luke Wilson (Richie) especially in their scenes together. The rest of the cast including Ben Stiller (Chas), Owen Wilson (Eli), Anjelica Huston (Etheline), Bill Murray (Raleigh) and Danny Glover (Henry) proves that an all-star cast sometimes can work very good. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of Wes Anderson's previous works, I must admit I viewed The Royal Tenenbaums with somewhat of a biased opinion. However, after watching it (and then watching it again, and again...), I have to say, bias or no bias, this is an amazing film.Wes Anderson puts a whole lotta love into his movies - the viewer feels as if he really cares about each character, no matter how dirty, arrogant, or just plain mean they may be. This love is apparent in the brilliant dialogue of the movie, not to mention the equal amount of time meticulously spent on each character. This gives the film a heartwarming (albeit not in the conventional sense of the word) feel that is too incredible to convey through words. It must simply be watched to be understood.I've heard people say they didn't find this movie funny - I laughed my ass off throughout the entire thing. Gene Hackman is amazing as the Tenenbaum patriarch, as are the rest of the cast, with no exception whatsoever. Danny Glover is extremely likeable in his role as Huston's suitor, Henry Sherman. Luke and Owen Wilson are amazing in their respective roles as Richie Tenenbaum and Eli Cash. Gwyneth Paltrow displays understated brilliance as Margot Tenenbaum. And, of course, Ben Stiller is hilarious as Chas Tenenbaum. Not to mention the bit players - they're just as great.Everyone should see this movie, with no exception.

		<fullReview>This movie has the quirky style Rushmore, but ultimately doesn't know whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama. The family itself is a caricature, so we shouldn't take them seriously, but then again the movie rarely made me actually laugh. The storyline is material for a drama. The cast does a good job, if they are trying for a dramatic tone. But how do we care about such ridiculous characters? Overall, seems like an attempt to use a style where it doesn't work. Watch Rushmore if you want to see a good movie by these guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was listed at my video store as a 'comedy'. I think this was somewhat misleading. While it certainly had funny bits in it I consider it more of a dramatic piece with occasional highlights of the ludicrous in life. That said, this movie is difficult to pigeon-hole in other ways. It has a fantastic ensemble cast but is more than a mere ensemble piece. It is dark yet sweet, funny and tragic. It is not the type of film I rave about (unlike Rushmore) as soon as it ends, but it is one that I will think about days after it is over. An interesting piece, well executed, but more quietly impressive than overwhelmingly brilliant. My vote 7/10 but would almost have been an 8.</fullReview>

All the people i saw it in the cinema with didnt like it.But for me, it was well-directed, well written, beautifully shot and not one actor in the film could be guilty of not doing their part brilliantly. Some outstanding performances are given by gene hackman, stiller and the wilsons, and i cant help but smile whenever bill murray comes onto the screen. The film is a fairytale and is delivered in that format, and so has the potential to appeal to all.If you want to watch a nice film you can do this, if you want to dissect a carefully constructed piece of work, TRT also offers this. I recommend it to everyone, but i dont expect everyone to like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Anderson's inner child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson is in touch with his inner child to an extend unmatched by any current filmmaker I can think of. He remembers well what it's like to spend hours in bed (because you can't sleep but you're not allowed to get up), staring at wallpaper, and hence, why that wallpaper had to be alive with possibilities, like dancing zebras. He remembers the let's-run-away fantasies that were captured in the book "From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler," about hiding away in the cozy confines of the Museum of Natural History with the stuffed elephants and giraffes. And he has channeled such pleasures as the way a stack of board games looks after years of competitive play with one's brothers and sisters. These thoughts, feelings, sensations, of being a child and wanting to go back to the familial home are the unique delights of watching "The Royal Tenenbaums."The three grown, brilliant, and disturbed Tenenbaum children are working out issues from their childhood as well in their adult life when they return to the rambling, pink-walled, shabby-chic house that their mother (Anjelica Huston) still calls home; this exercise for each of them takes on added significance when their self-absorbed, estranged father Royal also comes home to convalesce. Oldest son and financial wizard Chas (Ben Stiller) mourns his recently deceased wife, but also has some serious father resentment, filled with anger at his father due to episodes ranging from Royal taking money from him as a child, to an unfortunate BB-gun shooting incident. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) pouts girlishly when she learns that Chas has run home, and does the same to get away from her weirdo academic husband; she's also working out some brotherly love issues she has with her other sibling Richie. Richie (Luke Wilson) is the most intriguing character. He has some fascinating traits, like the constant drinking of bloody mary's--he carries a pepper shaker around with him at all times--and the continued wearing of his old pro-tennis ensembles. He still loves to camp out in his pup tent, listening to records and reading a beat-up old copy of Margot's long-ago written plays. And one can see why they all have said issues: Royal, played brilliantly by Gene Hackman, is an often insensitive "sonavabitch," but is also the most spontaneous, fun-loving eccentric of the family. They know he breathes life into the house, and it frustrates everyone to realize how necessary he is for balance in their lives.A fully and meticulously realized world, like the one Anderson creates for these characters, is much less literal and much more pleasurable for recalling childhood than some Hollywood yarn about waking to meet yourself as a child in the living room in order to find your schmaltzy inner man, or whatever they'll come up with next. Get "The Royal Tenenbaums" on DVD, watch it a zillion times, and enjoy all the tiniest, primal details that will really tap into something and bring you back to when your imagination ran wild.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Royal" Treatment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dysfunction has never been so entertaining. The Royal Tenebaums is satisfying blend of superb acting and sharp writing. Director Wes Anderson(Rushmore) re-teams with co-writer and actor Owen Wilson to deliver this comedic and surprisingly touching tale. Tenebaums proves that dysfunction is all relative. The story provides better character development than this season's other ensemble pic, Ocean's Eleven. If you thought that your family was screwed up, try growing up in family of geniuses. There's the patriarch, Royal(Hackman) an accomplished attorney and bastardly father. The resolute mother, Etheline played by Anjelica Houston. Houston herself is no stranger to playing quirky mothers(see The Addams Family) Then there's the children, Chas, Margot &amp; Richie. Chas(Stiller) is the neurotic financier and recently widowed father of two. Margot(Paltrow), the sullen playwright, whose referred to as the "adopted" daughter throughout the film. Finally there's Richie(Luke Wilson), the tortured ex-tennis champ whose had a crush on his "sister" Margot since adolescence. Rounding out the cast is Owen Wilson, a childhood friend who wants nothing more than to keep up with the Tenebaums. Danny Glover is Etheline's conservative new paramour and Royal's new adversary. Then Bill Murray portrays Margot's fifth and much older husband. Anderson definitely deserves accolades for his expertise in handling such a large cast.The basic plot is as follows, Royal Tenebaum has become estranged from his family for the last 20 years. He's been disbarred and is currently living out of a hotel room. He learns about his wife's new beau and sets out to do something about it. So Royal does what any good father and husband would do. He fakes a terminal illness in order to get back into his family's good graces. During which he spends his most of his quality time with his family. Quality time for Royal consists of taking his grandsons to illegal dog fights and shoplifting. Hackman hasn't had a role this meaty in years and he knows it. It's like watching the Lex Luthor Family reunion. The story plays out in chapters and unlike the aforementioned (but still cool) Ocean's Eleven, every character is given an adequate background. And amazingly enough as the movie progresses the Tenebaum clan become less weird and more familiar. The characters evolve from an eccentric bunch of whackos into something that may resemble your own family. This movie is as heartwarming as it is funny. All the while never compromising it's integrity or impact.(Look to see Hackman and/or Anderson around Oscar time).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made and presented, but ultimately very uninteresting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A different and unusual film that is certainly well made, technically and artistically. Some of the scene's should have frames around as they appear to be meticulously created. The performances of the actors, I felt, were very good.So why don't we have a good film. Well, simply the story and characters. The story is quite boring. Added to that a bunch of uninteresting, unrealistic, apathetic characters that seem to be devoid of life and incredibly na?ve. Nothing of real interest happens to them and of course when anything does you don't particular care. The dark comedy is there, but is too rare and only occasionally amusing. In between there are plenty of very painful drawn out scene's with no real interest, especially towards the end of the film.In the end, there was a real feeling of pointlessness. I certainly commend the effort in the making of the film and I'm pleased it's different from the norm, it's just a shame the talents of the director are so lacking when it comes to writing a story.By the way, I don't think you could be more insulting with some of the reviews. Just because people don't like this one film, don't assume somehow that they are stupid fools that like every other crap run of the mill comedy out there. Everyone is different and this is a strange film, so not likely to be to everyone's taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not very good with words so please bear with me. This film is, (in my opinion), a work of genius. It made me laugh, not often, but I found myself with a smile on my face most of the time. Gene Hackman (who I always doubted frankly) turns in his best work. Ever. Gwyneth Paltrow is equally engaging. Ben Stiller shows a side I didn't know he even possessed but Luke Wilson, as ex-sports pro Richie Tenenbaum is a real treat. His role is, er, let's say far from your typical family-drama role, and he handles it wonderfully. I haven't even mentioned Bill Murray and his child study yet. Another stunning cameo double-act with some blindingly funny lines. The soundtrack? Well, if you had listed it I would have scorned you and referred you to my parents, as it's not really my thing, but in the film itself it works brilliantly. Ruby Tuesday and Hey Jude will never sound the same to me ever again.I've just re-read this and I don't think i put it across very well. If you find yourself with a spare evening this week with nothing else to do, pop down to your local video store and rent this. You'll be glad you did. Trust me. Any film who's funniest line centres around a suicide note must be worth watching once.M.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A favorite of mine, but not for everyone. (Maybe a few spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only a favorite of the year , but an all-time favorite. I've always liked Wes Anderson's way of storytelling and this film is similar in style to his others. It's kind of dark and kind of dry and a little silly and a bit over-the-top, but it works for me. It's just my style.I like all the characters, Richie and Pagoda being my favorites. I think the characters are very interesting, and I even felt for them and related to them,too. But I understand where the others are coming from, they just can't accept some aspects of this film, therefor they can't accept the film.This isn't a laugh until your face is blue film, but I was highly entertained and did laugh aloud a few times. For me this is a film I'll watch a hundred times and always like. I've watched it about 5 times in 2 weeks and I liked it more everytime.Wes Anderson has such a way with crafting stories and no one can deny he didn't put a lot of thought into it. So to everyone I say at least watch it once, because this film deserves that much.Oh, and the film is a comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dreary and reclusive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want a smart, sly or dark comedy, don't watch this one. As dark comedies go (if that's what this was supposed to be), it doesn't come close to Fargo, Dr. Strangelove or The Big Lebowski. And if it's supposed to be an eccentric drama, then it pales compared with a movie like David Lynch's Mulholland Drive. Now there's a movie that stays with you after you watch it.Rarely have I seen a movie that left me so emotionally and intellectually uninvolved. Watching the three pampered Tennenbaum children wallow in self-pity or grief or whatever it is they've chosen to sulk about for two hours left me apathetic. I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them because they had so little life and did little or nothing to help themselves.And if this movie was not supposed to be a comedy, then the borderline psychoses that drive them all back under the matriarch's roof become mere plot contrivances. Chas is afraid his house will burn down. Margo (locked in her bathroom for hours every day) walks out on her husband. Richie (world traveler) is in love with his adopted sister.And if this wasn't supposed to be a comedy, why have the Danny Glover character dropping into a ditch, why have Chas T. and his sons running around in track suits all the time, why have Eli crashing through a second-story window after crashing his car? These are not the elements of straight drama. And the "adopted child" lines that I presume were intended to be funny got stale after about the 10th one.Compare any of these characters with Dude or Walter in the Cohen Brothers' The Big Lebowski. The Dude lives by a code and embraces his lifestyle, but I could relate to a guy with brains who basically drops out and expects little in return -- just a non-peed-on-rug. And his buddy Walter who sees everything through his Vietnam War prism. I've known real people like these two. One guy I worked with would introduce Civil War history into almost every conversation.By contrast, the three children in the Royal Tennenbaums are so needy and have so little to give, I couldn't relate. If they were seeking my sympathy (and they surely were pathetic), they only got my apathy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is one of the best movies I have ever seen! This movie is absolutely superb. The acting talents of Gwyneth Paltrow and Luke Wilson especially stuck out in this film as outstanding! This film should have received a lot more credit than it did by magazines, websites, and most of all, by the "Academy". The most entertaining thing about The Royal Tenenbaums is the characters. Bill Murray, Danny Glover, and Ben Stiller played their parts beyond what I expected. I also took special interest in the young talented actors who played Chaz Tenenbaums' sons, Ozzie and Oozie. The costumes were great and so were the writing credits of Wes Anderson and of course, the great Owen Wilson. But, I believe that no one could have done the characters of Mother and Father Tenenbaum like Anjelica Huston and Gene Hackman. I would highly suggest that you rent this film if you want to see a movie to make you laugh and turn you on! The nudity is in two seperate scences, but not for very long. The language is not that bad either. I somewhat disagree with the R rating, but the nudity brought it up to the "RESTRICTED" standards. The Royal Tenenbaums is a true classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice, Quality Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I'd like to preface my comment by saying that I didn't see this movie in the theatre and I think that probably tempered my enthusiasm somewhat. I know a lot of people think they can throw a 100" screen in their den and pretend they still get a movie experience, I have to disagree. There is still no substitute to seeing a movie on the big screen.Having said that, I found this movie to be quite charming, albeit a little self-involved. I suppose this movie would fall under the farce category although it was given a neo-hip twist. However you want to label it, it was intelligent, witty and very well cast. I personally believe Gene Hackman has been the best male actor of the last 30 years. The breadth and depth of his roles has been staggering and he has long ago surpassed Al Pacino and Robert Dinero.I viewed some of the comments and I found a lot of typical comments pro and con that fit into two basic camps. You have the artsy film enthusiasts who rejects mainstream film and cherish films by avant-garde directors and you have those that disagree with the first camp. It's always hilarious to read the invectives tossed by both camps. Personally, I can appreciate all kinds of movies. I can enjoy this film and then turn around and enjoy Something About Mary. And I don't think that's a contradiction. I sometimes feel people use movies as a vehicle to define themselves and I think that is the wrong perspective.I believe films should be based on their own merits without trying to label them. Film-making is an artform, whether you agree or not. In order to appreciate art, it has to elicit a reaction from you. You don't necessarily have to understand the reaction, however. I always laugh when I see someone dismiss a criticism of a movie by stating that the critic "didn't get it". Sometimes, there isn't an "it" to get.But enough of that. The Royal Tenebaums is a movie that I have no strong desire to see again right away. It didn't provoke much afterthought on my part. And to me, those are qualities that I find in great movies. As such, I'd say it was a good movie with one great performance. I do look forward to more from the director. I hope he continues to grow. He is unique in Hollywood and that is always refreshing.</fullReview>

I really like movies that have a crystal clear idea of what they want to look and sound like, and I respect Wes Anderson for giving us a very beautifully artistic movie -- it's much more polished than Rushmore, which I liked very much. Its greatest strength is its STYLE; Royal Tenenbaums is stylized down to every detail, including the 70's soundtrack, the sparingly clever dialogue, the locations which say New York without ever actually saying "New York", the characteristic clothes each character wears: Gwyneth's izod dresses, Ben Stiller's Adidas workout suits, Danny Glover's old-fashioned suits. But at the same time, the style is its weakness; Anderson only treats his subject matter and his characters superficially. This bothers me mostly in retrospect -- I know I was smiling while I was watching this movie, and I was admiring what Anderson was giving us and not hung up on what he wasn't. So on the one hand, I can't give it a negative review, because it is fun to watch, but on the other hand there's that "So what?" feeling you get after you've seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"No Humor" "Drama or Comedy?" "Boring" "Meet the Parents ruled!" You should be shot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, that's right, if any of these thoughts crossed your mind while watching The Royal Tenenbaums...quite frankly, you should be shot. Why? Because it's people like you who give directors a reason to direct other people's screenplays, who laugh at the trailers for Zoolander -- and generally anything that goes for cheap shots and obvious dreck, who are responsible for the Adam Sandler movies (not Punch-Drunk Love though, that's gonna be great because the other Anderson knows how to elicit greatness in the unlikeliest of places), and generally the state of films today -- that is to say terrible, one out of every ten movies is decent...maybe it's just the summertime.I've sifted through many of the comments here and they've thrown me into a bilious rage. Boring? Go watch a movie where fast moving cameras work in horrible tandem with fast editing, that's where you'll get your fix. Doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy or a drama? Are you stupid? Drama comes from Greek, which roughly translates as "Sacrifice", essentially the victimization of someone/something conducive to sadness. Comedy is the same thing -- victimization conducive to humor. Drama and Comedy are the same thing, they just happen to yeild different results. Now, most people would be satisfied with that mesh alone, but Wes Anderson has done us a great service and gone even further -- a kind of absurdist humor situated in a warped and utterly self containted universe -- a microcosm where humor, sadness, the outrageous and the endearing coexist. If you disagree, you should be gagged, tortured and...well, you get the point.I have found some of the comments hilarious, if only for the stupidity of it all -- someone explaining how a good movie resolves everything at the end, someone explaining how humor is a reaction and should only be a reaction to be funny, so on and so forth.It's people like you -- YOU know who you are, you idiot -- that are responsible for the destruction of The Magnificent Amberson's lost footage, for the proliferation of stupid teen comedies, for the PG-13 rating system (read: cutting a piece of crap down to appeal to the masses (read: teenagers)) Whew, double parenthetical, and for...god, I'm so tired...what's the point?One last thing: Something that I have found funny in the movie, which I have tried to express to my friends without success, is a very subtle but gut-wrenchingly hilarious touch. When Owen Wilson's character says to Luke Wilson's character "And she's your sister" to which he retorts "Adopted" and then there is a long pause, Owen Wilson looks to the side, then back, and the movie just cuts straight to the title card. That's brilliant. I think I've seen it before in an older director's movie, his name I can't remember -- the characters saying everything they need to say, and then the camera lingering, the actors waiting for the next scene and then the rush of the title cards. Great stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It was so well written, acted, and directed. I have never seen a film like this before. It cannot be compared to any other movie, it stands alone. Gene Hackman was brilliant, I adored his day with his grandchildren. Anyone that loves hidden treasures will love this film. When I first saw this movie, there were two other people in the theatre, I thought that meant it would be awful. I never knew how how wrong I would be. I laughed and cried during this movie. I did not want it to end. Most movies I sit that and look at my watch wondering when will it ever end, I was sad when this was over. Go see it, you'll love it. It was great fun!!!!</fullReview>

Very organic script that doesn't necessarily hype up every-day life with over-dramatics, something so many people think should be present in a film these days.Instead, this film displays a disfunctional family (aren't all families that way these days?) at face value and tells a story of real life.On a side note, I was very much reminded of "The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz", and wonder if the name of Richie's falcon was a nod to the Canadian writer of that particular novel, Mordecai Richler?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like an Edward Gorey book... (SPOILERS!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Anderson knows that Hollywood movies have an overblown view of reality, so that poor people live in twelve-room houses and drive SUVs, or that explosions ALWAYS have flaming fireballs that are shown two or three times in slow motion. This is why the Tenenbaum family is so over the top, and broadly drawn; the entire film is a joke on: (A) the way Hollywood does dysfunctional families and (B) on how the studios portray genius. I get the feeling that the drawing style of Edward Gorey was the model, with some additions by Charles Addams (Paltrow's character looks like one of his "New Yorker" drawings.) And because it is a joke on Hollywood's simulacrum America, nobody acts like a real person (i.e. Royal's story about Pagoda, Chas' one-dimensionality, Ritchie's suicide attempt.) Even New York's crummy cabs are cartoonishly represented by the rusted-out crudmobiles of the "Gypsy Cab Co." As a person who grew up with cartoons I can relate to Anderson's view, and I get the feeling that ex-cartoon watchers will get this film as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As soon as the first line drops you will be able to see the similarities between this and 1999's Rushmore. The story has an all star cast all making their best out of what they have been given here. The story revolves around a rich family. An uncaring father (a hilariously heart-felt performace from the never dissapointing Gene Hackman), an adopted daughter, 2 sons, and a best friend from across the street. After Royal (Hackman) is kicked out by his wife everything slowly goes downhill. But after 20 years of not seeing his family Royal wants to make up for lost time so he tells his family he is dying so he can move back in. But of course the feelings are mixed on the idea of dad moving back in. All the children are played greatly by Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Gweneth Paltrow. It may run a little flat at time but this often funny, often sentimental, often heart warming, often offbeat film on the importance of family values is worth the hour and fiftey minutes it runs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie stays low key, and hits on a lot of levels with a lot of characters. But its like a great car that you drive down a country road in second gear: you will either appreciate the smooth ride, the beautiful weather, the excellent craftsmanship, and the music tying it all together nicely. OR, you will grip the steering wheel tight and feel the anxiety that comes with not going faster.Apparently there are two definite sides here: those who think this film is a gem, and those who think it is a waste of time. I personally thought it was great, precious, and wonderfully done. BUT, had I gone in expecting something more funny (ie. "Meet The Parents") I would have been disappointed.Either way, its a flavor that is definitely worth tasting. Rent two DVDs, put this one in first, give it 40 minutes, and then decide if it is for you or not.Cheers.</fullReview>

I also love how the movie is narrated. It's like watching a play of sorts. The cast of characters is so well constructed and you really come to care for them.

		<fullReview>After watching Rushmore a few years back and falling completely in love with the movie, I was eagerly anticipating Anderson and Wilson's follow-up, The Royal Tenenbaums. Unfortunately, i was thoroughly bored by this movie. And, it really is a shame, since this movie has an all-star cast of great comic actors. The sad thing is that several of the actors talents, such as Bill Murray's portrayal of Raleigh St Clair, were totally wasted on this movie. Why you would take one of the great comic geniuses of our time and put him in a boring role with little to no lines, and no character development, is beyond me.The movie was quite reminiscent of Bottle Rocket for me. There was a lot of background story, and you get the feeling that they are just building up to a greater story. However, by the time the movie really gets going, it is just about over. There was only one scene in the movie that made me laugh, and that was the scene where Royal Tenenbaum takes his grandchildren on the town, teaching them how to create mischief. It was part of the trailer, so anyone who has seen it has seen the only funny part of this movie. Maybe part of my disappointment was because i was wanting this movie to be another Rushmore, which is not fair on my part. However, i don't think it can begin to hold a candle to its predecessor. Rushmore was just a great story, without all the big-name actors. It just goes to show that sometimes all the big names in the world can't help a story.</fullReview>

Actually, it's really just a sentimental family sitcom, something which should be strictly reserved for TV. It's not witty or complex enough to disguise itself or redefine that genre. Gene Hackman is the highpoint; he's always a pleasure to watch. Angelica Huston is wasted. Everyone else is in their element.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Royal Tenebaums is an outstanding production. I thought Rushmore was perfectly done, but The Royal Tenebaums is by far Andersons masterpiece. Its a shame he dosn't do films more often becuase all of his movies are well acted, well written, and of course, well directed. The overlapping stories and quirks of all the Tenebaums is something to take notice to. The characters in the movie (with the exception of Ben Stiller) are all very emotionless, and unusual. Yet, even with all the emotionless characters, it was acted perfeclty because of its black comedy background. Theres really not much else to say. It's the type of movie that you either love it or hate it. If your interested in seeing a black comedy, with an all star cast, and are a fan of Wes Andersons Rushmore, or Bottle Rocket this movie is well worth viewing. Also take notice to the music in the movie. Sometimes the music seems to be too upbeat for the scenerio, but that just adds to the darkness of the comedy. Easily a nine out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and I love things that are unique. Anyway, all I have to say is that this movie is very unique &amp; entertaining. It is not as much of a comedy as I thought it was going to be, but I still enjoyed it very much. There are some 'normal' funny parts but also subtle humorous situations and dialog which turn out great. The movie is much more than that though...it's hard to explain. There's a lot of great stuff here: an big great cast, excellent script &amp; direction, a lot of connections and detail, it's pretty amazing. I love how it's all because of Royal (who's sort of the bad guy) that everyone's problems and secrets come to light after all this time, which in turn let's them help their own and each others problems there by making all their lives better. It's because of Royal getting them all back together. It's different, a little weird and definitely not a typical played out story. I suggest you watch it yourself and see if enjoy it. I give it 7 stars out of 10. (sometimes I think it deserves more,..sometimes I don't. I just can't decide, so I'll stick with a 7*'s.Recommendation: Ghost World (2001). Not that these two movies are related much, if at all. I happened to enjoy very much and rate it higher than The Royal Tenenbaums. It's another unique non-hollywood movie that is also very funny and weird. Please watch it.</fullReview>

If you like funny, well made, intelligent, original, wonderfully acted, well cast film then this is the one for you. The rest of clown who thought it was boring should continue to worship Adam Sandler.There are so many memorable scenes in this film. Wonderful dialogue and flawless production. The attention to detail in this film is flawless. From the color schemes for the different characters to Richie's drawing done by Wes Anderson's brother Eric. The way each room is the house is immediately identifiable. The book and magazine covers constructed for the film. There are so many redeeming qualities to this film.The Criterion Collection 2 disc DVD of this film released today is phenomenal. The extras are top notch and the transfer is very clear. Listen to Wes Anderson's commentary for some wonderful insight into the film.For those of you with a brain and a sense of humor, enjoy the Tenenbaum family. For the rest of you..... well. You can all just take a flying leap to put it politely or go worship at the alter of Dude Where's My Car.</fullReview>

The IMDb Rating is way too high for this movie then what it should be worth. One or two suicidal scenes and brief nudity scenes are probably the only thing that would probably wake you up and the rest just puts you back to sleep or want to leave.Don't waste your time.

		<fullReview>Why are screwed-up families funny? Is it because we like to see social conventions, like the ones that state that normal families are made up of people who are nice to each other, turned on their heads? Or do we feel better about our own lives when we see misfits and malcontents on screen? Whatever the case, some excellent films and tv shows have been based on dysfunctional but likeable families. This is another one.Like 'Amelie', the other great comedy of recent times, 'The Royal Tenenbaums' begins with a deadpan narrator telling us of a series of bizzare, horrible and blackly funny events, as the film sets up its characters by showing us their past. In 1979 Royal Tenenbaum was kicked out of the house by his wife when their three kids were young, because, as Royal admits, 'I've always been considered an asshole'. There's no malice about it, it's just part of his nature. This is a man who always introduced his adopted daughter Margot as 'my adopted daughter Margot', who shot his 7 year old son Chas with a BB gun, who ignored this family for over 20 years then fakes a terminal illness to get back with them. In his abscence the Tenenbaums became prodigies: Chas a teen financial wizard, Margot an award-winning playwright at 14, Richie a tennis champion. Now they're all lonely and miserable, along with almost everyone close to them. Royal arrives to try and be a father and pep them up, as well as get a place to live, because he's broke.It sounds depressing, but it's not. There's a sympathy and charm to this tale, and a delightfully odd sense of humour, all heightened by the well-chosen soundtrack. The cast is amazing: Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller (NOT playing an idiotic loser for once), Owen Wilson and his brother Luke, Bill Murray, Danny Glover, and they're given roles that allow them to become characters who are unusual in cinema: actually unique and interesting people. There's not a dull character in this film, and because of that we care what happens to them. The slow pace and sense of humour will not be enjoyed by everyone, and some will want something more decisive, but I grinned all the way through.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Hackman (in a Golden Globe winning performance) is Royal Tenenbaum, a man ill equipped to be a father, who left his family over twenty years earlier. All three of his children were young geniuses of one kind or another ? Gwyneth Paltrow was an award winning playwright, Ben Stiller a hugely successful property tycoon, and Luke Wilson a championship tennis player ? but by the time they reach adulthood all traces of their talents seem lost. When the family finds itself unexpectedly reunited in the childhood home one winter, old animosities and loyalties flare up once again.Told almost as a modern fairy tale or fable the film opens with the camera close up on a book of the same name, and throughout it is broken down into chapters, with a narrator reading aloud the first line before we see it come to pass on?screen. This sense of knowing unreality also pervades the film?s look and the actors performances, presenting us with an almost mythical New York, complete with battered taxi cabs and a self contained visual style very consciously not of today?s ?real? world. Gene Hackman shines as the unwittingly unpleasant Royal, and all three of his on?screen kids give fine performances, particularly Stiller as a tracksuit wearing father himself, with similarly dressed kids Hackman is determined to show how not to behave! "The Royal Tenenbaums" might not deliver the cheap laughs you might expect (particularly if you come along expecting to see Stiller in "Something About Mary" and "Meet The Parents" mode), but its Oscar nominated script, charismatic look and fine performances ensure this is an intelligent, engaging comedy that derives its laughs from characters rather than set pieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragi-comic masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson's long awaited follow-up to Rushmore is magnificent. There is relatively little I can say about The Royal Tenenbaums that will do it justice, so I urge you to see it.There was literally nothing about this elegant, subtle, subversive comedy which was bad. Casting was splendid, with Owen and Luke Wilson taking the crowns as the boyhood friends with serious baggage. Cinematography of a damp, decaying New York was gorgeous. Soundtrack was fabulously eclectic, encompassing many of the records in my own collection, taking me completely by surprise. The script, though - gentle, funny and ultimately revealing - was the real star. The humour is extremely left-field. I laughed out loud in the cinema, only to stifle my chuckles because no-one else seemed to be laughing. Royal's casual racism towards Glover's character is painfully acute, but terribly, terribly funny.The story is not original, concerning the redemption of a selfish man through the love of his family, but the structure and delivery is totally unique. I was transfixed throughout. I have rarely enjoyed ANYTHING as much as this movie.I simply cannot understand why so many reviewers hated this movie. Perhaps the humour was too dark, or the action too limited, or the music too retro, or the costumes too 70s. Whatever, it was all glorious to me.One of the finest films of the last 20 years. Absolutely unmissable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky. Funny. Inventive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have created the perfect movie. There are sad moments, touching emotional scenes, real anger, bitterness, love, friendships and more. Gene Hackman and Anjelica Houston did exceptional jobs as did the rest of the cast. I would rank this movie in my top five of all time on par with movies like American Beauty and Gone With the Wind.The scenes that include Hackman and the play between Gwyneth Paltrow and Bill Murray alone were worth the price of admission, but what keeps the film from getting stale are the internal tensions played out in the film. Each character has insecurities and the film follows them as they work through these making it both painful, but also kind of cathartic. This very funny film is a testament to superb writing, acting, and directing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cracked up through most of the movie. The whole setup zips along through each character from the brilliance of their childhood to the immobility of adulthood. Gene Hackman has one of his most juiciest rolls ever. In Royal Tenenbaum, Gene gets to let out some fog and crankiness with a smile. Brilliant casting job!I think the movie should have kept the cream puff tone through the end. Towards the second half, I felt it strayed too far into uncomfortable territories unnecessarily. Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have a gift for dialogue and genuinely funny situational comedy with some good deadpan. Wes brings a real freshness to film with his complex characters blended with music and retro style. Bravo to a surging talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern fable?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie can be categorised as a comedy drama. While the comedy ranges from slapstick to witty, obvious to the bizarre, the drama is much less intrusive. Even when things get heavy there is a feeling that the comedy is only a thin veneer from the surface.Royal O'Reilly Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman: French Connection I &amp; II) plays a father who has allowed himself to become totally disconnected from his Wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston: The Adams Family) and three gifted children Chas (Ben Stiller: There's Something About Mary), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow: Shakespeare in Love) and Richie (Luke Wilson: Charlie's Angels). On hearing that his wife is to divorce him after a separation of 17 years in order to marry her suitor (Danny Glover), he goes all out to get his family back.This is a slow moving story that starts of at a stroll and speeds up to saunter. But if you want pace don't go to see character driven stories. I came to the consideration that this is a modern fable. But there are several possible lessons that in it is trying to teach. Such as 'It's never to late.' Or 'You don't now what you've got till its gone.' You have to pay attention and think about this movie while your watching it. It may seem like too much hard work for some thing that's supposed to be entertainment, but it's worth it with this one. While this story may have been told a hundred times, but then what story hasn't been, Anderson put a novel spin on it.Hackman again delivers stalwart performance as a wise cracking tell it like it is type guy. He has you loving him one minute and cringing the next. Hackman and Luke Wilson are given the two most interesting characters, with the rest of the cast give parts that are two dimensional to the point of being caricatures. Despite this the cast all turn in fine performances. Ben Stiller given fewer straight gags and more neurosis based humour plays it straight for a refreshing change from his recent roles.Director Wes Anderson manages to rework the magic he cast in Rushmore. Using cuts and shots in some scenes that give the film a home movie feel. Given that the whole story is told in retrospect, with a narration by Alec Baldwin I found it effective. It's hard to comment on his direction of the cast given the names involved in the project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first ten minutes make it a sure classic, and from there it just gets better. The cast is perfect and gives an amazing performance overall. Danny Glover pulled off being the old innocent black man, and Hackman did the same...just he's not exactly black or innocent. The movie is so original that it's my favorite movie of all time. It's got everything; character development, excellent writing, amazing acting, and terribly memorable. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you go to the theatre It's worth it. The DVD comes out July 9th which is a terrible wait because Ocean's Eleven came out a week before in theatres, and it came out on DVD May 7. Tis a shame. But hopefully Mr. Anderson and Mr. Wilson will make it worthwhile. Even if it had no features and it was in full frame, I would buy it. But I doubt it can be anything less than an amazing DVD considering the Rushmore Criterion Collection DVD. If it does just an infinitesimal bit of what that does, I will be extremely happy.</fullReview>

The movie is very cinematic and has a great use of color. The only thing that bothered me about the movie, is the time warp the family seemed to be stuck in. The movie starts in the seventies and of course everyone ages to the current day, but their wardrobe and furniture, etc. still seemed to be stuck in the seventies.

		<shortDescription>Witty comedy with an edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to see the high placing `The Royal Tenenbaums' has in IMDB reviewer's hearts. Is it deserved? Maybe. The story is fairly simple - Gene Hackman is Royal O'Reilly Tenenbaum, the estranged self-absorbed father of three child prodigies who have since grown up. The children want nothing to do with him, and so he pretends to be dying in order to worm his way back into their hearts.Current comedies tend to rely too much on the `prat-fall' style, popularised by the `American Pie' series. This movie realises the potential of quirkiness, as seen in other movies like `Election' or Wes Anderson's other: `Rushmore'. In this case the three child prodigies are now all washed-up. The daughter, Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), a former child genius who was a playwright, is caught in a permanent bout of melancholy. Chas (Ben Stiller), a businessman, is trapped in rigid self-discipline, as he tries to stave off memories of his wife's death. And former child tennis star Richie (Luke Wilson), feels he has nothing to live for. Pushed together, and with all their angst directed at their acerbic father, and you're left with a mixture of humour and tragedy.And that's one of the selling points of the movie. The humour is supplemented by the drama (one moment of which is quite disturbing). However the humour is never over shadowed - the film is quite funny. Sometimes it's a simple witty one liner - Royal's comments are particularly sharp - while other times it's the manner in which someone performs an action, often in a tragic-comic moment. There's a bitter-sweet flavour to the whole movie that works very well.The movie has great pacing and an ever better cast - no one lets the side down. Wes Anderson is more than capable here as both co-author of the script (with Owen Wilson) and director. A comedy that's apart from most of it's peers, particularly these days, `The Royal Tenenbaums' is something that you'll still be able to remember, and smile about, well after the credits have faded. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We found this movie superb - it had us giggling and laughing from start to finish. Yes, we recognised so many of our friends and contacts (so we hang out with a weird crowd, so what?). But my goodness was the audience split on this movie. While we (and many others) were clearly enjoying ourselves, some of the audience seemed completely baffled by the whole thing.This is comedy at its boundary-breaking-best - some people simply don't get it. The half-hidden running gags are superb - for example the "Dalmatian mice" that keep reappearing at inopportune moments.Take the risk - go see it - but don't blame us if you don't like it. 8/10 round here is a big hit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just go and watch it and fall into raptures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson's `The Royal Tenenbaums' is not a family film but a film about family. And as such it differs widely from the majority of films of that genre, where families of some kind are brought together in the end, in spite of a couple of difficulties. This is not a classic feel-good movie, nevertheless it made me feel good. It's not too serious but it's not a parody either. For me, this makes it the most beautiful movie on the issue of family life ever made.Although all the members of the Tenenbaum family are really weird and lead unusual lives (geniuses all of them), their relationship to each other is more authentic and more convincing than, for instance, Robin Williams's to his children in `Mrs. Doubtfire'.And, the biggest and most wonderful plus of this movie isn't mainly due to director and scriptwriters: the cast. If the `Tenenbaums' had been presented in Cannes, I'm sure they would have won the ensemble prize. One of them is better than the other. Not only have I been confirmed in my worship of Ben Stiller and Bill Murray, I've also discovered Anjelica Huston's versatility, Gene Hackman's humour, Danny Glover's age and how it becomes him, Gwyneth Paltrow's, well, talent to evoke pitiness, and finally, the magnificent Wilson brothers themselves.Right, talking about the beauty of this movie doesn't make much sense. Please, everybody go and watch it, just to agree then and fall into raptures too.`The Royal Tenenbaums' comes quite close to what I call a `really' great, big, strong movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Anderson, as usual, has produced a masterpiece. Fans of Rushmore will love this movie, some of them more. The writing is inspired, hilarious, and wonderfully quirky, (thanks in part, i believe, to increased Owen Wilson involvement in the writing process) and Anderson's Gilliam-esque attention to detail bring together yet another spectacular film.Unlike many of the films created today, Anderson steers clear of the topical, era-specific penis humor trend and creates truly timeless gems-and his exquisitely sisqo-less soundtrack, accented by the skilled and auspiciously chosen Mark Mothersbaugh, only adds to this magic. For true insight into the level of detail Wes Anderson applied to the direction of this movie, see it a second, third, or fourth time, and see how many times you can find that one boldface font: i count 14. and look at the games in the closet. woo. great movie. 9.7/10</fullReview>

Also there is a good point in this movie, the end of the movie that every problems can be solved. That should be O.K. after tolerate for almost 2 hours. I rate this movie 4/10.</fullReview>

But i saw this movie in late april, so some time HAS elapsed. It is truly great. It gets kinda boring after an hour, but the first hour, and the last fifteen minutes or so more than make up for the momentary (and i emphasize momentary) lapse in action. Gene Hackman is brilliant in this movie. Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have crafted a beautifully devious script. It is dark and hilarious. Ben Stiller is truly a great actor, not just a great comedian. I really wnat to emphasize Ben Stiller. He is really superb in this movie. The soundtrack contributes so much to the movie with familiar voices and familiar songs. The choice of well known actors to play bit parts is fabulous. This is a great, great, great, great movie. I really enjoyed it. I do have to be honest, for about forty five minutes there it got kinda scary, it almost turned out to be a bad movie, but the ending was great. I loved this movie.

		<shortDescription>subtle humor makes it more real...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The undercurrent of this unusual film is almost philosophical because of the fact that it's humor is ultimately based in truth. But also because of this, the film has been viewed and perceived very differently by different people. Reviews have ranged from panning the movie as boring and unsuccessful to raving about Anderson's filmmaking genius. I tend to believe that with Anderson's work the viewer has to be very tuned in and is not just handed everything on a plate as is the case with the typical blockbuster movie. I'm not suggesting that there is anything wrong with the latter style, I'm simply saying that this particular film required more attention to detail by the viewer in order to realize and make sense of some of the underlying truths behind much of the humor. In the end I suppose it all comes down to taste but I have to admit that I am of the school heralding Anderson as a creative and intelligent writer and director.The story is so outrageous that it's like a soap opera and the humor lies in the dialogue between characters (or lack thereof) as well as the actual plot. But Anderson was able to take all of these crazy elements and make the bigger issues very real. For example, the idea of talented and smart children growing into depressed, angry, lost adults without any of the support they once had as children. And the way people relate to each other in real life is similar to how these characters relate to each other- nothing is ever spoken out loud, humor and sarcasm is used as a substitute for real communication. These are some of the underlying elements to the story which make it more real than most films. It's ironic because the characters in this film are completely unrealistic in so many ways and yet very real in a basic sense.The biggest problem with this film was the fact that it was promoted as a comedy which misled a lot of people. Yes, the movie is a comedy- but so much more. Stylistically it reminded me of the movie "Harold and Maude" which is also labeled as a comedy but is much more. Blame Hollywood's promotional techniques and not the film itself if you were one of those misled by the trailers.Anyway, as with anything, you have to judge for yourself whether you like a film or not. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is a film which you may love or you may hate but no matter what any of these other reviews say, you have to see it for yourself to find out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In some quarters, weird equals funny. Weird also equals genius,and everything has to be dark. Well, this is weird, this is dark, but itain't funny, and it definitely ain't genius. The movie isn't really about anything, the people in it leave bizarrelives, like the kid who breeds dalmatian mice and the daughterwho spends part of her life in Jamaica as a rastafarian play toy. Essentially this movie is about wretched people doing wretchedthings. That in and of itself is not a movie killer, but throw in ascript that doesn't go anywhere, poor camera work, lousy editing,an somnambulent acting and it's hard to pull off a movie that'swatchable. The only reason I didn't walk out of this movie is GeneHackman. He is admittedly a class act and injects the only sparkin this thing. The one scene, shown in trailers for the movie so Idon't think its a spoiler, where Ben Stiller, as is son, claimsHackman stole his investment bonds when he was fourteen. Theslight pause and the nervous laugh coming out of Hackman washilarious. Possibly the only funny thing in the movie. I'm pretty easy going about movies, but if you're going to be artsyand dark, you have to be able to bring it off, that's a high bar tomeet. That's why mindless romantic comedies or testosteroneaction movies are so easy to make and end up being enjoyable. Dark and brooding and funny is hard, and they don't manage ithere.</fullReview>

If you go expecting to see some rip-roaring comedy then I'm afraid you'll be sadly disappointed. Sure The Royal Tenenbaums has some comedic moments but it's more of a character study, and I think some critics (and some audiences too) missed this point. This film works because of the characters and the actors that play them; they have depth, intelligence, emotion, and there always seems to be something going on with these people at another level. Gene Hackman, is as usual, brilliant. Quite possibly one of the best character actors working in Hollywood at the moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Stiller and his red sweatsuit set the tone, but where are Angelica Huston and Bill Murray's scenes?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wouldn't you just love to walk for one day in Wes Anderson's shoes? Not only is your newest film a critical success but you get one of the all time best casts in Hollywood history fairly inexpensively. That said, I ventured in to "The Royal Tenenbaum's" with huge expectations of a four-star film and found myself walking out with some disappointment. When your able to get an all-star cast as Anderson did, your going to inevitably leave someone out somehow. Somewhat disappointing was the fact that Gene Hackman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Luke Wilson were given ample running room, while Angelica Huston and Bill Murray languished in the back-burner. This is not to say that "The Royal Tenenbaum's was not excellent. Ben Stiller and his sons were incredibly hilarious in their red sweatsuits (did they ever take them off??) and this is Gene Hackman's best performance ever (I never admired Unforgiven or The French Connection much). The setting of the film (That funny little house) was also well-done. However, Angelica Huston doesn't get much work now that she's older and I would have loved for her to have more scenes and something else to do besides make cracks about her sometimes husband. The ending was a little too conventional for my taste but all in all, this film was very well done and merits a DVD purchase. A word of advice for Wes Anderson however, when you decide to do a character study you have to study all the characters in more detail.***1/2 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Speaking of royalty, in this case the king is definitely naked. After seeing this film, one question wanders in my mind: why was it done? Why spend some thousand dollars making a movie that means absolutely nothing, is neither fun or intelligent, full of horrid characters, with whom nobody can sympathize? The world must be upside down for a movie like this reach the 250 best films in IMDB and a masterpiece like Alain Resnais's "Je T'Aime Je T'Aime" don't even get a last place. Sure, it's quite well-done, but it doesn't mean anything, doesn't say anything. It's just a perfect example of hollowness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Royal is a fitting title for this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Brilliant writing by Anderson and Wilson. The characters in this film are perfect and play off one another perfectly. Funny, sad, and touching, if you have a family, you'll probably see part of them in this film, it is simply amazing and I urge you to see it if you haven't already... if you have, then see it again! It's really that good, i can't say enough good things about this movie, Gene Hackman is brilliant, the brothers Wilson are superb, Angelica Houston is amazing, and Gweneth Paltrow... well, she's naked but she's great in this movie, too. Every one is, it's an excellent ensemble cast, a lot of times super star casts fail to deliver the goods, but every one comes together in this and it's simply amazing. Now all i have to do is get my girlfriend to get over her hatred for Owen Wilson so she'll go see this movie (and then i can see it again!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky, surprising and off-beat... sounds like a Wes Anderson film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Packed with some solid stars (both comedic and straight-laced), 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is a delightful and much slanted look at the coessential dysfunctional family that could be from Anywhere, USA. Well, actually it could be from anywhere in the galaxy as you may not come across a more strange slew of characters in one place anywhere on God's green earth. For openers, Gene Hackman plays a hysterical deadbeat dad who had been alienated by the rest of his bizarre family for ignorance to them and vulgarity to others which can include even us the audience. Yet at the same time the viewer will be sympathetic to him and his mischievous routine and rebellious nature given his sly warmheartedness and charm. The trio of the children's life stories (wild and wholly tales portrayed in retrospect and real-time by Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow &amp; Luke Wilson) surround this rude and complex father shortcomings in spectacular fashion while combative yet dignified mom played by Angelica Houston is a steady presence amongst the chaos. Owen Wilson and Bill Murray round out the supporting cast for this fun-filled comedy. It's a good idea to screen early Anderson efforts like Rushmore and/or Bottle Rocket to prep for the amount of quirkiness thrown at you in this romp but designed to even challenge the zaniest of viewers on its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting film made in a unique way. Told in chapters of a book it features some excellent acting by a strong cast. Hackman is brilliant, Huston equally as good and Paltrow, Stiller, Glover and the Wilson brothers Luke and Owen are all memorable in their twisted characters. Glover looks really old and Bill Murray being very unlike himself. Luke Wilson once shaven and cut looks unbelievably like Pat Rafter. The charcters are what makes this black comedy work. I also enjoyed the soundtrack of the Stones, Paul Simon etc. A 7/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>humerous but stale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am surprised by the raving critics this movie has gotten. An estranged father of three tries to come together with his family after 22 years of neglect. Gene Hackman plays the father convincingly and that's it. The rest of the crew except perhaps Anjelica Huston as the mother and Danny Glover as her fiancé do a decent job. Ben Stiller as on of the siblings is energetic as always but his part ends up being very stereotypic and almost boring. There are a lot of good ideas in this movie since the surroundings and expressions tell the story and the jokes as much as the said word but things are predictable and often the cinematography is downright clumsy. Although a comedy this movie has a meaningful undertone and seems to be about forgiveness and family values. There are all kinds of hidden messages, e.g. the kids wear the same childish clothes their whole life (except the daughter who secretly has been smoking for 22 years) that might be a expression of halted maturity since childhood or what ever. Perhaps it was just for fun but got boring. Gene Hickman's character got to change clothes at least and was quite funny in his elevator warden. All kind of characters are introduced to the story in the beginning in a rather lame way although not altogether unfunny. Gwyneth Palthrow as the adopted sister never rises up to be funny, ever in the whole film and puts a depressing face to the whole story. Her kinky love affairs never rise to be funny or giving any meaning to the picture. Gene Hackman carries this movie on his shoulders throughout along with his faithful family servant Pagoda played memorably and intuitively by Kumar Pollana. In a way this movie reminds me of the French movie Emilé but it (this one) pales in the comparison. This movie is too stereotypic and slow to ever rise to the hall of fame in comedy, but if the director keeps trying, something good might come out of it later. 7/10</fullReview>

Owen Wilson was by far my favorite in the whole movie. His character tried so hard to be poetic, it was hillarious. All in all this was a great escape from Rusmore but in the same style.

		<shortDescription>A truly odd classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is a truly great movie. It is full of humor and humanity. The acting is impeccable, the story absolutely absorbing and the presentation stylish without becoming overbearing. It's also one of the oddest major studio releases in years. If you are unprepared for its oblique view of life you could be justifiably outraged by the movie. This is a cheerfully filmed comedy about child abuse, divorce, adultery, mental illness, grief, suicide and death. It's the type of movie where a trip to the dogfights is portrayed as a bonding experience. Despite.or perhaps because of.all this, it ultimately ends up a positive comment on the endurance of family love.Twenty years ago the Tenenbaum family was famous for their string of child prodigies. There was Chase the financial wizard, Margot the playwright and Ritchie the gifted athlete. All had accomplished prodigious feats well before their tenth birthday but then a terrible disaster occurred. Now all have grown to be twisted, neurotic and emotionally scarred adults. The terrible disaster was their father, Royal Tenenbaum. Royal is simply the most obnoxious excuse for a parent ever to slither across a movie screen. He's Auntie Mame gone bad. He's a self absorbed, conniving, cheating, racist b**tard. As the movie begins he's been kicked out of his luxury hotel suite for nonpayment of rent. He also finds out his ex-wife is going to marry her black accountant. Both these events impinge on Royal's self interest and so he devises a scheme he hopes will rectify the situation. The movie tracks the result of his scheme and the effect it has on the wreckage of his family.Royal is a pretty unredeemable character and Gene Hackman digs into the character's miserable hide with a tangible joy. Royal so full of wormy life one can readily see why a seemingly sensible woman like Ethel Tenenbaum would not only have fallen in love with him but still be carrying a guttering torch years after she's thrown him out. As Ethel, Angelica Huston is fully the equal of Hackman. Ethel is someone who's been raked over the coals by a loved one and who has done her best ever since to repair the damage. Ben Stiller is perfect as Chase, still nursing childhood wounds while trying to deal with the freak death of his wife. Gwyneth Paltrow defines the word "neurotic" as Margot, a woman hell-bent on hiding secrets no one really cares to know. The whole cast was exceptional and each has a moment or two where they can shine. Only Luke Wilson, as Ritchie, seemed a little too remote for a man enduring the rigors of hidden love.Does all this sound like a lighthearted comedy? Well, yes, if you're definition of "light hearted" is flexible enough. It is one of the funniest movies I've seen lately. It's not a cruel comedy like the excellent, if extremely nasty, South Park movie. You care about the Tenenbaums even as you laugh at their foibles. With all its darkness the movie is surprisingly sweet. There seems no clear-cut message except, perhaps, that even the lowest, most craven SOB has potential for salvation. Then again, perhaps the only thought was to entertain us. That The Royal Tenenbaums does, with great style and surprising warmth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: more a drama than a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you will like this film is all about expectations.If you come in expecting a comedy, you will be disappointed. The film is definitely comedic, but it's sort of quirky and fun rather than laugh-out-loud comedy. It comes across as understated and serious, sort of like how in "Being John Malkovich" the characters all did funny things but the actors played it serious.Now let's speak frankly here. I'm an action movie guy. I like it when a film is fast-paced, and I don't like dramas -- too melodramatic. When I go see a comedy, I want there to be some dang comedy in it! What turns me off most is to see an arty flick that is inaccessible to normal guys like me who won't appreciate the costuming and music score if the story is awful.However, I did like the "The Royal Tenenbaums". The film is very original, with great acting, directing, and writing. There were lots of clever and inventive plot twists, and while it is was a touch too slow-paced for me, I do recommend it.Who should see this film:-- drama / arty types of all sorts (but don't take your kids) but don't expect a lot of romance-- comedy lovers who don't expect Animal House and can deal with a heavy shot in the arm of "serious film-making".-- action fans who hate dramas but will grit their teeth and go because their SO wants to see it. You will survive, I bet.I'll give "The Royal Tenenbaums" a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anderson's off-beat humour an acquired taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen this &amp; ?Rushmore' before it, I have to say that Anderson's films leave me feeling very ambivalent. They try to balance idiosyncratic humour alongside tragedy, flipping from one to the other almost imperceptibly. Whether it works is a moot point. The film is a series of vignettes and sub-plots linked by Gene Hackman's endearing performance as the raffish Royal, returning back to the bosom of his estranged family, a group of eccentric prodigies, whilst simultaneously trying to thwart a rival for his wife's affections.Tenenbaum's humour is much more subtle than the average Hollywood comedy and there are good set-pieces. I particularly liked Royal's farcical attempt ? including hiring a bellhop from his hotel to act as his ?medical consultant' - to fool everyone, apart from his suspicious rival Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), that he's dying from stomach cancer whilst munching three burgers a day. Hackman has a wonderful way with one-liners especially invective. He blunders his way back into the family through a mix of charm and unintentional cruelty.It's essentially a darkly humorous film about a set of dysfunctional individuals. Royal is held responsible for his family's failings and fall from grace but, in a sense, he becomes the agent for their recovery, i.e. Margot &amp; Richie coming to terms with their feelings.I thought the ending was slightly disappointing with Royal finally reaching a sense of reconciliation with Chas at his death. The film should've just ended at Etheline's wedding. The symbolism in the film of Richie's hawk, Mordecai, roaming free over the skylines felt laboured, representing the characters' own inhibitions and their attempts to free themselves from their past. On the whole, after leaving the cinema, I felt I'd watched an incomplete movie, one which felt less than the sum of its parts. As another reviewer pointed out, the film is too dark to be merely labelled a comedy yet its drama feels too underpowered to be genuinely affecting. It's interesting that we are never shown Raleigh's (the underused Bill Murray) possible reaction to the love-affair between his wife Margot &amp; Richie, her 'brother'. Wes Anderson's dark, lugubrious humour is certainly an acquired taste. I much preferred this to ?Rushmore' which soon began to grate on my nerves. However, I'm not sure I'll be returning for a third helping. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky ironic comedy about a fraught family in New York. Wry smiles a plenty. 3 And A Half Flys Out Of Five</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eccentricity can come from unhappiness., but it can still be pretty funny. Wes Anderson (Rushmore, Bottle Rocket) director and co-writer with Owen Wilson of The Royal Tenenbaums has created a desperately eccentric family, the Tenembaums who live in New York. This malformed family are reunited when Royal Tenenbaum, the estranged and nasty patriarch (Gene Hackman) feigns terminal cancer in order to get back into the house. He hasn't been home for three years but gets kicked out of his hotel for not paying his bills. He also finds out that his wife Etheline (Angelica Huston) has fallen in love with her accountant played by Danny Glover. He needs to move back in. The kids come home to see their dying Dad.. They were all formerly child prodigies but are now bitter thirty some things with big chips on their shoulders. Chas (Ben Stiller) was a financial whiz kid until Royal stole his money and his wife was killed in a plane crash. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) had a play published when young but hasn't written for years. Richie (Luke Wilson) was a tennis champion but lost his form spectacularly. The mother Etheline has been running a fractured household for years. Eli, the kid from across the street (co-writer Owen Wilson) writes westerns that the critics pan. They live in a huge house full of nick knacks and sometimes viciously spar with one another. But the main weapon used is a sort of mean irony. One attempts suicide. Another would like to see the suicide note, or at least a paraphrase of it.  Their world is sadly funny, a world of grim smiles, of quiet hysteria. Most noticeable is Paltrow who just sits about miserable, enveloped in a pallor that's at least partly created from cigarette smoke.The humour in The Royal Tenenbaums would almost be gallows humour except everyone lives, even the one with fake terminal cancer. Essentially these malcontents are regarded with affection, in spite of their afflictions. 3 And A Half Flys Out Of Five</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It just isn't possible to articulate the absolute hidden genius of this film. The profundity of this screenplay is so over the comedic edge. No comedy in recent attempt has this cast, this type of writing, and this amount of visual humor. But it is not slapstick or sophomoric in nature. The subtle nuances carry the day; the brilliant one-liners lay on a bed of fantastic direction. The Direction is in the hands of Wes Anderson a college roommate of Owen Wilson and co-collaborator on the movie Rushmore. Wilson and Anderson also co-write this cinematic treat. Owen Wilson has vaulted on to the scene with numerous lead roles starting most notably Shanghai Noon with Jackie Chan.The story line is this (Gene Hackman) and his wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) had three children -- Chas (Ben Stiller), Richie (Luke Wilson) and Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) -- and then they separated. Chas started buying real estate in his early teens and seemed to have an almost preternatural understanding of international finance. Margot was a playwright and received a Braverman Grant of fifty thousand dollars in the ninth grade. Richie was a junior champion tennis player and won the U.S. Nationals three years in a row. Virtually all memory of the brilliance of the young Tenenbuams was subsequently erased by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster. Most of this was generally considered to be their father's fault. "THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS" tells the story of a family's sudden, unexpected reunion one recent winter.Above all, Hackman is purely masterful as Royal Tenenbaum; do not be surprised to see him win some awards for this role. I was especially fascinated with the role that Gwyneth Paltrow sews so exquisitely. The cast is given more flippancy with Bill Murray and a solemn Danny Glover. The music is well balanced and placed. To give you much more detail would be a grave injustice. This is just brilliant comedic acting and timing. Much of the wittiness is hidden in the background and unannounced intelligence. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this keyboard to recount the story.This is the movie of the year. Given that the year is only 5 days old I think I am safe in making that assertion.5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky movie made by a stellar cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm at all sure that I'd have gone to see this film if it hadn't received such positive reviews. The strange title gives no indication of the subject matter and, when one does discover the theme of the movie (examination of a dysfunctional well-off New York family), it's not exactly a crowd-puller. Royal Tenenbaum is the odd name of the head of an even odder family, played by Gene Hackman ? an actor who is now in his 70s and starring in his 80th film. Hackman does little comedy ? believe it or not, this is a funny movie ? but here has the pivotal role in a stellar cast. His wife Etheline ? whom he left 17 years ago - is played by Anjelica Huston and they have three ?grown-up' children, each of whom was once a prodigy and now has psychological problems. There's Chas (Ben Stiller), a financial whizz-kid, Richie (Luke Wilson), a one-time tennis champ, and Margot (a panda-eyed Gwyneth Paltrow), a playright of sorts.. If that was not enough, there's Danny Glover as Etheline's suitor, Bill Murray as Margot's husband, and Owen Wilson (who teamed with Hackman in `Behind Enemy Lines') as a family friend.It's this talented cast that gives director and co-writer Wes Anderson such an entertaining success for such a quirky movie. Without them, it's hard to see how this would have been more than a light-weight curiosity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been anticipating the opening of this film for months and actually kidnapped my mom (the only movie cohort available at the moment) to catch the afternoon showing. And oh, it was... GRRRRAND!The screenplay feels layered and as richly textured as a novel. That reflects in the strange and genial behaviours of the characters. Some people have complained about the "zombielike" acting from Paltrow and Luke Wilson... I think it's done ON purpose: see,they feel like they actually are damaged goods -- Chas Tenenbaum is another whole story - and they react disaffectedly to everything that has harmed their emotional development.Yet, this stunted growth of their feelings -- including Eli, the cowboy obsessed pal and "Faux" Tenenbaum- is part of their vulnerability and charm.On the other hand, the production design is beautiful: the homes, the clothes, the colours... and Pagoda! He IS the man!Besides any film that features Lou Reed's "Stephanie Says" and rescues from oblivion Nico's "The Fairest of the Seasons" -- Mom &amp; I were deeply touched when it came into the soundtrack and she even wept- is decidedly on my "To Own when it's Out on DVD" list. Kudos all around... Anjelica Huston, won't you come to tea please? WE LOVE YOU!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Royal" Treatment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dysfunction has never been so entertaining. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is satisfying blend of superb acting and sharp writing. Director Wes Anderson(Rushmore) re-teams with co-writer and actor Owen Wilson to deliver this comedic and surprisingly touching tale. "Tenenbaums" proves that dysfunction is all relative. The story provides better character development than this season's other ensemble pic, Ocean's 11. If you thought that your family was screwed up, try growing up in family of geniuses.There's the patriarch, Royal(Hackman) an accomplished attorney and bastardly father. The resolute mother, Etheline played by Anjelica Houston. Houston herself is no stranger to playing quirky mothers(see The Addams Family) Then there's the children, Chas, Margot &amp; Richie. Chas(Stiller) is the neurotic financier and recently widowed father of two. Margot(Paltrow), the sullen playwright, whose referred to as the "adopted" daughter throughout the film. Finally there's Richie(Luke Wilson), the tortured ex-tennis champ whose had a crush on his "sister" Margot since adolescence. Rounding out the cast is Owen Wilson. A childhood friend who wants nothing more than to keep up with the Tenenbaums. Danny Glover is Etheline's conservative new paramour and Royal's new adversary. Then Bill Murray portrays Margot's fifth and much older husband. Anderson definitely deserves accolades for his expertise in handling such a large cast.The basic plot is as follows, Royal Tenenbaum has become estranged from his family for the last 20 years. He's been disbarred and is currently living out of a hotel room. He learns about his wife's new beau and sets out to do something about it.So Royal does what any good father and husband would do. He fakes a terminal illness in order to get back into his family's good graces. During which he spends his most of his quality time with his family. Quality time for Royal consists of taking his grandsons to illegal dog fights and shoplifting. Hackman hasn't had a role this meaty in years and he knows it. It's like watching the Lex Luthor Family reunion. The story plays out in chapters and unlike the aforementioned (but still cool) Ocean's 11, every character is given an adequate background. And amazingly enough as the movie progresses the Tenenaum clan become less weird and more familiar. The characters evolve from an eccentric bunch of whackos into something that may resemble your own family. This movie is as heartwarming as it is funny. All the while never compromising it's integrity or impact.(Look to see Hackman and/or Anderson around Oscar time).4.5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the thing that critics and people on a whole tend to forget about films and movies like this is the fact that there is a plot, but it isn't really spelled out for you in terms of some ending that satisfies audiences. In this film the characters all undergo fundamental changes in character and views on life that eventually spark different trains of thought in my mind because the characters are so interesting. The most ironic thing about the movie is the fact that royal is the catalyst for change in a positive way even though he was the one that played a big part in his children's eventual demise as adults. Also, this movie kind of strikes the same chord as a show like seinfeld because it seems like a funny movie about nothing, but that is really just a hoax because it is about something. It satirizes seemingly everyday activities and occurrences by creating this world of tenenbaums where even outsiders such as eli become envious of it. All in all, I thought that the movie was very good, just as a I expected it to be since Wes Anderson has begun making a career out of good film making.Just as a side note, I am always amazed at these inherent rules that real critics and other people tend to implement when they talk about various films. It is almost like certain films have to adhere to these things or they will never become quote "good movies". That is one of the most ridiculous elements of the film industry. For example, one of the things that I've heard about this movie is how royal was the only developed character in the story, which comes as no surprise here since he is the main character. He lies and says that he is dying for the wrong reasons, but in turn reaches out to his children and by the time he does die, he has been somewhat forgiven. So you see the things that go on in the other people's lives are interesting and noteworthy, but the story is meant to revolve around royal and that is why he is the only one that real light is shed on in the film. Lastly, I'd just like to say that from an artistic standpoint with camera work and scene set ups, this film is really good, another thing that "critics" tend to miss out on in their viewpoints.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall i must admit i enjoyed this film. It was not a comedic masterpiece as portrayed by so many preveiws, or even what i would classify as a comedy. Yes parts were good for a chuckle and the like but nothing truly hilarious. Each and every character seemed incredibly well fleshed out despite their unusually high numbers. i saw (in other comments here)complaints about how they [the reviewer] didn't care about any of the characters and there were too many, but i found that quite not true (perhaps because my last veiwing was that of Gosford Park).Anyway i've gotten off track. I'm writing this because in reading other comments i saw no mention of the 2 things that botherred me throughout the film...they weren't awful things but i found them to be a hinderance to my veiwing.The first of which was the voice of the narrator. It struck me as a very non-narrator voice...it didn't sound good or anything to be described as positive...i believe it to be that of Alec Baldwin and thought it just plain bad, i'm probably alone here now that i think about it.Anyway my next (maybe more valid) complaint is that of the music. Similar to the narrator complaint but with some possible explanation to it...i thought the music almost never went with what was happening in the story and was far too ubiquitous (look at my fancy word). It seemed to be going so often that you more noticed it when it was not playing than anything else. A lot of the time i just think they're shouldn't've been music playing when it was...i don't know i just think it subtracted a bit...but still it was quite good in content and all stylistic-ness...so go see it and find out i'm probably all wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's most admirable about Anderson's own prodigious film career is that, unlike the Tenenbaums, his creative and prosperous well will likely never run dry. For me, "Bottle Rocket," "Rushmore," and now "The Royal Tenenbaums" have each successfully pulled off the seemingly impossible: exceeding all expectations and elevating imaginative storytelling to lofty heights. Wes Anderson is one of my favorite filmmakers not because his films are my favorites, but because each sublimely satisfies AND leaves me craving the next helping.Every character in Tenenbaums is blessed with a ludicrous past and an extraordinary future, with enough present peculiarities to keep the mass ensemble as inseparable as family. The Canterbury Tales-approach to the story serves to focus our attentions on the individual characters and performances, but particularly to the profilmic details (set decoration (watch for the underwear art on the wall; it changes), wardrobe (beards for everyone!), and what's the deal with all those beat-up taxicabs?! Inexplicably hilarious.) If I have one complaint, it's that overall, the sheer volume of material smothered some of emotional attachment I was looking for: by the end, I had less invested in what happened to everyone, though I trusted the story to reach an inevitably satisfying conclusion. And I'm already eager for the next one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, I am not in the movie biz, advertising biz, marketing biz, or any other vocation where I have to sell something to the general public. However, I would be interested in knowing the demographics of the people who posted comments to The Royal Tenenbaums. The comments are either "Wow, this is the best movie of the year" or "This is not funny. Go and see Joe Somebody / Joe Dirt." One commentor remarked that people in the audience "over 35" were laughing while the commentor and his/her friends were debating whether to leave early. Another commentor was perplexed that Bill Murray, who was so good in "Scrooged" and "What About Bob," was so dull in The Royal Tenenbaums. (No mention of "Stripes", "Ghostbusters," "Caddyshack" or "The Razor's Edge.") On the other hand, other commentators have compared the characters in The Royal Tenenbaums to characters in James Joyce novels.My personal theory, is that people expecting a belly-laugh, situational comedy are going to be severely disappointed by The Royal Tenenbaums. There are no scenes where Gene Hackman has intercourse with an apple pie, where Gwenth Paltrow mistakes ejaculate for hair gel, where Ben Stiller slips on a banana peel and falls face first into a wedding cake, where Danny Glover falls into an open hole....wait, that does happen. In other words, The Royal Tenenbaums, is not the typical Hollywood, mass audience comedy. The demographic groups that see "American Pie," "Ace Ventura," "Something About Mary," and "King Pin" are not going to like The Royal Tenenbaums. NOTE: This is not to deride these films; they are funny. However it is a different style of humor.People expecting to find humor in dialogue, plot, character, and in subtle interaction of script, director, and actor will find the Royal Tenenbaums sublimely satisfying. For example, the narrator's line, "Right after Royal said those words, he realized he meant them...." Is brilliant.

		<shortDescription>The Usual Drollness from Wes Anderson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film. It is a subtle treat. There are some good performances from fine actors. The main weakness, in my humble opinion, is the script, which takes a wonderful concept and nice scenes and goes absolutely nowhere with them. Definitely not the film I was expecting.Wes Anderson creates offbeat experiences. "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore" are quality productions, if you are inclined toward droll humor and eccentric characters. I generally prefer a bit less, oh, restraint in comic characters, but this brand of comedy has its place (heaven forbid all films should have the same sensibility). Let's say it is the difference between "funny" and "amusing." I find myself interested in one or two characters in his films, and fairly uninterested in the rest, and this film follows that pattern.The standout is Gene Hackman. He portrays a sleazy patriarch to perfection. He viscerally reminded me of some real-life folks I know, which is an accomplishment. He breathed humanity into the part. Naturally, his character is, as usual for Anderson, a bit over the top, but Hackman makes it work. He deserves recognition for this.Gwyneth Paltrow also creates a vivid impression. I became comfortable watching for her next sultry pose in the background or disaffected comment. Her appearance turned scenes into art, which didn't particularly liven up the tale, but added an enjoyable element. This is now Bill Murray's second film with Anderson, and while I'm always glad to see Mr. Murray, I think Anderson does not do him justice. I kept expecting Murray to do something interesting beyond his character's definition, but was disappointed. This is a supporting role similar to his part in "Wild Things," but while that was a hilarious screwball turn, this was not. Ben Stiller also was wrong for his character. He is a funny man, not (to me, at least) "amusing," and so seemed at odds with his reactions and dialogue. I kept waiting for him to say or do something at which I could laugh out loud, and was disappointed. He was wasted in this role and became little more than a distraction.Overall, I liked the look, but not the story. About halfway through the film, a television interviewer asks one of the characters about the Tenenbaum family being down on its luck, and I found myself wondering why they would be considered so interesting beyond their immediate circle. The family is established at the film's beginning as being wildly successful and interesting, but there is virtually no follow-up to that. Aside from some private interactions, it was difficult to understand why the public at large would be interested in them. Anderson may be saying something about celebrity in general, but that sort of undermines the point of making a film about these particular people and their tepidly interesting situations.Good to catch if you are a big Hackman or Paltrow fan, or if you prefer films with subtle sight gags and eccentric characters. Definitely an acquired taste. I liked, but didn't love, it, so it gets 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice change from Rushmore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RATING: *** / ****Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have defined a style in their films. The formula is simple: take a few glum characters, plop them in front of a camera, stick in a quirky romance and let them loose. This has gained the duo many admirers, but I'm not one of them. Their films aren't depressing, just uninteresting and unpleasant. And after enduring the highly overrated "Rushmore", it's high time this formula worked.Gene Hackman is Royal Tenenbaum, a man bent on getting his family back after learning his wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston), who he never officially divorced, was with another man (Danny Glover as Henry Sherman). The Tenenbaum children are Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Richie (Luke Wilson). Chas is a financial consultant of some sort with two children. Margot is a Pulitzer Prize winning playwright who has always been known as the "adopted daughter". She doesn't communicate often with her husband Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), and is having an affair with her childhood friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson). Richie is a retired pro tennis player who has fallen in love with his sister. One day, Royal confronts Etheline and (in one of the funniest confessionals i've seen in a while) tells her he's dying. Is he? Of course not, but he wants his family back. Due to one thing or another, they all move in under one roof, and from there sparks fly.I had a wonderful time at "The Royal Tenenbaums". Anderson and Wilson have taken their normal formula and gave it a personal touch, resulting in a funny, honest effort. Unlike its morbid predecessor, "The Royal Tenenbaums" is warm and loves it's characters. The Tenenbaums are a family that has already achieved their goals in life and are now stuck with nowhere to go. They can only go back and catch what they missed: the feeling of really being a family, of caring for each other. Royal is making an honest effort to do this, but the only way he can try and gain his family's respect is to try to fake his own death. His "fresh start" is represented through Chas's two sons, who see Royal through a new pair of eyes.Oh yeah, and it's funny, too. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is full of fresh jokes and has its share of pratfalls, but it's in the characters that much of the humor lies. Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), Royal's friend and a doorman for the Tenenbaums, is played down perfectly so that when he explodes, you'll be laughing so hard you'll be begging for air. And Royal is a terrible actor; trying to convince his family he is dying of stomach cancer while he is out jumping into pools, driving go-carts and eating cheeseburgers. "Tenenbaums" revels in these kinds of ironic switch-arounds, giving the audience plenty to enjoy.The ensemble cast of "Tenenbaums" works nearly perfectly, with each other and in and of themselves. Gene Hackman's performance as Royal is pitch-perfect; giving Royal the edge he needs to win his family and the viewer over. The rest of the cast is exceptional as well, including Gwyneth Paltrow looking a lot like Christina Ricci, Owen Wilson doing a stoner and Anjelica Huston exquisitely handling her role as the woman caught up in the middle of it all. Some characters became a chore to watch after a short while. I was completely under whelmed with Bill Murray's Raleigh St. Clair. St. Clair is such a flat, empty character that there was no way I could sympathize with him when Margo ran away with another man. There's a difference between understated and soulless, and unfortunately, Murray does what he did for "Rushmore" and walks on the latter half of the spectrum (Billy Bob Thornton's performance in "The Man Who Wasn't There" is a good example of a well handled quiet performance). Also, what was the purpose of St. Clair's patient? Is his presence alone supposed to be funny? I wasn't laughing.Warts and all, "The Royal Tenenbaums" is a family affair brought to you buy those who specialize in gloom. However, what separates "Tenenbaums" is how lovingly pieced together it is, with its characters kicking away from "depressed mode" and actually developing. With a smart screenplay, (for the most part) wonderful acting and a touch of warmth, you can't go wrong with "Tenenbaums".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a perfect example of the Love it or Hate it genre. Most of the time movies like these reach only one type of audience and they love it, but for the rest of us...we hate it! I think I laughed about once or twice during the entire movie (thanks to Gene Hackman) - and quite frankly, I'm surprised I stayed through the whole movie. I saw about 10-15 people walk out of the theater and it was the premiere showing!! It was just disappointing to see all my favorite actors be in such a depressing, boring movie. It wasn't even 2 hours long, but it seemed to just drag on and on forever. So, if I were you...trying to decide whether to see this film in the theaters or wait for video/dvd...I would definitely recommend waiting. Or just not see it at all.</fullReview>

Luke wears a headband in almost every scene. It is so dark and funny that it gives dark humor movies such as The Cable Guy (also with Owen) a run for it's money. Gene Hackman (a Santa Fe resident) does a great performance. He is so easy to love and hate at the SAME TIME. If you want to see a strange movie that ventures into territory that NO OTHER MOVIE EVER HAS, then SEE THIS! The photography is great also.

		<shortDescription>A comedy where the audience doesn't laugh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Theoretically this film is a comedy. But there are few laugh-out-loud scenes or jokes -- instead I heard scattered laughter at various times from different parts of the theater. I laughed when no one else did and other people laughed when I did not.At first I thought it was filmed with no broad strokes but on second thought I wondered if it was all so broad that I wasn't aware of it. Kind of like not being able to see the forest for the trees.The `screenplay as novel' approach is interesting, and to a certain extent, works as a story. But I am not sure why this film is on so many `Top Ten' lists.The film is almost impossible to explain. There is pathos, fear, humour, paranoia, greed and a great cast; but I wasn't always sure that the actors knew why they were there. The sound track was perfect -- as is every sound track that Mark Mothersbaugh produces. The film was well edited and directed and every cast member was great but something overall was missing -- which is not to say that I did not like it -- because I did. I am just not sure why.Gene Hackman, as Royal Tenenbaum, turns in a stellar performance: this role may well win him a Golden Globe. Probably because his acting is greater than the script or direction.Alex Baldwin adds much to the story as the unseen narrator. He has a soothing, calming voice in a film that is full of unreason.There are metaphorical attempts at thematic imagery.... The rooms within rooms as exemplified by the tent in the ballroom and the closet of games -- but they don't really lead anywhere unless you are willing to search for some kind of meaning that is deeper than what superficially appears.This is also a film about healing -- the people are broken -- but some manage to find it within themselves to fix that part that is broken.I have to say that this is most definitely a film that must be judged on its own merits -- every audience member must see it and decide for their own self. You may end up in my position: I liked it but I am not sure why.</fullReview>

Second, I'll echo what many other posters have already said: There are two types of people in the world--those who get high-brow absurdity, and those who don't.I saw this movie yesterday for the second time. I have to say that much of the enjoyable experience is lost if you happen to be in a crowd of persons largely falling into the latter category. The first time I saw this--and I saw it fully expecting to see what I did--more than half the audience, consisting primarily of middle aged white folks, got it. It was a thoroughly marvelous movie-going experience. The second time, however, the crowd was made up of a bunch of stiffs and low brows expecting Ben Stiller to talk out of his butt a la Jim Carrey. Few persons laughed, other than me and a woman sitting about three rows behind me (I wanted to hug her). I found myself feeling embarrassed and self-conscious for laughing alone while everyone else sat in stone-faced silence, apparently waiting for something amusing to happen.The Royal Tenenbaums is loaded with humor, but you have to engage a little of your brain to find it. Don't misunderstand; it's not mentally taxing, but you can't wait idly for the jokes to fall in your lap. Someone else remarked that this is a movie for all ages. I have to disagree. I doubt many ten year olds, or even teens, possess the life-experience or sophistication necessary to understand why so many of the characters, situations, and scene backdrops are absurdly and hysterically funny.The laughs come not from catchy one liners. This is more high brow. The humor is sometimes visual, as in the riotously funny paintings in Eli Cash's living room. Sometimes it's in the form of a running gag, as in the omnipresence and broken down appearance of the Gypsy taxicabs and the contrasting Greenline buses. Other times it is found in absurd character depictions or dialogue which isn't innately funny, but is uproariously so in the context of the situation. For example, when Royal, a long-absent family patriarch, meets his grandsons for the first time they are exercising at a neighborhood park. He asks them how often their dad makes them exercise. One of them, about eight years old, replies with a deadpan, "At least 16 times a week." If that is funny to you, as it is to me, then you should get this movie. If not, then stay away; you are wasting your time and money.Anyone who goes to this movie completely blind may be forgiven for asking what the plot is about. Those who have even a passing familiarity with Anderson's previous collaborations with Owen Wilson should be ashamed for dwelling on something as tangential as the plot line.This isn't a movie about plots. It's modern day theater of the absurd meets poignant, almost Hallmark, moments, set in the context of a family with grown up, washed up whiz kids. (I have to believe Anderson is a student of Beckett or Ionesco.) The poignancy abounds as much as the humor and absurdity. Nowhere is it more pronounced than in a scene from near the end of the film between the titular character and his wife. Royal, portrayed expertly by Gene Hackman, is walking in the park with his soon-to-be ex-wife Ethel, played equally well by Angelica Huston. The actors' performances masterfully convey that these are spouses who have a long history together and, although they can no longer live together, that they obviously retain a tremendous affection for each other. Royal gazes admiringly at Ethel and tells her that she has more grit than any woman he's ever known. She smiles approvingly, moved and flattered. It was a moment of rare cinematic honesty between two principal characters that rang so true and touched me so deeply that I almost choked up.Anderson has a gift for shooting and editing his films so as to create a sense that the viewer is being voyeuristic. We are watching someone else's bad dream unfold. An example of this is seen when Ben Stiller's character pulls Hackman's into a tiny closet full of long-discarded Milton-Bradley board games. They stand face to face, occupying the full screen, and shout at each other, obviously bitter from years of conflicts with each other and a years-long silence between them.Often, Anderson breaks the proscenium with his title cards and the little interstitial shots of quirky bit characters from a central character's "back story." These are great moments in his films and help create an easily recognizable signature style. Anderson's and his writing partner's Wilson's characters are always at least slightly out of step with the larger world around them. This is evident in their wacky wardrobes and their askew appearances. Although most of them are flawed and some are downright bitter or mean, Anderson and Wilson manage to imbue them all with a certain pathos. They find an essential redeeming goodness and inherent likeability in each one. Their characters tend to reconcile their differences and apparently to learn to live with their conflicts in the end. Stiller's and Hackman's characters reach this point of reconciliation and mutual understanding near the end when Hackman buys Stiller a replacement dog (appropriately a Dalmation like the Dalmation mice Stiller invented as a kid) after Eli runs over Stiller's dog. Stiller thanks him, hugs him, and declares, "It's been a bad year for me." It's touching and honest.Finally, Anderson's use of background music is so unconventional and perfectly in tune with what's happening on screen that the music itself takes on the part of reflecting the characters' emotions, while also evoking the appropriate emotions in the audience. How often does one hear music as eclectic as that of modern French composer Erik Satie, Van Morrison, The Rolling Stones, and Jackson Brown and "Christmastime is Here" from the Charlie Brown Christmas Special, sewn seamlessly into one film?Personally, I find Anderson's works, and especially this film, to be at once hilarious and delightful, and poignant and hopeful as well. I hope that he continues his collaboration with Owen Wilson and that together they enjoy long and prolific film-making careers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film, but not without its problems.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the movie like many expecting for high dosages of dry wit, and an all around pleasant movie. Perhaps there was too much anticipation on my part, because of Anderson's past movies. I found the movie a breath of fresh air from so many movies being generated by the Holywood machine. There were however some dull moments in the movie, which left me yawning in my theater seat. I did find one part of the movie particularly enjoyable, although dark. The scenes where luke wilson and bill murray find out about all of the men paltrow had "balled," followed by the montage of flashbacks to all of the men and the ramones song "judy is a punk" playing in the background. Truly a wes anderson classic. Then the dark scene of luke wilson shaving in the bathroom and the song "needle in the hay" playing in the background. Maybe i'm a sicko for enjoying this part of the movie, but I think that part of the movie was a testimant to what a great filmmaker anderson can be, and reminisant of what everyone comes to expect when we go to see one of his movies. I think the movie is worth going to see if you are a true wes anderson fan and can not wait for the video release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is there an Academy Award for most boring film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For having such a talented cast, this movie never got off the ground. From the opening voiceover "explaining" the family's history, I kept waiting for it to become funny. Now, I appreciate humor and think that I have a rather dry sense of what is funny but I never found it here. I kept trying to make myself laugh (and did chuckle here and there). I was profoundly disappointed in the film. Perhaps I am not sophisticated to appreciate the writing, but then, I don't think so. I did not feel alone. The audience chuckled a few times as well; the rest of the time, the theater had the atmosphere of an unoccupied tomb. Surely Gene Hackman, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Bill Murray did not need the money that much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's because I'm only 16, or maybe it's because this movie was one of the least amusing "comedies" I have ever seen. I did not find anything funny in this film. To be honest, I've never seen any other work by Wes Anderson. Maybe his other films are alright.....who knows. What I do know is that I won't be renting any of his movies any time soon.....yeah....I am letting one bad apple spoil the whole bunch.When a movie that runs just under an hour and fourty minutes seems like three hours you know that it's definately lacking something (a plot maybe). I felt bad for making two of my friends see this movie with me, as they seemed to enjoy it less than I did.In all fairness, I did recommend this movie to my parents. Every theatre goer over 35 seemed to love this film.I only laughed twice during the film. Once when the man sitting behind me snorted; and again when the lady next to me touched my arm with her fur coat (hey.....it tickled).If you like off-beat, dark, and often boring (ok, completely boring) comedies, go see the Royal Tenenbaums. If you are under 35 or do not enjoy the above......save your $8.00, go to Blockbuster and spend $4.00 to rent something so won't feel so bad returning if it was completely horrible (you might even have enough money left to buy some Gummi Bears at the checkout).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much of a good thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could have been my favorite movie. Wes Anderson's aesthetic is rich and inviting. Locations, sets and soundtrack weave together to create a compelling atmosphere.Anderson's characters too, are intelligent, eccentric and (usually) unique enough to be people we would respect and seek out in daily life.Too much of Rushmore has been carried over into The Royal Tenenbaums. At times Richie Tenenbaum is a dead ringer for Max Fisher. And this is a sad thing. Max Fisher was so fabulously unique, brilliant and bratty. The recycling of character traits here debases both movies.Had I not seen Rushmore, I would have fallen in love with The Royal Tenenbaums. But Rushmore came first and remains Anderson's best effort. I hope his future works will retain the Tenenbaum atmosphere while introducing new personalities who are more than shadows of former Anderson characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rare Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am usually skeptical about film as a medium. It generally is too totalizing, suspiciously immediate, allows its audience to be too passive, usually just confirms all these lame American mythologies (the happy ending, the good man, the ultimately forgiving woman, hard work conquers all, intimate human relationships between rich people are always more important than anything else in the world) --- in short, films might be entertaining, but it is hard for me to see how they might be art.Of course I'm talking about a small subclass of films - `movies' - that is, Hollywood, general-release movies viewed at the multiplex, and I'm being unfair to the efforts of thousands of people who aspire to something more. Be that as it may - in the set of things that most of us see most of the time, there are very few real standouts.Enter The Royal Tenenbaums, which, I must say, was entertaining, and thoroughly so. Wes Anderson has a perfect sense of comedic timing, perhaps only rivaled today by the creators of The Simpsons. Actually, this movie had a lot in common with The Simpsons - take them and transcribe them into upper-class New York life, and you have some idea of what you will be seeing if you go and spend $8.50 or whatever it might cost you to see this movie.But, like The Simpsons this movie has a conscience - it is art. Somehow this movie has taken classic, universal archetypes (though The Simpsons deals more in stereotypes - and I think there is a difference) and has absolutely breathed undeniable life into all of them, and it's particular life. The old, lecherous, gruff ass-hole father, the hopelessly confused, over-sexed daughter, the fanatical over-achieving son, the near-fatally moody other son, the understated but in-control matriarch. These are all character-types we have seen before. (Not the least of which in Joyce - Finnegans Wake has exactly this cast of main characters - HCE the bumbling father, ALP the omnipresent mother, Shem the brother doomed to failure and exile, Shaun the hyper-social achiever, Izzy the hopelessly lost daughter and object of all of the men's lust/love - it is probably not coincidental that Joyce's name shows up on the screen briefly - someone fictional is interviewing James Joyce about 'the west' in the Sunday Magazine Section - this movie is what Joyce might have said about the west - or at least the west side - if he knew how to make movies.)To some extent, the movie embraces this. The flashback vignettes for each character make this clear - these are highly compacted (hilarious!) riffs on well-known themes. The Alec Baldwin voice-over almost sounds like `A Christmas Story' at times. The firm book-page section breaks - even the mock-thematic unity reached when Richie's bird returns with some gray feathers, like an after-school special. Like the various digressions in Finnegans Wake or the `Circe' episode of Ulysses, (or any episode of The Simpsons) the farcical manipulation of conventions is used in such a commanding way that one starts to think it is easy (and then realizes at once that is must be infinitely hard).All the farce notwithstanding, the movie, and its characters, all have details that only real life, and real humans can have. Royal has quirks that just don't show up everywhere (or anywhere else) - a penchant for always pointing out that his daughter is adopted, the ability to lie about his impending death at a moment's notice, a bell-hop friend who is willing to pose as a doctor. Margot had her finger cut off by her birth-parents, and hides her smoking habit from her family well into adulthood, Chas marries an Israeli who later died in a plane crash and is obsessed with the security of his children, who always wear warm-up suits, Richie still wears his old tennis wristbands, Ethel is an archeologist. One could go on - I'm sure when I see it again I'll pick up more and more details.The movie has a keen ability to make us laugh at a moment's notice - but it is not that much of an exaggeration to say it can switch gears so abruptly that you are amazed the movie doesn't stall (afterward, when you think about it - while you are watching it you are swept back and forth between laughter and poignant sadness) - and if you are someone who cries at movies, you might here. It is almost as if all of the laughs provided - and these are a special kind of laughs - laughs that draw you in, generally as compellingly believable and personally resonant as they are patent exaggerations - it is almost as if all of those laughs are just so much emotional foreplay, designed so that when the heavy content of the movie advances, you are in such an emotionally vulnerable state that you are sincerely moved in ways you might not have thought possible at the outset (I had similar feelings while watching High Fidelity).The soundtrack you cannot help but like, if you are like me. From Ravel chamber music to Velvet Underground outtakes, Nico (solo), the Clash and Paul Simon - you are bound to like a movie when you could compile its soundtrack from CD's you own.Lastly - the actors all deserve a strong round of applause (one which I almost gave them before coming to my senses at the end of the film) - the mediation between archetype and individual, comedy and tragedy that this film so skillfully achieves requires both a sharp script and brilliant interpretations/appropriations of the characters by the actors - Hackman and Paltrow are the obvious standouts, but the supporting characters, including the idiot-child taken on by Bill Murray's character and Owen Wilson, the droll drug-addict writer/possible terrorist - every one of them has hit the mark.In short, it is a travesty if this is not selected as Best Picture of 2001.</fullReview>

You would think that in a laugh-filled movie, that a serious part wouldn't fit in real well, but it does. The few serious parts in this movie are good ones. Another thing I really like is that you don't know what year the movie takes place in.The more I think abot this movie, the more I like it. So I would recommend it to everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has some of the most diverse characters ever witnessed in film. Which has to be a great accomplishment for not only the director and actors but for the screenwriters as well. The movie starts out just as any normal movie would, setting up the characters and plot. People are here watching the movie thinking and expecting it to be a comedy but yet behind all the jokes lays a bigger and deeper meaning. Looking at all the kids knowing that they don't hate their lives but maybe want better ones. I think the biggest achievement is that you feel every emotion the character feels. You feel compassion and loneliness for Ben Stiller over losing his wife. You feel butterflies in your stomach over Luke Wilson's deep obsession with his adopted sister Margot(played by one Gwyneth Paltrow). You feel unworthy when you see how Gwyneth Paltrow latches on to these low life losers. Its a great movie. Gene Hackman had the best character out of them all. Its a roller coaster of all coming down into one house hold. GREAT MOVIE.</fullReview>

From what people told me, this is supposed to be a movie about something serious and also histerical at the same time. If you think that spotted rats and and a SPOILER!!!guy being stabbed just for kicks is drop dead hilarious, then by all means, see this movie, it will keep you entertained, but if you don't, like me who was completely bored, see another comedy-drama such as Go, American Beauty, Election, or You Can Count on Me!

		<shortDescription>Funny, but not Rushmore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This rebellious family comedy proves the Anderson and Owen writing team's creativity, but when compared to their 1998 Rushmore it falls a little flat. The cast is loaded with entertaining family members, who each has their moment, but it's Hackman that makes the movie. As father Royal Tenenbaum, Hackman is a hilarious scoundrel who equals good parenting to taking his children to dog fights. Hackman never stops and truly deserves Oscar recognition for this roll. He does for this film what Bill Murray did for Rushmore; however, it just isn't enough. The last half-hour slows down and takes a dark turn ? the ending picks back up, yet by then it seems too late. The bottom line is that The Royal Tenenbaums lacks the liveliness and unity of Rushmore and reminds me more of Bottle Rocket ? another very funny Anderson and Owen film that unfortunately comes off feeling a little incomplete. The fabulous soundtrack and interestingly awkward scene cuts are right on the money though. So it doesn't match up to Rushmore, so what? It still is better than over half of the films released this year.</fullReview>

The same essential story, former child prodigies who are all messed up as adults. though This is done in such a way that the humor is more apparent. I love the little chapter segments between scenes. this gave the movie a literary sensibility that is lacking in most films of the day. i thought this was genius. In regards to people saying that it wasn't funny, there are no "jokes" in this movie. The humor is left to stand in the situations that are created around the characters.

		<fullReview>First of all, this movie is not going to be hysterically funny to everyone. The quirky characters and odd situations they find themselves in can be laugh at loud funny to some, but leaves others saying, "What are they laughing at?" I was part of the group laughing hysterically. (Especially at the ATV's in the background on one scene, but I'll save that for you...) This is a story about a family growing up, shall I say, dysfunctionally?No, I'd rather not say that because I'd love to be a part of this "Dysfunctional" family as one character 'Eli Cash' so desperately wanted. They each have that something that makes me want to get to know them, and not just for their accomplishments. Royal, the patron of the family is a crass old guy who tells it like it is, "Isn't there another body around here?" Ethel, the matron of the family, is a sweet lady who has had her share of suters. Chas and Richie, the sons of Ethel and Royal, are child prodigies in the field of finance and tennis respectively. Margot, the adopted daughter of the Tenebaums, an acclaimed playwrite at an early age, started smoking at 12. Eli Cash, the next-door-neighbor, want's to be a Tenebaum and practically is. Three more characters you will come to love are Pagoda; Royal's assistant with a thing for stabbing, Raliegh St. Clair; Margot's husband and psychologist, and Dudley; Raliegh's hilarious patient with excellent hearing and color blindness. Unlike the Wes Anderson films before Tenenbaums, this one does not sink into a lull. The movie moves foward and keeps you laughing from start to finish. It's easily on my top five movies of the year. Go see the Royal Tenebaums, you'll either laugh, laugh hysterically, or have a good time.???!???!???!</fullReview>

I'm a huge Gene Hackman fan, &amp; I figured with him &amp; the rest of the cast this was going to be a good film. I should have said excellent. This is by far one of the best films I have seen...ever. Hackman gives a superior performance, comedic at times, which is Oscar worthy. When Royal Tenebaum(Hackman) is thrown out of the hotel he is living at, he decides to search out his estranged family. Hoping to get a place to stay, he tells his children &amp; wife that he is dying. But the more time he spends with his family, he starts to 'live' again. What was a love-hate relationship with him &amp; his family starts to change with some great results. Most of the flashback scenes are hysterical. This is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cleverness before character **a few spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to love this movie because Rushmore was my favorite movie of 1998. However, I only liked it. There never seemed a great urgency in anything the characters did. There was never any crisis and very little conflict. Royal was broke and kicked out of his hotel. I always knew he'd survive. Even when he was inexplicably stabbed by Pagoda, I knew he'd be OK. There were some very funny scenes played very deadpan. The humor wasn't spelled out like other "comedies". You had to be sharp, for instance, to realize that the doctor that comes to the house to treat Royal was actually the elevator operator at his hotel.The film was VERY good until Royal was "unmasked" and kicked out of the house. The it just rambled for a while. Just an addition of wacky scene after wacky scene. The romance between Margot and Richie was just so freaking DULL that not only did I not care that they got together, it almost seemed like THEY THEMSELVES didn't care. Again, no urgency.The film didn't blow me away like Rushmore did, but it is STILL better than any other comedy this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to evoke emotion with a film. Very few directors in this day of age can even hint at emotional realism, but The Royal Tenenbaums has done just this. It was a remarkable storyline. Honesty, comedy, and tragedy all captured frame by frame. The characters are so far removed from ourselves, but yet we find some part of ourself in each and every member. The mixure of emotion one gets from watching this movie is unbelievable. In one way envigirated, happy in life, but at the same time insanely depressed. The combination is a sobering experience. Innovation lies at the heart of this movie. Undoubtably, it pushes the boundary of film. Told, as if it was a literary classic, it claims its mark in our film world.</fullReview>

The only bright spot for me was Gwyneth Paltrow who was beautiful to watch and played the only character who seemed even slightly more than two dimensional.

		<fullReview>While "The Tenenbaums" is far more charming than "Rushmore", it is narratively, almost identical. It begins as a dark comedy (a point emphasized in the trailer) but becomes softer and more sentimental as it continues. In Ander-Wilson's world, all transgressions are forgiven, all vendettas, forgotten. The "lite" breaks through the clouds, love and happiness prevail, and in the end, it's all puppy-dogs and balloons. In short, a Hallmark Card with a hip veneer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps it's just me...and my friends...and everyone I've talked to. Yet The Royal Tenenbaums is a royal pain in the rear to sit through. Being hailed as one of the greatest comedies and family geared movies ever it instead is bogged down by so many things. I'll touch on a few here to keep it simple.1. Gene Hackman and Luke Wilson (as Royal and Richie respectively) are the only characters that get any development. The rest of the movie flops on it's face because we don't know anything about the characters. Some say that Baldwin as the narrator tells you all you need to know but instead I found myself half way into the movie finding out something about Margot that was a total shot in the dark, something not even the most clever of us could catch. Bad story telling there.2. Gene Hackman's character in general. Now he was indeed the best character, but that isn't saying much. He cussed an inordinate amount of times, and this comes from a foul-mouthed teenager. Every other word is some form of swear. Secondly the things that he does that are supposed to be funny are more commonly everyday occurances. Maybe I'm just not old enough to appreciate this.3. The director's style. It borders on painful. The color schemes are original, that's a given. But the drab reds and flashy pinks begin to wear on your eyes after a while. I walked out of this movie with a migraine and a bad temper, not my idea of entertainment.In fact, personal opinion of course, there were only 2 truly genuine comedy scenes. I won't spoil it but naturally both deal with Gene Hackman. Now something that turned my stomach is during one very emotional climatic scene involving Richie in front of a mirror (those who have seen will understand) the entire audience save me and my 2 friends was cracking up laughing. This was sick and degrading and if it was intended as comedy then I want nothing to do with a movie theater ever again in my life. In fact, the laughter from the crowd made that scene the worst I've ever seen in my entire life. It absolutely ruined what was supposed to be an unrequited love moment.1 out of 10 stars, horrible movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just sum it all up for you. "Royal Tenenbaums" is a movie with what I call, "weird humor." This is the kind of humor that I'd say 50% of people get and 50% do not. It's just stuff that seems out of place or doesn't really make sense. For instance, one of the most halarious parts of the movie in my opinion was when Eli, !POSSIBLE SPOILER! after crashing his car into the Tenenbaum household asks, "Where's my shoe?" and then Dudley comes into the frame, kneels, and presents him with his shoe. Another great part was when Royal and Pagoda were kicked out of the house, Pagoda stabs Royal for the second time, and Royal says something along the lines of, "That's the last time you put a knife in me!" Oh god my sides were splitting! Most people would probably think that's just dumb. Anyway, if you like this kind of comedy, the kind that's also in Rushmore, also a very good film by Wes Anderson, then without a doubt you should see "Royal Tenenbaums." But if you don't, I'd advise you to not see it unless you want to bore yourself to death for two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a great, unique flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to the theater to see "The Royal Tenenbaums" I was expecting it to be a sophisticated, laugh out loud comedy. Boy, was I wrong. The flick is a lighthearted stab at dysfunctional families. There is no dialogue in this movie that will have you doubling over in laughter, but the combination of minute details makes it so that you have to really pay attention to understand some of the comedy. Try not to giggle when you see Richie and Eli talking with the paintings behind them. Gene Hackman puts on one of his best performances of his career (I know, you've heard it before). There is one part in the movie that jumps out and grabs you when you least expect it. It totally changes the atmosphere of the movie. Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson did a great job writing and directing this flick. It is much more deeper, but not as comical as Rushmore. If you are expecting this movie to be really funny, don't get your hopes up. I really don't know what genre in which to classify this movie. It has humorous elements, yet they are not overpowering. This is by far, the best movie I have seen this year.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Royal" Treatment, Tenenbaum Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take a look at just about any family from any era and you'll probably discover a certain degree of internal conflict present. This is nothing new. But recently-- comparatively-- someone chanced upon the term `dysfunctional,' put it in a sentence with, and preceding `family,' and now, though we have neither more insight nor knowledge about any of it, we can at least define what we already knew that we didn't know. The estrangements that occur within a given family unit and the causes thereof remain a mystery, and in the final analysis, a family is a family is a family, and in `The Royal Tenenbaums,' director Wes Anderson presents one of `those' families for your consideration, contemplation, cogitation and review. And it's quite a group; a family you're not likely to forget any time soon. In the decade before they separated, Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Etheline (Anjelica Huston) had three children (one of whom-- their daughter-- was adopted). Etheline was left on her own to raise them, and very early on each child exhibited some unique talent bordering on genius. Chas (Ben Stiller) became a financial whiz and was running a successful business out of his bedroom when he was still a kid; Margot Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a successful playwright by her early teens; and Richie (Luke Wilson) was a professional tennis champion by the age of seventeen. But as our story begins, Royal, due to certain circumstances (and for reasons of his own) feels the need to reconnect with his family, and even though he hasn't spoken to Etheline in over seven years, she is still technically his wife-- they never divorced. So, at this late date he contrives a way to gain the attention-- if not the affection-- of his wife and children, once again. And suffice to say, soon one and all (including the audience) are given the `Royal' treatment, Tenenbaum style, courtesy of Wes Anderson and a terrific cast. With `Bottle Rocket' in 1996, then `Rushmore' in 1998, Anderson began developing his own unique style of crafting and presenting a film that he fine-tunes to perfection with `Tenenbaums.' It's a style that comes from realizing a personal vision and knowing how to implement it, knowing how to convey that unique perspective on life to the audience. Anderson uses a very straightforward and honest approach to tell his story; there is no charade, pretense or manipulation involved. He lets you know who his characters are and what they are about, good or bad, and in a totally non judgmental way. Royal Tenenbaum, for example; he presents him as he is-- what you see is what you get-- right or wrong, this is who he is, and he leaves it up to the viewer to assess his conduct. And though he may not give you all of the pieces of the puzzle that is any particular character, he gives you enough to make up your mind. Most importantly, he gives you real people to consider; people with all the flaws and foibles that you and I or anyone we know are invested with in one way or another.  Beginning with the extremely well-written screenplay, by Anderson and Owen Wilson (the two also collaborated on `Bottle Rocket' and `Rushmore'), the movie is intelligent and insightful, and a challenge for the discerning viewer. This is not a film to be taken lightly or at face value; there is a lot to take in, visually as well as cerebrally, but for those who make the least bit of effort, the rewards are substantial. There are moments of hilarity, but also of reflection, because the comedy and drama plays out measure for measure as it does in real life. And that's what makes this movie (and all of Anderson's work) so interesting and engaging-- the very real and unpredictability of it all that is so true-to-life. The story is nothing less than a concise take on the Human Comedy, with characters that are rich and believable (for all, or maybe because of, their quirkiness), and presented in signature style by Anderson-- which is quite a feat considering this is only his third film. Many directors build a career without ever attaining that personal `signature' that defines their work as uniquely their own, as Anderson already has.  Leading this outstanding ensemble cast, Gene Hackman is delightfully and endearingly unlikable as Royal, the father everyone hopes they never had. He's about as delicate and subtle as a trash compactor, but in an amusing sort of way. The guy you can tolerate, even enjoy, as long as you know he's leaving at the end of the day. And Hackman plays him to perfection, which makes all that goes on around him fall into place, as well. Stiller gives an effective, understated performance as Chas, a single father of two, coping with problems of his own and obsessed with safety, while Paltrow is deliciously morose and introspective as Margot Helen.  Luke Wilson, meanwhile, gives an affecting performance as Richie by managing to really get into his character's skin. You sense that there's a lot going on behind his eyes, which, in fact, is one of the strengths of this film-- the fact that you can feel these people actually `thinking.' Richie, Margot and Chas share that common thread-- that silent introspection that is so subtly effective, and Anderson wisely gives each of them these quiet, pensive moments-- without cluttering them up with unnecessary dialogue-- that tell you so much about who they really are underneath. And it proves that even in film, a picture can be worth a thousand words.  Rounding out the cast-- and all with noteworthy performances-- are Bill Murray (Raleigh), Owen Wilson (Eli), Danny Glover (Henry), Seymour Cassel (Dusty) and Kumar Pallana (Pagoda). Quirky, eccentric, funny and alive, `The Royal Tenenbaums' will make you think and laugh at the same time, which isn't such a bad deal; it is, in fact, the magic of the movies. 10/10.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was torn when I saw Rushmore. I couldn't decide whether to like it because of its humor or hate it because of its perversely obstinate strangeness. There's no such problem with Tenenbaums. It's still strange, but it's not off-putting, as, in my opinion, Rushmore was.Don't get me wrong. This is not a movie for the common crowd. It will not be universally admired. On the other hand, Titanic was universally admired, and so was Gladiator. Neither of those two films will ever, in my opinion, hold a candle to this one.The glory of Tenenbaums is its characters; it is character-motivated and character driven. Therefore I see people on this complaining that there was no plot. On the contrary, I could easily sum up the plot in two lines. I don't think this is an intellectual's movie; the jokes don't depend on having a certain IQ or shoe size. They don't depend on being a certain age, either. They do depend on having a certain sense of humor. If you didn't like or understand movies like O Brother Where Art Thou? or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels you may not have the requisitely original (and in my opinion, rare) sense of humor to enjoy this movie.However, blaming it on the movie would truly be a mistake, as there are a lot of people who enjoyed it profusely. There are some hilarious moments in this movie: the tic-tac, the pictures of Margot, the mice, Royal's chosen epitaph.This isn't a movie for intellectuals. It is a movie for subtle people. (Those two things are not the same.) If you can appreciate the humor involved when a Klan rally prances around like the flying monkeys from Wizard of Oz (O Brother Where Art Thou) or the humor involved when a gangster father chastises his son for swearing while taking his son to work with him (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), you may not like this movie. The jokes will not come up and hit you upside the head. They prefer to sneak up on you like a certain variety of cute, spotted rodents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The better of the two Gene Hackman/Owen Wilson collaborations of 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here director Wes Anderson explores the idea of the dysfunctional family and how there's no escape from who you are and where you came from (hence the tagline). Anyone will be able to relate to the love/hate relationship the Tenenbaums have with each other. They make each other miserable and yet need each other desperately.With this cast, filmgoers less likely to brave a more artistically adventurous film will buy a ticket to this one. For many, it will not be what they expect. It doesn't deliver huge laughs, but it's a sweet story laced with really clever humor. Anderson's visual style maintains a giddiness throughout. A simple cutaway here or reaction shot there serve to alter the tone of a given scene (such as the hilarious flashback to Margot's reunion with her real family in Indiana). "Royal Tenenbaums" is one great scene after another. There seems to be more set pieces than there were in Anderson's "Rushmore" of a few years ago. At times, "Tenenbaums" feels more like a Woody Allen picture than a Wes Anderson (by no means a bad thing). For example, the sidewalk-set scene in which Royal first tells Etheline he's dying. It's one for the ages.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about a movie that did right by me: The Royal Tenenbaums was funny, well-paced, well-acted and quite touching, to be honest.The hype surrounding Gene Hackman's performance has definite substance to it. He portrays the fallen patriarch who has (seemingly) little interest in what he has until he realizes somebody else might get it. The desparation and cunning shown by Hackman is brilliant. The rest of the cast shines as well, with Luke Wilson standing out for me. The quiet discontent provides the perfect tension between family members who haven't always been the best of friends.The humor scores points with me, since a lot of it seems very subtle compared to most of today's "comedies." There are few times that I find myself bursting out in laughter in the theater; on more than one occasion, I found myself doing just that. The sly writing teamed up well with some visual humor (something about those matching red jogging suits ....) And the "I'll say what's on my mind when it comes to mind" dialogue from Royal Tenenbaum was funny without being overly offensive.To think I haven't even mentioned the outstanding soundtrack until now (Nick Drake, Ramones, Nico, Velvet Underground, et. al.) shows how much I thought of the movie as a whole. This gives "Memento" a run for its money for my favorite 2001 movie, and it's hard to compare that apple to this orange. Actually, they're both peaches, damn good ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real characters in a fictional world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the outset of The Royal Tenenbaums, there are no qualms made about the fictionality of the characters and story we are watching on screen. The movie is presented as a book, much like old animated Disney movies, except that, in those cases, they were based on a real book. In The Royal Tenenbaums, even the book is fictional. We are reminded of this at regular intervals by an extreme close up of a chapter heading and the first few lines of a page describing the scene we are about to see. Furthermore, despite the fact that the year is identified clearly as 2001, all of the characters seem to insist on existing in a strange year that never happened in the late seventies and early eighties. This not only applies to the major characters, who have the excuse that they are trying to reclaim their childhood, but to every fringe character and all of the extras. This extends beyond the pastel, retro clothes we saw in the preview. Nobody seems to have noticed that things have been invented during the last twenty years: nobody has cellular phones, or even cordless phones, people send paper mail, Ari and Uzi, members of the youngest Tenenbaum generation keep books for their father's business using notebooks and paper and what looks like a four-function calculator. People still listen to vinyl in this movie. To everybody's credit, all of the devices which intentionally prevent us from forgetting even momentarily that we are watching fiction do nothing to keep us from caring about and usual feeling pity for the characters. The fact that these characters do not exist makes it no less horrible to see their continually destructive behavior. Gwyneth Paltrow is especially wonderful as Margot. She manages to portray several distinct and intense emotions using only one facial expression throughout the entire movie. I hope it inspires the Academy to begin a special awards category for most utilitarian acting. Among a lesser cast, Paltrow might have stolen the show, but the entire cast is so excellent, and each character is so well-developed that it is hard to give special mention to individuals. However, it must be said that Gene Hackman gives a nearly flawless performance. The casting of the young counterparts of the Tenenbaum children is marvelous, lending great continuity to the film.

		<shortDescription>Too many characters, but wonderful no less...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie greatly, however, I was surprised a little at Wes Anderson's choice of casting so many characters. The fact Anderson billed so many big stars wasn't troubling to me, it was the fact that he tried to squeze all of them into equal time on the screen. You see, the beauty of Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, was the fact that there was only two or three (three at the most) main characters. We got to see each main character in many aspects of life, which, in this special brand of humor especially, is SO IMPORTANT. However, this is all very petty, because I loved the movie regardless. I've always loved reading Salinger, and I would be partial to this movie regardless of how well done it was! There weren't too many strong links to the Salinger stories, but Margot Tenenbaum (Paltrow) reminded me a lot of Franny Glass. I was skeptical of the casting of Ben Stiller, not because he isn't talented or anything, because he IS very talented (see the Ben Stiller show) - - but because he hasn't been in ANY good movies lately (see Zoolander, Meet the Parents). But he pulled it off. He was my least favorite character, but he did alright I guess.Richie Tenenbaum, played by Luke Wilson, was great though. I loved the character. The scene where he punches the glass and then stands beside Bill Murray as they both look away was so hilarious! Also the scene where Luke is shaving it very powerful and moving. I dont know how Wes Anderson pulled off such a serious scene in a movie like this, but he pulled it off. But again, it would have been better had we known Richie a tad bit better. Luke is too talented in this type of humor to be underused. Owen Wilson needed more time as well, and a better character then what he got. He is also too talented and funny in this kind of comedy to be so grossly underused. The scene where he talks about his book on Custer was so funny, I was just waiting for his character to develop and it never did.When I see the Wilson brothers in these type of comedies I wonder why they make so many BAD movies outside of Wes Anderson (see Home Fries, Anaconda, etc) Outside of Wes, the best movies they were a part of were probably Dog Park for Luke (directed by mad genius Bruce McCulloch), and Cable Guy for Owen.But I'm whining again, when I should be praising. All this talk over who was underused when I should have talked about how great Gene Hackman was!!! Overall The Royal Tenenbaums was a wonderful movie that I'll treasure forever, but it finshes a close third behind Rushmore and Bottle Rocket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Royal Tenenbaums" marks a huge artistic leap for Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson, who have already written two of the most brilliant movies of the past five years and maybe ever: "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore." What's amazing about this film is that they have gone from making "Bottle Rocket" with only a supporting performance by a washed up star (James Caan, who's great nonetheless) and now attracted one of the best casts imaginable (Hackman, Paltrow, Stiller, Murray, Glover, Huston) while upping the ante of creativity instead of selling out. It's amazing how all of the characters have an incredible amount of quirks while remaining totally believable and touching. Hackman breaks out of his rut of playing crusty authority figures and creates a one-of-a-kind character that is fully realized and funny. Alec Baldwin's voiceover work places viewers squarely into storybook land, a perfect touch. GO SEE THIS MOVIE AND SHOW HOLLYWOOD THAT ORIGINALITY DESERVES TO BE REWARDED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subliminally Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Hackman (Royal Tenenbaum) makes a desperate attempt to reconsile with his estranged family after many long years. Although this attempt is somewhat underhanded, faking a terminal illness to gain sympathy, it is nevertheless effective. As children, Chas (Ben Stiller), Margo (Gweneth Paltrow), and Richie (Luke Wilson), are overachievers seemingly destine for success. However, in assumed adulthood-by age only, after Royal departs the family a crude father figure, the children are finding out that success is not as easliy acquired as it once was. Chas, Margo, and Richie have all fallen from the lofty heights of success to the lowly sorrows of depression. All three children now seem lost without one another, compared to their somewhat happier childhood as a family. Upon hearing of the morbid news, everyone returns to the Tenebuaum household. The rest of the movie consists of subtle and uncomfortable humor accompanied by deeply sensitive topics. Although the humor was at times too soft-spoken, it was necessary to convey the "life is okay to laugh at" undertone of this picture. The film sags in the middle, making connections between the begining and end of the movie-arguably the best parts-somewhat difficult. Eventually, the family goes through a period of growing and discovers the happiness so hard to come by as individulas is found so easliy as a family. The film seems to imply that it's never too late to make a change, as most characters make life-altering discovers at the film's close. Walking out of the theater I will admitt the film did not leave a good taste in my mouth. Yet, after much consideration, I will say that I was subliminally entertained by the picture. I do recomend THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS to anyone that enjoys brilliant character development, real life humor, and a unique cinematic appraoch. However, if you enjoy films that allow you to idly watch as plots, themes, and characters are effortlessly feed to you like a baby in a highchair waiting for the next spoonfull of mindless humor and stifling blatancy, then I suggest you see the next American Pie movie.</fullReview>

This director has taken a incredible array of acting talent and totally wasted them on a film that is one of the most boring and unfunny things I've ever seen.Apparently the entire cast was given massive doses of qualudes prior to each scene. ANY display of emotion was strictly off limits here. Gwyneth Paltrow apparently was singled out for double dosing. Bill Murray was given a lobotomy shortly before filming began...his body appears in the film, but Bill Murray isn't in residence.My biggest mistake was not walking out after the first 30 minutes. I wanted to but decided it might get better. It doesn't.I love independent films. I love films about dysfunctional families. But this film just plain sucks.I can't imagine what all these people writing how awesome this film is saw....

		<fullReview>Here's an amazing array of quirky characters and a well-chosen collection of actors. And the purpose of producing this film was?? _to entertain the performers _to make a bundle _to keep the Wilson boys off the streets _to capitalize on the cabin fever syndrome.RT has a script, which is neatly divided into chapters of a book. And I admit that I nodded off three times in this masterpiece of meander.Royal (Gene Hackman) is a lovable schnook - when he shows up you want to be sure you know precisely where your wallet is. Angelica Huston portrays a long-suffering matriarch who isn't about to compromise her affections for a suitor played by Danny Glover.Gwyneth Paltrow leads a team of infantilized adults (thank you NYT) including Ben Stiller who plays it for laughs and succeeds in beating his character into the ground. Did anyone else get tired of the red running suits? The remainder of Luke and Owen Wilson and Bill Murray (who looks embarrassed to be here ? but shouldn't) do little to add to the development of the plot. But then I must remind you that I snoozed.Like Hackman's character, you really want to love this movie. The buzz over RT is about its simple entertainment value. It's just funny so sit back and relax and laugh along with Royal. You will enjoy this much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At times excruciatingly funny yet oddly unsatisfying. As with Rushmore, I found the overly quirky characters too bizarre to relate to and the director tends to skim superficially over each of them, leaving you wanting more. Hackman, Huston and Owen Wilson are superb but the supporting cast felt rather lightweight although that's in part down to the script. It's certainly one of the better comedies I've seen in the last few years but doesn't hold a candle to an in-form Woody Allen, an auteur who treads similar territory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anthony and Dignan Ride Again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apart from Woody Allen, or maybe the Farrelly brothers, Wes Anderson has a singular voice in American Comedy. He goes not for broad strokes but rather for minute character details. It is understatements that get the biggest laughs. And in an era where directors are desperate to get an audience rolling that they will resort to anything, (pie defilement, testicle eating, horse masturbation, etc.) Anderson's films have an air of confidence to them. He knows you'll laugh, so he won't beat you over the head.And in the tradition of Lubitsch-esque films like his previous two; "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore," comes "The Royal Tenenbaums." With this, Anderson has joined the leagues of the greats working today. He must be mentioned in the same breath as such off-beat directors as the Coen brothers, Terry Gilliam, and even Stanley Kubrick. (Although he's dead.) Let it never be said that attention to detail ever broke a movie.A lesser director might have taken the same materials that Anderson has here (A dysfunctional family of geniuses living under one roof with a shifty and untrustworthy patriarch) and made a terrible film ridden with stock characters and weak situations. But this particular director has made these potential stereotypes come alive with their own little quirks and mannerisms and outlooks. Consider for example a scene where Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson) is playing tennis, and is losing horribly for he sees his adopted sister Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) with her new husband in the stands. He is in love with her, and he is at his wits-end, and his reaction to this on the court is funny and heartbreaking at the same time. These characters can easily be classified as neurotics and too quirky for the audience's good, but that is a statement of someone who isn't paying enough attention.I usually shy away from all-star casts because that usually means that studio executives are swarming around the set insisting that changes be made to make the film more "palatable" for audience consumption. But that is not the case here. Everyone from the film's lead: Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum, to Kumar Pallana as his manservant Pagoda, are all they can be. This film is deeply enriching for general audiences, and for aspiring actors, this is the movie to see to learn how the pros apply their trade.**** out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit, I hadn't heard of this movie when my friends and I went to see it, I just went along for the ride and bought my ticket not knowing what to expect. Thank God I hadn't heard the hype, because then I might have actually been disappointed. I would have preferred it if this movie had let me feel any sort of emotion toward it, but instead I just sat there trying to remember if I had just SEEN a movie. This movie indulged itself for two hours in front of an audience and then spit it out without any sort of satisfaction, denial, or feeling at the end. I'll also admit that I didn't get it. The humor, the subtleties, and the outrageousness were all totally lost on me. I don't see the humor in a child keeping financial magazines in his home, a lobotomy patient like daughter hiding smoking from her family for 22 years, or a washed up tennis star continuing to wear his handband years after he lost his last match. If these kids were such incredible geniuses, couldn't they at least use some of their supposedly keen intellect to do something witty? I started to look for the humor until I decided there was nothing particularly funny.Perhaps this wasn't my brand of humor, but if I want pathetic, dysfunctional (yet still very funny) characters, I'll watch something by Woody Allen or Happiness. I find the humor of dysfunction families in movies to be based in some sort of reality. There was none of that here. I don't think this is a bad film (again, I'm not sure), but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to people I care about. This is a film that will be totally and utterly forgotten by this time next year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that is supposed to be wacky just sits there on the screen and I sat there in the theater waiting for laughs. The script is howlingly defective and the acting, which is supposed to convey depression and neurotic behavior, is a huge turn off. Yes, Gene Hackman does a fine job, but his character is neither humorous nor interesting. Gwenyth Paltrow is told to work against her natural charm with disastrous results. So much is just not funny including: stomach cancer, dogs killed by drugged up writers, Hackman's relationship with his wife and children, Danny Glover's unfortunate character. I'd laugh a little and then go back to looking at my watch while I waited for the next laugh in what was a very dull alleged comedy. Only two positive notes: the coming attractions for this film were terrific and the way Hackman's character was resolved was humorous. Meanwhile I do have two questions: who decided to green-light this script before it was ready and why are so many critics claiming that this film is so good? Adam Graham in the Desert Sun newspaper thought that "The Royal Tenenbaums" was reason to "stand up and cheer." For me, it was more like sit down and nap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what you might expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attention reviewers: if you went to see this movie expecting something else, do not sound so disappointed that you never got it. It doesn't make the movie bad; it just wasn't your cup of tea, so stop defacing this page with bad reviews. Instead of complaining about the slow delivery of lines, sit back and appreciate the way each shot was masterfully framed. All of the actors fell in love with the script for some reason, so you might be missing something. Also, I highly doubt that the use of music in this movie was in any way intended to boost soundtrack sales, as was indicated by another reviewer - it is not a tactic employed often by talented and credible directors. Speaking of music, Wes Anderson is known for creating incredible and appropriate soundtracks. Try listening to the lyrics and comparing them to what is happening in the film. The details have significance.I am sorry that this movie was not the boisterous comedy that some people wanted, but if they had done a little (gasp) reading or checked out some previous films by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, they would have surely realized that their movies are more dramatic and serious than most comedies. Also, much of the humor in these films is in the situations and characters themselves, not in one-liners, and much of that goes unnoticed to some moviegoers. I am assuming that this will not change anybody's mind on the film, but maybe it will help you to sort out whether it is worth your time and money to go see The Royal Tenenbaums. My advice: if you enjoy watching blockbuster movies with illiterate actors and nine-figure production budgets, skip it; but if you really appreciate film, go see it right now.</fullReview>

It's impossible to get"lost" in this movie, but maybe that's intended. Great actors do the best the can, but it's a shame to see that much talent go to waste.

Although I'm not generally impressed with Miss Paltrow's body of work, with both Ben Stiller &amp; Bill Murray in the cast, I mistakenly thought this "comedy" would be a winner. And poor Danny Glover, he obviously received some misguided career advice. Apparently, according to some of the other reviewers on this database, I just don't get it (and neither did the 4 others in my group). But when a movie is highly touted as the best comedy (of the year, decade, century), I expect laughs. At the very least, a few giggles, smirks, grins. Nope. Even throwing a "dark comedy" label on the movie--and adjusting your expectations accordingly--wouldn't save this one.

After ?Bottle Rocket' and the irresistible ?Rushmore'; he delivers never before seen bravura performances from his entire cast as he weaves a daunting portrayal of one of the most dysfunctional cinematic families in a long time. Gene Hackman plays Royal Tennenbaum with incredible zest. After discovering he is suffering from a life-threatening disease, he therefore sets out and attempts at reuniting with his estranged family. His estranged children were all once child prodigies and now all live dysfunctional lives attributed to his abandonment when his former wife (Anjelica Huston) requested a divorce. Among Royal's prodigies include Ben Stiller who plays Chas. An arrogant and security?obsessed father with a bb gun bullet lodged in his hand who constantly fears for the safety of his two young look alike boys. Luke Wilson plays Richie; a tennis master who suffered from a meltdown due to an unattainable attraction. Then there is the adopted daughter, a seemingly empty Margot Helen (played with perfect bleak gloominess by Gwyneth Paltrow). Adopted from the age of two, this adventuress is an award-winning playwright who attributes her unsatisfactory life to her adopted father's introducing her as ?My adopted daughter?' Each of these complex and detailed characters is conveniently introduced through Anderson's introductory musical montage sequence where in a matter of moments we are introduced to the cast. Included in this constellation of prestigious actors are Owen Wilson as Eli and a fully bearded Bill Murray as Raleigh St. Clair, an amusing doctor who consistently mopes around with his favourite experimental patient. It is important to understand that this not a straight forward drama nor a laugh out loud comedy. In its' fullest essence; this alternative film is an endearing, touching, dark and anti-clinical observation of a dysfunctional family and how its' members inter-relate. The true beauty of this film lies primarily in the subtle manner in which this overwhelming amount of information is presented. The previous paragraph may seem contradictorial to many but in viewing the film analytically, this film at its' core is really about renewing lost family values. The primary difference lies in Anderson's off-kilter storytelling perspectives that flawlessly blend drama and comedy while displaying this renewal. That is where many may spot an unfavourable trait. Anderson's films in the past have spread upon two extremities. Those who understand his films and those who gawk at what seems like banter. While it isn't as aggressive as his two previous films, this piece is a tender one at heart. Yet, while I will state that ?Rushmore' is still my favourite Anderson film, this film will be heralded as a great follow-up. ?The Royal Tennenbaums' is delicately developed and lets the characters tell the story rather than events. Also noteworthy is Anderson's ability to blend music with imagery to evoke emotion. Along the likes of Cameron Crowe and the musical offerings in his films, Anderson presents us with some classic tunes that protrude through the screen with emotion in order to make us fully understand the range of emotions these characters undergo. Through flashbacks, we see what these children really were and we see how and why their father's abandonment caused their decay in which the hatred is based upon. Through a delicate unravelling of all these three prodigies' inner most secrets, we see that there is much more than their simple, grim appearance. This is where Anderson's genius can be found. From a script by Anderson and Owen Wilson (Eli), we can see that these characters are not the sort of people one would run into everyday. Their appearance is slightly off, their wardrobe is slightly off and their genuine affection or dislike of their father is so pure that it seeps through the screen and provides us with a thorough understanding. These are all various elements of Anderson's slightly off kilter and subtle piece about this dysfunctional family. The term alternative is used because with every film, Anderson seems to concoct and carry forward with a unique and alternative. This film is divided into chapters. With narration by Alec Baldwin, the film divides into an introduction, as well as chapters and an epilogue. In viewing closely the first words in each chapter reading, one can see that the words describe the exact opening scene of that segment of the film, which provides a fresh tactic in developing the style and tone of the film. In appreciating this film, there will be an objective and subjective viewpoint. Those who lean on the objective and classify the film for its' script, style and movement will probably be turned off by Anderson's alternative ways. Yet those who view the film in a subjective manner and attach themselves to this film personally will find the film quite nostalgic and satisfying. That is the feeling I received after exiting the screening. For evidence, one needs to replay the final sequence at a burial in the film where the family is once again reunited. The characters are together in a display of remorse, affection and finally admiration. And those who understand this film will have nothing but that for Anderson's affectionate family study.Giancarlo's rating: **1/2 (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the year's best movies. Everyone who was in it and worked on this knew what they were doing. The cast was great and the crew did a well earned job.Alec Baldwin plays the narrator in this comedic masterpiece. And he tells a story about a family. In this family you have Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), Elaine Tenenbaum (Angelica Houston), Margot Tenenbaum (Gywenth Paltrow), Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson), and Chaz Tenenbaum (Ben Stiller). And Henry Serman (Danny Glover) and Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) are close friends of the family. And to finish this wonderful cast up, you have Bill Muarry as Raleigh St. Clair. With his sidekick Dudley.You don't want to miss this masterpiece. This movie is about comedy alright. To me Wes ANDERSON did better on this movie than Rushmore and Bottle Rocket (no offense). He just knew what he was doing. Well, like Eli Cash said, "I wish I was a Tenenbaum."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My biggest disappointment of 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of each year, I do a quick overview of the coming releases, and in 2001, The Royal Tenenbaums most certainly made my 'most anticipated' list. Written and directed by the same people who put out the brilliant Rushmore three years ago, and Bottle Rocket before that, the pedigrees were in place for a brilliant followup.Royal Tenenbaum (played by Gene Hackman) is the head of an estranged family, curiously full of child prodigies, who brings them all together when he announces he is terminally ill. The cast in this film is stellar. Angelica Huston as his ex-wife, Danny Glover as her new boyfriend, Ben Stiller, Gwynneth Paltrow and Luke Wilson as their children, how can you possibly go wrong?&lt;polite pause&gt;Well, I don't know either, but somehow, somewhere, this movie lost its' way. Despite (very) occasional moments of brilliance, for the most part, I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of them. Unfortunately if you're going to try and tell a clever, witty, character-driven family dramedy, that's just a death sentence. For the better part of two hours, the movie just plods along, never really doing anything, or showing us anything interesting in these many people's lives.And that's a shame, because with the talent available in this film, the Tenenbaums could have been one hell of an amusing family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Living in Harrisburg PA I don't get a chance to see many movies before they open nationwide, but The Royal Tenenbaums was well worth the wait for wide release. Most movies fail to live up to their expectations, but The Royal Tenenbaums was above and beyond what I expected. I'm a loyal fan of Wes Anderson, Rushmore, etc.. and I'll be the first to admit that not everyone is going to like this.. as you'll see from the mixed reviews his movies receive, but if you liked Rushmore or Bottle Rocket, or want something a little offbeat, check this out.So many things are perfect in this movie.. the humor that only half the audience could laugh at, the scene changes, the sets, the queer artwork, the development of the characters. Wow. I wish everyone could find this movie enjoyable and make it amazingly successful, but at the same time I'm glad that in a way it's mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit that this film was not the best movie I have ever seen, but it is the best movie that I have seen in a long time. I would have to agree with the other viewers, though, if you are a big fan of the Wes Anderson/Owen Wilson writing team, this film will not disappoint, otherwise you may just not 'get it'. That's ok too, there are lots of movies other people love that I just don't 'get' either. But, in the last month I have seen 4 or 5 movies that other people raved about, including Harry Potter (cute, but too long!), Lord of the Rings (cool, but waaaaay too long!) and Vanilla Sky (incredibly, insultingly, degradingly way way way too long). I think that, among its peer films of the season, RT shines. This movie had a lot of character development, although, I could have seen more of Bill Murray and 'Dudley' and I can always see more of Owen Wilson!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I already wrote a little snippet (don't know if it was published or not) of what I thought about the movie. However I realize now, after reading some of the other comments that that may not suffice. I don't think many of the people writing these comments have even seen any of Wes' other films, or would even want to, for that matter. Some of you can see brilliance when it's in front of you. you are the ones that say, `Wow, Thomas Edison, that was just genius. Electricity will change the world.' The rest of you just sit back and say, `Yippee, what the hell do we need that for.' Now I know that is a terribly exaggerated analogy, but I'm cramped for time, and I'm trying to make a point. For those of you who just don't get The Royal Tenenbaums, just think about the movie for a bit, you might start to realize that it's more of a play than a movie, and who knows you might actually get some of Wes', and Owen's brand of humor. It's not in-your-face fall down gags (except maybe one or two) or mindless sexual-innuendos, it's more `intelligent' humor. I don't mean to classify any type of humor as better than another, but in Tenenbaums, you just have to read between the lines - you have to think. The jokes are present - they are definitely there, you just have to listen. For example, all of the characters kept the same clothes, adding to the caricature-like portrayal of each person, thus giving the viewer a better understanding of each personality in a very short amount of time. One of my favorite things about Anderson's films is the behavior of each character; it's the same type of funny that you see when you sit back and look at life in general. It's obvious by many of the reviews that I've been seeing, that several people just don't get that type of humor though. However, to those people, I'd just like to say, `Keep trying, eventually you'll get it.' Look at all the big stars that have fallen victim to loving that type of amusement: Gene Hackman, Bill Murray, Danny Glover, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Seymour Cassel, Alec Baldwin, Jason Schwartzman, and obviously Luke, Owen, and Andrew Wilson. One might say, well everybody makes a bad movie now and then, but if that were the case, why would they keep coming back? I think movies need something lately. people are making movies left and right, and most are good. However, good isn't something we should strive for, movies should be great, and movies should be different. Wes Anderson show's the movie industry what it should strive to be. He uses vibrant colors and beautiful scenery to make memorable settings. His musical choices are so fitting to the movie and it's respective moods (contrasting with most movies now-a-days that just throw in some songs that are popular to sell the soundtrack, or cheap shots like the very African-American music played throughout the whole movie Ali with little regard to the mood or tempo of the movie). Combining Wes' artistic approach at sight and sound with his extraordinary use of dialogue and behavioral antics he makes the movie so pleasurable to the eyes, ears, and everything else you can think of. To all the fans that have loved Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson's films so far: thanks for the support, you helped put out one of my new favorite movies of all time (which I drove 2 hours each way to Philadelphia, 3 days in a row and once more after that, just to see this piece of classic cinema history).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes and Owen Strike Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the past year, I have been waiting patiently to see The Royal Tenenbaums. Like most movie geeks, both Bottle Rocket and Rushmore are on my short list of favorite movies. Finally I was given the pleasure of attending what, without a doubt, will be hailed as one of the best movies of all time. Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, the comic and dramatic geniuses behind Bottle Rocket and Rushmore have outdone themselves with The Royal Tenenbaums. The movie is both humorous and touching, light and dark, and just all-around fabulous. I will admit, at first I had my doubts about the cast. What made the first two movies so good was the mix of the unknown (Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson in Bottle Rocket, Jason Schwartzman in Rushmore) and the well-known (James Caan in Bottle Rocket and Bill Murray in Rushmore). To hear that the cast included such mega-stars as Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston and Gwyneth Paltrow did not sit well with me at first. But, I can admit that I was dead wrong. There could not have been a better cast for the film. Gene Hackman, at 71, plays the role of a lifetime. After he wins the Academy Award, Royal Tenenbaum will always appear in any story about him. Luke Wilson is amazing in the film, and after watching his performance, I am upset that the media has not given him his due for the part. The set decorations are amazing. I have never seen so much color and detail in so many shots in one film. The ambiance of the sets is what gives the film its edge. The Royal Tenenbaums is a 10 in my book. The perfect movie. I just can't wait to see what Wes and Owen come up with next. I'm on the edge of my seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a cast - what a script - what a topic! Just when you thought they'd done the dysfunctional family genre to death, this gem pops onto the screen. It answers the question: What happens to a family when everyone (everyone!) is an enormous talent? There are more symbols in this movie than St. Patrick's Cathedral. Stay alert, right down to the color of the sweatsuits at movie's end. The pup-tent, the sunglasses, the cigarettes... a symbol's worth a 1,000 words, and their volume cuts the script effectively in half if you catch them all. Wes and Owen better get nominated for the writing, else / unforgivable! But stay alert. You're bound to miss a few if 'one viewing only' is your intention.The cast: Great! Hackman, Huston, Stiller, Paltrow, Wilson x 2, Glover and Murray! Are you kidding me? Each: At the top of their game, character acting an eccentric role to the knees. There's even a guy actually named Brian Tenenbaum in it, probably a Wes Anderson inside-joke (B.T. is a paramedic).It's a sophisticated comedy. If you liked "A Fish Called Wanda", you'll love it. If you can't get past "Animal House" for laughs, sit this one out. 7 / 10. Now lean back and wait for the TV Series, which will surely come.</fullReview>

From the assassin east indian butler to the amazingly bizzare physciartist (played by Bill Murray) you just laugh at how crazy this movie is.There is a lot more to this movie than star power and I highly recommend it to anyone who is bored of movies that rely on ridiculous slapstick (eg. not another teen movie) to get a laugh from the audience.a 10/10 in my book</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Royal MessWith such a stellar cast, it is hard to imagine that the movie could fail. Veteran stars Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston, and Billy Crystal, supported by proved stars Gwenyth Paltrow and Ben Stiller, cannot spark enough on screen chemistry to carry this eccentric film. Wonderfully narrated by Alec Baldwin, the film commences by introducing us to the Tenebaum family. Far from being Royal, the three children, played by Paltrow, stiller and up and coming Luke Wilson, apparently were heralded as geniuses and enjoyed notability in their youth. Baldwin narrates the ups and downs of the children's lives, but the film doesn't fully take form until the three thirty-something children end up living back at home. Hackman plays Royal, the patriarch of a family he abandoned long ago. Finding himself broke and homeless as well as wanting to prevent his wife (they have been separated for years, but never divorced) form marrying her accountant (Danny Glover), Royal feigns illness and moves back into Tenenbaum home. The film's best asset is that Paltrow shines in her role as Margot, the adopted daughter and once known play write. This movie was as tab for Paltrow to establish herself as a serious actress, one with range, poise and intelligence. She won the Oscar race against Cate Blanchette, but hasn't made the careful choices Blanchette has made, and effectively Paltrow has become a more mainstream Hollywood celebrity. In this role, she demonstrates the range and composure that won her the Oscar for Shakespeare in Love. We forget about her performance in this summer's dismal Shallow Hal, and she truly makes us believe that a film with her name on it should be worth the view. In fact, the acting in the film was superb throughout the film. And why wouldn't it be with such an accomplished cast? Unfortunately, the chemistry between the characters in the play didn't mix. Each actor played his or her part extremely well, but these eclectic characters proved too eclectic for one another. The relationships were not believable, and the film lacked any fluidity. Aside from a few rather funny segments, the audience fidgeted and checked their watches. Even the laugh out loud parts of the film were a detriment to the overall film. They only prove how hilarious the movie could have been. The film was full of `could have beens.' With such incredible potential, the film crashes and burns. Its quirkiness and often clever humor remind us of director Wes Anderson's other films Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, but the originality of those two movies is not apparent in Tenebaums. The movie, presented like a book, and feeling like a play, drones one slowly, with subtle humour and often too clever jokes that mainstream audiences miss. Though at times enjoyable, the film fizzles and the when the credits finally rolled, the audience gave a sigh of relief.</fullReview>

What was missing, though, was that person letting the audience in on the secret. What drives each of these people? Angelica Houston and Danny Glover seemed to be there to fill time--we never learn anything about them. Chas is obviously driven, but why? And why is he driven 20 years after our "introduction"--is he still selling spotted mice? Is he doing anything? Are those people setup in his room just for his own ego? And what the heck is up with the sweatsuit? Margot felt rejected as a child, and so never established a real relationship with a man. Tired. I've seen that before. Richie (was that his name? it's never a good sign when I can't remember a primary character's name) played tennis, but was in love with his sister (YUCK!). Apparently that disgusting revelation is supposed to make things interesting. The only character that is fleshed out is Royal. But even he seems to flip flop a lot--there was no definate progression from sleazebag to decent guy.I'll admit, I'm not into dark comedies. Maybe that's what I'm missing. But something definately slipped by me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what it's cracked up to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After weeks of previews for The Royal Tenenbaums and all the great reviews, I waited anxiously for the movie to finally be released. The story seemed interesting, and the impressive cast lured me to believe this would be an excellent movie. Gene Hackman and Angelica Huston are Royal and Etheline Tenenbaum, with Ben Stiller (Chas), Gwyneth Paltrow (Margot), and Luke Wilson (Richie) as the 3 "genius" Tenenbaum children. Also with Owen Wilson as Richie's friend Eli Cash. So I came in with pretty high expectations. The movie began very slowly, documenting the early days of the Tenenbaum family when the children were at a young age, with Alec Baldwin narrating. I kept waiting for there to be a point when the movie would get rolling. But there never really was that point. It just dragged on with an occasional joke that would be sort of funny but not that funny. As the plot twisted and turned along the way, there was never a point throughout the movie that you could really embrace the characters. It was like they were just a bunch of boring people standing around. I could go video tape a bunch of people standing around doing nothing for two hours and it'd probably have the same effect as this movie. However, there was one bright spot in my opinion, and that would be the performance by Gene Hackman. He did a terrific job of playing the old grumpy man trying to get back on the side of his kids whom he'd treated like garbage their whole lives. Gwyneth was OK, but her character Margot had absolutely no personality and therefore dragged the movie down. And Ben Stiller was hardly entertaining, his two boys were fun though.I seriously almost walked out of the theater in the middle of this one. This movie had so much potential, but it dragged on so much that there didn't seem to be any point to sitting through the whole thing. Besides Gene Hackman, there's not much reason to see this except for maybe curiosity. But if you are looking for entertainment, you might as well forget this one.I'll give it *1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

And why is he driven 20 years after our "introduction"--is he still selling spotted mice? Is he doing anything? Are those people setup in his room just for his own ego? And what the heck is up with the sweatsuit? Margot felt rejected as a child, and so never established a real relationship with a man. Tired. I've seen that before. Richie (was that his name? it's never a good sign when I can't remember a primary character's name) played tennis, but was in love with his sister (YUCK!). Apparently that disgusting revelation is supposed to make things interesting. The only character that is fleshed out is Royal. But even he seems to flip flop a lot--there was no definate progression from sleazebag to decent guy.I'll admit, I'm not into dark comedies. Maybe that's what I'm missing. But something definately slipped by me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Evolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have simply done it again. From Bottle Rocket, to Rushmore, then to The Royal Tenebaums, they have both proceded along the road to creating a gradiose movie. Not only does The Royal Tenebaums exhibit the cooky dark humor found in Bottle Rocket, but it also displays the deep emotionality of Rushmore. One thing new to Wes and Owen's film experimentation is the increased vast uniqueness of characterization. Although The Royal Tenebaums has an unbelievable cast, the characters are special due to physical and emotional behavior. The movie is a sucess. Both directors, and all the actors participating have made this movie a enjoyable outing to the theatre. The movie has all the qualities which makes a Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson films' appeasing. Not only does the humor evoke giggles and chuckles from everyone, but it also has an element of deep emotion which shows an evolution by the directors, because this was not a resource found in their other films. There is not only the craziness of Bottle Rocket, but a message concerning family, which is deep, astounding, and emotionally stirring. I love this film and want Wes, Owen, and all the actors that they have employed over these three films to keep on being so creative because it is humorous and brings a good feeling out whenever somone sees these films. By the way, once again, there is another soundtrack which massages my ears and stimulates my mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I am not a Gwyneth fan. But I do have to say I loved her in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. Anyway, I love this movie. I loved Rushmore and couldn't wait to see this movie. Needless to say, I was NOT dissapointed. The humor was awesome and Gene Hackman had me rolling! I mean he could really nail his lines and I was very proud of his work in this movie. I was boo hoo crying at the end of the movie too, because I really felt a strong admiration for his character. I mean, don't get me wrong, Royal (Gene) was a punk, but in the end I think he really redeems his character. I do have to say that the movie was perfectly cast and Gwyneth and Angelica really shined in the movie. They had very important roles in the movie and they each stole the scenes when they appeared. I was amazed that Wes Anderson (director) and Owen Wilson wrote the movie. I didn't realize that Owen was that talented and also helped to write Rushmore. I truly recommend this movie and I can't wait to buy it on DVD. Without giving anything away, I like the ending and I felt a strong sense of resolution with all the characters. This is a huge achievement considering there was so many characters in the movie. Go out and watch this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me Shout the Word SUBTLE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to agree with Patrick Brogan from Arizona on the remarkable job that Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson did on bringing together The Royal Tenenbaums. However, I do think that Patrick neglected to talk about the subtle humor that Wes Anderson is famous for writing and Owen Wilson is famous for delivering. Wilson's "... and rightly so." during the scene with Richie is a classic example of the Anderson/Wilson connection. Every question a character asks requires a specific answer, yet the answers that every character gives are extremely ambiguous. This is what I find makes not only Tenenbaums, but Rushmore and Bottle Rocket as well, fresh and long needed writing styles that make the minutiae of films leap out at you. A welcome change to the repetitious catchphrases that are always in your face and more often than not, become annoying more than funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is about a family of genuises. Each one with his or her own gift or talent. Richie, for example, was a pro tennis player as a pre-teen, Margot, a playwright at a similiar age. Each returns home, and finds their father, Royal, to be on his deathbed. Since I can't mention story spoilers I won't go any further with the plot. Critcs have deemed the film a "cheap, art house flick"...I beg to differ.

		<shortDescription>Best Wes so far...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting patiently for director Anderson's follow-up to the brilliant and subtle "Rushmore", and the wait for "The Royal Tenenbaums" has been well worth it. In short, everything that made "Rushmore" such a classic is seen in a different and yet wholly familiar form here in the new movie, and to an incredible effect. Gene Hackman displays wonderful comic timing and brings a very sly, sometimes understated take to the paternal character of Royal that is brilliant. Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson also both shine in their respective roles, with Luke getting to flesh out a larger part then he has had in many of his more recent roles since "Bottlerocket". He brings a very likable air to his tormented character, as does his brother. The scenes between the two of them are priceless nuggets of humor. "Rushmore" fans will also be happy to see Mr. Littlejeans, Max's math professor, and, of course, Bill Murray, who may have been a little under-utilized this time. Max's dad also makes an appearance, and he finally gets to be a doctor, sort of. From a technical standpoint, Anderson brings along many great ideas used in "Rushmore" including extended expository sequences, montages, and unique transitional mechanisms (in this case treating the movie as chapters in a book with Anderson's own illustrations at the beginning of each), and expanded them across a broad canvas, inhabited by the wonderful Tenenbaum family. The editing of this movie was also exceptional. If you liked "Rushmore", this is a must-see movie, but then again you were probably going to see it anyway. Rest assured that it expands on Anderson's unique visual vocabulary and infectious good humor, even while it explores many of the same painful subjects that his other films have, all to wonderful effect. I really do think this could be a masterpiece, but since we are so lucky to have many years of Wes Anderson ahead of us, it would be foolish to be in any hurry to call it such at this point. You just have to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why anybody would call this movie hilarious. I saw it, and I laughed maybe once during the whole thing. Actually, I can't say that, because it was so bad that I walked out in the middle of it. The plot went nowhere, there were scenes that contributed absolutely nothing, and it really seemed like nothing but a bunch of wackos feeling sorry for themselves.I really expected a better movie considering the cast. Bill Murray's talents as a comedic actor were wasted, in the part that I stayed to watch, he never did anything remotely funny. Danny Glover's part also contributed nothing. A few days earlier I saw Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson in "Behind Enemy Lines," and both of them were much better in that movie than in this one. Hackman's character was the only one who ever changed his facial expression.I sincerely hope that this movie receives none of the awards that people say it deserves.</fullReview>

It is not "incredible", and it certainly is not "The best movie of the year". Yikes. Wes Anderson, while being a very GOOD director/writer, is not the greatest thing since Orson Welles. Just because we want someone to be great like that doesn't mean there exists such a person and we cannot label someone who is, I grant you, very original, that mantra when he clearly does not yet deserve it. We'll see what he can do outside of quirky dramedies. Moving on... This film is moving up to Memento-grade overrated status.

		<fullReview>It's very refreshing to see something this unusual coming out of a major studio these days.... Quirky and imaginative are two words that come to mind and in many ways this was not so different than Wes Anderson's Rushmore and Bottle Rocket. But at the same time this film has a certain compassion that his other films lacked. In any case this movie is filled with cool stuff to look and laugh at as it tells a story that seems to be about family, forgiveness. Wes Anderson has put together a great ( star stunted ) cast and pulled off the difficult task of making the best of their talent while keeping strong his fresh yet offbeat style. Many may complain that this is no Rushmore but it is still very good. One can only hope that Wes Anderson will have a job in movies for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You want interesting?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. After 12 months of mostly boring, formulaic movies, I am thrilled to recommend "The Royal Tenenbaums". Writer/Director Wes Anderson ("Rushmore", "Bottle Rocket") may have joined the ranks of the Farrelly Brothers for creating interesting and unique stories and characters. I do hope the story lines tighten up a bit in the future, but the thrill of watching interesting (often bizarre) characters overcomes any story telling short comings. Take heed that the Pacing in this movie is unlike any other. Sometimes it appears that an entire scene is based on a shrug or a single word. Anderson seems to have a hand-picked group of cronies that stick close together. Throw in veterans like Hackman, Angleica Huston and Danny Glover and you can't help but realize this is cool. Yes the narrator is Alec Baldwin and if you don't realize this until the credits, then you need to see more movies. I couldn't help but marvel at Gwyneth Paltrow's character and her eternal state of melancholy. She is proving to be the real deal and not some princess like Julia Roberts. Excellent turns by Ben Stiller and Bill Murray, along with the Owens brothers make the ensemble cast a thing of offbeat beauty. Whether this is a very dramatic movie with some hilarious moments or a an offbeat comedy with a dramatic foundation, I cannot say. But it is VERY interesting and entertaining filmmaking ... and I have been starving for this all year. By the way, does anyone know who Brian Tenenbaum is? He is credited as playing a paramedic. Is this a childhood friend of Andersons? Just curious!</fullReview>

Even the music is dirge like, which adds to the film's major flaws, a lack of consistent writing and directing. It's like owning a stable of racehorses and all you can do is ram them into each other aimlessly. Bill Murray and Gene Hackman could have mailed their performances in.

		<fullReview>Well, every review I"ve read of this movie heralded it as fresh and unique beyond most of what's in theaters....I went into the theater with my expectations downgraded from that (since most of what passes for masterworks these days is just mediocre), so I wasn't terribly disappointed. It's got a lot of funny moments, the cinematography is beautiful, as are the NYC area locations, which are used in a really unique way. The cast is game, and overall, it was fun to watch, and the scenarios were, indeed, set apart from your usual movie fare. But that's as the movie was intended: Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson wrote it to be quirky and off-the-beaten path, so anything short of "different" would have been an abject failure.In short, this movie was a fun way to pass some time...But nowhere near as great as the reviewers' praise would have you believe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another truly magnificent work by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson -- not to mention the excellent cast. Without going into detail about the story or characters -- though loads could be written -- I'll just take a moment to comment on the cinematography, which was superb. I don't know how he does it, but Wes Anderson manages to frame and shoot films that feel almost like Renaissance paintings -- the frame is full, but balanced between foreground and background, vibrant colors contrasting in different parts of the frame, with an almost obsessive attention to detail and nuance that fill out the main focal point of the shot. How he manages to integrate this technique into the film, without pulling you out of the narrative or being gimmicky (later-day Scorsese, I'm looking your direction), I cannot describe or understand, but he does manage it. Once again, Wes Anderson has managed to combine a vibrant, moving and very funny story with exquisite artistry in film-making.My only regret is that we have to wait 2 years for another new film. At least there is the Criterion DVD to look forward to!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW. After reading all these reviews, I think everyone will fit into one of these groups after seeing "The Royal Tenenbaums":A) You will love this movie with all your heart. Not for the humor, or the people starring in it, but for the wonderfully filmed details, the subtle nuiances of the script, and the unique 'environment' that Wes Anderson created in this little world. Each actor is slotted into a specific character for a reason, and portays them to perfection.B) You will be disappointed, because you were expecting a slapstick comedy after seeing the previews, and don't have the flexibility to change gears and simply recognize good moviemaking. You probably thought 'Rush Hour 2' was a good film.C) You will complain that it isn't as good as RUSHMORE or BOTTLE ROCKET. Come on! Don't base it against those classics. Base it against the other 1,000+ movies that have come out over the past three years. This one certainly ranks high, considering the excellent balance of emotion, visual artistry, humor, and HEART that you were fortunate to sit through for two hours.We should all go to the movies demanding QUALITY entertainment for our $8, and the entire crew gave us just that. Their love and caring shows throughout. If you enjoyed it, then I think you are someone who understands that gems like this should be appreciated for what they are, and thanked God you weren't spending your money and time on another "Pearl Harbor" or "Saving Silverman".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rushmore was staged like one of its protagonist's plays. The Royal Tenenbaums, from the same director and writers, is instead a novel, complete with chapters and a narrator (Alec Baldwin). Even more than Rushmore, a quirky film to be sure, I'm not quite clear of my feelings about the movie. It has some very big laughs, but I don't think it's much of a comedy. It's more like a very serious movie with some funny moments in it. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) is the despicable patriarch of a bizarre family of genius, who live in a gorgeous house in a version of New York, with old taxis and phones, that only exists in this movie. He is kicked out of the house when his three children are still young, and they have to cope with growing up without a father, and with their status as revered prodigies. Twenty odd years later all the kids are screwed up, and they all move back into the old house with their mother (Anjelica Huston). Royal tries to worm his way back into their lives with unusual results.Rushmore's hero, Max Fisher, was a brilliant playright who didn't fit with society. The Royal Tenenbaums is like watching a movie with five or six Max Fishers. Chas (Ben Stiller), is an accounting wiz, Richie (Luke Wilson) is a former tennis great, and Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) is another brilliant playright. But they are all messed up; Chas is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, Richie had a shadowy one a few years back, and Margot is eternally sullen. Add to this scene after scene of failure, terrible parenting, possible incest, suicide attempts, drug use, and death of both man and animal, and you don't really get the typical mixture for comedy. But the movie has genuine moments of comedy. Owen Wilson's performance as a friend of the Tenenbaums is constantly bizarre and often very funny. Royal is a terrible father, yet he is so good-humored and ready with a smile thanks to a great performance by Hackman, that you can help chuckle along with him at all his bad deeds. And the biggest and best gag is at Richie's crucial tennis match, with great physical comedy from Luke Wilson.Shifting the pieces of this thing around in my head writing this, I still don't quite know what to make of it. I laughed, and in a few of the scenes at the end, I was genuinely moved by the performances of Hackman and Stiller. But the complaint that it's "needlessly quirky" is probably true, and some of the weirder eccentricities (Like Bill Murray's character's experiment subject) don't pan out, and neither do some of the techniques used to shoot the movie (Nearly all dialogue scenes are shot with the character dead center of frame looking at the camera...I wish I could understand why!). And the New York of the film is cute at points, but it does grate; I kept wishing the Gypsy Cab company had more than the two cars that are seen in the movie over a dozen times.I guess I'm resigned to say that it's an interesting, if uneven, movie that you should see for yourself and try out. Maybe not on the big screen, but this movie should be seen. Great or terrible, it's far more involving than most movies I've seen this year, and deserves to be viewed for that reason at the very least.</fullReview>

But Anderson's latest film, The Royal Tenenbaums, is his first to truly embrace the quiet, melancholy mood that his two previous films showed flashes of, and it fills his off-kilter universe with an emotional resonance those earlier efforts lacked.Presented like a book and feeling even more like a play, The Royal Tenenbaums is imbued throughout with a low-key tone of sadness and pain, but it never gets depressing. The characters are so specifically realized, and each of the actors perfectly suited to play them, that the somewhat morose feel of the story might have weighed down a production less in love with its own environment. But Anderson's flamboyant style and obvious attachment to the subject matter and atmosphere remain intact and prevent the story from getting crushed under its own weight. Like his first two movies, Anderson co-wrote the screenplay, about an estranged father of a family of geniuses who attempts to get back into his children's lives after a prolonged absence, with Owen Wilson. The pair are so attuned to each other's sensibilities, and have cast actors equally equipped to portray the oddball characters, that barely a note rings untrue.The cast is superb, from Gene Hackman in a career-best performance as father Royal, all the way down to Anderson regular Kumar (stealing nearly every scene he's in) as Pagoda, the Tenenbaum family servant who aids Royal in his scheme to win back his family. Portraying the once-celebrated children, now fully grown and scarred with emotional traumas from a childhood spent as the son of their careless, magnificent bastard of a father, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and Gwyneth Paltrow come through admirably. Paltrow plays skillfully against type as a somber, emotionally insecure young woman crushed by her father's indifference (she is the family's lone adopted member, a point that Royal made sure to mention when introducing her) as a child; Wilson trades his everyman joviality for a bit of wounded reticence, and his expressive eyes and hangdog expression are the perfect depiction of the film's subdued feelings; only Stiller sinks into his familiar mannerisms as perhaps the most overtly off-the-wall character, a widower still crushed by his wife's recent death and now obsessed with protecting his two children (scene-stealers themselves) from any and all possible dangers. Bill Murray, fresh off his triumph in Anderson's Rushmore, has a much smaller role this time around, but his wit and delivery liven up some of the film's most tangential scenes.The film opens with a superb, rapid-fire montage introducing us to each member of the Tenenbaum family, with Alec Baldwin delivering voice-over narration. Luke Wilson's Richie was a star tennis player until a spectacularly funny breakdown at a national tournament; Stiller's Chaz was a financial wiz by age 12 but couldn't escape from his father, who once inexplicably shot him with a bb gun during a childhood game; and Paltrow's Marge was a young playwright who shared a connection with Richie but grew up to flit between countless sexual encounters, desperately seeking the approval her father never gave her. Owen Wilson has a role as Eli, a childhood neighbor who always wished he were a part of the Tenenbaum clan and continued to send his press clippings and college report cards to Ethel Tenenbaum, the mother of the clan, played warmly by Anjelica Huston.The detail heaped upon each character is immense, and may, to detractors, appear a bit superficial. But although there are a lot of people to get to know and only two hours in which to do so, the characters are so fully realized and affectionately rendered by the director and cast that they all succeed as three-dimensional portrayals. And, like in Rushmore, the quirks are there; just look at Danny Glover's bow-tied, purple-suited landlord Henry, who with his white goatee and kind, dignified manner is the film's most together character. His proposal to Etheline sets the plot in motion. Anderson and Owen Wilson share a wonderful sense of humor and it shines in this picture, but just as the somber tone is tempered by the brilliant dialogue and absurdly pertinent comic situations (all of the humor is character based and not in any way at the expense of, or superfluous to, the plot), the hurt behind the humor, and the depth of emotion felt by the family members, is never overwhelmed by the laughs. The film is grounded in some real emotion, and by the final act, it gets downright touching.Visually, Anderson is a master. His frames are loaded with detail and perfectly constructed, from color to props to placement; his shots are impeccable and lend the film an air of artistry not available to most current filmmakers. His choice of music accentuates the melancholy tone of the film (from The Velvet Underground to the Rolling Stones), and his ability to layer so much information into just one shot is astonishing.The Royal Tenenbaums is a big film, but one with a small, deeply felt emotional center. A lot of the situations are bizarre, and the characters are not your run-of-the-mill creations, but they all ring true and the pain through which they are navigating comes through loud and clear. When all is said and done, The Royal Tenenbaums is not only the funniest movie of the year, but also the sharpest, and most unexpectedly tender depiction of a modern family to come along in some time. The Lord of the Rings might be the biggest movie of this holiday season, but The Royal Tenenbaums is the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film's artistic achievement depends on color. The film is like a long painting. The color packed into each scene is remarkable. So expressive and beautiful, it gives justice to the complexities of the Tenenbaum family. color acts in all human life; Wes and his team control it for the purpose of the cinema, a story with a soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blech..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seldom walk out on a movie, but after this movie had gone on badly for about an hour, then launched into another one of it's stupid flashbacks, I just had to go. Let me tell you why.First of all, this movie was advertised on TV as having big comedic stars in it: Ben Stiller, Bill Murray, Gene Hackman, guys who have laid down some pretty credible comedic acting in their day. The tone of the TV commercials is that the movie Tenenbaums is a barrel of laughs, a comedy basically, so you're set up to go in and have a good time with it. Then what happens. You go to the theatre, pay your $9.75 and get treated to a piece of junk film that has big stars and little else.The movie starts out by describing the main characters, but the characters make no sense. For example, one of the characters is a Tenenbaum kid who starts a business breeding mice with spots on them. Another becomes a big tennis star as a child then loses it and starts sailing around the world on a ship, still wearing his tennis headband. The characters are so completely unbelievable that they have to be taken as not realistic. OK, I think, if they aren't realistic, they must not make sense on purpose, to be funny, or to be symbolic of something, or must be caricatures of something. They must have some kind of meaning. But no, oh woeful viewer, they don't. They are just a collection of odd weirdnesses that add up to nothing! Is that the point? Nothingness? As in Jean-Paul Sarte nothingness? Nothingness with meaning? No, not even, dear viewer, the characters are just nothing at all, no depth, no meaning, they have nothing to tell us or each other.OK, well, what about simple comedy? Is there some comedy here?The movie tries to be funny I think, but no. Is it funny that Gwyneth Paltrow is married to Bill Murray and hides her smoking habit from him? Is it funny that their dialogue is short, perfunctory, inane? No it is not. That's just one little example of the not-funniness of this. None of it's funny; there is no comedy here: no interpersonal comedy, no physical comedy, no jokes, no clever innuendos, no nothing. I hate to break the news to you, Mr. Filmmaker, but it does not take any talent to write little vignettes of ridiculousness that lead us nowhere and also fail to stand alone as amusing momentitos!! Well, is it some kind of off-beat comedy, like dark comedy? No, not really. It's just a collection of odd constructions that try to pose as off-beat treats. Is a junkyard a sculpture?Well, OK, how about the plot? Is there a story here? Even an unusual one? Well, yes, there is. But, it is so drab, so lifeless, so plain stupid that it makes you want to barf. The old man Tennenbaum tries to move in on his estranged wife when she considers marrying someone else. Ho, man, what an idea! A theme is revealed! Jealousy! Possessiveness!! Male-Female Angst!! Romantic Desperation!! Great!! But no.not to be, dear viewer. The movie plot plods along like a lame Clydesdale, leaving horrific road-apples of tepid storytelling, weak characterization, unfinished business all around.How about the technical aspects? The movie was in color, but the lighting director should go back to doing black and white. The movie had a gruesome undertone of dull brown over all, and it wasn't done on purpose for the effect, because it was uneven, unpleasant, and uncinematic. Ever heard of gel filters? Color correction? Or did they limit your budget to a pack of Sylvania 100-watt incandescents and one extension cord?The only thing halfway good about this movie is the production design. The stuff that's scattered around the sets in the scenes, little things like a framed drawing of a jockstrap on the wall do slightly enliven this dying grunt of a film. Whoever did the design, bravo! But, don't waste your time, go find work on a Johnny Depp number where you can really dig your teeth into the atmosphere. You efforts are wasted on this one, baby!Finally, a word about the Big Stars. This movie is a prime example of how Big Stars cannot pull a garbage film out of the can and make a meal. The Big Star performances are good, given the material, but that all comes to naught. Anjelica Huston is especially good. Bill Murray has his moments (that's all he's given-a few precious moments to work his Murry Magic). Gwyneth Paltrow, well, Gwyneth if you're listening, the fat girl movie was lots better than this for you. I know you were doing what you were told to do, deadpanning the whole thing, but it really really sucked. Your character was a big nothing. Get out and act, show us something with some life in it. That's what we want from you talented blonde beauties. It was like watching Cameron Diaz hidden away under ugly makeup in that Being John Malkovich piece of junk-painful. We want to see you, we want to hear your song as Paul would say. Why screw around with this kind of junkola?And last but not least, Gene Hackman, what a pro. Love his Snidely Whiplash routine, love it totally. But, there's was so little meat on the table of this script that Mr. Hackman was left looking like an actor who was in a movie all by himself.When I see a movie like this, I feel cheated. My $9.75, my couple of hours, but mostly my expectations. I expect something like professionalism and theatrical responsibility when I see a movie. I don't want to be dissed by being handed a plateful of miscellaneous piece-parts and then being expected to think it's cool that way. There's no business like show business, so show me a show! Don't tell me I don't understand. You make me understand. And if you can't, you're in the wrong business brother! Above all, don't advertise a film to be a comedy with big-name stars, then shackle them to some weak material that pretends to be oddly meaningful. You aren't doing anybody any favors by that ploy! It ain't cute, it ain't cool, it's dishonest!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, so close. . . WARNING -- Some Scene Spoilers in My Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many, I have been a very serious fan of Wes Anderson and Co. -- having seen and loved both Bottle Rocket and Rushmore. Tenenbaums is a more ambitious film than the first two in that the plot tries to carry more main characters and just the overall general production is more "big budget" in its feel and look. Unfortunately, I feel Anderson bit off just SLIGHTLY more than he could chew. Most disappointingly, I didn't feel that powerful deep connection to the film or the characters that I felt with his first two films. Perhaps, it's because there were just too many lead characters and it is near impossible to draw a viewer in on so many. Additionally, some of the characters stunk. The Danny Glover character was either poorly written or poorly acted. I found it to be cliche. I was really disappointed and distracted with the stupid cheap sight gags of Glover falling in a ditch or accidentally bringing his tie to his glasses. That type of crap is meant for Saved By the Bell not for someone of Anderson's ability. I was shocked. Bill Murray was boring and flat and offered nothing to the film. Anyone could have played his role. Ben Stiller as usual, was not bad, he does have "something," but he also wasn't remarkable. On the contrary however, Gwenyth Paltrow and Luke Wilson were devastating and dead on--I was riveted whenever each was on the screen.Another gripe is that I felt Anderson tried to be a little too cute in the film with everyone's little quirks and the strange lack of time--the movie is in the present day, yet the people wear clothes from the 70s and 80s. And lack of place-- Why was New York so non-descript? Why the Gypsy cabs (which don't exist), the fake street names, etc? The matching jump suits, Luke's anachronistic 70s look, the outdated medical equipment in the house (that none of the geniuses seemed to pick up on)? I found this not believable and once again, distracting and fake. BUT, after further thought, to be fair--I realize, perhaps that is Anderson's point--to make a fantasy type world, where everything doesn't have to be "real life" to a T. I don't know though... Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, for all the extreme weirdness of their characters, still were somehow (to me at least) very believable. Where they had quirks, I believed them and was locked-in to the film, and in Tenenbaum's I was a bit distracted by these anachronisms and character quirks.Despite the gripes, Anderson is in a class by himself. I would never even be this critical of a film if the director didn't warrent my analysis time. In 3 films, Anderson has achieved an instantly recognizable style--a tremendous feat. His camera work is deep and meaningful. The scene of Margot coming off the bus while Richie is waiting, is to me, as good as film EVER gets--it destroyed me. Also, Richie's suicide scene is very powerful (and not in cheap way), nice use of Elliot Smith soundtrack and blue-ish hues to for appropriate and effective intensity. Ultimately, I would take a flawed work of a true artist and master like Anderson any day over a meticulous but "same 'ol same 'ol" spy movie, melodrama, or who-done-it by the rest of the Hollywood or indie hack directors. Anderson is an original and so Tenenbaum's is worthy of anyone's time. If his next film combines the grandeur and scope of Tenenbaums (production-wise) with a slightly sharper script and a little bit less trying to be quirky and making me laugh every second at a stupid sight gag--it will be undeniable. Rock on Wes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a lovely film. Among my favorite parts is Gwyneth Paltrow exiting the green line bus, set to "These Days" by NICO; like most scenes in Andersons' movies, the music seems to be tailor made for the image. And what about those images? Wow. Wes Anderson's flair for mis-en-scene and composition is impecable, and rivals that of Bernardo Bertolucci's.Hackman is great; even when his isn't the lead he's the best part of any movie he's in, kind of like Samuel L. Jackson. The relationship between Richie and Margot is strangely touching, remeniscent of The Sound and Fury, and I think I have one of those weird, non-sexual, "I wanna be more like you" boy crushes on Ben Stiller--he's so funny. And of course, Bill Murray, silent or vocal, is hilarious. Huston, Glover, and Owen Wilson or great, too. Everyone has chemistry with everyone, and combined with Anderson's afformentioned talent, it's a joy to watch.It's obvious that Anderson and Co. love film making because every aspect of it is accounted for, every detail is appreciable by the audience. In "Rushmore", I took one look at Max and thought "I know exactly what this character is all about." At first sight of any of the Tenenbaums, you'll think the same thing. Anderson realizes the significance that one piece of costuming or set dressing can carry. CHEERS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Anderson's finest and one of the best of 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The genius of Wes Anderson has come full circle with The Royal Tenenbaums. A complex comedy that orbits issues of familial dysfunction, TRT's ferocious wit speaks to all of us on some level. The cast is uniformly wonderful, especially Gene Hackman as Royal. This is the tale of a clan of geniuses in decline, with their estranged parents and associated pretenders to the family. Each character is drawn in such an individualistic manner, this harkens to our sense of identity while providing a visual style that is again, an Andersonian achievement. Alec Baldwin's stoic narration coupled with stark super titles that flash staccato style add to the off-kilter ambiance of the pseudo New York dramascape. More outré than Bottle Rocket, more sagacious than Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums is a monumental accomplishment in visual storytelling, a milestone in Anderson's career, and one of the best American films of 2001.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Parts Are Greater Than Their Sum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very entertaining film with much stylish humor. What makes it work is the almost miraculous jelling of each main actor with his or her part. There is a coherent story but the sharp vignettes of often weird behavior stand out each almost by itself. And that isn't a bad thing.Gwyneth Paltrow is in her most atypical best as a near catatonic failed playwright. Gene Hackman is not so much the dubious and shifty paterfamilas as he is a needed catalyst for the other family members and hangers-on to deal with their lives. Anjelica Huston is at the top of her form. Ben Stiller is believable as a neurotic, perhaps with good cause, single dad. Danny Glover exudes kindness and class.This very fine movie appears to garner near rapturous reviews perhaps, partly, because of the dearth of good films this past year and the overpowering impact of tragic events. We need this film right now but it has staying power too. It sets a high mark for comedy and will undoubtedly receive Oscar nominations. For a film set in the Bronx it seems almost criminal to see major scenes shot across the river in New Jersey. Lifelong New Yorker filmgoers accustomed to seeing their city as, well, Toronto, are in for a shock. What's next, passing off rural Connecticut as Queens?Every seat was taken in the West 13th Street theatre where I saw "The Royal Tenenbaums" this afternoon. Interestingly, the frequent outbreaks of laughter were not universal but seemed to come from different sections for different scenes. Hmm.Anyway, GO SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Anderson's masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I highly enjoyed Wes Anderson's two previous films, BOTTLE ROCKET and RUSHMORE. They were films that were entertaining and intelligent, but both films had their lulls. Before I watched Anderson's latest film, ROYAL TENENBAUMS I was expecting it to be great, but not excellent. After watching it, I am pleased to say that ROAYL TENENBAUMS is Anderson's flawless classic. ROYAL TENENBAUMS is about the tale of a disfunctional family who live in Manhatthan. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) is a liquidator and husband of archaeologist Etheline Tenenbaum (Anjelica Huston). Together they have three children: Chas (Ben Stiller) a millionare investor who is fitness crazed, Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) the "adoptive daughter" is what Royal calls her is a successful playwright who won a Pulitzer Prize, and Richie (Luke Wilson) a successful tennis pro who had a breakdown during one of his matches and is traveling the world by ship. Royal was never the perfect father to the kids, he shot Chas in the hand with a BB gun, and critized Margot's play, but it was Richie that Royal favored and gave the most attention to. But Royal abandoned Richie leaving Richie to become a burn out. Royal finds out that he's being evicted out of the hotel room that he's been staying at for years. Royal also finds out that he is dying and has cancer, so he would like to spend the last couple of weeks with his family. It just that since Royal has last talked or spent time with his family things have changed. Etheline is thinking about a marriage proposal offered to her by her friend Henry Sherman (Danny Glover). Chas is a widower and has two boys, Margot is married to a much older man, Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray) a human study author, and Richie has become depressed and is traveling the world only communicating through telegrams. When the five Tenebaums are under the same roof again for the first time in seventeen years, it becomes a hysterical and memorable adventure for both the Tenenbaums and the viewer. ROAYL TENENBAUMS is a movie that I have been waiting for all year, a intelligent movie that is entertaining at the same time. The humor in this film written by director Anderson, and co-star Owen Wilson (who plays Tenenbaum friend and western writer Eli Cash) tell TENENBAUMS much more different than BOTTLE ROCKET and RUSHMORE. It's not as vicious as BOTTLE or as cynical as RUSHMORE, TENENBAUMS is instead more heart-felt and tender. It has many sympathetic and sensitive moments, but that doesn't keep it from not being funny. In fact there are several hilarious scenes in this film. And unlike most comedies where there are those scenes where the audience goes hysterical with laughter, TENENBAUMS is different the comedy keeps hitting you like a racquet ball hitting a wall. When Anderson wrote TENENBAUMS, he had Gene Hackman and Anjelica Huston in mind for Royal and Etheline Tenenbaum. And what stroke of luck did Anderson and the audience get to have, both actors agree to do the roles after reading the screenplay. Huston gives her best acting performance that I have seen from her since PRITZI'S HONOR, as the caring for her children and confused at her husband Etheline Tenenbaum. Stiller, Paltrow, both Luke and Owen Wilson, Glover, and Murray all give wonderful and memorable performances as the family and friends of the Tenenbaum family. Stiller is funny as the arrogant child, Platrow is also great as the cynical, and Luke Wilson is good as well as the quiet and calm depressive. And there is more great support from Anderson alumni's Seymour Cassel and Kumar Pellana. Even Alec Baldwin does a great job narrating the story of the Tenenbaum family to the viewer. But if anybody comes out ahead, it's Gene Hackman. Hackman is one of the greatest actors of all time. I have enjoyed his work for all of my life. From when I first saw him as Lex Luthor in SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE back when I was two, to the vicious Little Bill Dagget in UNFORGIVEN, and from watching him as Popeye Doyle in FRENCH CONNECTION. Hackman well deserved Oscars for both UNFORGIVEN and FRENCH CONNECTION, but for TENENBAUMS, he MUST get an Oscar. He gives one of the best performances that I have seen from anybody in years. And for HACKMAN, it's his best performance since UNFORGIVEN. Hackman carried the picture from start to finish with his humor and emotions. Royal Tenenbaum is the most enjoyable father figure role that I have seen in any form of medium since Homer J. Simpson, and that is the highest compliment that I can think of. If Gene Hackman or any of his family/friends are reading this, I would like to thank Mr. Hackman very much for giving a wonderful, excellent, and enjoyable performance. And Anderson does his best work that he has ever done. It's not as orignal as BOTTLE ROCKET or RUSHMORE, but he makes it more fun! Anderson uses a lot of his trademarks in TENENBAUMS (characters who smoke, odd paintings, Luke and Owen Wilson, excellent soundtrack, Kumar Pellana, and the wonderful and unique shots with subtext on the screen). Unlike BOTTLE and RUSHMORE, I can watch TENENBAUMS over and over again and still laugh my rear end off the first time I saw it compared to the seventh or eighth time (and since working at a movie theater showing it, I have been watching scenes from TENENBAUMS over and over again and still get a major kick out of it). ROYAL TENENBAUMS isn't a comedy for everybody, for those who like the cliche type comedies like MISS CONGENALITY, WHAT WOMEN WANT or RUNAWAY BRIDE won't like it. Those who prefer stupid and sophmoric humor like CORKY ROMANO, HOW HIGH, and TOMCATS won't like. No, this is for the intellects, those who laugh at life and the way people live, my kind of humor. We don't laugh at the people, we just laugh at the way they are and live. And in TENENBAUMS is that kind of humor, which makes it easily the best movie of 2001 next to ALI. ***** (out of five)</fullReview>

The story is beautifully crafted and molded in a quintessential Wes Anderson manner. The attention to detail is impeccable, the cast equally balanced and supportive of each other. Gene Hackman's performance as the mischevious Royal Tenenbaum is beautiful to watch and I hope he will win his much deserved Golden Globe for such a golden performance.

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the hype -</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start out by stating that I think Bottle Rocket was one of the best movies of the nineties. And I thought Rushmore was a cute, fairly entertaining film that tended to go long because of the lack of story.This movie, however, is one of the worst films I have seen all year. And this has not been a stellar year for movies. Undeveloped characters, no story and very little humor. I was looking at my watch half way through the film - which was by the way shortly after the film's set-up. Breaking all dramatic rules (and not for any good reason - ala Bunuel's surrealist fare) - this snooze-fest features the longest and most pointless voice over I ever heard and also points up Wes Anderson's limited directorial skills. Wes doesn't know how to use visuals to move the story along, his sets are interesting but pointless and he doesn't know the first thing about story telling. And the flawed but interesting characters from his earlier films (and which I personally think has much more to do with Owen Wilson's writing talents that anything Wes can be credited for) are completely missing in this film.Let's face it. When this movie goes wide and America votes thumbs down on this piece of crap - it won't be because they don't understand it, but rather because the general public will not be as easily fooled as the indie film crowd.Bottom line - I had a much better time watching Dude - Where's My Car?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, I waited 7 months for this flick to show up and I was far from disappointed. Obviously, it IS one of the best films of the year. The writing by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson along with his direction was nothing else but ingenius! The emotion of each character well fitted their role of a ironically disfucntional "successful" family. Ben Stiller (Chas), Gwyneth Paltrow (Margot), Luke Wilson (Richie) all did excellent acting in showing their characters bland emotion of secrets and disappointment that was PERFECT for movie's atmosphere. And let's not forget about Gene Hackman (Royal) that made everyone laugh in the theater even 5 minutes after the scene was over. If you expected everyone to be happy and go-getty for this drama/comedy film are sadly mistaken. The only bad part about this movie was there wasn't enough of Bill Murray, but that does not phase the movie of what it's really worth. Basically, GO WATCH IT! BUY THE POSTER!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very funny, exquisitely acted, and beautifully filmed. It also has its moments of poignancy. It is intelligent filmmaking that works on a number of different levels. It's also one of the only movies I've come out of from the theater this year, not feeling the need to analyze and dissect... it's as if everything in the film works so well and completely, it totally satisfied and entertained, providing me with an almost-perfect movie-going experience... and that doesn't happen very often.

		<fullReview>After seeing that Wes Andersen was directing this movie, I couldn't wait for it to come out. Rushmore was brilliant, so why would The Royal Tenenbaums be any different? Such great actors and great writing playing the most bizzare of characters ever assembled. How Wes Andersen comes up with these things I have no idea. The only thing missing from this movie was some more lines for Bill Murray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a drama? More like hysterical comedy that you didn't want to end. After a season of totally predictable, recycled junk, a breath of fresh air finally hit the theaters and it never felt better! Avoiding Lord of The Rings until the crowds die down, I had anticipated seeing this film after watching the trailer and it was everything I had hoped. An all-star cast, Gene Hackman's best role in years, Ben Stiller and his 2 sons in the same red Adidas jogging suit throughout the film (there are 2 scenes in which you do not see Stiller in the red suit) and Gywneth Paltrow chain smoking in every scene she is in, a habit which she has managed to hide from her family for 22 years. Truly clever and original, just watching the first 10 minutes is a treat by itself. Dysfunctional has never been funnier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wait after Rushmore was worth it. Wes Anderson has crafted a funny, touching, and bittersweet story of a family in chaos. There's more than a touch of J.D. Salinger in the story, but Anderson makes it his own--Tenenbaums is the best film I've seen this year. Wes Anderson films may not be for everyone (a friend once told me they didn't like Rushmore because "it was too depressing"), but for the rest of us they're wonderful. The cast is excellent (Gene Hackman as well as Anderson's usual suspects), the script is great, and the direction is deft and sure. Do yourself a favor and see a wonderful film made by a director who puts his all into his movies and knows his craft inside and out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I certainly think this is an entertaining film, and worth seeing. The acting is very solid and attractive, especially Gene Hackman and Gwyenth Paltrow. The movie is pretty funny, and definitely very quirky.But, what is the point? Yes, it's about coming home and re-connecting, and it is very funny at points, and it is infused with an off-beat attitude towards a very dysfunctional family. Hackman and Paltrow steal the show here. They are both excellently cast; especially Hackman. I couldn't imagine a better actor for this role. He's great, as usual. And Paltrow; that eyeliner is pretty wild.Ben Stiller left me really cold, though. He's the weakest cast member, I think.Go see this if you, as I, like quirky films. But, don't go if you expect to learn something about human nature. What, ultimately, is the point of the film, other than a well-off-center look at this family?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cry of laughter from all of the fathers of the world who need one more try at getting it right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the adopted Margot Tenenbaum, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, distances herself from her family by saying, "It's okay, we're not actually related,' she reflects the feeling of the father, Royal (Gene Hackman), and the entire clan, who spin like planets outside their family but strangely also deeply a part of it. When she says of her first husband, "I met him in the ocean, he came out to me in a canoe,' you know this is one weird family.`The Royal Tenenbaums" is Wes Anderson's lyrical and brilliant homage to all the dysfunctional families of America. The characters are uniformly eccentric, like Royal, who fakes dying to get back with his family, and his son Richie, played by Ben Stiller, who in his brilliant business teens expropriated his home from dad. The dislocation of each member is best expressed in their uniformly low-key reaction to Royal's news of his impending death. Writers Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have crafted a family like and unlike the rest of us. For fathers, it is a confirmation that the distance we sometimes feel is not so unusual, especially those of us who have spawned an eccentric writer like my `D Girl' daughter or my very independent and sometimes ruthless business kids. When a neighbor wishes he were a Tenenbaum, Royal wishes he were, too. That's funny and poignant, a cry of laughter from all of the fathers of the world who need one more try at getting it right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEWARE OF SPOILERS Obviously funny; devilishly quirky, creatively poignant no doubt, but the characters lack emotional pull! It's a challenging comedic satire that does pep up humor and outrage! The décor of the oversized mansion obviously match their characters! And the viewers are not given shots of the familiar Manhattan spots. Instead, Anderson's New York feels more like an invented city with crummy `Gypsy cabs', the miserable shot of the Hudson River, and the outdated streets where viewers keep seeing the Green Line bus. Heck, is this the only bus-line serving the streets? Yep, it's definitely Anderson's bizarre universe with the most offbeat (just look at how they're dressed!) and unimaginable characters to twitch your stomach muscles at the most unexpected moments. It's a dark tale about family ties, with themes of manipulations, child exploitations, loyalty, jealousies, betrayal, and parental blindness! It's looking at how things can go wrong even with a family of `geniuses'! Hackman's fallen-out-of grace conniving character is nastily funny. So are all his precocious family members. But Anderson's characters are created not to allow the viewers to laugh with them, but to laugh at them. Solid dark humor that does put me to shame for laughing! Overall, Anderson has made a good satire out of his characters, with everyone seeping with flawed traits. Unbelievable! This film is interesting: it does tackle the characters' neurotic catastrophes and eccentricities. Put them all under one roof and observe the mess! Nice ensemble of actors? gosh, the two Wilson brothers seem to share the same vocal tone! Overall, the cast's characters are certainly fun to watch but their emotional pains are not cringing my soul with as much empathy as I would have liked. Only Luke Wilson's Richie has the capability of moving me. His performance is captivating!The closing chapter seems cold and rather lame. Perhaps, I'm unconvinced by the characters' facial expressions to conclude that they have finally reached a change of hearts! With Anderson's thoroughly unusual directorial style, this film is a worthwhile piece to see. B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On Soderbergh's Heels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a season full of "can't wait to see" movies, Wes Anderson's "The Royal Tennenbaums" was the one I looked forward to the most. And now that I've seen it, I can't wait to go see it again. I'm sure this movie will be talked about for a long time coming and deservedly so. Early on in the movie, one would think that Wes Anderson was reverting back to his dark comedic roots (Rushmore, Bottle Rocket) but the reality of it is that this movie is a completely different animal. One knock on Anderson I have heard in the past is that his pacing leaves a little to be desired, but in my opinion that is where his genius lies. He strays away from the standardized three act form of screenplay and concentrates more on just telling a kick ass story. The story is about Royal Tennenbaum (Gene Hackman) trying to assemble some type of relationship with his dysfunctinally brilliant family of old before he dies?. What stuck out with me in this movie was the lack of emotional attachment that everyone showed to one and other. It is almost to a fault until Royal drips just a bit of feeling into the movie and then every member of the brilliant cast gets to respond to this new found sense of expression. I never thought I'd see a movie where Ben Stiller made me cried, Gene Hackman made up for Heist and Gwenyth Paltrow shined without smiling. This movie did these things and so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet, meandering diversion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a bit perplexed by the fervently enthusiastic reception this film is receiving, but maybe that's just a reflection of what a dud 2001 has been for quality films. This is not to say that "The Royal Tenenbaums" is not a good movie. It is a sweet diversion, though meandering at times. The story plays like one of John Updike's more lighthearted novels, with its caring depiction of the intricate dysfuntions of a family of geniuses. Kudos to the actors, who all are cast perfectly. Were these roles written with each of these folks in mind? Seems like it. Gwyneth is especially fine as willfully neglected and secretly rebellious Margot Tenenbaum. Music choices are great, as usual with Anderson's films (more of Mark Mothersbaugh's tickly score cues would've been nice). My only real beef is that it didn't quite make my moviegoing heart sing the way "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore" did. Maybe if Anderson had focused a bit more on one or two characters, as opposed to trying to give each family member equal time, it might have been more emotionallly affecting. Make no mistake, this is good. But if you want great, return to Anderson's earlier work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read some of the comments posted on IMDB about this picture. I'm dissapointed. I feel sorry for those who didn't enjoy this movie as much as I did. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I can't help but feel that they missed out. I loved The Royal Tennenbaums. I'm biased, however. I have been closely following the carreers of Wes Anderson and The Wilson Brothers since Bottle Rocket. I nervously watched their stars rise, hoping they wouldn't sell out. (Kind of like your favorite local band who signs a record contract) I loved this movie. It was what I expected. Anderson has become quite the auteure. Certain themes have repeated themselves in each of his movies. Meanwhile, his visual style has grown. He and D.P. Robert Yeoman can create visually staggering images of the most mundane settings. Kudos to the art director as well. Each frame is so full of color and detail! How can you become bored watching this? There is so much to see and hear. The script was amazing. No suprise there. The acting was superb. Again, this I expected. Anderson seems to be able to pull great performances from his actors. Bill Murray should have won an Oscar for Rushmore and gene Hackman better win one for Royal Tenenbaums. And I believe Luke Wilson should be considered for best supporting actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Close, no cigar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not seen Rushmore or Bottle Rocket, I have nothing to compare this to, though I will say the film makes me want to see the other two Anderson has made. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is an interesting and entertaining film, but it has its shortcomings. Namely, it seems to have lost its message somewhere in one too many little side commentaries about familial relationships. The film sets itself up to have a message, but none comes forth - is it about the downward career trajectory? reaching your peak too early? how selfish parents affect kid's lives? What?That said, the film is incredibly well made. The sets are very well done, you subtly notice things like the character's always wearing basically the same clothing, these kinds of things. There is a nice bit of subtlety as you continually see Ben Stiller's character (Chas) shut his father out literally and figuratively by turning out the lights in the room his father (Hackman) is in. The film is full of these kinds of impressive touches.The acting is a mixed bag - a couple of characters aren't written particulary well. Hackman, Bill Murray, and Danny Glover all shine in characters that are ridiculous to some degree. Anjelica Huston is great. Luke Wilson and Stiller are right for their roles, and Wilson makes a stunning transformation that fits well into the movie, and he does a fine job as the film's moral center (I think.) Gwyneth Paltrow and Owen Wilson's characters, however, appear to be included for the sake of advancing the plot - neither one really gets much of a chance to act, so I can't really blame them for their performances (though O. Wilson did, of course, co-write this, so I can blame him a little)."The Royal Tanenbaums" felt like it still had a lot of rough edges to work out. There are a lot of hilarious, dark comedy moments, but the film seems to be concerned more with these moments that making any salient point. There are something akin to eight major characters (the five Tenenbaums, Glover, Murray, and Owen Wilson, not to mention Chas's two kids, who provide a number of great moments), each of whom have their own separate and interesting issues, and there isn't near enough time to explore them all - only Luke Wilson's Richie and Hackman's Royal seem to find their solutions (and maybe Chas) - the ending is kind if a cop-out, though I won't say more about it. Basically, the film kind of deals with everyone's problems, sort of, maybe, and for the characters whose problems aren't really adressed (like Paltrow's, Owen Wilson's, and Murray's) you have to wonder why they're brought up to begin with, because there really isn't one central turning point around which everyone revolves, as much as the film wants it to be Hackman. This is definitely worth seeing, for Hackman's (especially) excellent performance, for the way it was filmed, and for some a good laugh, but it doesn't quite reach the level of memorable piece it seems it was intended for.</fullReview>

The writing is what makes WesAnderson's films stand out from most of the other tripe that spewsout of Hollywood every year. When you combine this great writingwith a superb cast, talented acting, perfect direction andcinematography, and a music score that hits all the rightnotes...well...you can't really go wrong, can you?This film practices "subtlety", which is something you won't findwith most films, today. If you are expecting explosions, peoplescreaming at every other turn, and non-stop slapstick, you mightwant to rent ACE VENTURA again, instead. Not to say THE ROYALTENENBAUMS doesn't have one or two instances of each of thosethings, but they are hardly the main source of humor.The obvious and cliched are torn away, which may confuse andbefuddle many viewers.

On this aspect alone, "The Royal Tenenbaums" is a resounding success. But style alone cannot make a great film or a great director. What's missing? Let's try real, grown-up characters. I was impressed by Mr. Anderson's ability to rustle up a great cast, but all they did was mope around in twee outfits. Meanwhile, we're supposed to have empathy for this dysfunctional family and what they've gone through, but there's really no depth here. What a waste. Another issue is the pacing: too slow, and not on the mark all the time. With time, the jokes are fewer and farther between. The film thus starts to drag after the 1st hour.

		<fullReview>I very much enjoyed Rushmore and was excited to go see The Royal . Tenenbaums. However, with the comments of Danny "Gone Fishin" Glover, I am considering a personal boycott of the film.Now, I understand that Danny is "just an actor" and sometimes when you play make believe for your living, you lose touch with the real world. What's more, he absolutely has the right to state his position to any who would listen -- that's what America is all about. But I also have the right to tell him that he's wrong.Mullah "Taliban" Omar just the other day mentioned that he's looking for the "...extinction of America." Well, you know, it would be quite difficult to put on the little dog and pony show over there in Hollywood if there was no one left to fill the theaters. These terrorists want to eliminate us and our way of life. They don't have any problems with their own brand of death penalty - one based on some scary and backward ideals. We are in a war right now and it's one that we must and will win.So, maybe they will take a lesson from Ben Stiller and digitally eliminate Danny's character from the movie. Then I may be inclined to go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was ridiculously lucky enough to find tickets to the premiere of The Royal Tenenbaums at the NYC Film Festival and I hardly know what to say.I won't give away anything at all or go into much detail about characters or what happens. Suffice it to say that the film is shockingly superior to Wes' last two films (yes, including Rushmore), and that I've never ever seen a dramatic film that was this funny. There were a few scenes where the audience couldn't even hear what was being said because everyone was belly laughing so loudly (one scene in particular between Luke and Owen stands out...it's hard not to watch the interior decorating).Wes crams SO much information and so many jokes into this film; I found myself thinking about the film afterwards and laughing out loud and jokes I'd almost forgotten (the tennis match, for example). The film does take very dramatic turns, but usually not for long. To compare, it may not be "more dramatic" overall than Rushmore, but the themes it deals with are a bit heavier. I'm not explaining that very well. I'll skip it.The acting was sensational, the direction was literally jaw-dropping, the music (The Beatles, Nick Drake, The Ramones, Elliot Smith) was perfect, and story is hilarious and heartbreaking. I'll have to see it a few more times to come close to digesting it. How else can I describe it...an instant American classic! That's what I think, anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always avoided Wes Anderson movies, but like Tarantino and Reservoir Dogs, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about."Was it interesting?" This movie might be shot well but is mostly about the characters. I was afraid the quirkiness was going to make them into cartoons, but they had be made into complex people with involved back-stories. The way the interacted with each other was understandable, though a little weak at times.2.5 out of 3."Was it memorable?" Wes Anderson's style is noticeable throughout, but it doesn't distract too much. While there are occasionally some vibrant colors, most of the movie is dingy, but I feel that was somewhat purposeful.2 out of 3."Was it entertaining?" As a comedy, it's rather light. As a drama, it's a little weird. It's not a fun movie, or a powerful movie. It's somewhere in the middle being just an enjoyable movie. Good things happened, bad things happened, people learned various lessons, life goes on. Just done in a unique way.1.5 out of 3.Starting with 1 (why ask), 1 + 2.5 + 2 + 1.5 = 7 The performances were good, though I thought the casting was a little mismatched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just my favorite Wes Andersen film but one of my favorites...period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure how many times I've seen this movie, it really doesn't matter I guess. The only thing I know is the more I watch it the more I love it and the more I notice all the little details and quirks that make it so special and unique. It's dry humor and beautiful story telling may not be for everyone but if u don't like it I guess u just don't appreciate good film making and u suck so there! The cast is top notch, the style is artsy and ingenious but not in a way that should be intimidating or confusing to a novice film watcher and the characters are memorable and interesting. I am a big Wes Andersen fan but there is something about The Royal Tenenbaums that makes it my favorite...so far anyway. If u enjoy Wes Andersen's films but u haven't seen this one then do what ever u have to do to get yourself a copy of it and find a working DVD player or if needed a VHS player (yes it's available on VHS, I know this because I have one-lol). Get yourself in front of a TV and make it snappy and then just kick back, relax and enjoy the magic of a really finely crafted work of art. You will be greeted by the regal voice of Alec Baldwin. He'll introduce u to the Tenebaum family and tell u all u need to know about why they are the way they are and why they have strayed so far from their potential and one another. I hope u will watch the Royal Tenenbaums and I hope u will enjoy it's charm, if u don't well...I guess ur just a loser who should go watch Transformers or something with lots of explosions or shiny flickering images.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Anderson's Ageless Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happens when you combine the fast-paced eloquency and intricacy of a Wes Anderson film with a heartfelt message and an all star cast? Easily his best film, the rare Anderson film that combines brisk entertainment with a message that resonates, 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is an amalgamation of the aforementioned characteristics, and the following analysis will display how it both captivates and provokes, a rare occurrence in modern cinema. To begin, lets examine just how 'The Royal Tenenbaums' captivates the audience in a way only Wes Anderson can - through the use of his always beautiful production sets, he successfully places you and I in his fictional world, controlling almost every single aspect of this world like a child building a fictional world from scratch. Alas, Anderson has always done this, as from 'Bottle Rocket', to 'Moonrise Kingdom', to 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', his enchanting sets always inspire awe, hence his multiple Academy Award nominations. His very distinctive screenplay is also very engaging, with his frequent narration proving charming and his unique ability to make choppy, sully dialogue appear, as was the namesake of this section, captivating. To become a 10/10 film, however, a film must not only entertain, but provoke - Despite 'The Royal Tenenbaums' unique, quirky manner of projecting its theme, it is still relevant and meaningful. First of all, what is the theme? Imprisonment. While this sounds like a rather dark theme for a Wes Anderson film, or any film branded as a comedy in particular, that is part of the beauty of the film - the way it makes you laugh and feel at the same time. So, how is imprisonment relevant? Look at every character in the film, and how they are held back by a restriction, imprisoned and unable to break free until the end. The following list displays each character and their individual restriction, contributing to the intricate theme.Royal - Royal is constantly imprisoned by his past actions of restricting his children in adolescence and is only able to break free by having to fake a terminal disease.Etheline - Imprisoned by marriage, she is finally able to get a divorce and be freed at the end of the film.Chas - Imprisoned by his wife's death, unable to break free and become his former self.Margot - Restricted through taboo of brother-sister relationships, her marriage to Raleigh, and her cigarette addiction.Richie - Imprisoned by the social taboo placed on brother-sister relationships and is constantly unable to communicate his feelings.Henry - Restricted by his social standing, which makes it difficult to truly communicate his feelings to Etheline.Raleigh - He has been restricted by his marriage and his constant thoughts of Margot having an affair. Eli - Imprisoned by his drug addiction, as it essentially takes over and controls him - his rehab stint at the end of the film signals his freedom.Uzi &amp; Ari - Imprisoned by their father's overprotective nature, attempt to break free and 'live a little'.Ultimately, 'The Royal Tenenbaums' captivates and sends out a unique, dark message regarding life, all while incorporating well put- together subplots, and incredibly creative world, and a story that makes its audience laugh and experience all in one remarkable, noteworthy amalgamation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever Made Featuring Dalmation Mice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Director Wes Anderson Catapulted to Overwhelming Financial Success with this His Third Film. Critics Generally had a Soft Spot for the Originality of the Director's Vision in the Previous Cult Favorite Two, Bottle Rocket (1997) and Rushmore (1998) but both Failed at the Box-Office.But here the Artsy Anderson Scored Big Time and the Film Made Oodles of Money and (no surprise) was a Hit with the Critics. The Differentness of this Movie still made for some Very Vocal Detractors and those who Generally don't like the Movie Absolutely Loathe it.The Visual Template is Once Again a High Point and the "Out There" Characters are in Keeping with the Style of Unusual but Interesting People. The Tenenbaums are Unusually Gifted Misanthropes and Their Short Lived Success, Feeding off Their Genius, was Impermanent and what was left over was a Dysfunctional Family of Depressed Paranoics, and Zombified Substance Abusers.The Movie is Ill Fitting in just about Every Way and it Rides that Quirkiness for the Full Two Hours. It is a Situation that is Comedic and More Pathetically Interesting than Funny. These are Eccentrics and the Audience is in Awe of Their Eccentricities and that's where the Humor Originates. Not in Gross Out Awfulness or Pratfalls, Physical Missteps, or Outrageous Over the Top Silliness that is the Modern Way.A High Profile Cast Probably Helped this Movie and Drew Much Needed Mainstream Attention to the Director's Work. To Say that this is a One of a Kind would be Inaccurate. Wes Anderson has Made other Movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Memory is a funny thing; you cannot trust it.I've always seen parts of Royal Tenenbaums since i was as kid; the red jumpsuits worn by Ben Stiller, and his two kids. i always thought that it was a comedy. it took me a decade to finally sit down and watch it with a friend.Needless to say, tears were shed. The film is a roller coaster; you'd think that it will be a light-hearted comedy, a typical of Wes Anderson. No, he will side kick you in the ribs with these scenes which you could relate to if you have ever been sad, depressed, angry, helpless. I was tearing up in several scenes. My friend did the same, esp. because of what Luke Wilson's character was doing when he felt truly helpless. I love you Wes Anderson. Your movies always give this light shimmering hope despite our messy lives full of mistakes, wrong doings and strained relationships. I sincerely hope that as many people as possible will feel something watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Anderon seems to always make his films feel unique and distinctive from anything else, but feel familiar in his filmography. This is no exception. Funny, offbeat, charming, but also oddly dramatic and weighs its family issues and themes pretty seriously, this is a stand out film. The whole cast does some great work here, in particular Stiller and Hackman. Huston is also pretty effective. Paltrow stands among the weakest in the cast, although it's not a noticeable flaw in the film. I wouldn't say this is Anderson's best film, but certainly a more than worthy addition to his collection, and definitely recommended to his fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Anderson at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming from someone that doesn't like that much Anderson's style. In fact, he has style, and a very peculiar one, which is the main reason I'm attracted to his films in the first place. His films are visually different. I would call Anderson a 70s fetishist, considering all the influences and the references he uses in his films of that specific decade.However, story-wise his films are more focused in tell a story than having a good character development. That is something that I immensely dislike, since a story in my opinion starts from the character. Anderson often throws characters with mediocre development in his scripts and often they fail to having me caring about them.Royal Tenembaums maybe very well an exception to the rule. The development may not be the best but if you are patient, after the 20 minutes or so the story starts to involve you and you'll see yourself liking the 'Royal'. Is weird, but it worked. Don't ask me how. I think the film finally started only after the 20 minutes, what is a possible explanation why it grew on me.Anyway, this film is Anderson as always. A disturbed family and an apparently dark and sad story told in a funny and laid- back way. Obviously it has obviously comic moments, but I'm not sure if comedy would be the most prevalent genre if wasn't by Anderson's direction. The result, of course, was above average.Overall, 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exercise in weirdness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Royal Tenenbaums" is a film I recommend but I must point out that it's not everyone's sort of movie. Wes Anderson has written and directed a film that is filled with EXTREMELY strange characters that are very bizarre--not not in a John Waters way--more in a way that just left me a bit confused. I assume this was his intention but no matter how strange it gets, there is a certain likable aspect of the film...though exactly what this is, I am sure I can clearly say. I think it has a lot to do with the folks being completely different--and after reviewing more than 12000 films, it's nice to see something different.Gene Hackman plays the title character--a ne'er do well named Royal Tenenbaum. He's abandoned his family and inexplicably has returned after two decade's absence and wants readmission to the family. The plot, whether intended or not, is a remake of the old Warner Brothers film "Daughters Courageous"--though aside from the general plot, the films are not at all alike due to the quirkiness of "The Royal Tenenbaums". This is one you just need to see to believe--and the story never is believable but it's also never dull.By the way, in addition to the family members played by Anjelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson, other major actors in the film include Danny Glover, Owen Wilson and Bill Murray. This is yet another oddball performance/characterization from Bill Murray--who has made a long string of odd ones over the last decade or so, such as "Lost in Translation", "The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou" and "Broken Flowers". They don't always work but you have to respect his willingness to try something different.Oh, by the way, although they said it in the film, traumatic events do NOT turn a person's hair white. That's a myth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had an excellent cast which went completely to waste. The movie was stupid, incoherent, unfunny, and it defies description and belief how such a monumental squandering of talent and resources could possibly pass scrutiny. Only Hollywood, which has become synonymous with profligacy and idiotic output could have put its imprimatur on such a piece of drivel.The principals must have been paid princely sums to parttake in such an appallingly worthless production. There is not one shred of intelligence or worthwhile creativity in any scene and makes one wonder if studio officials and screenwriters have invented a new type of mind-altering drug. It is beyond dispute that legions of moviegoers have been swindled out of a portion of their disposable income with such a rotten representation of tripe masquerading as entertainment.Furthermore, it defies belief that this website could be defaced so thoroughly as to award this colossal turd of a motion picture (and I use the term loosely) with the exorbitant rating it now enjoys. My rating is for the brave souls listed in the cast who have talent but would lend themselves to tripe like this, presumably for good money only. Hopefully their future endeavors will acquit them in better fashion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Wes Anderson;s dramady is an excellent film. That I can't deny. But some of the characters in the film annoyed me a little. Perhaps probably cause I loved Gene Hackman;s character the most, and everyone treats him unfairly.Royal Tennenbaum(played by Gene Hackman) is made out to be an unlikable father. But he is actually one of the best things about the film. Wes Anderson, being the genius he is, uses what he usually uses. He usually makes a comedy, adds a little drama to it, and then adds weird. But here, Anderson uses all of those things, but doubles them.The Tennenbaums(played by Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Gweneth Paltrow) all grew up with unfortunate lives. The parents were divorced. They never really got to know the father really well. The daughter was adopted. Just unfortunate things. Well, the adoption not so much.Years later, they have obviously all gone their separate ways. The father(Gene Hackamn) is living in a hotel. The mother(Anjelica Huston) is a scientist or something like that who is asked for marriage one day by her partner(played by Danny Glover).Chas(played by Ben Stiller), one of the sons, has two children. He was once married but she died in a plane crash. So he is extra careful. The other brother, Ritchie(played by Luke Wilson) has moved on from his tennis days. He is in love with the adopted daughter Margot(played by Gweneth Paltrow)Margot is now married to an older author(played by Bill Murray)and is having an affair with Ritchie's old friend Eli(played by Owen Wilson). She ran off when she was fourteen and didn't do much with her life afterwards.They are all brought together when Royal, the father, tells his ex-wife that he's dying. So everyone moves into the Tennenbaum house again. But not everyone is happy with the father even when he's dying.The film is at times very funny. but I got very creeped out in the last part of the film. Some of the characters I didn't like. such as Luke Wilson's(cause he was very weird)and Ben Stiller's character too. I think the thing that really made the film for me was Gene Hackman. He did the best job. He was very funny. Wes Anderson has done some great films. I think this is definitely one of them. This has got to be seen.The Royal Tennenbaums: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love Wes Anderson movies and this is one of his best. For me, it is second to "The Life Aquatic" but by a very small amount. This was the first Wes Anderson film that I had ever seen and I really thought it was incredible. I love the dull, quiet humor that is throughout this film. It just makes so much sense to me. I like the way that film reads almost like a novel. The characters are really great too. They are all unique and are all very interesting. The story told in this film is a good one as well. It is simple; not much happens, yet a lot is going on throughout the film. The way that the camera moves along with the traditional Anderson direction and use of music is top notch.There isn't much more I can say. It is a personal favorite and I don't think it could be any better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Indie Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson is different. Very different. This film about a selfish, unkindly caring and depressive family that are truly dysfunctional in every sense of the word. Their world is the same as ours, but from a very different perspective. Wes' style of films are a kind of organized mess. Where pain, depression, love, hate, petty crime and shallowness are meshed together to make a perfect experience and depiction of strange people and their eccentric ways to love. Most would consider The Royal Tenenbaums Wes' magnum opus thus far, and I would not be one to disagree although Rushmore is my personal favorite. Each and every character gets enough screen time for you to either love them, hate them or have a slew of very mixed-yet-strong feelings for these characters. Whether or not you like them, you care. At the end of the film, I found myself immediately laughing and crying at the same moment, and that is no exaggeration in any way. Wes Anderson is my favorite director because he mixes such deep, profound drama with subtle, smart humor. Sometimes just one line in his film can make you feel both humor and sorrow. Exactly and only one line in this film set of my hysterical laughing with my hysterical crying. This film is so perfectly paced, set, acted, written and directed that you will not be able to find many flaws, making it a truly unforgettable, wonderful film. The indie epic that it really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of The Royal Tennenbaums for a few years now. It's one of those movies I can watch over and over again. The characters are original, and their struggles overshadow most of the humor and masterful cinematography Wes Anderson provides. There's many themes thrown around in this movie: The 'perfect family' - famous and successful, but having numerous internal problems.Forbidden love between brother and sister The boy-next-door who wishes he was part of their family (which I personally am a victim of) The widow, who is coping with the loss of his wife in the worst ways possible.The dead-beat father seeking redemption in the eyes of his children The divorcée finding love again after 20+ years The lost little girl trying to find comfort and solace in her life There's A LOT of stuff to relate to, for many people, in this movie.For the actors and actresses involved, it's my opinion that this is the top. This is the feather in their hat. Gene Hackman becomes my favorite actor of all time as Mr. Tennenbaum (or "Royal"). The Wilson brothers are also very respectable. This is a pretty serious and thought-out role for Owen Wilson, who happens to be one of my least favorite actors of all time. He's great as Eli Cash.Angelica Huston and Danny Glover are on-screen champions of quality acting.I fell in love with Gywneth Paltrow during this movie. She's beautiful, and conveys a silent sadness that is unmatched by any other actress i've seen.Aside from all of these heavy things I have to say about The Royal Tennenbaums: The movie is fun! And it's stylish. It's full of life, and I always end up calling my dad (who I didn't get to see very often, and just so happens to be a very ill person himself) whenever I watch this movie.Please go check this out! There's something for everyone in The Royal Tennenbaums.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cost Of Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Darth Vader. Vito Corleone. Jim Court. Add to that list of seriously flawed cinematic fathers one Royal Tenenbaum, the mostly-absent head of the hyper-talented, hyper-depressed Tenenbaum clan of Manhattan, N.Y.Gene Hackman delivers one of his most amazing performances as the largely amoral but entirely sympathetic Royal, who decides to reintroduce himself to his somewhat shattered clan when his estranged wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) is courted by her accountant. He shamelessly lies that he's dying. Complicating things are the three Tenenbaum children, finance wizard Chas (Ben Stiller), playwright Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and ex-tennis star Richie (Luke Wilson)."Everyone's against me," Royal whines at one point."It's your fault, man," responds faithful friend Pagoda (Kumar Pallana)."Yeah, I know, but dammit, I want this family to love me! How much money have you got?"Royal is basically a user, and no good at dishing out compliments to his emotionally starved children, either, like when Margot, then nine, writes her first play and asks Pops what he thinks. "This is a bunch of little kids dressed up in animal costumes," he snorts.It's possible Royal's tough love drives his children to early success, but it also takes a toll, a toll the film explores in depth. Like the tagline for the film goes: Family isn't a word, it's a sentence. Fortunately, director Wes Anderson is interested at least as much in the comedy potential of Royal and his clan as he is in the more dramatic implications. Like jaysilentbob says in his review here, "Each joke ends in tragedy, and each tragedy ends in a joke."I think that distances more people than it should. "Tenenbaums" is a film that exists in a kind of hermetic cultural isolation, with its Salingeresque characters and busy background scenery. But it's no arch New Yorker cartoon shot in life. Instead, it winks at its own upscale transatlantic pretensions. Margot's plays carry titles like "Erotic Transference" and "Nakedness Tonight". A pal of the family named Eli Cash (co-writer Owen Wilson) sends his literary clippings to Mrs. Tenenbaum and smugly tries to insert words like "presupposes" into his conversation.Not everything in this film clicks. Bill Murray feels lost as Margot's long-suffering husband, and there are various nods in the direction of spotted mice and a wooden ring finger that lead nowhere. But if Anderson overstuffs his movie with such details, he also finds rich payoffs, like when the often superfluous Chas shares a tender moment with his father near the film's end.Most of the film works best in setting up Hackman for another killer line or facial reaction. Like when Richie says "You don't look so sick, Dad," and he replies with a pleased "Thank you."But for all of Hackman's brilliance and well-honed instincts, the Royal role wouldn't be so satisfying if the film he cements didn't make some solid points about family, adult disappointment, and ultimately human redemption. You laugh, and if you're like me as much on reviewings as the first time, but wind up feeling something deeper, a lot deeper, at the overall experience, the kind of feeling that reminds you how beautifully ephemeral and transcendent a really good film can be at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first Wes Anderson movie that I watched. It appealed to me so much that I landed up watching most of his other movies with the latest one being "Darjeeling Ltd". Wes Anderson's other movies like "Rushmore" and "Life Aquatic" were also good but none was able to recreate the same joyful experience that was set by Royal Tenenbaums.The movie portrays the dark side of a dysfunctional family. But the different characters in the movie, each having their own quirkiness, weave together to form an interesting and joyful storyline. The casting is perfect with Ben stiller playing the role of an over protective dad, Luke Wilson as a depressed brother and Gene Hackman playing the title role of an aloof father. Gwyneth Paltrow looks beautiful as she makes a serious attempt at acting. As with all Wes Anderson movies, this movie too has a heavy blend of wonderful background scores and a subtle dash of comedy.In all, this movie is a pleasurable watch especially if you want to experience the trademark Wes Anderson directorial style at it's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Anderson is hailed not only as an important American filmmaker but also as a true American auteur.All of his films have stirred both critics and audience alike.This is a great feet which has not been achieved by many filmmakers who are currently working in USA.It can be said about "The Royal Tenenbaums" that its star cast has helped to disseminate ideas about a dysfunctional family.This is the only positive aspects of this film as due to its comic book approach characters have not been fully developed.They appear as poor shadows of famous people.One of the film's character is a poor copy of great Swedish tennis player Bjorn Borg.Wes Anderson's choice of dressing his actors in weird costumes in order to characterize dysfunctional families is a bad idea as not all dysfunctional families dress like that.One can wonder how can a dysfunctional family be recognized merely on the basis of their attire ? The worst part of this film is that not only adults but even kids are shown as dumb.This is perhaps something that might not go well with young audiences.As a final word it can be said that "The Royal Tenenbaums" is neither a comedy nor a drama.It is a different film for which even the laughs come with great difficulties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The royal tenebaums - overly dysfunctional American family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that before this film, I was a Wes Anderson film virgin. I had never seen one of his pictures previously. This film is not a bad place to start.The Royal Tenebaums is the story of a family of likable American curiosities. You have the spiv runaway father done for trying to cheat on his son, the intelligent mother hen, the brilliant but now paranoid son, the genius adopted daughter who smokes incessantly but secretly and the ambitious ex-tennis player son who, through his love and jealousy for his adopted sister, no longer plays tennis. Added to that, a family friend who becomes famous and talented in his own right and becomes involved with the adopted daughter and you have the recipe for an interesting blend of people most of us recognise.This whole film was presented in a series of chapters, like those of a book. The cast are brilliant, especially Gwyneth Paltrow and Owen Wilson who manages to restrain his usual surfer dude schtick long enough to present a different, more moody side to his acting talents. It also presents us with straight acting from Ben Stiller who is normally renowned for doing very likable comedy, again playing the money mad genius son who is left a paranoid, safety conscious widower by an aircrash. And finally, there is Luke Wilson. A world away from his usually quite dopey but gentle comedy characters, Richie Tenebaum gives a new edge to Luke's acting talents. He far outdoes Owen in this film and gives a rich tapestry to a character who is jealous but sincere in his love for his adopted 'sibling' Margot and in dealing with her husband of convenience, played by Bill Murray. All the cast are wonderful.Lots of nice little touches, like Margot's secretive smoking, missing finger, fur coat costume and thick, clumpy flat shoes combined with tiny sports dresses and Kelly Bag, Owen's drug addled and porn driven cowboy with Gucci loafers and blonde, little boy lost bob haircut, Richie's sports wrist bands and mustard suit with dark glasses and long hair that disappears in his anguished response to his 'adopted sibling's sexual proclivities and his later passionate kissing with the same and, of course, Gene Hackman with his 'break all the rules' mad man attitude.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is the story of a man named Royal Tenenbaum, and his three amazing children. In their childhood, things break down, and now it is his mission to seek redemption.This is one of the most interesting films I have ever seen. It is filled with an excellent cast, soundtrack, and Wes Anderson's direction is top-notch, with a brilliant dialogue.I don't really know what else to say, it is a depressing yet cool movie, and it works. It has some funny moments, and at the end it will leave pensive and curious.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Anderson stuns us again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Rushmore, Wes Anderson already sold me with his witty black-comedy humor and excellent casting. A dysfunctional family with a heartless, yet charismatic father played by Gene Hackman attempts to recover the family ties. Gene Hackman does so by telling his family he is near death and wishes to spend his last days with them. These last couple of weeks where the family reunites and blends together reveals new secrets by each character. Wes Anderson creates this "stuck in the 70's" mood by his choice of indie wardrobe, classic 70's music, typical NYC settings and even makeup, as shown through Gweneth Paltrow's mod eyeliner. Music by the velvet underground, the Beatles and even the Ramon's, it really creates the feel for each mood of the characters. With salmon pink painted walls, the Indian doorman, and the detailed bedrooms, the house shows a personality of its own. All three of Angelica Houston and Gene Hackman's siblings return home, as well as Gene Hackman himself, to come to closure and resolution with their individual, as well as family, issues which only brings them closer together. I found the movie incredibly entertaining and it's one of my top three movies of all time. If you enjoy dark humor and classic 70's music fitted in each scene as well as excellent actors playing ridiculous characters, then you'll definitely love this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many others have given such eloquent commentary on this extraordinary film that all I can really add is that Wes Anderson is a genius! (Not that that hasn't already been observed by others.) Anderson has a body of work that is highly literate and highly literary -- here, the novelistic quality of his movies is directly referenced on-screen -- and it's his greatest strength (among many great strengths). Anderson is a writer/director that creates whole worlds that echo our own but are very much part of his psyche, and his ideas and ideals are warmly human and thoughtful.If I had to lump Wes Anderson with anybody else (which would be a crime), I'd put him with Charlie Kaufman (BEING JOHN MALKOVICH) and the Coen Brothers (THE HUDSUCKER PROXY). Gentler than the Coens, more hopeful than Kaufman, he nevertheless shares these other directors' secret status as modern fantasists: None of them are *called* fantasy filmmakers, but that's what they are.Of course, the entire cast of THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS turn in crackerjack performances (though Ben Stiller is a bit stiff), Mark Mothersbaugh creates an evocative and quirky score, and even Alec Baldwin does a solid job of narration. Standouts include Danny Glover for the pivotal role of Henry Sherman and Angelica Huston, as well as the ever-excellent Gene Hackman.A funny, smart, offbeat movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is one of few films which is appealing on a variety of different levels. It is compiled of subtle humour, perfectly illustrated characters and a gripping storyline- all the components for an excellent film. The characters are so excellent in this film- all at once they can make you cry, wretch or laugh. Another excellent point to this movie is its music soundtrack. From the interesting Elliot Smith, whose "Needle in the Hay" perfectly compliments the depressing lows of Richie to the beauty of "These Days" by The Velvet Underground to the marvelously composed theme music of Mark Mothersbaugh. The Royal Tenembaulms is an excellently written and composed film and is certainly one that should be seen before your demise. Once again Wes Anderson delivers an interesting and entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Royal Tenenbaums" is set in a fictional city, but it feels as much a New York movie, and Woody Allen homage, as "Sidewalks of New York."The ensemble of quirky crazies, with sidekicks who seem to be amateur actors, is a hoot, marred by repetition when some of the characters don't develop or change, particularly Gwyneth Paltrow's one-note depressive.What a surprise to read in "The New York Times" yesterday that auteur Wes Anderson was more influenced by Truffaut than David Lynch or Fellini -- huh?Gene Hackman is simply having a ball, breezing through. An extra joke, a la "Long Riders," is having the Wilson brothers play best friends, not brothers. The camera is a part of the ensemble as well, as we're always aware of placement, restricted view, and angles, reinforcing a dysfunctional family locked together.The pop musical selections are equally quirky.

		<fullReview>This film has caused a lot of comment and discussion. It seems a person either likes it or hates it. I'm in neither camp, but don't wish to sit through it again, thank you very much. Tries, and succeeds, to be different, but that's all. With a cast such as this, it should have been brilliant. Hackman won awards for his performance?? He is playing, as, for me he always does, Gene Hackman, but just dressed up rather oddly.Bill Murray should have played the part. No character development anywhere in sight. Gwyneth was wasted, Stiller played himself. Filling a movie with actors and then making it look as though they were all playing their parts in different rooms,(and in some cases, different countries.)does not work for me. It looked as if the cast were embarrassed much of the movie. Murray in particular wondering,"What am I doing in this?" My verdict? A pretentious mess. Not the worst movie ever, as someone has suggested, just a bore!!( I would give the soundtrack the thumbs up, terrific stuff.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie this afternoon. The first part of the movie was spent describing everyone in their youth, the next part was spent showing their present state of affairs, and then it was over.I read somewhere where someone described the characters as paper dolls in a shadowbox, and compared the movie to a doll house.After I watched the movie I felt "empty." I said "what the hell happened here in those 2 hours?" Big deal, we learned that they're all weird and someone tried to off himself. Big deal. Royal Tenenbuam wanting to bring the fam together is just a device used to bring these characters back together to place them in this "doll house." The scenes are beautifully and meticulously set-up, and maybe this is why nobody ever moves. It's like looking at photographs on the wall come to life - somewhat. Everything seems so random and has no payoff. The characters reactions are bizarre and minimalist. I kept thinking "well maybe this is a metaphor for something." Maybe it was supposed relate to a greater, more epic story or something. Richie, with his long hair and beard, at points, looked kind of like Jesus, and his reactions were sort of Jesus-like, (i.e., you're my brother and I love you."), and in fact, he was set up to be the "savior" of the family...Sort of trying to get everyone to understand Royal's side of things, and vice versa. But that was never actualized (and admittedly, would have been pretty cliché if it had). Alas, we see that Richie feels The Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name for his (adopted) sister, Gwynneth Paltrow. He tries to kill himself (a decidedly un-Jesus thing to do) after learning that his sister is a slut who smokes like a chimney. (Also, did anyone else think that in certain parts, he bears a resemblance to that stupid skit from SNL, "The Falconer?") Just Weird. Why? Nobody knows, and after watching the Directors Comments, I don't think there is an answer. The parts with Luke Wilson and Gwyneth, and when Luke attempts suicide, are really the best parts of the movie. It's the closest it comes to any actual emotion. Other than that, everyone and everything seems so oddly detached. It seems so over-edited or something. It almost reminded me of those (I think) Calvin Klein ads in the '80s for Eternity or Obsession, where 2 people would have a totally random "conversation" while never even looking at each other. (I don't remember the ads but they went something like "His eyes are trees." "My head is weightless." "Purple is Angry." or something equally "deep." And then some french-accent voice-over.) Basically, the substance of this movie is about the same.I thought "there must be some meaning beyond this." So I watched the movie AGAIN - with the director's commentary. Wes Anderson just talked about himself and all of the clever ways he came up with this color for the background and how very CLEVER he is and he did this, he did that, all about technical stuff. Sadly, this man suffers from delusions of grandeur, likely because of all of the yes men around him. All he spoke about was how he set up the shot, how he thought of this, he thought of that, etc. The word "I" was stated more than I have ever heard it said in a 2 hour space of time. Nothing about the characters, really. Nothing to answer the question WHY they do what they do, or what he's trying to say. In fact, more than a few times, he said, "I don't know why I decided to do it that way, but it seemed to work." Don't waste your time. Those who attack people who have a less than favorable opinion of this movie as "just not getting it" or being somehow intellectually challenged, WRONG. To all of those people I must say that if Wes Anderson is the brilliant filmmaker you purport, then the running joke that he's playing is actually on you. This film requires very little intellectual work beyond what you see on the screen. The movie would have been much more satisfying and worthwhile if he actually did give it an actual story, rather than just a contrived set-up tool masquerading as a plot.This director pays a lot of attention to detail. So much so that I think he neglects the "big picture" - i.e., the story. He misses the forest for all the little the trees. Oh well.That said, I will give this movie a couple of stars for its amazing attention to detail. I just wish one of those details was the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tend to avoid any movie suggested to me by self-confessed film fanatics and washed-out "I'm working on a script with dreams of fame, but right now I'm cleaning out toilets" co-workers. This film was suggested to me by the latter, and guess what? I broke my own rule. Well, I waited a few months and saw it on cable, so maybe I didn't. Or maybe I did since I actually did see it. Well, it doesn't matter.The Royal Tenenbaums is one of those artsy quirky-for-the-sake-of-quirky movies. I really haven't seen to many (the aforementioned washed up film "connoisseurs") of them, but this is certainly one of them.The basic plot that I grasped was that an selfish, aging man who's lost his family and fortune decides to make a stab at redemption and make up with his estranged wife and children. He comes back to find one son hating him, his wife with his former business partner, and the rest just drifting along in the stream of life. The plot makes many twists and turns, as do the quirky subplots.The main plot itself is PAX-TV fare. Old bad guy tries to make everything right before he dies. Overall, nothing new and innovative here; but the sub-plots (one son's breakdown, adopted son's drug-use, etc.) keep some of the interest while the main plot languishes.The actors all turn in minimalistic performances (the screenplay doesn't allow for much else), but they're all fairly good at what they do, especially Anjelica Huston and Luke Wilson. The style of the movie is what most contributes to the humor. Almost retro '70s style, though it's set in present times.And... the "humor" (or lack thereof) is what most irks me about this. As a straight drama, the movie is more than adequate. But the comedy is mostly wooden. It's all cerebral humor, which really isn't a problem normally. I "got" the humor of most of it, but none of it was especially funny, and it left nothing buy an afterthough that says "Well, that was supposed to be funny..."This film is best for the aforementioned connoisseurs, who think anything highly stylized and with Oscar buzz is good. For anyone else, take it by ear. If you see it on TV and there's nothing better on, it's worth watching. Anyone who likes humor with more body that's not as flat, you'll hate this as a comedy.Rating: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This amazing, endearing, hysterical film is tough to label. Perhaps the best description I've heard is that THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is "an adult world seen through a child's eye." There is definitely an innocent quality to everything you see in this film, although the humor is usually very intellectual. Furthermore, every performance is note-perfect, from Gene Hackman as the rascally head of the family, to Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Luke Wilson as the kids- all screwed-up, bitter, and melancholy in their own ways. Although the story deals with some very difficult familial themes- ranging from divorce, abuse, neglect, even incest(!)- THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is never downbeat. Amazingly, this heavy subject matter is presented as if it were all lightweight kid's stuff- and somehow, it all works.</fullReview>

This is also the kind of movie you have to watch more than one time. Each time I find a little joke or something about the scenery that makes me laugh. Even the most mundane phrases become funny (i.e "Stop belittling me"). The soundtrack is also out of this world. The music fits perfectly, from the Rolling Stones in the tent with Margot &amp; Richie, outlining their relationship, to Elliott Smith's "Needle In The Hay" during Richie's suicide attempt. A few of my friends found it boring, but it all depends on what kind of humor you like. I give my approval this movie to anyone who likes dry/dark humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only in the movies can a con man be cured</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Question: Can a two-bit, chiseling, psychopath and bully of a con man (Royal O'Reilly Tenenbaum) be re-born late in life as a human being?Answer: Only in the movies. Specifically, in this movie. I have seen such con men try to "be real," but it always turns out to be just another con. Wes Anderson built his movie on this unlikely -- make that impossible -- premise. He created an alternate universe, where a con man can be healed by love. There is a note of poignancy here, as if there were a psychopath in Anderson's own life, perhaps his father, whom he hoped would some day change. This cannot happen in real life, con men never change, so Anderson went ahead and made it happen on screen. And he did it well. As a straight drama this story would have been unbearably bleak. But as surreal fantasy with comedic structure, it tells it like it isn't -- a modern fairy tale rooted obliquely in the absurd, a fantasy of a world that only superficially resembles our own. Think of it as an intergenerational Amelie. The Royal Tenenbaums is clever, well cast (except for Bill Murray, who seems in a hurry to leave), superbly executed, and fully engaging. At least it was to me. On the other hand I can understand not liking this movie, especially if one is still susceptible to psychopaths (hint: if you watch Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw, or Ted Koppel, you're susceptible to being conned).Hey, Hey, Hey! Wake up! It is OK not to be conned. The emperor really has no clothes. You have permission to stop being a victim. Turn around and walk away. In my business I daily encounter antique collectors who have been conned repeatedly, and usually it is because they cannot admit the possibility of being conned, so they just go along and make up a rationale for why it's not a con, when of course it is. Etheline Tenenbaum gets it. You can too. *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The above is the question Royal Tenenbaum poses to his "adopted daughter" Margo. Royal is a self-centered, shameless SOB. His whole life has been devoted to his own personal desire for comfort. However, as Royal grows older, he realizes that he has missed out on the most important thing in life, family. In his case, his family is a creative assortment of professional tennis players, aspiring playwrights and genius entrepreneurs. Wes Anderson has made what I think is the finest film of the last decade. His imaginative script elicits incredible performances from Hackman, Stillar, the Wilson brothers, etc. The wonderful music enhances unforgettable scenes that stay with you forever. Who would have thought that someone could make me become a fan of the music of Nico and Elliot Smith. I don't know of another director that involves so much detail into a story. There is so much thought and imagination behind everything. This is not so much a movie, but rather a work of art. I laughed during this film and I cried. The one thing that I wished was that it could continue for hours more. I really think in Wes Anderson, America has found its next Orson Welles and with the Tenenbaums, the Citizen Kane of our time. Perfect film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the cast and the advertisements, I thought this would be a great film. I didn't catch it in the theater. I waited for cable, and boy am I glad I didn't pay for this one.I've only walked out of one film I paid for in my whole life (Ready to Wear), but had I paid for this, I would have walked out.The opening of the film was genius, but it deteriorated rapidly. This film was boring, pretentious, dull, and an overall waste of two perfectly good hours of one's life. I couldn't believe that this many good actors would sign on to this script. What were they thinking? One has to assume that either they read another script and it was changed, or that they were offered god-awful sums of money to participate in this fiasco.How this rates a 7.6 out of 10, I'll never guess. Who is rating this thing above a 5? I gave it a 4. I would only recommend that you watch this if you are incredibly bored and there is nothing else on cable.This film wants to be an art film, but it fails. One of my friends who is an avid film buff once told me: "I love well done films, but sometimes directors get so full of themselves that they create an overly pretentious mouthpiece for their supposed genius." This is just such a film. I got the feeling that Wes Anderson was giving his best attempt to demonstrate his infallible genius rather than to actually make a great film. If you want to see a great film...in the kind of genre and tone this film wanted to be...then I sincerely recommend you watch Being John Malkovich or Adaptation instead. Charlie Kaufmann is a genius, but after seeing The Royal Tenenbaums, I have to conclude that Wes Anderson wanted to prove he could do something on the same level as Being John Malkovich, and made an incredibly dull film instead.Okay, so enough ranting.... On the good side, the costumes are entertaining, the sets are unusual, and the actors turn in decent performances given that they had utter garbage to work with in the script.</fullReview>

For me, watching this film was what I imagine watching a very long, very bad "Saturday Night Live" sketch would be like.Far from being subtle, nuanced, or understated, the acting of most of the players was as transparent as a vacuum. There are, among others, Ben Stiller ("Hey! I'm angry!"), Gwyneth Paltrow ("Hello. I'm depressed."), Luke Wilson ("Hi. I'm wallowing in the despair of a secret, unrequited love."), and Owen Wilson ("Hey there. Not only do I act in this movie, but I co-wrote and co-produced it as well. Am I talented or what?!"). Gene Hackman does a solid job in the role of Royal Tenenbaum, but by being surrounded by these others, his performance appears better than it really is. Anjelica Huston, Danny Glover, and Bill Murray are along for the ride, going through the motions as they wait for more suitable vehicles to which they can hitch their flagging careers.The writing suffers from trying to convey too many things: humor, angst, ennui, anger, affection, etc. The result is an inchoate teratoma of a script that can't decide what it wants to be. If co-writer/director Anderson were trying to make a film redolent with dark humor, he should have asked Todd Solondz for advice. If he were aiming for irony, then he would have done well to have given Jim Jarmusch a call. For a film about people living "lives of quiet desperation," Mike Leigh is your man. After seeing "The Royal Tenenbaums" and the also critically acclaimed "Rushmore," I must say that Wes Anderson is well on his way to being the most over-hyped director since Steven Soderbergh.This film will be best appreciated by twenty-somethings and precocious teenagers who believe they 'get it' better than anyone else, whatever 'it' may be (Life, the Universe, and Everything). And judging from many of the comments, that appears to be be the right demographic. I find it telling that many who thought this to be an excellent film feel a need to heap abuse on those who would disagree. Rating: 4/10.</fullReview>

Apart from that it was bitter frustration and agony watching this piece of garbage. Incoherent junk (well, what can you expect of a movie with with Ben "I suck bigtime" Stiller in it).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With such an impressive cast, you would think that "The Royal Tenenbaums" would have been a whole lot better. I can see from the voting history, that the majority of IMDb users liked it. I'm afraid that I cannot agree. What with such names in the cast as Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke and Owen Wilson, Bill Murray and Danny Glover, I guess I expected a lot more. Billed as a comedy, I don't think I laughed once. Hackman is Royal Tenenbaum the head of the family who left 22 years earlier to follow his own selfish interests. Now broke he feigns a fatal illness to work his way back into the good graces of his family. Huston (I haven't slept with a man in 18 years) looks bored in her limited role as Ethel, the mother. The three Tenenbaum children, after showing flashes of brilliance in their youth, have now descended into the dark side of life. Stiller plays Chas who once showed promise as a financier but has now degenerated into a paranoid widower with two look a like, dress a like boys. Paltrow (complete with Tammy Faye eye makeup) plays Margot who was once a promising playwright and now locks herself in the bathroom and looks stoned all the time. Her husband Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray) is I think, a shrink who always seems to be analyzing his stepson (Stephen Lea Sheppard). The third sibling is Ritchie (Luke Wilson) a failed tennis pro who harbors a secret desire for a forbidden fruit. Also in the mix is next door neighbor Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) who winds up being a spaced out druggie and Danny Glover who sleep walks through his role as Henry Sherman, Ethel's suitor. Eventually all come home to roost and through Hackman's efforts the "children" regain their confidence and everybody lives happily ever after. The only performance in the film that I liked was that of Hackman as the didn't give a damn father who upon going broke, suddenly realizes that he has to regain his family before he dies. The other principals seem to be in another world. Ben Stiller IS NOT funny; Bill Murray (with a fright beard)IS NOT funny; Gwyneth Paltrow looks half asleep; the Wilson brothers are in other worlds (I suppose Owen has to take some of the blame because he co-wrote the script); and Danny Glover is totally wasted. For what its worth, the film is narrated in sleepy manner by Alec Baldwin. If this was a comedy, I must have slept through the funny parts. A real disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Step forward The Royal Tenebaums, for the above honour. I begrudge even wasting usage of my computer on this film it was so cringe makingly woeful. Dysfunctional families can be quite interesting in films or TV. Unfortunately these were dysfunctional but also dislikable in the highest possible manner &amp; consequently at no point will ever give a monkeys toss what happens to any of the characters. Nor do I believe the man in charge of writing the alleged jokes (&amp; I use the term 'jokes' in the loosest possible sense) should ever receive a fee for this tripe. Shame, as all the actors are good. Could be another example of the difference in humour between continents but it's a relief to see many of the European reviewers here are equally baffled how this film has a high rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yada yada</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one of those people who believes that if a director made one excellent movie, then all of his future films must also be considered pure genius. Wes Anderson is an example of this phenomenon. This movie, the Royal Tenenbaums, lacks depth and lacks soul. The characters, as others have said on this forum, are mere caricatures of real people. The children of Royal Tenenbaum seem to represent all the worst qualities of young people associated with the "slacker" generation. Selfishness, venality, hedonism, egomania, egocentrism and more are seen here in the younger cast members. By contrast, Royal Tenenbaum (who Anderson inexplicably calls the "villain" in his DVD commentary) comes across as a flawed, but friendly and down-to-earth guy. Gene Hackman makes this movie worth watching, but that's the only reason to watch. I'd watch him read from the phone booth and that might be an improvement over this movie. What could have made this better? Look at Rushmore, which is a true masterpiece of story-telling. There, the whole story is funny and intriguing because we see the Schwartzbaum character displaying his genius throughout his childhood and we believe he is gifted in some way. Sometimes his genius is manipulating people, but in an earnest way. He has a manic energy which is infectious, which contrasts sharply to the droopy slackers in Royal Tenenbaums. Supposedly, the children of Royal Tenenbaum are geniuses also, but that part of the character development (a crucial part) is given the yada yada treatment and I never accepted these children (now adults) as once possessing genius or charm or precocity. They just seem to be ciphers. Now the movie wants to make a statement that divorce takes a toll on children, but that would be a dramatic theme which seems beyond the scope of this comedic film. Also, as drama, it's not very convincing because, once again, we never learned to like Royal's children at any point during the story. Also, much of their suffering seems self-induced and part of a strategy to shift the blame (to their father) for personal failures so as to avoid taking responsibility for themselves. As always, Gene Hackman is excellent to watch as a craftsman, but he deserved a better movie than this. I wanted to love this movie just as I loved Rushmore. However, this one didn't make the grade. For Hackman's performance only, I give the Royal Tenenbaums 5 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might be a little too cute, but who cares?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson deserves high marks for originality, tremendous art direction, and all and all a very well crafted film. Unfortunately, there are too many characters for any real depth. With the exception of perhaps Gene Hackman, all the actors in this film come off as caricatures. And needless to say, there is only a hint of a plot, and little or no character development.In another age, some might say that many layers of fascinating atmosphere and detail are not adequate compensation for an embryonic story. Of course, those days are long gone. There are no real standards anymore. In fact, most of the Hollywood product has no more substance than the cartoons they are based on. Nevertheless, Anderson is able to capture his quirky vision on film. I came away with the same feeling I get from the typical Woody Allen effort. Maybe the overall result is a little too cute, but who cares? (6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, i try not to be the guy who doesn't "get" anything because i hate it when people don't understand my favorite movies. This time, however, i'm going to have to be that guy. I watched this during the summer (in the middle of the night) and didn't enjoy it too much, i wasn't into the story, didn't care about the characters, and thought that the second half of the film was even more boring than the first. My friend recently rented Tenenbaums again so i gave it another try and watched it at a reasonable hour. Still, no dice. The humor is too dry, there aren't any good laughs, and the story isn't even terribly original. The acting is NOT superb, it might have been if the story had given the actors more to go on. I got what the audience was supposed to be laughing at (theyre neurotic, right?) but i didn't find it funny. Henry Sherman (Danny Glover) falling into a construction pit while having a conversation and the person he is talking to doesn't notice and continues on? This was the "brilliance" everyone seems to get except for me?What i DID get this time was the direction was above par. It is a colorful movie, reminds me a lot of Amelie (strange this movie was made 2 years later...) and the music was pretty good too. That is, however, not enough to get more than a 5 in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Irritating to Be Likeable (5/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[I saw this on DVD, YMMV]This movie starts out very slowly. There is a droning narration over a long sequence that introduces us (very slowly) to all the Tenenbaums (Royal and Ethel; their children Chas, Margot, and Richie; and a wannabe, Eli Cash) and their past. Not satisfied with that, the movie starts over again to introduce each of the characters to us again (very slowly) as they are 22 years later. Its an irritatingly long setup for a weak payoff.Nothing about this film is particularly funny. The attempt at slapstick when Henry Sherman (Danny Glover) falls into a hole falls as flat as Sherman does.Nothing about this film is particularly dramatic. Anderson cannot bring himself to write a true bastard of a man. Instead he keeps placing Royal Tenenbaum into situations where is just a likeable, selfish boob.The characters are so flat and frigid that the incesteous relationship between Richie and Margot seems surreal. There is no passion on either part. There is nothing but a connection to the past when they ran away together as children.One part that works is the music. I was pulled into the movie as Richie changes his appearance deliberately and dramatically while Elliot Smith's _Needle in the Hay_ floats in the air. But I started to get irritated again as the complete flatness of the characters continued.I am not from a divorced family. Perhaps Wes Anderson is relying on people to supply reasons for the odd actions of the Tenenbaum children from their own experience. Reading other reviews here seem to suggest that intimate experience with divorce helps in connecting with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film again, and I just noticed how the wondefully aged, but somehow not dated, everything is. The music, games, book designs, interior design, clothing, and feel of this movie is so seamless, and reminds me of "Ghost Dog", in which everything surrounding the characters screams out "the best has passed". The story, pacing, and dialogue are so uniquely Wes Anderson that if you're in that kind of mood, there's nothing better. If not, or if you disliked his previous work, it's just another movie. The casting is top-notch, and the actors give a wonderful performance. In my opinion, this is the director's finest work to date, and I hope that he continues putting out work that is this unique and of this caliber.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[possible spoiler] This flick seems to inspire extreme opinions from folks. Let me come down somewhere in the middle: despite an opening that promises some great comic potential, and some truly zany - and subtle - comic touches, this flick never achieves liftoff. The precious convention of "bookishness" - presenting the story, chapter by chapter, as a novel - gets annoying after a while, and the film bogs down as it devolves from its comic plane to some attempts at genuine emotion. In other words, it's another in that plethora of movies we've seen lately that can't make up its mind what it wants to be. I groaned when I figured out that Royal - the venal, selfish, completely unscrupulous reprobate - was going to turn out to be the agent of the family's reunion, and that this dark comedy of zany, flawed personalities was going to be ruined by a saccharine happy ending. Having said that, Gene Hackmann's performance as the wily and blissfully blase scoundrel Royal sustains the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too many commenters here feel it necessary to slam others who don't like a film they loved. I saw comments here like "If you didn't 'get' this film, go back to watching Adam Sandler".For the record, I'm serious about films. Since I am VERY economic with my time, I rarely rent poor movies. Yes, I miss some good ones, but I almost never find myself watching a movie I thoroughly dislike. I've only shut off one or two movies mid-way, and I almost shut TRT off.I thought the screenplay was weak, and the "style" of the film was off. Devices I didn't like included the overt "chaptering" of the film, and the expository method chosen to introduce the characters. The casting was strange: Bill Murray in a small, unfunny role (at which I thought he did well), or Ben Stiller in a tense dramatic role (at which I thought he did poorly).The entire effort smelled too much like a private joke. Apparently the Wilson brothers and the director have known each other for years, so I guess this was a vanity effort. You know the script isn't very witty when the costumes are supposed to get laughs: characters wear the same outfit throughout their lives, for example, and for a funeral red sweat suits are replaced by black ones, ha ha ha.I gave it a "2" only because I respect Hackman and Huston too much to push the key with the "1" on it. The movie confirmed one thing for me: "Behind Enemy Lines" was not a fluke; I really, really do not like Owen Wilson playing ANY role....</fullReview>

The film is burdened down with, among other things, too many loose plot ends, characters who simply enter and leave (prolonged "extras" roles, perhaps?), plot motivations that really come to nothing, a script that seems to go on and on and on, and a tedium level that made me think this film was a royal bore, as well.There are a few pleasant moments, however to call this a comedy, is a bit of a stretch (and more than a little misleading). The coarse amount of self-indulgence displayed by almost every character, echoed dsyfunction, not humor. A movie should have more to offer, than a "nifty" (expect more sales) soundtrack.Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, et al, make some attempts, yet can't overcome the turgid, poorly written script. Half the supporting cast looked as if they were sleepwalking. I came to envy them about three quarters through this film.Frankly, THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS reminded me of bad and endless "LOVE, AMERICAN STYLE", retooled up for the new millenium. For rabid fans of Hackman only.NOT RECOMMENDED.</fullReview>

I wouldn't have bothered writing a comment on it if the rating was lower but now I feel the need to warn the potential viewer about it. This is one of those pretentious films that have emerged lately and which try to emulate comedy but... taking it to a (supposedly) higher level. A local leftist film-critic loved it because it actually shows that Americans are not all as happy as the media would want us to believe (or something like that...). Wow! How smart!Let's face it people. A comedy is supposed to make you laugh. If it doesn't , it's not a comedy - at least not a good one. A few funny moments, a set of oddball characters and a very good set of songs from the 60's and 70's do not necessarily make a good comedy nor a good film. In this case, they make a long, long set of scenes that never ever manages to take off. If Hollywood quite often brings out commercial garbage, we're not gonna fall for pretentious anti-commercial garbage either. 5/10 for me.</fullReview>

And while I enjoyed it at the time, on reflection it has very little depth or lasting substance. The Tenenbaums are a family of dysfunctional eccentrics straight out of vintage J.D.Salinger or John Irving, but are too cartoon-like to invest any real emotional commitment. The movie is wonderful to look at, their are some genuinely inspired comic moments, the acting is very good for the most part (especially Owen Wilson's typically charismatic turn), and once again it has an interesting and eclectic soundtrack, but unlike 'Rushmore' I didn't believe these characters. That's the bottom line. Worth watching without a doubt, but don't expect too much. A 'Hotel New Hampshire' for the 21st century, but that's about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw Rushmore, Bottle Rocket. Fell in love with Wes thanks to liberal use of the Kinks, well-placed awkward teenage floundering, perfect swearing, and the poignant sting of misappropriated genius. Flush with erudition I cringed at bad reviews from co-workers... "it's boring." "what time period was it supposed to be in?" Idiots, I guffed. They don't understand Wes' concept of our generation's neo-americana...the aura of the decaying institution -like hardwood floors in a public school, board games, typewriters, rotary phones. That's what the music is really all about - those songs are really the stuff of our Sesame Street childhood, bells and harps and wailing punk genius. Tenenbaums seems to make the most of those props - really bringing it into decaying New York luxury, failed aristocracy, smudged celebrity. The idiom is too lush for words, like a coveted childhood novel you can still enjoy, timeless yet static...but the language behind it - this time the movement was missing. I wanted Gene Hackman to let loose, I wanted Bill Murray to do something, I wanted it to be bolder. Royal isn't supposed to go around saying out loud that he wants his family back. The whole genius behind Rushmore and BottleRocket was each character's insanity was tenaciously preserved, even as they acted as if they were completely normal. There is still redemption, change, growth for each character, but no self-consciousness. Not so in Tenenbaums - each character keeps commenting on how crazy they all are, as if they knew the difference! The only good part was when Royal takes the kids out - even this could have been a little bolder. Everyone was holding back. So yes, I get it, I understand Wes' vision, I think he's great - but this time he missed the mark. There needed to be more writing and less fluff. Sorry - I was really bored and disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just for the record, I liked Rushmore a lot. I used to complain to people that it was unfairly overshadowed, in awards and recognition, by another low budget comedy that came out the same year--Election.So needless to say, I was incredibly disappointed with Royal Tenenbaums. It's a disjointed, meandering, catatonic mess of a movie held together by seemingly endless voice-over. And no, this garbage was NOT funny. Quirky? Sure. Colorful? I suppose. All-Star cast? You bet. But these things do not a good movie make. Sure, Gene Hackman was steady, and there were intermittent humorous or clever moments, but these were overwhelmed the dull, forced and utterly pointless parts of this colossal failure.I find it sad and telling that a number of critics, and quite a few people commenting on this website, would praise this obvious dud simply because (I suspect) it was made by a couple of young, up-and-coming filmmakers who have one good movie under their belts. The Auteur theory is alive and well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has its moments but it often tries too hard to be hip and cool and often instead winds up just borring and silly. Though Gene Hackman as the patriarch of the gifted but flawed Tenenbaum family delivers a solid performance, supporting players often seem to be going through the motions and director Wes Anderson seems to think that weird = funny which isnt always the case. The film does produce a few laughs, but not enough in my estimation to make this film work on it's own merits. GRADE: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Royal Tenenbaums are to movies what a hangover is to drinking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would first like to ask if everyone that is reviewing this movie has actually seen the same film that I have watched, because the words "incredible", "best of 2001", and "masterpiece" are the last words that come to mind when I review my thoughts on this film. There is no need to re-iterate the basic plot and characters of the film, as the have been adequately laid out in other reviews. Instead I'll give a basic run down of what is wrong with this film.The film itself starts interestingly enough, with a fine cast in the roles of an eccentric family that has been apart for years, but is brought back together for various reasons. We are shown snippets of the Tenenbaums, and through the film we learn bits about their childhoods, their pasts, and where they currently stand. Everyone seems to have their own quirks, but alas, by the time the film marks the half way point, you start to wonder - where is this story going? The answer: no where. It plods along at the same pace throughout, and is mildly engaging, but has no real story to tell.Of course, there are snippets of real life that might make you smile in recognition from time to time, but it is far from what one would term a 'Comedy'. The few true comedic lines come from Royal Tenebaum's (Gene Hackman) faithful servant Pagoda (Kumar Pallana). Unfortunately, this accounts for less than a minute of the films overall running time. The rest of the time, I assume we are supposed to find humor in the extreme eccentricities of a deplorable cast of characters, as they pull us through scene after scene of monotonous monologue.There are some who say that Bill Murray or Danny Glover "stand out" in this film. I dont see how this could be further from the truth since both only have about 4 lines throughout the entire film. The same can be said of Anjelica Houston, who's entire character consists of yelling at Royal from time to time, and otherwise just staring ahead with a vague smile.Overall, the film is not horrible, but it is far from something great. Wait for a rental on a really boring night, and make sure you watch it alone, because I'm sure if you rented it with friends at least one of them will never let you pick a movie again. What else can I say? A waste of money for people sucked in by the trailers, and an even bigger waste of money for whoever backed this film, because when it hits wide release, no amount of stars will be able to make this piece of cement float.

		<shortDescription>A Woody Allen movie gone bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What motivates the critics to consider this a sterling movie? If it is plot, dialogue, comedic effect, suspense, interesting characters, then I am at a loss. The movie was largely unintelligible, witless and senseless. Either critics have morphed into teenagers or they are so taken with directors' inside jokes, photographic techniques and other cultish aspects as to make these more important than the plot. Whether the story makes any sense or whether there is any rhythm or rhyme to the movie seems to matter very little. Woody Allen produces decent movies even as he creates odd characters and attempts satirical parodies. At least most of his movies entertain and follow a story line. As to the Royal Tenenbaums, they were a royal pain in the butt. Unfortunately, so was the acting. If this be greatness - the Wilson Boys and Hackman - oh my. Hackman was playing himself - such acting! I liked Anjelica while Danny and Gwyneth were OK, but Bill Murray and that Stiller fellow? Egads. Fortunately, I saved the popcorn bucket to upchuck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a royal waste of time !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a monumental disappointment! It's unfortunate that The Royal Tenenbaums is such a waste of time and talent. The story was pointless, trivial, and odd. What was the deal with the matching Addidas outfits anyway? In fact, the funniest thing in the film was to learn at the end that the narrator was Alec Baldwin. Now that was truly hysterical! However, the film was not. Just looking at the talent in this film makes me almost angry that I spent two hours watching these fine actors waste my time and theirs in a cinematic yawner such as this. All could have been solved if just one person had called for a psychiatrist. This entire group needs therapy. Where are some good neighbors when you need them? Couldn't anyone intervene and suggest the obvious? Therapy. Medication. Anything to get these oddballs back on their feet. Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson (Luke's brother and co-writer of this time-waster), Danny Glover, and Bill Murray. Each has made films ten times better than this. Who can forget Bill Murray in such truly great films as Groundhog Day, What About Bob?, Quick Change, Tootsie, Stripes, or even the Man Who Knew Too Little? Or Danny Glover in the Lethal Weapon series or the (better) Silverado. Gene Hackman was terrific in the French Connection, The Heist, The Package, The Firm, Bat 21, Hoosiers, and even Narrow Margin and Behind Enemy Lines, which also starred Owen Wilson, who was great in Shanghai Noon, Zoolander, Meet the Parents and Behind Enemy Lines. Owen's brother, Luke Wilson did a great job in Legally Blonde. Okay, so he needs better roles, but I'm sure they'll come in time. Now Ben Stiller was outstanding in Keeping the Faith, Zoolander, Meet the Parents, as well as Reality Bites. And Angelica Huston and Gwyneth Paltrow ... two terrific actresses whom I'm sure have done great work. I just can't recall seeing any films they were in that I liked. Nonetheless, this only proves my point. There are better films out there. My advice... see virtually anything else these fine actors and actresses have done, resist the hype of this film, ignore the critics, and save your money for better cinematic experiences. This film earns a mediocre 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much could have been funny and was unexplained. So many scenes began and ended on open notes of indifference. So much pain! So much of the acting was monotone apathy, which is fine but if you're going to have that sort of delivery then the lines need to spark on their own. For the most part, the script was full of visual quirks and bland dialogue. The only thing on fire in this movie was the set designer who must have spent days on each room.I loved "Rushmore" and was looking forward to seeing the maturation of Wes Anderson in his third full-length film. Instead I saw a regression. Admittedly he's very intelligent and it shows once again in his humor. But telling a joke doesn't require quantum physics smarts. It's very simple: set-up and punchline. Yet Anderson misses the second half of the equation throughout most of the film. He has enough set-ups to last for the rest of his career. He packs the film with so many beginnings that there's no time for a satisfactory ending. Half-breed mice, oddly named pets, Halloween clothing and a quiet Indian servant. It's a nice and good until you wait for the payoff. "Royal Tenenbaums" had such great potential and ended up being just a scatological listing of quirky character traits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as fun as I had hoped it would be. Still an enjoyable movie to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No I'm definitely not a Wes Anderson fan (even though I certainly get and understand his style) and I'll probably never become one. You'll either just hate his movies or just totally love it.I saw "Rushmore" and though I enjoyed it, I certainly did not loved it. "The Royal Tenenbaums" seemed like a more enjoyable and completely humor filled movie, so I decided to give it a chance. Just like "Rushmore" I enjoyed watching the movie but I wasn't always exactly fully amused and the movie did not always entertain- or was fun enough.The movie is filled with some eccentric, quirky over-the-top characters, set in a normal world. The characters are weird but they're certainly not funny. Not any of them is ever given something interesting or fun to do in this movie, which seems to be a waste, considering when looking at the cast of the movie. Ben Stiller is holding back and Bill Murray is given too little screen time to become an interesting or hilarious character. Guess that the movie also has way too many characters in it, which does begin to work distracting from each other after a while.The comedy and humor of Wes Anderson movies is always in its little and subtle things. Each sequences is carefully crafted and fully thought out. Every time you watch this movie you'll discover new fun small things set in the background or a small piece of dialog or character behavior. So I definitely understand and appreciate Anderson's style but yet I just don't enjoy it as much. Just not my type of movie and style of film-making.The entire movie is made in intro-style. So scene's rapidly follow each other and everything is build up and break down again in basically 5 minutes time. To me this is a very tiresome way of film-making that doesn't work amusing enough for me. It's good at first but it's starting to get old already after a while.Saving grace for me was Gene Hackman. He certainly added some style and power to the movie as the rude and not so subtle father of the family. In my opinion he also was the true main fun thing about the movie. Even more fun and hilarious than Bill Murray in the movie. I think that says something about the entire amusement level of the movie as a whole.In all honesty the movie did entertain me and this was mostly because of the little subtle things in the movie. As a whole, so with the characters, style and story included, the movie just didn't strike me as an perfectly amusing one. But most likely the Anderson fans shall not complain.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Anderson pays attention to extraneous details and smothers his movies with cuteness. TRT hasn't evolved from the promise of "Rushmore". "Rushmore" was fun and promising but after two feature-length films, "The Royal Tanenbaums" and "Life Aquatic" he still hasn't developed past his high school autobiography. Obviously he commands a lot of star power and financing, more than is good for him. He wastes the talent. He doesn't know what to do with them, Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston, Michael Gambon and Bill Murray. Bill Murray jumped the shark (for me) in "Lost in Translation" a self-indulgent paean to Sofia Coppola's rich, spoiled and precious life. Wes Anderson falls into this category. The 3 points are for his dedication to set design and aesthetics. He clearly cares a great deal about cute details, dolphins with cameras following the boat etc. how these enhance the story and the audience experience, I don't know. But he is a professional set designer for sure. His stories and writing stinks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is simply breathe taking. Anderson and Wilson teamed up again, creating another film with their unusual style.This film portrays a family trying to regain a past glory that was never truly there in the first place. The family is composed of supposed 'child geniuses' that grow up knowing they are no geniuses and have trouble dealing with this 'fall from grace' that they know very well was never there in the first place. Their mother, Ethelinne, (Angelica Huston) was loving but never did raise the children with personal attention, instead she insisted on trying to make them something they were not- perfect. Their father, Royal, (Hackman) left the children at a young age and nearly disappeared from their lives.This film truly shows human emotions and reactions in a way only Wes Anderson can. The subtle sarcasm, the defense mechanisms, the denial...all portrayed so amazingly well that you don't really notice it, but subconsciously realize it.There is no good way to describe this film (other than the essay that comes with the DVD) other than the words 'subtle perfection.Many people think this 'movie' crap, and I believe that is due to a lack of recognition of reality in film. No writer/director makes his characters more realistic than Anderson.This is a film everyone should see at least once, although many nay-sayers like it a lot more the second time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Royal Tenenbaums is on my top 5 list of favorite movies of all time. I actually went through a period of time when i watched it everyday. I'm not really sure why i love this film so much. It might be the silly characters and the way they dress and talk.... sigh. I want to be a Tenenbaum. Margot is by far the most amazing character. My roommate and I want to be her. The silly hair and the super dark eye make up. The wooden finger. She's oozing with sex! Speaking of "oozing" Arie and Uzi.. the BEST! My favorite part of the movie is when they meet Royal for the first time.. at the Y. The music.. and camera.. the wit. It's great.... very vintage-like. I quote this movie like it's cool. You can't miss a single minute of this movie... you have to let it seep in and take a hold of you. It's very detailed. The way they say things and the little things that they do is what makes it funny.I have to admit that I do know where some of you are coming from and why you think the movies a little boring. I Understand. Murray, the Owen Bros., and Stiller.. you see them as these Silly, funny Zoolander type of characters..and I can see how this film might be disappointing. Because they are nothing like anything they have done before. But it works sooo well. The SOUNDTRACK is another thing I love about the film. I don't think that the suicide scene would have been as powerful if it wasn't for that perfect song. It's incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weak screenplay propped up by luminaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finished this film scratching my head over the raves I've been hearing about it. The cast is terrific, but the material is quite mediocre as was the box office. I can only assume that Wes Anderson's dark, straight faced comedy must really have found a niche that is starved for this style of humor.This is a film that pretends to take itself very seriously while delivering one absurd situation after another. There is something cleverly ironic about that, but mostly the film is too serious to be funny and too weird to be melodramatic. It really fails to identify itself. It might be viewed as a lampoon of wealth, power and wunderkinds, but it lacks the satirical punch to succeed in that vein.The acting is delightful given the material with which they had to work. The ensemble is brimming with notables, all of whom are at the top of their game. Gene Hackman is a good choice for Royal. Hackman is an accomplished dramatic and comedic actor and he was the best of the cast members at walking the line between earnestness and the inanity required by the script. Anjelica Huston seems almost like she can't believe she is saying some of the lines she is given, delivering half of them fighting to hold back a grin a mile wide. Ben Stiller does a nice job of portraying the neurotic widower and father hater, obsessed with the safety of his kids. Luke Wilson comes closest to delivering a believable character, playing the highly eccentric former tennis star that had a nervous collapse over the love of his adopted sister. Luke's brother Owen Wilson is far less funny in this film than in others I've seen, but in his defense, he didn't have a lot with which to work. Gwyneth Paltrow abandons her normally sweet demeanor and does a nice rendition of the psychologically troubled Margot, complete with despondent personality, blank stare and a variety of nervous habits. Bill Murray and Danny Glover round out the cast in minor roles that amount to little more than cameos.This is one of those films that you either love it or you can't connect. I couldn't find enough meat to classify it as much better than fair. I rated it 6/10. Add a couple of points if you like ironic deadpan humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anderson's best work to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is this year's best film. At least, the best film I've seen all year, which says a lot, considering it's December and I've seen many films this year alone. Wes Anderson continues his "quirky" (I hate to use this term with him, but it fits) look at life, first explored in the marvelous BOTTLE ROCKET and the charming RUSHMORE. The title family consists of disbarred lawyer Royal (Gene Hackman in what should be an Oscar-nominated performance), whose mooching ways led his kids astray--at least from him. He is unofficially divorced--for twenty-odd years--from archaeologist wife Etheline (Angelica Huston, very wonderful in all her, albeit few, scenes) and has been living in a hotel suite--littered with Encyclopedia Brittanica and dated suits--for at least three years. When he is kicked out of his suite for not paying his hotel bills, Royal returns home, pretending to be dying from stomach cancer.The children--introduced as child prodigies, with The Beatles' "Hey Jude" playing in the background and Alec Baldwin narrating (his narration, throughout the film, is essential, his voice raspy and distinctive)--have outgrown their genius diapers. Chas (Ben Stiller, somewhat wasted but still funny) was the financial wizard of the family. He still is successful, but the loss of his wife in a plane crash has made him very protective of his sons Ari and Uzi (Grant Rosenmeyer and Jonah Meyerson). He even insists that they don smaller versions of the red track suit their father wears. He is the one most resentful of his father, who once shot him in the hand with a BB rifle when he was a child (the BB is still lodged between the knuckles). Richie (Luke Wilson) is a former tennis phenom who suffered a career-ending defeat at the hands of an opponent named "Gandhi." He also has a secret infatuation with Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), his adopted sister, as seen in the younger Richie's numerous portraits of her (and the fact that they once ran away together as children). Margot is a zombie-like ex-playwright who suffered the most under Royal, whom always made it clear that she was adopted, and, sadly, was very critical of her work, regardless of her age. She dabbles in smoking, watching TV in the bathroom for six hours straight, and avoiding her anthropologist husband Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray, always funny anywhere, even if his age is showing), whose latest case study involves a very peculiar nerd.Hackman shines here, especially in his snide comments, many of them directed toward Chas and Margot, who seem bitter at him (and who can blame them?). Upon learning that Chas' wife is buried in the same cemetery his late mother is buried in, Royal smirks, "We'll swing by her grave too." But Royal wants to change--possibly. His way to Chas' heart is through Chas' boys, and in one bravado touch, Anderson further intensifies the film's Seventies look (though lacking the grittiness, the film is set and filmed in an unspecified part of New York, the location of most Seventies films) when Royal approaches the boys near a rooftop jungle gym. The closeups remind us instantly of 1971's THE FRENCH CONNECTION, a film that earned Hackman his Best Actor Oscar. The exteriors are purely New York, a perpetually snowy and cold, yet sunny, NYC, unfazed by the goings-on at the Tenenbaum household.The lesser characters do well. Danny Glover as Henry Sherman, Etheline's current suitor, is fine and lovable, especially when he verbally spars with Royal--or, really, when he defends Royal's many quips. Kumar Pallana, an Anderson fixture since his amusing turns as Kumar the safecracker in BOTTLE ROCKET and Mr. Littlejeans the caretaker in RUSHMORE, plays Pagoda, the family's longtime butler, with the right amount of naivete and wholesomeness. Owen Wilson (who co-wrote the script with college buddy Anderson, as he had done with the previous films) is one of the film's funniest characters, Eli Cash, the family's neighbor from across the street. Once a quiet child in a red dinner jacket, he has grown up into a novelist, complete in Western wardrobe, and assistant professor of English Literature at Brooks College. His first novel was a dud called "Wildcat," which was written in an "obsolete vernacular"; his latest, "Old Custer," as he notes, "presupposes" whether Custer really died at Little Big Horn, which he also acknowledges as fact. This is a man who has stacks of pornographic videotapes, dozens of cannibis plants, and paintings of hooligans with white facepaint on motorcycles in his apartment. Look also for Seymour Cassel (memorable as Max Fischer's father in RUSHMORE) as Royal's pal Dusty, an elevator operator at the hotel who later poses, in a witty scene, as his doctor.Anderson continues with the lively colors and soft guitar riffs that made his first two films quietly affecting. Baldwin's narration, along with cut scenes of the film's fictitious novel and the opening sentences of each chapter (though some of us may want to buy the hardcover version anyway), make the film thoroughly enjoyable for most viewers. While diehard Anderson fans (such as myself) may consider BOTTLE ROCKET his magnum opus, THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS doesn't disappoint until the second half, when the Richie-Margot storyline slows the momentum. But the film ends on a (basically) happy note, and you leave the theater feeling content about how you spent your afternoon. I, for one, cannot wait for the next Anderson/Wilson feature. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, a bold statement considering Memento, Mulholland Drive, Amelie, LOTR:FOTR, A Beautiful Mind, In the Bedroom, The Man Who Wasn't There, and a few others. None the less, there is no better movie. Ever since I saw Bottlerocket and Rushmore, I knew Wes Anderson was a special director and the Wilson/Anderson writing team was top notch. This movie merely proves that beyond a shadow of a doubt. _The Royal Tenenbaums_ deals with issues such as drug use, suicide, incest, infedelity with such a tact and perfect dichotomy between humor and seriousness.The acting: Gene Hackman at his best since his Oscar win for _The French Connection_, Angelica Houston and Danny Glover give their best performances in years, Luke and Owen Wilson as always give great performances under Anderson, Paltrow in her best performance ever, Stiller's best performance as well (in his first decent role), and Bill Murray shines again under Anderson. Of course, one cannot mention a Wes Anderson movie without mentioning his troupe of actors that you will find only in his movies. Kumar Pallana as Pagoda steals every scene he is in, and Seymour Cassel as Dusty is another great accomplice to the scheming Royal.Perhaps Anderson's greatest strengths lie in his ability to bring out great performances from his actors, and the subtle detail in every scene. Watch the movie a second time: look at the walls in the Tenenbaum home. Even these miniscule details build even more upon the rich characters of _The Royal Tenenbaums_. See it again and again.JurorNo8's Rating: 9.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I have vaguely known the plot of "The Royal Tenenbaums" for several years now, I decided not to watch it until the other night and for that I am deeply regretful. This film (and subsequently Wes Anderson) is absolute genius. The subtle comedic acting by Paltrow, Huston, Murray, Glover and the Wilson brothers are overshadowed only by an outstandingly hilarious performance by Gene Hackman. The writing is near perfection with vastly complex characters made relatable through their family relationship and the directing is underrated as the less enthused moviegoers often miss the beautifully complicated art direction and cinematography. As if the sets and camera work were not enough, Anderson uses perfectly placed music by artists which vary from the Beatles to Nico to Elliot Smith to add deep emotion to a number of different scenes and completes his masterpiece with an amazing soundtrack. In closing, "The Royal Tenenbaums" touches on everything from humor to drama, from sadness to joy and all in less than two hours. As far as a recommendation goes, all I can say is that this movie has leaped into my top 5 almost overnight and that is not an easy task. I highly recommend it: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for a really good evening. But my mistake was to think this movie was funny. Well, for fun you'd better watch Happiness.Imagine a family of depressed members. Flat characters, that don't come to life. Everyone is strange and has his own single issue. And they all sit speechless staring in front of them. Well, that's the movie.You'll expect something to happen and the persons to come to live. But you'll be disappointed. Even the things that happen are slow, unemotional, and predictable.Sorry, did I say predictable? Sorry, no. No-one can predict such boring, little changes in the lives of movie-characters, which are supposed to be EN-TER-TAI-NING. The music is badly chosen. The best parts are the ones without soundtrack, and then suddenly you get distracted from the plot because of some annoying, wrongly chosen pop song. This happens so often, you'll think someone is trying to make a statement you don't get. Bad luck it's never quiet for a whole scene. Because I like happy-endings, I don't see the point of discovering why someone is depressed, and then ending the movie without showing this knowledge did make any difference to the person.Let's end positive. Gene Hackman was OK. And the nice part of the movie is when he takes out his grandchildren to teach them to be naughty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless, subtly hilarious classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson loves his characters.As a matter of fact, if one were to take the actual plot of The Royal Tenenbaums (not Wes and Owen Wilson's screenplay), one could imagine how any other Hollywood director might have approached the matter- after all, it isn't an overly complicated story- an estranged father wants back into the family he just about ruined with his insensitivity and boyish antics. For most big-name budget movies this would be but a subplot of a romantic comedy with sharks.No, when you think of it this film isn't really about much at all. But Wes Anderson has an all-too-rare mastery of his craft, an innate gift of being able to visualize every single nuance of action, every minute reaction of every single one of his characters BEFORE rolling the film.Of course, crafting lovable, understandable characters is one of the primary jobs of a screenwriter, but what makes Wes so unique is his (and you all knew this was coming) SUBTLETY. Little details flow in and out, things are seemingly set up for no reason and paid off with this filmmaker's one-of-a-kind sense of humor.Like fine wine (and his previous films, Rushmore and Bottle Rocket), time is on The Royal Tenenbaums' side. This is a film that, in a decade, any devoted student of film can sit down and watch, literally, as an audio/visual bible- I could go on for hours about the film's exceptional sense of style and humorous recurring themes, but I know mere words will fail me. I highly recommend you watch this film with an open heart and mind. In an age where people don't really pay attention to the movies they watch anymore, TRT may not be for everyone, which is a shame because it's an instant classic, no matter what the cant-stand-20-minutes-in-a-film-without-a-car-explosion generation has to say about it.His dialogue is perfect. His attention to detail is hilarious. His characters are what they need to be- nobody is trying to grab the camera's attention here. So what if attention deficit moviegoers, the Academy, the BAFTAS and the Globes don't recognize his brand of greatness? Wes Anderson is the filmmaker of the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where did the plot go?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking for the plot in this movie, but it seems to have either disappeared or be hiding very well or just maybe never have existed. The movie is just a mix of strange occurrences and although you could argue that there are some stories like Royal's attempt to get redemption, you never really care about the story because the characters are so superficial. That is the biggest flaw in this movie. The characters are caricatures and most of them are selfish and anti-social. So why watch this movie? I guess there are a few mildly funny moments (like three or so), and it is very beautifully shot. I especially like the camera movement, which is very dynamic and gives a smooth feel to the movie. Instead of cutting back and forth Anderson often uses pans, which works well. Like in on of the final scenes, where he pans slowly across the fire truck and registers all the different reactions to the crash. Also his use of music is quite good (I love Ruby Tuesday). But what is form without substance? The thin plot and the superficial characters turn this movie into just another failed attempt of making a clever movie. The end result is just a tiny bit better than the absolutely terrible "Rushmore".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe Owen Wilson's idea was to present a "cocaine dream" instead of a tangible story line. The Royal Tennenbaums left me wondering what just happened. Nowhere in the story's weaving in and out of Royal Tennenbaum's life did I find a character that I actually cared for, which was the first flaw. And Royal's revelation that he's dying makes me wonder why I should care. His character has done nothing to make the audience feel endeared to him, so the news is met with more of a "hmmm" instead of an "oh no!". I left the theater laughing, but only because it was the most ridiculous thing I'd seen in a long time. And I was laughing at myself for plunking down 8 bucks to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family isn't a word?It is a sentence. This is a brilliant film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is one of the more unique movies I have seen in recent times, the 2002 ?comedy', The Royal Tenenbaums. I have highlighted the word ?comedy', because after watching this film, I was not laughing at it so much, but rather in awe of how good a drama it really is. With an all star cast and highly intelligent script, here is a movie that I am still unsure what to call or think about. The Royal Tenenbaums is the richly tragicomic story of one unique family's sudden, unexpected reunion. Royal Tenenbaum and his wife Etheline had three children - Chas, Ritchie and Margot, and then they separated. Years later, feigning terminal illness, the reprehensible Royal Tenenbaum returns to his wife's house where the Tenenbaum kids are also back under the same roof. So join the clan in the Royal Tenenbaums, where there is a crazy quilt of past and present family relationships, conflicts and misadventures.What an extraordinary movie ?the Royal Tenenbaums' really is. In my experience of watching movies, which has not been that long, I have not seen a movie quite like this one. The story to it is very original. Written by director Wes Anderson and star Owen Wilson, it is very much a look into what means to be in a dysfunctional family, illness (looking extremely well into the mental illnesses of split personality and depression) and of course cancer. All the members of the Tenenbaum family are in some way sick, and it is through the story you get that feeling.Also, the ideas of infidelity, failed marriage and incest, which all could be considered distressing, are so interesting to watch being played out in the movie that you have to be intrigued by them. Only the Tenenbaums could have all of these problems to contend with. What was also great about the story was the style that it was delivered in. With a terrific voiceover placed in the story, seen chapter by chapter on the screen, it was a very refreshing way to see a movie being played out. That being said, this movie had a star studded line up. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) was a very enjoyable role to see on the screen. Hackman's performance reminds me very much of his character in the 1999 hit ?Heartbreakers'. I am sure that many fathers would look at this man and say, `I am never going to be that sort of father!' Royal's wife, Etheline (Anjelica Huston) is also a queer woman, and has a man who is very much in love with her, the Tenenbaum's accountant, Henry Sherman (played well by Danny Glover). Yet if the parents are strange in this film, then it has certainly rubbed of on their children. Chas (Ben Stiller) started buying real estate in his early teens and had a preternatural understanding of international finance. He is a safety freak and is struggling to get over the loss of his dear wife, Rachel. Richie (Luke Wilson) was a top junior championship tennis player. Then one day he lost his game for some reason, but we do not know exactly why. Then there is Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), a playwright, who received a $50,000 grant in the ninth grade. Margot has been a rebellious girl for a lot of her life, which is understandable, considering what she has been through. My feeling about Margot is that she is one of the more intriguing characters of the entire movie. The two standout actors have to be Stiller and Paltrow. I have seen plenty of them before, but not quite like this, which is credit to their acting ability and the people behind the scenes, who made them like they were.Yet there are still more performers that need to be highlighted from the RTs. Ike Cash (Owen Wilson) is an extraordinary individual, especially towards the end of the film. Margot is also ?married' to Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), who is another character that you do not expect, but actually get. For me, Murray was amazingly withheld, not normally associated with his style of acting, something else that I liked from the movie. Then you have to love the voiceover style of Alec Baldwin. He has an incredibly deep voice for the narration purposes, and if we do not hear him again in this role, it will be a real shame. There are some really memorable scenes in this film. It is a fine introduction, which sets the movie up beautifully. Then all of the scheming ways of Royal's are most entertaining, especially the one that shows him on his sick bed, as he is asked by his son Chas to ?get out'. He is a very fraudulent, but funny man as well. Yet there are some quite serious moments in the movie also. Richie shows us that his state of mind is not quite right, with what he does to cure the problem quite disturbing. Then with Margot, you have to love her stubborn attitude and carefree nature towards life. The end of the film was wonderful, and it might leave you asking, ?is everything as it seems?' I have seen plenty of movies that are little bit different, with such titles as ?Pulp Fiction', ?Memento' and 2001s ?Mulholland Drive' coming to mind. They all did things different to your normal mainstream movie, but the ?Royal Tenenbaums' is different once again. I applaud everyone involved in this movie, the actors, the director, the producers, all the people behind the scenes, for giving me another avenue of the movie world to explore and learn from. I will be interested to see the next movie that is like this, as I am sure it will be a long time to come. This movie was rated as a ?comedy', but it was so much more. I highly recommend a night's viewing of the ?Royal Tenenbaums', a movie that you can call whatever you want!CMRS gives ?The Royal Tenenbaums': 5 (Brilliant Film) </fullReview>

Not that all movies by the same team have to be compared to all the others, but it seems like they are similiar in a lot of ways so its natural to compare them. I love Wes &amp; Owen and will see anything they come up with. They have a real love of humanity and are never really cruel. Even when the characters do unkind things to each other, its like they still do it with love. When Pagoda stabs Royal in front of the house, he still helps him into his cab and later on is seen attending to the wound. This is this movie in a nutshell. Even Gwyneth, who makes my spine shiver, was tolerable in this. 10/10. Thanks guys, you bring something new to modern cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching "Rushmore" and "The Royal Tenenbaums" I've had it with Wes Anderson! And Owen Wilson's better off staying in front of the camera, because he's no use as a screenwriter. What is it about Wes Anderson's movies that critics and film buffs everywhere swoon over? There must be hypnotic rays emanating from the movie screen, because this guy seems to have as much talent as a modern artist who paints a canvas green and titles it "Grass." This movie is such a pretentious bore, so drab and lifeless. Even the all-star cast, full of great talents, can't bring life to this corpse of a film.As far as I know, this is supposed to be a comedy. Comedy requires a setup and a punchline. This movie has no punchlines! We simply experience one quirky situation after another, and we're supposed to laugh at the mere fact that it's quirky! This is so weird! Ha ha freakin' ha! If this is the pinnacle of high-brow comedy, then bring on the gross-out flicks! The DVD should've came with a laugh track, so I would know which scenes I'm supposed to laugh at. I've seen a lot of lame comedies, but at least with most of the lame comedies I see, I know when I'm "supposed" to laugh. I mean, I can use any scene from this movie as an example. One was the scene where Luke Wilson is on the tennis court, playing a terrible game. What was the joke? He's losing! That's the joke! And then he takes off his shoes and socks on the court, as if that's supposed to add some humor. How 'bout he flings his tennis racket into the crowd? How 'bout he curses out his opponent like John McEnroe? There were some great comic opportunities in that scene, but apparently Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson don't know the first thing about writing comedy. Come on, when a person like me--an amateur screenwriter--is sitting in the audience thinking about 1,001 ways each scene could've been funnier, that's not a very good sign! Not a good sign at all!The film's only 90 minutes, but it moves at the pace of a dying snail, so it gets more and more tedious by the minute. You know a director is conceited when he/she shoots a scene that has practically nothing to do with moving the film along, but simply shows off his ability as an "artiste." Why do we have to watch a 2-minute scene that lingers on a close-up of Luke Wilson as he shaves his head and face? The cast (amazingly) doesn't seem bored with the script and gives in spirited performances, especially Gene Hackman who really goes with the flow, but Anderson may as well have casted a bunch of apes, because there's no reason to waste the talent of A-class actors for this piece of garbage.If I had a choice between watching "The Royal Tenenbaums" and "Corky Romano," I wouldn't know which movie to choose. But there is one thing I have to say--at least the makers of "Corky Romano" didn't intend to make a masterpiece. Anderson assumes he's making a new addition to "The Godfather Saga" and obviously the critics fell for his pretentious direction. Is this a human comedy or a farce? The characters are too wacky for it to be a human comedy and they're too dull for it to be farcical. Sure, the film's original. But the originality goes nowhere. Originality alone doesn't cut it.For all those who found this movie hilarious, I want you to come to my house and watch it with me, so I'll observe which moments actually make you laugh and which moments I'm supposed to laugh at. 'Cause through my eyes this is just another lame comedy. So it has intelligence. So does a PBS documentary on uranium. But who the hell would wanna watch it? No matter what way you look at it, a comedy that's not funny is not a good comedy. This is not only a lousy comedy, but a lousy film altogether--in any genre.My score: 3 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess by some of the reviews here that I am not the only person who thinks Wes Anderson is a lousy director. This thing is tediously miscast, poorly constructed, and unbelievably pretentious. The hype this movie got shows the incompetence of a number of our "best" critics who can't seem to see the total inadequacies of this misdirected garbage. This disaster shows that even with a large talent pool and gifted artists you can completely ruin a roll of film. Disappointment as word doesn't even hint at how poorly this piece of fiction has been handled. I see the characters and wonder how they would come off with actors who fit the parts and had a family resemblance. It would have also been nice if the period feel of the piece had been fully realized. The ethnic background of the main figures seems to be avoided and the behavior is highly irregular in some instances, not even close to real human emotion. It would great to see this story remade by someone who knew what he was doing. This is like a bad high school play version of good literature. I can easily compare its wrongness to the casting of Carrie Underwood in Sound of Music. This stuff stinks. It like all other Wes Anderson films is also boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't Stand Wes Anderson!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me - and I know many, many people will disagree - Wes Anderson is another one of those directors whose movies I only like one of - I actually quite enjoyed The Life Aquatic (mostly because of Bill Murray and the quality stop-motion animation), but that's it. Everything else he does is just irritatingly boring, dull and completely unfunny. I've tried to like his movies, but I just can't. I hate directors whose movies are odd for the sake of being odd, and not because it's funny or it makes sense; it's just downright pretentious. He's not even weird or odd in a good way like David Lynch. Some might argue that his humour is too sophisticated or high-brow for my caveman mind, fair enough, I'm just here to speak my mind. This review is applicable to all Wes Anderson films (except Aquatic), so hopefully I won't have to keep repeating myself. Oh, another thing; I absolutely can't stand Jason Schwartzman!

Even with the main character, the father, who spends his time trying to make up for his past failings, we never get to see what those could be. Oh, unless you consider not knowing his adopted daughter's middle name. I suppose this is meant to be funny (or perhaps this is some sort of transatlantic irony struggling for life) but it's just flat. It looks like the makers tried to have too many quirky characters and rather than deal with one or two relationships ended up with nothing but that quirkiness. Big deal. Oh, yeah, and its got somebody's all-time favourite tracks from when they were growing up as the sound track (always a bad sign) - totally out of place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow-burning masterpiece *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film on TV and have never seen a director quite like Wes Anderson displaying his outlook on life so expertly. He and Owen Wilson have created a family beyond dysfunctional. Their underplayed script of various oddballs all with their own tale of despair is as left-field as you'll find, with each character, and I stress this, as pathetic as the next.Gene Hackman plays the lead role of Royal with huge confidence while Paltrow (Margot), Stiller (Chaz), and Owen and Luke Wilson (Eli and Richie), develop into fully fledged actors in their brilliant well-rounded performances. Anjelica Huston plays the strong matriarchal head of the family and gives the biggest whiff of normalcy from the film with Kumar Pallana, the knife happy friend/butler/colleague at the opposite end of the spectrum. Along with Pallana's inspired creation, comes Anderson's strongest hand - background players. Like the Coens, he truly adores every character and you feel background with each one. Whether it be Danny Glover's sombre turn as Huston's love interest, Royal's colleague and partner in deception or Buckley the dog. They carry the film and keep it fresh.The script is as above mentioned, slow-burning, letting its characters develop with ease and no constraints. This sits perfectly with Anderson's patient camera, and eye to present the story in a skit-type basis which it very well may be with its spot-on throw away one-liners. When pestered about the nature of his suicide note Richie replies wryly, "Of course it's dark, It's a suicide note."Its along with these, the acting and Andersons direction that Tenenbaums is promoted from simply a cult or indie classic into something so much more. The slow moments perfectly sober the funnier and give room for rest and perspective. It is also where the film delivers its most touching and poignant moments. The wedding scene is totally destroying and will levels the viewer flat. As with Richie's graphic suicide attempt and Royals ultimate demise in the company of his previously absent son.I cannot praise this film enough but I have tried.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painful waste of potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has all the ingredients for a great movie, but whoever put them together was on crack. What a terrible waste of a great cast and a great idea. It's disturbing that such high-flying potential could result in poor dialogue, a John-Irving-in-Hell type plot, a lack of chemistry between actors, and horrific attempts at comedy.The best scene in the movie is the one where Royal tells his wife of his condition. It looks unscripted and absolutely, painfully real. I was with this movie for the emotionless, deadpan acting and the throwback style. I thought Gene Hackman did an excellent job given what he had to work with. But Ben Stiller was not good, and neither was Owen Wilson, whose affability and comedic charm is completely missing. Also missing was some semblance of humanity in everyone but Hackman's character. A real disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly one of the worst movies I have ever witnessed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching a movie, my typical routine is to log onto imdb.com and rate the movie. My taste in movies is fairly broad, and for the most part, my ratings generally correspond to other IMDB users. Because bad movies generally don't inspire me to write a user comment review, I haven't written many bad reviews. After I finished watching The Royal Tenenbaums, I knew I had a clear and definite `1.' Had I seen that many people agreed with me, I would have merely cast my vote and departed. But when I logged on to imdb.com, I was aghast to find that this movie not only received an average rating that would require two hands to count with, but also was sitting in the Top 250 list. And that is why I am writing this review.The words `artsy' and `cultured' keep coming up when people defend this movie. This movie serves an injustice to those movies that are in fact artsy and cultured. This movie has no plot, no laughs, no emotional connection to characters, no important theme, and no point. These qualities (or lack thereof) do not make a movie artsy or cultured. This movie was like a Stanley Kubrick film without Stanley Kubrick directing ? it just doesn't work.Let's talk about humor. There are a lot of movies that do not have humor, but this movie's lack of funny bone stimulation is incredible. For the purpose of this review, I am working under the presupposition that this movie was supposed to be a comedy. If the cast didn't include some comic actors and had I not known anything about the movie beforehand, I would have been hard-pressed to call this movie a comedy. I laughed only twice during this movie: during the scene in which Ben Stiller's character chases Owen Wilson's character and pushes a priest down the stairs, and during the scene that shows Royal Tenenbaum's tombstone inscription.There were other times when I got the feeling that the movie was trying? trying to be funny. But it was like watching a comic fail on stage, having missed his timing or the joke's set up. During these scenes, I just kept grimacing, `If they had just set it up a little better?', `If they had just not played the most dreary of background music?', `If they had just tried to be as funny as they tried to be weird and eccentric?'And remember, humor is a reaction, not a choice. It isn't called a `sense' of humor for nothing ? it as much a sense as our five senses. You can't justify or explain why we laugh or don't laugh. Why do we laugh at some things and not at others? We might be able to identify certain patterns or trends that lead to our cachinnations (the timing, the context, the delivery, the punchline, the randomness, the wit, the irony, etc), but as for answering the question of `Why?', your guess is as good as mine. People have tried to defend the humor in this movie against the gross-out, perverted humor prevalent in today's mainstream comedies by guilting (through condescending oversimplification) those who enjoy laughing at things that are A) socially unacceptable and B)funny as hell. It seems that nowadays we'd rather remain tight-lipped when something funny happens at a funeral and we'd rather laugh when something not funny happens in a situation in which we're expected to laugh (polite laughter to our unfunny friends, family, and coworkers). This is insane. For instance, I find the concept of wheel-chair basketball to be particularly funny. Perhaps it is insensitive, politically incorrect, and mean-spirited (it is most definitely all of these things), but if I were to tell you that it wasn't funny, I would be dishonest. The truth is, this movie just isn't funny.And another thing, if you are not absolutely in love with bright reds, you may want to adjust your television.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented the DVD. It may be that everything that happened after the first hour or so was cinematic gold; maybe the characters suddenly burst into life; maybe someone said something that was devastatingly funny; maybe a series of brilliantly executed plot twists would have left me gasping in astonishment. I'll never know. After an hour of flat, insipid, self-indulgent crap I put my eyes, ears and brain out of their collective misery and pressed STOP. My theory on the production of this film is as follows: that gifted auteur, Mr Anderson, secretly scanned my brain and detected all the things that I find funny, moving or intellectually stimulating- he then ensured that his film included none of these features. He then double-checked for all the things that I find boring, crass, pretentious and irritating and ensured that all of these features were emphatically stressed in his shooting script.</fullReview>

And I am totally sick of the Wilson brothers. They have absolutely no range. They have no idea how to play anything other than their fantasies of the type of cool offbeat dudes that they wish they were in real life but probably aren't.Everyone else in my family liked it, and I have no idea why.

I couldn't figure out when the story was set, a gravestone indicated someone died in 2000, yet everyone had rotory phones, ancient elevators, old cars, old computers (with flat screen monitors), ok...... so obviously the writer/director was trying to set some sort of strange mood to the setting (it takes place in a generic city called "metropolis", no relation to Superman).We figured, IMDB rates this movie HUGE, lots of big name actors, how could you go wrong. The acting was fine, just the story was nonexistant... oh yeah, I think I already mentioned that.

		<shortDescription>Honestly the worst movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely the worst movie ever made. With such a great cast you would expect something at least decent, but like in all of his other movies the sophomoric director and writer, Wes Anderson, managed to tear to shreds a movie with so much potential. The movie was directed as I imagine a 14 year old might direct a movie if you just gave him a camera and told him to mess around with it, and as far as the plot is concerned, Wes Anderson (and Owen Wilson who co-wrote the film) did even worse. The acting in the movie was fine, but under such poorly written dialogue you'd scarcely be able to tell. The idea of a screwed up family and its members' sometimes funny and sometimes tragic interactions with one another is hardly a novel one, but in all fairness the film doesn't really act like it is and that's fine. This is not my problem. The problem is that in this movie the interactions never actually are humorous (despite Anderson's attempts at "tongue-in-cheek" humor, which, again, would be fine if they actually were comedic in this respect, yet they aren't), and as tragic as other scenes may be, the characters are so poorly developed and at times so cliché, a viewer of this film finds it impossible to relate to the characters and ends up having little or no regard for their fate. Worst of all, the movie fails in what is clearly its main goal and the entire point of the film. The story is supposed to show how despite his having ruined the family in the past, Gene Hackman's character brings them all together when he dies. Anderson makes a despite attempt to show this one meaningful point in his train wreck of a film, and yet, as far as I'm concerned the message doesn't really come across at all. The end of the film thus leaves its viewers conflicted because they know what Anderson wants them to think but the conclusions anyone would draw for themselves show an entirely different picture. I remember after watching the film, with a plot that amounts to hokum at best, I put in the special features disc of the DVD and watched the egotistic Anderson walking through the house that the movie took place in saying how he chose the colors for all the different rooms to correspond with the different characters' personalities. That's great, someone needs to tell Wes to stick to interior decorating and stop trying to make movies.</fullReview>

Yes, we all get "it" (the quirkiness, the irony, the deadpan humour, etc.), but the "it" doesn't make the movie good by default. The pacing comes at a snail's pace and the characters are unappealing for the most part. Fantastic cast, but wasted. And I'm having problems with the "Bill Murray Syndrome." Which is to say that every serious movie he's in has people praising it to high heaven, but I just don't get it. Rushmore, Lost in Translation and The Royal Tenenbaums all have the following in common: a serious Bill Murray, agonizingly slow pacing and characters that you want to push off a cliff.I kept waiting for the appeal of The Royal Tenenbaums to kick in and it never did.

I didn't remember any of the disturbing animal things in this movie; nowadays I wouldn't have watched it.I do like Wes Anderson, though, and I do remember liking The Royal Tenenbaums, that bunch of crazies, headed up by Royal (Gene Hackman). He and his estranged wife Etheline (Angelica Huston) have three exceptionally gifted children: Charles (Ben Stiller) is a financial genius, their adopted daughter (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a popular playwright, and their son Richie (Luke Wilson) is a national tennis winter. Royal moved out very early in the kids' lives.Now he needs back in. He's been thrown out of his hotel because he can't pay. He tells Etheline that he has stomach cancer and only a few weeks to live, and he wants to be with his family.The family by now, in adulthood, is a big mess. Charles is now a widower and overprotective of his two boys, Ari and Uzi. They wear matching warm-up suits and he rehearses them in fire drills. Margot is unhappily married to a psychiatrist (Bill Murray) and spends most of her time in the bathroom chain smoking. Richie quit tennis when he suffered a meltdown during a critical match. He has been living on a cruise ship for the past year. Also, Etheline wants the divorce that's been denied her for 22 years as her accountant (Danny Glover) has proposed.The kids all come home to be with their father, happy to be away from their problems. Margot is having an affair with their neighbor Eli (Owen Wilson) who is a western novelist into drugs.A hospital worker owes Royal a favor so he moves in with a lot of borrowed medical equipment. He and his grandsons get along the best; Charles has a lot of issues with his father. Richie is in love with his adopted sister. Her husband suspects she's unfaithful, which she is. He hires a private investigator.Royal is found out and tossed out of the house. He becomes an elevator operator at the hotel that evicted him and moves into the Y.Royal is dismissive and rude, but he loves his family and eventually tries to do right by them as he's the only one who can.There's an underlying sweetness to this film, and it is filled with great music, funny dialogue, and sad, lost characters. It's emotional, striking to look at, and has a lot of subtle touches. The end is satisfying and not pat. The big thing about the comedy for me is that it's not directed to the lowest common denominator.A black comedy that's not for everyone. I think Wes Anderson fans will appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So... I am not a big fan of films made by Wes Anderson but I have watched few, and even liked a lot, some of them. I hope this one will be the blast, especially it such nice cast: Gene Hackman, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Danny Glover, Alec Baldwin and probably some more.20 minutes - and I have no idea what to write. It is typical Wes Anderson film where everything feels special somehow, but you can't really point your finger at something specific 37 minutes - I have a great trouble stay interested in this film... Good acting is just not enough and I am bored...1h 16minutes - dysfunctional family, drama, love story, you know... just typical human problems, created in a very special artistic way 1h 33minutes - hilarious, but only slightly :)Great acting, style and music... but the story meh... Not a fan of Wes Anderson's stories to be honest. I love his attention to details and style, I definitely like that/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, boring and unfunny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see I am in the minority here. I watched this movie based on the large number of good reviews but it turned out to be a confused dud that didn't know if it was drama of comedy. I persisted with this movie but honestly wish I had not. I found the movie slow moving, boring and just not funny. The characters aren't engaging, relatable or even believable. The setting was boring, the premise was shallow and nothing of any real interest happened at all. The music was good, the cinematography nice, but all in all totally underwhelming, which was a real surprise considering the big name cast members. I'm a big fan of Gene Hackman but he wasn't the right choice with this movie, I think this was just a pay cheque for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anderson is a tad overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to watching The Grand Budapest Hotel, I couldn't stand Wes Anderson's films. And this film is an excellent example as to why. To keep the story short, Anderson seems to think that merely being weird makes him comedic and merely throwing a dark curveball at the plot makes him tragic. And, admittedly, according to most people, it seems to work. He's a well-regarded director, so it's most likely that I'm just one of those people that don't get it. And I did get it with The Grand Budapest Hotel, where everything I had hated about Anderson somehow just seemed to work.But not here! The Royal Tenenbaums is simply tedious. It has style, I'll give it that. It has plenty of style, from the set designs to the clothing to the dialogues. Everything has a healthy splash of "just a bit too much" thrown in, making it an interesting film to follow, especially visually. But the story... gods, the story.So we have this man, the eponymous Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), who used to live the high life with his family, The Tenenbaums. And what a family. I can't decide if they're satirically bohemian and odd or whether they're what Anderson thinks what a normal urban family is all about. Probably the former, but with this man, could be either one.Anyway, Royal has since estranged himself from the family, but now his wife (Anjelica Huston) wants a divorce in order to remarry. And once again Royal's rapscallion side rears its head as he tries to throw wrenches at her plan. Plus we have all the kids to make it even weirder. We have a highly neurotic Wall Street shark (Ben Stiller) who dresses himself and his kids solely in neon red jumpsuits. We have a tennis prodigy (Luke Wilson), who drinks nothing but bloody marys with pepper. And finally we have Gwyneth Paltrow, who's married to Bill Murray.Hijinks! I can see what draws people to this movie. It is very unique in style, the plot is very unpredictable and you're constantly being intrigued. For me it was a tedious experience because I couldn't regard the characters as people to be taken seriously and thus the drama side of the plot fell flat for me. And I don't like weird for the sake of being weird kind of humour, so that didn't work either. But, you should be able to garner whether this is your kind of film from this, so go ahead and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Royal Tenenbaums is a perfect mixture of sadness and happiness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An estranged family of former child prodigies reunites when their father announces he is terminally ill. Roger Ebert wrote that: ""The Royal Tenenbaums" is at heart profoundly silly, and loving. That's why it made me think of Wodehouse. It stands in amazement as the Tenenbaums and their extended family unveil one strategy after another to get attention, carve out space, and find love. It doesn't mock their efforts, dysfunctional as they are, because it understands them--and sympathizes." The Royal Tenenbaums is a perfect mixture of sadness and happiness. The soundtrack is just marvellous and fits the mood of the film so well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wes Anderson Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums was the very first Wes Anderson film I ever saw, and was instantly captivated. As with all of his films, Wes Anderson wrote, produced, and directed this film. He and his co-writer Owen Wilson earned an Oscar nomination for their work on the movie. The duo were nominated against the Nolan Brothers's Memento, but both excellent movies lost to a film called Gosford Park, which I can't say that I've seen. Wes Anderson is one of the most unique directors in the world. I could probably sit down and point out every single one of his movies after watching it for 20 seconds. This unique, quirky style is one of the main reasons the film, along with all of his films, work.The cast is also excellent. Aside from the upcoming Grand Budapest Hotel, this is my personal favourite Wes Anderson ensemble cast. Everybody owns their character. Gene Hackman as the lead, trying to get back with his family. He plays the father of Stiller, Paltrow, and Luke Wilson's characters. Hackman won a Golden Globe for his excellent performance. Ben Stiller as the paranoid, resentful eldest child. Gwyneth Paltrow as the moody, mysterious, adoptive daughter. Luke Wilson as the emotional ex-tennis player with a secret, Owen Wilson as the drug addled author, and best friend of Luke Wilson's character. Anjelica Huston, Danny Glover, and the great Bill Murray round out the exceptional cast. (Alec Baldwin as the narrator isn't a bad thing either.)The story revolves around Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) trying to reunite with his family. Initially he is successful by borrowing of medical equipment, and convincing his family that he has stomach cancer. He bonds with the entire family until, Danny Glover's character discovers that it was all a ruse, and Royal is cast out once again, leaving him to struggle to continue to mend his broken relationships. Along the way, many things and subplots happen during the movie. Most of them work, but some of them didn't. The best sub-plot was revolving Ben Stiller's character, Chas Tenenbaum. His wife died in a plane crash a year before the events of the movie. This makes Chas very over protective of his two sons. Royal eventually breaks these barriers down through bonding time with , resulting in Chas lightening up and Royal finding 3 relationships mended. The sub-plot that I found didn't work for me was the one revolving Paltrow's character, Margot Tenenbaum. Margot is married to Bill Murray, and she is going through marital problems. What bothers me is that she had relations with both Owen and Luke Wilson's character, but neither are really explained. It is finally revealed that Margot and Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson) are actually in love, but this love square felt a little out of place for the movie.Overall, while I didn't like the brother/sister love dynamic, the rest of the movie is a Wes Anderson classic. Along with Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Royal Tenenbaums should be viewed before watching The Grand Budapest Hotel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Anderson at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Andersons approach to family, love and sentimental tragedy is as genuine and unique as his approach to humor and sincerity in matters of the heart. The emotional richness incorporated in his movies is inimitable and The Royal Tennebaums is Wes Anderson truly at his best. His colorful characters feature unmatched depth and are merely played to perfection as brought to live by a sparkling cast. Presence of a complex plot is beyond argument and Andersons delivery of detailed background information trough simple one liners is in my eyes pure genius and to be made an obligatory lecture in every film school.Perfect. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Royal Tenenbaums</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this film several times over the years. It was my introduction to the films of Wes Anderson. I've heard many people complain about his movies because they are to slow or boring or not funny. He does definitely have his own unique style and pace that takes some getting used to. I've had to for some of his other films, but The Royal Tenenbaums is always one I've loved from the start.My first viewing was after borrowing it, along with several other random films whose names escape me at the moment, from my sister and her husband. I loved Anderson's brilliant writing and dialogue. I loved the cast and their characters (with Little Fockers in theatres now, which also stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, I can't help but think "Why can't they make more movies like Tenenbaums and less like Fockers?") and the way they refer to each other at times. Gene Hackman calling his children "my darlings" and "my sweet boy" are my favorite instances of this. And I loved the shot of Mordecai, Richie's pet hawk, flying across the cityscape upon his first release with The Rolling Stones "Ruby Tuesday" playing triumphantly in the background. To this day, that remains one of my favorite shots in, not just this movie, but any movie.I have since bought my own copy of the film after that magical first viewing. I've shared it with my other sister. And this afternoon, I showed it to my dad. Periodically throughout the movie he would say something to the extent of "this is crazy". This is quite an appropriate and accurate assessment. Much of what happens in The Royal Tenenbaums and many of it's character's actions can be defined as crazy, very much so. But what the hey? So often, life IS crazy?Check out my other reviews and whatnot at: notexactlyaquote.tumblr.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pedant and dry (I began to think that it's a corollary with Wes Anderson's films !)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first segment wasn't clear enough. The case of that family as very disconnected wasn't portrayed well. I didn't feel at all the sufferance of these characters apart, and since being kids. The matter of being geniuses was lost; other than assuring the expatriation of the characters, it added nothing, being not utilized at all. Sometimes the dialog has so little to showcase. The tricks (the matter of separate chapters, the way all the actors talk to the camera's eye, the unbroken singing soundtrack, ?) didn't serve much in my opinion. It made the movie just atmospheric, and when it comes to that soundtrack, annoying is the right word! The characters look so strange and odd. Yes, we all are like that without love. But sometimes they looked too odd as no humans, moving woodenly like puppets and talking intermittently like robots! (Owen Wilson)'s character was surely the worst. I didn't understand that guy at all. So he became great writer out of his love pain, then he became hopelessly addicted to drugs when he understood that his girl is in love with her brother ?!! (Ben Stiller) hates his father so much, so why exactly is that ? Stealing his money once? Or hitting his fingers at another? The reconciliation between them both at the end was a farce. Or how (Stiller) discovers his fears after his wife's death too late as well. Look at the way (Royal Tenenbaum) divorces his wife so simple, with not much to explain why (personally I though it's another scheme of his). And it was so lame that someone smokes for years and years and nobody, including her husband, didn't ever notice. I know (Wes Anderson) is telling us how far we became towards each others, but he just assumes too much, with great confidence, that that would work. I don't know why this movie tries to say simple things with this amount of pedantry? Like the long one-shot sequence after the car crash, it has a lot of effort to it, yet with so little drama or comedy.It is movie about not living love, or losing it, through a tale of some always absent father who tries so late to connect his true disintegrated family while discovering that the thing they all miss, and suffer because of missing it, is love. However, that tale, while being eccentrically funny at times, didn't have much soul, and seemed so dry at times. I loved some points here and there, such as the way nearly all the characters live in no real home (ship, bathroom, elevator, tent, or a house always burning); simply there is no belonging since there is no home of love, or home with love. And so, selecting the name (Tenenbaums) would be understood for sounding so close to (tinted bums). The new job of (Gene Hackman)'s character; aside from being a funny sudden transformation for him, it says metaphorically how his character tries to connect people to their rest or stability, while he himself has none. It has another merit; (Alec Baldwin) as the narrator. Unexpectedly the movie unearths the wise and heartwarming tone in his voice and uses it perfectly. (Hackman)'s performance ruled as the only human character there. The rest immersed in roles were written to look like a caricature however no real fun did generate. As a drama it isn't so great as well. You read that Danny Glover's looks was modeled after the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's?SO WHAT ??!! So much to the sophisticated details (the spots on the dalmatian mice, the hawk, the amputated finger, the monster-masked men paintings, the brown color for all the clothes..) either. As you see there is great attention to many picky external details, but with no such attention to the essential, more sincere to the drama, ones.After watching (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou), then (The Royal Tenenbaums) for (Anderson), I began to believe that this guy loves to change the form, ornament it, showing different characters in different taste, however with no nifty outcome yet. The problem with him obviously is that he thinks that style is an enough narration, and the form can be satisfying core.After its end, I wasn't impressed or that satisfied. Not due to the not-so-happy ending; on the contrary that was interesting point itself, but for seeing plenty of good stars with promising tale in so tinted yet cold work. Remember the shot in which we watch (Gwyneth Paltrow)'s character smoking alone in the street at night after her new play's end; that was too frosted to provocative extent, not all the Beetles' music in the world can do anything to this !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll Always Watch Hackman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with Roger Ebert. This film, which I avoided because the title threw me off, is about love and estrangement, yet it has a great comic element. Ultimately, it's about a family that peaked too soon, sending everyone into cosmic neuroses. The father, Gene Hackman, returns to this dysfunctional mess. He is a total ass and yet he has a soul. Everyone else is coping with his or her shortcomings. The dynamics that ensue are wonderfully exaggerated. Some of the actors are in the early stages of their careers and seem so young. I especially liked seeing Ben Stiller in what is a serious role. He is a widower with an obsession with protecting his children. They all wear matching warmup suits throughout the film. They do fire drills. You get the point. Eventually, it is Hackman who steps back, takes a look at himself, and does the best he can to try to make their lives better. Unfortunately, this is a mixed accomplishment. I found the movie incredibly quirky and amusing. The Coens would have made it darker, but it does quite nicely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amelie and Tenenbaums by same director...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its astonishing to me how similar the particular method of directing has been in The Royal Tenenbaums, as to the French movie Amélie. Both movies have narratives about the people in a similar odd way, with a sort of comic book childishness to it. Both got released only one month apart in the same year, 2001.First I thought Hollywood had tried to copy the french one, since Hollywood is constantly doing remakes of foreign movies, and then adjust them to the US market (ex 3 men and a baby, kill bill, and hundreds of others). But clearly no one has been trying to copy anyone in this case since both movies were done in the same year, even released almost at the same time! How bizarre is that???!!Because of the unusual, rather comic books style the characters are portrayed (especially how they are presented in the beginning with the narrative), its an interesting movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuinely beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the most special thing about a Wes Anderson film is that it feels like a complete emotional journey by the end, and this is particularly true of "The Royal Tenenbaums", "Rushmore", and "The Darjeeling Limited". "Rushmore" boasts a stunningly well-written love triangle which is rather implausible, as are many of the events which occur in the film, but because the characters feel so absolutely real one can believe it. "The Darjeeling Limited" is perhaps the only film which is really evocative of how that sort of trip, especially in a foreign country, feels. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is the most far-fetched and quirky of his films other than "The Life Aquatic", but it doesn't matter because Anderson again grounds the film in reality by making the characters feel real.Once again the usual criticism of Anderson's films being too quirky and all that falls apart simply because it's not there for its own sake. I didn't hate Diablo Cody's "Juno" as much as some others, but while there are people who may talk like that the whole thing is far too cutesy and adolescent to earn my respect. I can see Cody or the director Reitman attempting to show off what they think is musical knowledge by name-dropping. Anderson isn't interested in such things, the music in his film serves a purpose always, the characters' quirks exist not simply because it's 'cute', and again his and Owen Wilson's writing here is simply tremendous. Like another IMDb member put it: he treats every character with respect, but doesn't take any one of them too seriously."The Royal Tenenbaums" was Anderson's most ambitious film when he made it. It's got the largest and probably most diverse group of characters, he pushes the style he fully formed with "Rushmore" to the max. I noticed on this viewing, having seen "Rushmore" just a week earlier, that Anderson appears more confident in dealing with exposition visually. The efficiency of characterization in "Rushmore" was remarkable, and I do think it is a superior film to this ultimately, but much of the exposition in that film was handled through dialogue. While there is some well-handled narration here, there are also several quick montages (reminiscent of the one detailing Max's extra-curricular activities in "Rushmore") which convey a lot of information with great efficiency. This movie strikes a great balance between drama and humor, and Anderson is a phenomenal storyteller who lets the audience dictate their level of involvement and interest. He never pushes any information on you, and if you're not really paying attention you'll likely miss a lot of important characterization, even if you follow the general plot just fine. The efficiency of the storytelling is particularly noticeable in this film, considering just how much is covered here.The cast are pretty much perfect, with Gene Hackman giving the best performance of his career (and that's really saying something). Anderson's direction is as controlled and deliberate as can be, but without stifling the material, and the cinematography is gorgeous. The script is great too, and while it's not my favorite Anderson film it is a significant entry in his filmography, not that he has made any 'lesser' films just yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warm oddball comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I was going to love it and liked it. It's not always the way with Wes Anderson - I though his very particular brand of humour really hit the mark with The Life Aquatic. The quirks and subversions of his vision are a gift for an actor, which is, no doubt, why this film is populated with so many good ones.Clearly Anderson has in mind that this is a rather farcical film and in fact might as well be a modern version of The Addams Family. Anglica Huston is not cast entirely with this in mind though, bringing a warmer haughteur to her part as Royal's wife. Royal Tenenbaum was always going to be the key role, the warped Lear, and Hackman is a good choice on paper although I felt he struggled a bit. Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow as the grown, prodigious but dysfunctional siblings are a riot, Stiller a particular delight in conjunction with his boys Ari and Uzi. It is a comedy, after all. It's not entirely satisfying but there's are any number of unexpected laugh-out-loud corners and this will be the appeal for many. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is without a doubt one of the best films I ever saw. Every aspect of this film is beautiful. The directing, the dialogue, the acting, the characters, the plot, all spectacular. This movie has a damn near perfect mix of hilarious comedy and strangely human drama. It's in the top five funniest movies ever made in my opinion (the others being The Big Lebowski, M.A.S.H., Dr. Strangelove, and The Life Aquatic) It may be safe to say that Wes Anderson's directing ability is second to none. He always knows the perfect shots for expressing the feelings of his characters. He also fuses music into his scenes perfectly. To me, for a movie to be truly amazing it has to get you to understand the "bad" characters. In this film some of the characters do some pretty horrible things to each other, but when everything is all said and done, you completely identify with them and don't see them as bad or villainous. This film also has strong morals about forgiveness which I think we could all learn from. All of Wes Anderson's film are grate, but this one is the best in my opinion. A must see for any movie goer. **** out of ****.</fullReview>

The cast are remarkably comfortable with one another, seem to be thoroughly enjoying what they are doing, and deliver some of the best performances of their careers. Several scenes are breathtaking in their execution--a rare feat in contemporary film. Gene Hackman is astonishingly touching, and Huston and Glover could not be better.

		<fullReview>Maybe I saw this movie in the wrong frame of mind. I understood it was a comedy of sorts although the press reviews promised that it was "something more". So I went into the theater expecting "THE GRADUATE" or "THE SURE THING". This flick was terribly disappointing. It was obviously playing for laughs but had spotty and inconsistent humor; e.g., Danny Glover's pratfall vs. attempts at more cerebral laughs. Ben Stiller's character was so wildly out of place -imagine placing Zoolander in "ARTHUR". Glyneth Paltrow's character was not funny at all and functioned as the stereo-typical straight man. Its not hard to make me laugh but I must see humor in its context. I'm guessing this filmmaker wanted to make a film that was poignant, drawing laughter from tears, relationships, etc (Check out ONCE AROUND). Such a filmmaker starts with a sincere purpose but herein the movie soon becomes too obvious an attempt at sophisticated laughs using inconsistent types of humor and not particularly sympathetic characters. It just does not work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty and humor from simplicity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is a hard film to put into a genre. It has no jokes, or funny lines, and the plot is more tragic than anything else. Yet, it works as a comedy, and a drama. Everything about this is very simple. The characters don't have many responses to what's going on, and when they do, they only have short lines, not letting us into the characters at all. Yet, by the end of the film, the characters are lodged in our brain, and we know all facets of them. It's the beautifully simplistic writing and direction that make this small film a masterpiece. Who knew so much could come from the word "OK".Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) hasn't been much of a parent to his now grown kids, but when he tells them he has cancer, they come to see him. Some are more enthused than others to do this. His son Chas (Ben Stiller) hates his father, and keeps his kids away from their grandfather. His secretive step-daughter Margot (Gwenyth Paltrow) still won't let him in. His son Richie (Luke Wilson) feels like a failure, after quitting tennis because of a bad game. His ex-wife Etheline (Angelica Houston) has just found new love right when her husband came back into her life. Sounds very simple, and it is, but beneath the simplicity, and coldness of the characters is a sweet longing, that make these some of the best characters ever written. The acting is superb too, lead by Gene Hackman as the father who doesn't know what to do, but he knows he wants the family back together. This is one of the most perfect comedy/dramas I have ever seen, and after it's over, you just might want to give a hug to your family.My rating: **** out of ****. 105 mins. R for language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Count me among those who don't see what people like about Wes Anderson's films. It's not that they're particularly bad; it's just that they aren't especially good. They are thoroughly average, nothing more or less.This movie sports an excellent ensemble cast but I couldn't help but wish that they populated a more interesting story. I didn't connect with any of the characters so it was difficult to care what was in store for them. It's not necessarily a bad story; it's just missing something to truly engage the audience.I have to admit that, as a director, Anderson is talented. The movie definitely has a style all it's own. Also, the soundtrack reveals an enthusiast's ear. Unfortunately, the film ends up as little more than a mediocre story wrapped up in an appealing package.If you liked "Rushmore" here's another movie in the same style. You can take that as either a recommendation or a warning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is billed as a 'quirky comedy'. Well, to paraphrase Goering, when I hear the word 'quirky' I reach for my revolver. As for 'comedy', just don't go looking for any laughs here. Had this been a mainstream offering I would have baled out after half an hour but stuck with it to the end, determined to find out why it was nominated for an Oscar. Almost two hours later, as it crawled to its end with the speed of an arthritic slug, I had to conclude this had been one irritating, tedious and desperately uncomical film. Not one flicker of a smile had passed over my face and not one jot of interest did I have in any of the characters. Stylistically it had its moments, employing tricks familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of 'indie' cinema or 'alt rock' MTV video. But this was all form over content, right down to the painfully hip 'look at me, I've got taste' soundtrack, itself predictable and conservative despite Anderson's pretensions to the 'avant garde'. The ending, with its syrupy score and 'happy ever after' conclusion, showed the director didn't even have the strength of his convictions, resorting to Hollywood 'feel good' schmaltz. I can only think people who found this film funny did so with the help of chemical assistance - or are the types who think they're more clever than they actually are, always the first to applaud the Emperor in his new clothes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a great cast, plot and it automatically just caught my attention... sadly. This movie was so boring I wanted to shoot myself. The plot just dragged on and the jokes we very dull.A rich couple split up which soon lead to their three children having screwed up, dull, mischievous and awkward lives. 22 years past and now the children are all grown up. The father, Royal Tenenbaum desires his wife back (they never split up) so he tells her about the cancer he has been diagnosed with. This incident causes all three children to move back with their parents and lead their new, boring lives. The plot may sound interesting... but trust me it isn't.2/10 just because it was nice seeing both Wilson brothers playing in the same film... with the touch of Ben Stiller comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great cast; shame about the film. The premise shows potential. Dysfunctional family deserted years before by their father who now wants to worm his way back in. Unfortunately the writing is so limp and the characters so underdeveloped that after twenty minutes you won't care at all about what's going to happen to any of them. Angelica Huston, Bill Murray and Danny Glover have bit parts so inconsequential that their roles could almost have been assigned to extras; of the Tenenbaum children only Luke Wilson's ex-tennis champ character holds any interest at all. Gwyneth Paltrow is at her most two-dimensional (not her fault, blame the script this time), Ben Stiller is completely wasted in his role and the less said about Owen Wilson's part and lack of acting talent the better. The film's only saving grace is Gene Hackman who is on top form and steals every scene that he is in - which is most of them.SPOILERSHowever, the plot device of him pretending to be terminally ill is done away with far too quickly, wasting a lot of comic and dramatic potential, and of course he conveniently dies at the end when no-one (except everybody that watches clichéd films like this) expects it.Also, what's with the title? Why is Hackman named 'Royal' other than to jazz up the film's name? It's never explained; personally I think that calling a film 'The Tenenbaums' would have had less appeal than one with a possible regal attachment, although it would have been more honest. The same association was used to much better effect in the UK sitcom 'The Royle Family', as the lives of the characters portrayed there are as far removed from those of the monarchy as can be. With the USA having no Royal Family what are we supposed to make of it all? Yet again, weak writing.So, to sum up, not really worth bothering with unless you are a die-hard Gene Hackman fan, and even if then I think you'd be better off watching paint dry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen Wes Anderson's first film, Bottle Rocket, and being thoroughly disappointed with it I didn't have that high expectations for this film. It surprised me with how entertaining it was, not to mention how sharp and clever most of the humor was. The cast contains considerable talent and it shows. The acting is superb and the timing is never off. The writing is very good, and there is hardly one joke or gag in the whole film that falls flat. What really makes this film work that despite the extremes, despite the unlikely nature of many situations and characters, it seems somehow believable and it rarely steps out of line or tries to be funny by being downright offensive. It reminded me of old episodes of The Simpsons; a wacky yet(albeit only slightly) credible view at family life. The characters are far-fetched and somewhat unusual but we still relate to them and feel with them. The plot is pretty good and the pacing of it is very good. Despite the laid-back feel of the movie, you're rarely bored. The humor is very good, it makes you laugh without stooping to the level of crude gags or gross-out comedy, and whilst being almost entirely unoffensive. Just about anyone should be able to enjoy this, unless you have something against one or more of the actors, or don't like the style of humor. I advise you to check out the memorable quotes if you are unsure whether or not you'll like the movie. I recommend this to any fan of any of the actors involved and/or fans of Ben Stiller/Wilson brothers' humor. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes this movie a masterpiece, in my opinion, is the great writing and direction, great acting (especially Gene Hackman), great soundtrack, great humor ("Did you just call me Coltrane?" "No."), great story, and great message.The message I got from watching this movie was that family is really more important than the grudges you hold against them. This movie teaches us to follow the characters' role models. If you're the one who caused the problem, realize that and try and make it up to your family. If you hold the grudge, and the other reaches out to you, don't retract. Accept their apologies and move on with your life.Everyone is great in this movie, but Gene Hackman's role is what really stands out. He manages to play a complete jerk and have the audience still like him. Ben Stiller is great, as are Bill Murray and the Wilson brothers.Back to how hilarious the movie is. The movie is so strange and quirky, you can't help but laugh. So many great parts, like Dudley mentioning that the cab has a dent in it (and one there. and one there.), or Royal's laugh after being accused by his son of stealing from him.This movie is truly a great masterpiece in American cinema.</fullReview>

The relationship between each character is amusing and understandable. Each character is important to the plot and the film.

		<fullReview>"The Royal Tenenbaums" is about a hugely disfunctional family of geniuses and former child prodigies that are reunited after Royal (Gene Hackman), the family patriarch, claims he'll be dead in six weeks. The other members include mother Ethlene (Angelica Huston), oldest son Chas (Ben Stiller), adopted daughter Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) and younger, tennis pro Richie (Luke Wilson). But they're not the only ones thrown into the mix, we also have Ethlene's fiancee Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), Margot's husband Raleigh St. Claire (Bill Murray), family friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson - who also co-wrote the movie), Royal's friend Dusty (Seymour Cassel) and butler Pagoda (Kumar Palaan).In Anderson and Wilson's previous film, 1998 masterwork "Rushmore", they had three leads and about five secondary characters who are still quite important. In this they have six leads and about a dozen secondary characters. So it's clear that this is their "big" film, and it is, it's an epic of family films.I'll start with the acting. There is not a single actor that doesn't become their character. Hackman is perfect as the sleazy Royal, Huston is sweet and charming as Ethlene, Paltrow is completely unrecognizable as Margot, Wilson is funny and tragic as Richie, and Stiller gives what is his best performance yet as Chas. The others - Glover, Murray, Wilson - are all pieces in the masterful puzzle that is "The Royal Tenenbaums".Then there is Anderson and Wilson, who - as writers - become characters themselves, with every line that drips off the screen you can just picture them huddled around a computer, typewriter, what have you for hours upon hours perfecting their screenplay. Something notable is Alec Baldwin's narration, his abnormally quiet and teacher-like voice lends even more to this already wonderful film. The script definitely should have won the Oscar, and Hackman, [Luke] Wilson and Gwyneth Paltrow should all have picked up nominations.A beautiful, wonderful film on all accounts, 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Ensemble Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson's 2001 triumph "The Royal Tenenbaums" deals with three former child prodigies - Chas, Margot, and Richie Tenenbaum - whose adult lives epitomize dysfunction. The family's conflicts are intensified when its oft-absent patriarch, Royal, resurfaces seeking redemption (or at least a place to stay now that he's broke).The ensemble cast is enough to overcrowd a movie poster. It features Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson (who co-wrote the film with Anderson), Danny Glover, and Bill Murray; all of them delivering fine performances. Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent as Margot, conveying both cynicism and compassion with her kohl-rimmed eyes. Luke Wilson also leaves a lasting impression as the sweet but emotionally wounded Richie.Anderson's unique storybook visuals are pleasing to the senses, as is the soundtrack (featuring Nico, Elliott Smith, The Velvet Underground, and The Ramones) that wafts into the film like some heavenly mix tape. However, the film ultimately resonates because of the emotions of despair and hope that it conveys with unfailing humor and authenticity. See it more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Off-beat comedy that probably takes its eccentricity too far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tenenbaum family has produced prodigies in various fields, but the father is down on his luck and claims that he is dying of stomach cancer.This New York story rather reminds me of Woody Allen with the farce button nudged up a bit higher. I can live with strange (and this is very strange), but this takes on life-and-death subjects and the obscure with the same focus and attention leaving me a little disoriented.You can see how the producers probably had a ball bringing this concept in to being, but slowed down when they had to take it somewhere and then were wading in treacle trying to bring it to a climax. There is a famous screen writing book that advises that you need to take all your characters and throw them together in a garage (Reservoir Dogs anyone?), but the joke - here - is that even when you throw your (fictional) characters together that doesn't mean they have to interact. Not in a verbal sense anyway. There are lots of good bits here and lots of people trying to entertain, but you can't mix and match comedy and tragedy without being a master of your craft and director Anderson isn't quite there yet. Indeed he should be grateful for the talented cast who pull together and work hard to keep the whole thing from falling apart at the seams. Very watchable though and I hope he can move on and make an even better film or should I say, a better more even film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite what many people say, this film is fantastic. Maybe these people never read any books by, say, Roald Dahl when they were kids. The script is brilliant. I suppose if you're IQ is below 100 AND your parents have been happily married for 45 years, then okay, you're excused. All the children have this brooding inner turmoil that was caused mostly by their father. The character Eli Cash is great. He's that kid that did have parents, but the parents didn't really care, so he latches on to another family.Even the color palette of the film reminds me of a storybook. The cinematography is mostly subtle, but there are the parts in the movie where it zooms in really fast, and not very stable, like the part where Royal approaches Uzi and Ari. The soundtrack is great, especially the Elliott Smith song in the suicide scene.As for Anderson getting all high and mighty after the success of Rushmore, I haven't even seen it. So I can't really compare. I've seen Bottlerocket, which is a hilarious film. This movie isn't pretentious in anyway that I can tell. Aside from the "adult" themes in the movie, this is a fabulous children's book, about the gaining of innocence that was taken away way too early in life.Watch it.

In the end, though, I can't say it is much more than a medicore movie. It has something to say, and certain images and scenes evoke feelings and ring true or are funny and cool. The tone is actually that this is an extraordinary movie that you either get or you don't. The trouble is, I think I got it, and it still wasn't that great. I think it might just boil down to this: Bill Murray gets to our hearts and makes us laugh easier than Gene Hackman, who needs tailor-made material to do it. You can even see that here, as it is Hackman's show with Murray, unfortunately, only a bit player. The last scene, where Murray says "Oh, God no," about something the touring boy can't do, made me wish we had seen more of him throughout the movie. Oh well, we always have Rushmore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if more than a bit taken with itself. Anderson was uncertain about what he wanted to do, inconsistent with his characters and story lines, and how the scenes are strung together. Having established Royal as a wild, Carpe Diem kind of guy, he acts like a grown-up at the wedding. Wouldn't he have pulled another crazy stunt, like, let's say, stolen Eli's roadster, then crashed it into the house? Talk about inconsistent, what was the point of Eli doing that? Maybe Anderson was trying to avoid being predictable, yet I WANTED Royal to do something nutty in one, last desperate attempt to win back his family instead of meekly conceding defeat. Why was he invited to the wedding as if nothing had happened? Royal and Etheline had separated, yet there is no mention of a divorce. Here, Anderson missed a golden opportunity: Royal digging in his heels, refusing to give Etheline a divorce, refusing to recognize Henry as his replacement, forcing her to try to get an annulment, which can take years (I was confused as to why a priest was to preform the ceremony since he cannot marry someone who's divorced.)It was also inconsistent with Royal's attempts to reconcile with his children. Maybe Anderson wants to comment on the peculiarities of family dynamics, yet Royal hardly gives Richie the time of day, and acknowledges Margot only long enough to lecture her on the dangers of two-timing one's spouse.Henry is the Ultimate Uncle Tom, complete with bow tie. Anderson would be accused of racism were it not for the dignity and simmering rage Glover gives Henry, a rage that nearly busts loose in his "jive" exchange with Royal. But after Henry exposes Royal's scam, he shrinks back into the shadows like, well, an Uncle Tom.We're expected to embrace these characters, yet Anderson's style is distant and off-putting. Apart from Hackman, the actors seem trapped by his rigid framing, color scheme, and enforced deadpan. Richie pining for Margot, only to so mortified by her, thanks to a detective's report, that he shaves his hair and takes a razor to himself, tells us that, for Anderson, the human need for intimacy is a messy - even fatal - proposition. Better to keep Life - and Love - at a distance like Henry, then jump into the fray like Royal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a cast this good (Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Danny Glover, Bill Murray, the Wilsons) and a director (Wes Anderson) who clearly has a rapport with his camera, "The Royal Tenenbaums" is certainly no stinker - but the respondents who've written comments on the lines of "Listen up, Touchstone Pictures - I want that 105 minutes of my life back and I want them back NOW" are on to something.The problem with the movie is that this tale of a gifted but emotionally starved family in New York, whose problems basically stem from the insensitive patriarch (Hackman), isn't populated with anyone you can really give much of anything about. This is supposed to be darkly comic, but writers Anderson and Owen Wilson go overboard on the dark bit and almost never provide anything comic - not that I wanted the film to be filled with endless jokes and slapstick, but the movie fails to even draw a smile for the most part... and though decently acted and with amusing stuff around the edges ("That cab's got a dent in it," says a character of one of the most dilapidated taxis in the Big Apple), after a while you begin to wonder why you're even bothering with this. As Margot, the adopted daughter, Gwyneth is playing a woman who's depressed for practically the entire movie - she was the only person I truly bonded with, because I suffer from depression myself (and this damn movie didn't help). There are some decent moments throughout, but in the end, it just proves - again - that smaller, more intimate movies aren't as immune to being empty inside as the independent sector insists. Listen up, Touchstone Pictures - I want that 105 minutes of my life back and I want them back NOW.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I admit it: SPOILERS (I guess).I loved Bottle Rocket. I loved Rushmore. I barely liked The Royal Tannenbaums, if I liked it at all. It has very good points. The music, the colors, the costuming, the cinematography were all very good. But I was bored. All those things alone do not a good movie make.First, I wanted a lot more. For all the characters and plotlines this film had, it needed way more time. No character was seriously developed (with the possible exception of Royal) and all the information in the mis-en-scene didn't do enough to fill in the gaps when the dialogue stopped. All those games in the closet didn't do it for me, neither did the pictures on the wall in Eli's (Owen Wilson's) apartment. Second, I wanted a lot less. There was way to much packed into this film, given its running time. The wonderful premise (an estranged father of child prodigies, pretends he is dying to move back in with the family when he's kicked out of his old place) was diluted almost beyond recognition by the addition of a quick sketch of everyone else's life story. Take those out, tell the main story, and the film works better in my opinion. There was enough material in this film for three or more very interesting movies, I would've liked to have seen all those films.I will say this, Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson are wonderful at creating memorable characters. I think in 20 years Dignan and Max will seen as fresh and as great as they do today. This film was overflowing with memorable characters. Sadly though, in the end, looking at the poster of this moive said as much about the characters as the film ever did, which is too bad because there was a ton of potential, just not near enough time.One last little annoyance, the reason Chas (Ben Stiller) moved back home had to be the most contrived part of the movie. No sprinkler's at home? Come on. I know Wes and Owen can do a lot better than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great cast, but this one went right past me. I like dark humor, and I like offbeat movies. While this movie falls into both of those categories, it just isn't very funny or interesting.The movie is full of quirky characters, but quirky characters aren't enough - you have to care about them, or at least find them humorous or interesting in *some* way. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A star studded cast that built the perfect dysfunctional family.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Genius! The Royal Tanenbaums is one of the best movies I've seen in a long while. Edward Gorey meets Days of Our Lives. True to form, Gene Hackman was scintillating. Owen Wilson was, well, Owen Wilson--delightful to the hilt. Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bill Murray, and Luke Wilson proved to be equally stellar. A star studded cast that built the perfect dysfunctional family.I waited almost a year until this film was out of the theatres before I saw it. I'm very skeptical of my friends' opinions, but had someone cued me in to this film's pure originality, I would have rushed to the theatres to see it.One reason this film is so attractive is its consistency. The characters are undeniably unique and don't deviate a degree from their established personality. The structure of the film is very fluid, a story built around chapters of a book checked out from the library about the Tanenbaum family (perhaps one of Eli's novel's or maybe one of Margo's plays) narrated by Alec Baldwin. Also, the grainy, circa 1970s cinematography creates the perfect ambiance for the film. It makes the story seem fictional, obviously a film that has jumped inside a book but hasn't blurred the sharp, crisp edges of reality (the library book) with the soft, rainy lines of the story.Completely delightful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh my God, this is Bad. (This is a comedy, Right?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have discovered that there are basically two reasons for me to do a review at IMDb. The first and most obvious, I loved the movie and want all to know what a great film it is. The second much more obscure reason is that there are numerous votes of 10 or 9 at IMDb and I am thinking the film was trash.This film fits in the second category. Oh my God, this is bad. I couldn't even finish the movie on DVD (I was amazed I watched 2/3 before shutting it down.) and found the special features on the DVD much more interesting. Why is this a bad movie? The acting for the most part seemed wooden and forced to me. The interaction between the actors seems very rehearsed, very unnatural, and not even funny. (This is a comedy, Right?)This seems more like a boring factual, matter of fact movie about a family. A family which I would try desperately to stay away from after seeing this movie about them. Just very, very, strange and I don't mean in a good way.About I really can recommend of the DVD is the extra goodies on the DVD. Stay away from the movie itself. I warned you.

		<fullReview>I had been wanting to see this film for a while because I had read many good reviews, and it got nominated for several awards. After seeing it, I have to wonder who are these people that seem to think this was funny and one of the best films of 2001. It didn't make me laugh once. Sure, when the characters are introduced in the beginning, you think they are going to be really interesting as adults. But, the writing just wasn't there. Gene Hackman was really good in this, to bad the movie didn't have the plot to go along with the acting.FINAL VERDICT: Disappointing because could have been so much more. I'd have to say this should just be skipped because it isn't that entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess this sort of movie is just too subtle for some people.For those of us who don't need every joke telegraphed 15 minutes in advance, or every character trait spelled out in broad strokes, Wes Anderson is without a doubt one of the absolute gems of the American cinema today. This movie is about subtlety, about the little ways in which we all interact with our families and friends even if we don't always acknowledge them to ourselves. This film takes an oddball family whose life stories are almost certainly unlike those of its viewers, and shows us that their emotions and familial interactions are not so much different from our own, even if none of us were rich businessmen, award-winning playwrights or tennis champions before we were out of our teens. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe how many people on the imdb DON'T like this movie. It is a staggeringly original film. Gene Hackman's performance is so tightly &amp; consciously controlled that young actors should study his work in this opus.With a bizarre story of a family in tatters, Anderson has morphed conventional comedy into something entirely fresh &amp; totally entertaining. Some of the reviews re: Tenenbaums smack of idle contempt from people who were weaned on Top Gun and Independence Day. have you people ever SEEN a film? Sweet Jesus, The Royal Tenenbaums is pure gold. Anyone who doesn't think so knows NOTHING about cinema. Go rent The Fast &amp; the Furious- it's probably more your style.</fullReview>

And when they are forced to make the transition from the weird to the mundane it is a butt clenching experience of unbearable cuteness and sentimentality. Anderson is incapable of creating characters you care about or believe in. So he hides behind his 'style' and hopes you'll mistake his vacuous pretension for subtlety.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere in this movie is a coherent story, but it's unfortunately buried under lackluster acting and self-important directing. I have not seen so little energy in performances since ... well, Dragnet. Any film which uses Bill Murray in this way should be burned -- what a waste of resources! Only Gene Hackman seems to be engaged at all in this film, likely because he's supposed to be the charming-rogue character, whereas all of the rest of the characters are supposedly serious and therefore boring. You can't blame the high-priced acting talent for this -- Wes Anderson deserves all the blame here. Besides the bland and deadpan acting, there are innumerable shots of actors staring directly into the camera, saying and doing nothing. The movie is broken up into 'chapters' in an annoying literary pretension that distracts rather than adds to the story. Alec Baldwin adds a constant voiceover to move the plot, since almost none of what we see manages to do that. Maybe this makes a great art film, or experimental cinema, but it fails as anything else. It's 109 minutes of almost constant boredom, with only its lush cinematography to recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Altman Should Have Directed It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something about Wes Anderson's stories that I find slightly off-putting. He's a good writer and storyteller, and I can't find anything wrong with his direction. His movies are professionally made, A-list quality, top Hollywood product. Why then, don't I enjoy them as much as the for-pay film critics or IMDb commenters? I must be missing something.A complaint that I can (barely) articulate is that the movies have a slightly sour tone. Some of the most inventive characters populate his work, but I never quite connect with them. (I felt the same about the characters in "Rushmore"). A 'poor little rich kid' characterization acts as a barrier to my empathizing with Anderson's protagonists. I actually want them to fail, not persevere. I guess I should to discuss this issue with my analyst. That said, "The Royal Tenenbaums" is a very good movie; it certainly makes for an entertaining weekend rental. I agree with the Academy though, it's not Oscar-caliber. If Mr. Anderson had written the screenplay, and then let Robert Altman direct it, then maybe it'd gotten nominations. I certainly would have enjoyed it more. </fullReview>

Please, film-makers, surprise me once in a while. When you lie on your deathbed, what runs through your mind is not what you did, but what you failed to do. So stop failing to make bold movies.

		<fullReview>I've seen some simply awful films in my years, but I can safely say without a moment's hesitation that The Royal Tenenbaums is the worst piece of nonsense I've ever had the misfortune to be exposed to.It's quite obvious that this movie thinks it's very funny and throughout every painful minute the viewer gets the impression the film is constantly patting itself on the back in celebration of its wittiness.But in actual fact - aside from pleasing the middle class dinner party brigade - this film is about as funny as the Ebola virus. The dialogue is contrived, the characters' "quirkiness" is simply annoying at best and cringe-inducing at worst, and the direction veers wildly out of control in a haphazard and formless fashion.I'm sure the star cast can sleep easy at night thinking they've been in a "seriously artistic" movie, but when the ending credits start to roll the viewer simply appreciates how dumb each cast member must have been to have accepted their role in the first place.In short, this film is firmly up its own rear-end. It's unfunny, un-original and un-inspired. Save yourself a couple of hours and keep this contrived nonsense well away from your DVD player.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was really looking forward to this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and now I'm looking forward to not watching this again.Someone wanted this trifle to be a lot of things. The trouble with that is, it shows through. It reeks of wannabe. It wants to be Le Fabeleux Destin D'Amelie Poulain meets Short Cuts. It relies on a star-studded cast in kooky roles, narration, detailed sets and colors galore. It goes for a tacky 1970's look, as the set and costume designers made sure to find the most mismatched ties, hats, shoes and jackets and objects they could find in terms of both design and color, but it's neither realistic nor pleasantly surreal, it's just labored. The Royal Tenenbaums wants to be fresh, artsy, moving, intriguing, charming, entertaining, funny and serious. It ends up falling flat on all accounts.Speaking of flat, I can think of two movies where the cinematography annoys me to the point where I'm completely distracted away from the story in favor of a sinister urge to slap whoever is responsible: Battlefield Earth and The Royal Tenenbaums. In Battlefield Earth the camera is tilted 45 degrees in every shot to create a dramatic effect for no reason whatsoever in whatever devoid-of-content non-dramatic scene there is. The makers of The Royal Tenenbaums, on the other hand, have a fetish for symmetry. Nearly every shot of a character, environment or object is symmetrical. If one character is in the shot, he's in the exact middle of the picture, facing the camera at an exact angle, placed in front of a symmetrical background. Just like in hip-hop/r'n'b videos which apparently can't be done without silvery corridors, frog's eye view and a bunch of dancers in bowling-pin configuration. This is cool for effect, if used wisely, tastefully and sparsely, (Kevin Spacey getting fired in American Beauty or the opening shot of Turkish' shaved head in Snatch) but using it for two hours plus is an amateurish testament to poor imagination. Whenever the shot requires several characters in the picture, it's composed in a way so that whatever is to the left balances out what's on the right. The end result doesn't convey the feeling of someone trying to create art, I just get a disturbing look into the head of some pedantic psychopath who can't sleep unless his shoes are lined up at an exact distance in a perfectly straight line.Moving on to the other artistic merits... well, there basically is none. While the cast is made up of accomplished actors, they're really not doing much except sporting their default, built-in character. I get the feeling the director was running arround obsessing with symmetry in the shots while the actors directed themselves.Don't get me wrong, I love movies that are about nothing. That is, whenever they find something substantial in the little things of life and dwell on it and shed new light on it. Even better if they do so on a tiny budget and with simple means. But Royal Tenenbaums goes to extreme lenghts to convey a story about nothing without finding even a breadcrumb of a story worth telling. It's the classic story about a careless bastard who fails to live up to his social responsibilities, who then goes through some cathartic experience and comes out a better man, a la As Good as it Gets, Family Man or Liar Liar. Except in this one, there's no real payoff in the end.Whenever a fresh, young director gets this kind of shot at making the big time, handling this kind of cast and budget, you get the feeling it's gonna be the start of something great. But Wes Anderson is no new Paul Thomas Anderson, M. Night Shyamalan or Sam Mendes. He's not your man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting... but not Oscar Material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Hackman, who is one of my favourite actors, really shines in this one. However in many scenes in this movie we find his role is pretty much a reprise of the crusty, chain-smoking-old-guy shtick he did in Heartbreakers, which was arguably a far funnier outing.The rest of the actors play essentially peripheral roles, and the interplay between Richie and Margot Tenenbaum and Eli Cash are, well, ho-hum and really don't liven up the picture that much. Paltrow overplays her hand in this one, but Anjelica Huston is well-nigh perfect as an overly-solicitous and protective mother. Ben Stiller (in the role of Chas Tenenbaum)is just plain annoying. Owen Wilson is horribly miscast as a failed, coked-out writer, an oft-overdone, gimmicky role that has been tried in other movies with varying results.The humourous parts of the film work because they come so unexpectedly, and the overall pacing of the script is good. The story is interesting, too.What makes The Royal Tenenbaums work as well as it does is its quirky characters and weird juxtapositions. On the other hand, the entire enterprise tries too hard to be one of those Woody Allen-ish, arty films (in the same vein as Annie Hall). You can always tell when a movie is going to be 'arty' - it's usually released on a label bearing a pretentious name you've never heard of before.The Royal Tenenbaums is reasonably entertaining if you like stories that take you off the beaten track and dish out doses of unexpected humour. Otherwise, it's a bit of a pedestrian exercise.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is more action in plant growing contests, more sex in Mary Poppin's movies...BORING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a cold Sunday afternoon 24 hours after a snowstorm of epic proportions (Ok, only three inches, but...) and my wonderful girlfriend suggested we check out a movie. I agreed and since I picked the last movie- Black Hawk Down- I asked her what she wanted to see (I know, what a guy). The suggestion was The Royall Tenenbaums. She is no longer allowed to suggest movies. Ever. I have never had trouble keeping my eyes open during a movie until the excrutiating hour and a half I spent suffering through Tenenbaum. I have never wished that I was at the dentist or proctologist until Tenenbaum. I have never thought that there could be an activity more boring than watching a snail sleep before Tenenbaum. Heck, prison is a more enticing option than sitting through Tenenbaum. Even watching your nose hairs grow is more enticing. What was so bad about the movie? In my mind, a movie has to have one of the following to be worthy of viewing: Action, drama, comedy, sex, a good story, and any of a million other things. Tenenbaum meets none of the criteria. For crying out loud, even the chick...who is by the way not even a hot babe with huge natural breast...she don't even deserve to be in a film, (Gwyneth Paltrow) does not look good in this movie. There is more action in plant growing contests, more sex in Mary Poppin's movies, and drama (!) well I cannot even think of something that would result in a facetious comment. Oh, and the good story part; lets just say that most Wrestlemania shows, late night Cinemax, and Springer episodes involve more of a story line.Furthermore, the movie leads you to believe that there is a star studded cast. Well, there is. I do have to wonder if the stars (Hackman, Paltrow, and Stiller) even read the script before signing on. Paltrow (One reason to put up with up a chic flick- she is pleasing to the eye and other parts) spends the entire movie in a catatonic state. She is the brooding daughter who is chronically depressed and spends every minute wearing too much dark makeup and showing less acting ability than most dead squirrels. Stiller, well, for the three minutes he appears in the movie he is about as humorous as a bottle of Aquafina water. Even worse, the film does not even try to make use of his humorous abilities. Heck, anyone could have played his part and done as well as he did. About all he did was wear a funny jump/sweat suit and play the part of the tough love son. As for Paltrow and Stiller, think of an athlete who knows he is past his time, but would like to collect a final paycheck- worthless and showing zero talent, but collecting big bucks. Gene Hackman plays the lead role and was about as funny as, well, as uh, Rosanne is sexy. Yes, just like seeing Rosanne naked, I found Hackman to be as endearing as, well as seeing Rosanne naked. In other words, there are about 97.7 million things I would rather suffer through. Hackman plays the role of devious father who has been estranged from his family for years- 20 to be exact. He is desperately trying to win back the affection of his family and goes to extremes- which we are supposed to think are humorous- to do so. The oh- so- humorous extremes involve faking illness and secret meetings with the kids of Stiller in order to win affection. At the same time he is trying to win his way back into the heart of his wife (divorced him- sort of- after he lost his millions) and we are supposed to find this funny. Again, I would get more of a chuckle out of staring at a wall.The plot basically focuses on Hackman as an estranged father figure who has lost millions. He wants to earn back the love of his family and goes to the not so funny extremes I mentioned before. In the interim, you have the wacky daughter (Paltrow) and her numerous loves, the loony son and his friend (the dorky "perfect" guy from Meet the Parents) trying to fall in love with Paltrow, and Stiller playing the oddball father to two kids who really do resemble what he most likely looked like at a younger age. Hackman pretends to have cancer and is set to die shortly. He wants to right all of his wrongs with the family and get back into their good blessings before passing on. The movie ends when he finally does pass with the tough love son- Stiller- beside his bed. Perhaps the biggest problem with the movie is that it was impossbile to follow. The story was not developed well and there were too many characters attempting to be developed in the opening three minutes.I thought that the premise posed some moments that could be humorous. The last time I was that wrong was when I invited my parents to see "Debbie Does Dallas" with me and a girlfriend. In all honesty, I told my girlfriend that Tenenbaum was the worst movie I had ever seen and this was five minutes into the movie. My opinion only got worse. The one saving grace- as is often the case for a guy when seeing a chic movie- would have been Paltrow. However, unlike many chic flicks, the female lead was not attractive. Had Paltrow looked remotely sexy/hot/not butt I may have been able to keep my eyes open for the entire movie. I would liken Tenenbaum to a dark Woody Allen movie. Hey, if you like that stuff, more power to you. Personally, I prefer going to Dr. Urbuttisingoodshape (the proctologist) versus a Woody Allen production. Especially one that is a poor offering. In case you are wondering, my girlfriend is still my girlfriend. However, she is NEVER allowed to pick another movie unless I am really, really hungover and in need of a nap. Believe it or not, I even told her I would rather be watching "What Women Want". Avoid Tenenbaum.</fullReview>

But when I was reading the other comments, I read that some people dislike it because they can't relate to the Tenenbaums. Why do you have to relate? Why do people always make a big deal about that? The point of movies like this one, is that you look from the outside and be glad you can't relate.And the ending was too happy. Everything came nicely together and everyone had wath they wanted. But that's a typical Hollywood error, the problem is that most people like it. But if you look at the greatest films like Dr. Strangelove, Requiem for a dream, The Sixth Sence, No Mans Land, American Beauty,... None of them have a happy ending. If it weren't for the ending, I would have given it a 9, but now it will have to do with 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy/Tragedy... Brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am constantly amazed by the mainstream movie going public. You would think that I would have ceased being amazed long ago, but I guess I'm a romantic at heart who really wants to keep faith. Enter many comments that I have read on this site about one of the funniest, saddest and most touching films I have ever seen: The Royal Tenenbaums.The fine line between comedy and tragedy is well known to anyone with any sense of dramatic history. This film dances back and forth over that line with an evil grin (much like Happiness did as well), making you laugh, then making you pay for it with a moment of tragedy. How could anyone say (as many of you did) that you "didn't laugh once"?! While I realize that no one was hit in the crotch with a golf ball (which ironically does walk that line between comedy and tragedy... hmmm), if you didn't laugh out loud at the deadpan one-liners like Bill Murray's "she smokes?", Dudley's "Am I colorblind?", or Angelica Huston's "Well, I think you should quit" there is seriously something wrong with you (or you were distracted waiting for Ben Stiller to make a funny face). Check out the "memorable quotes" section on this page if you don't believe that there is anything funny here! By the same token, if you didn't fight back tears during Richie's "hair cutting scene" (with Elliot Smith's beautiful Needle In The Hay providing the only sound), Bill Murray's one word exit "goodbye" to Gwyneth Paltrow in the hospital, or Ben Stiller connecting with Danny Glover with the line "I'm a widower too", then you are colder than I can imagine!Rushmore was an indication of Wes and Owen's talent and gift for dialogue, disarming comedy and character development but Tenenbaums is their masterpiece. The world they have created, where children and adults alike can isolate themselves from each other while all in the same house and tear apart the people closest to them seconds after making you laugh, is so unique and engaging it makes supposed "heartfelt dramas" like the Armageddons of the world seem offensive to all human sensibilities and supposed comedies like the Dumb &amp; Dumbers of the world seem more base and childish than anything your kids watch on Saturday morning. This is complete and powerful film making - with the full range of emotions and moods that life really has, even in a caricature of reality. I can't imagine seeing this film less than 100 more time in my lifetime... and I can't imagine how you could feel otherwise. By the way, even after the third viewing, Eli's pretentious "Everyone knows that Custer died at Little Bighorn, what this book presupposes is... he didn't" makes me laugh embarrassingly loudly. That's how good this film is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the best I've seen in the past several years. I loved the understatement of it. I'm so tired of histrionics being labeled "great acting". No, it's not Jim Carrey stuffing papers in his mouth and getting big laughs! (Not that I didn't love "Liar, Liar"!) This is so much funnier, so much more subtle. Just the script alone is priceless. There isn't one boring spot in it. Then there is the fine acting, especially by Gene Hackman. It's so rare to see a film where nobody is "chewing the scenery"! And the visuals: the house, with every detail perfectly done, the Gypsy cabs and Green Line buses, Margot's fur coat, Richie's headband, Chas' warmup suits, Pagoda doing yoga, fixing martinis, reading in his hammock... How could anybody watch this and pronounce it boring??? You must have burned out your brains watching "The Fast and the Furious". I just hope Wes Anderson keeps making movies for years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Getting this out of the way right off the bat, there is probably a number of comments here that could be considered "spoilers". You are forewarned.After watching the dvd of the Royal Tenenbaums, and after reading a number of postings here, I am amazed at the number of people who miss the humour in this wonderfully crafted film. Sure its not (thankfully) Zoolander, or American Pie, or any other piece of drek where someone's haircut, a stutter, or a guy getting kicked in the groin is the height of comedy. I'm not going to outline the plot of the film, that has been done, probably much better than I could, in numerous postings elsewhere.There is simply so much to like here. Hackman spouting 70's catch phrases to everyones bafflement (does anyone still tell people to "shag ass"?), along with his Marvin Belli style wardrobe and his complete lack of feeling for anyone else. Owen Wilson's self-absorbed Eli Cash, betraying everyone he comes in contact with (The scene with Margot in the subway puts the lie to his obviously self-created western persona). Bill Murray, when faced with a detective outlining Margot's numerous affairs deadpanning afterward "she smokes?". Pagoda, a man of many abilities including a humble servant, a male nurse, a master of disguise, and a vicious guy with a knife.There is obviously much broad comedy in the film (Royal's day with his grandsons, Royal and Margot at lunch, Chas and Royal at the lawyers, Richie's last match plus 2 dog fights!!). The wedding day alone is as funny as anything made in the last ten years, with the dog leash snaking out from under the car the funniest (and most morbid) part. However, as Mies Van der Rohr said, "God is in the details".One could list a multitude of scenes where the laughter comes from a brief look (Richie, when being wheeled through the hospital, still has all the shaving cream on his face), an aside (Dudley, in a room seemingly a 100 yards away, listening to Murray commenting to a colleague outlinng the number of serous problems the kid has (besides the fact he wears shorts and a bucket hat in all types of weather) and asking "I'm colour-blind?") the scenery (Eli's paintings, the inside of Richie's tent, the games closet where so much important dialogue seems to take place, the cabs, the 375th St. Y, where Richie ends up destroying children in a tennis camp), or the costumes (Richie's wrist bands over his bandages, Margot's Izod dresses, Eli's ill-fitting hat and cut rate cowboy wear, Etheline's ever-present pencil, the elevator operator uniforms). This layering effect serves to make the film even more interesting upon repeated viewings. There is more taking place at the edges of this movie than occur entirely in most other flicks. The timing even seems to pass through (at my count) every season over the space of a couple of weeks.And while, if looked at objectively, there are a lot of damaged people in this movie who behave reprehensibly, you can't help but feel for them. Each, in his or her own way is struggling to deal with situations (many self-created) that have burdened them for years, and come to a solution they can live with.So like everything, to each his own, although I'm baffled by anyone choosing garden variety crap over something as well made as this. Considering some of the prior comments there are many out there who will never "get" a movie like this, and I guess that can be considered a good thing. Gives you that much more pleasure when you do come across a gem like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: this movie is not for the clueless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do all the major film critics and people who loved (or at least respected) this movie have that the rest of the bad review writers have? A clue. As one positive reviewer said, it balances on a knife edge between comedy and sadness. That's it in a nutshell. This doesn't necessarily make it a dark comedy; on the contrary, I found a lot of things to celebrate about dysfunctional families. This movie was funny, sweet, and sad; tweaked just right with Anderson's semi-skewed view of the world. If you can't appreciate that, then I feel sorry for you. To call this movie bad, however, just pegs you as...clueless.** Minor Spoilers ** Anderson &amp; Wilson just keep getting better. I love Anderson's ability to compound an emotional scene with music. He carefully fits in the soundtrack in the most precise moments, it's beautiful. Consider the scene where Margot and Ritchie meet at the bus station with close up shots and Nico's "These Days" as a backdrop. I mean, I hate Nico's music, but it works here. Same goes with Nike Drake's "Fly" and Elliot Smiths "Needle in the Hay". Everything clicks. I love the detail that Anderson puts into his sets. If you pick up the DVD, listen to his commentary track. It's amazing to see all the intricate details that go into his shots. Things you really wouldn't notice nor care about, yet add to the ambiance of the world he creates.</fullReview>

Oh sure, there are funny scenes, but comedies are suppose to make you laugh. The star-studded cast does an excellent job, but it seem that the only direction they were given was to look dour.I wonder what Wes Anderson was after.

		<shortDescription>Somewhat entertaining, but also somewhat weird.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoa! Over half the IMDb votes for this film are from the youngest group 18 - 29, that must be where all the 10s come from. Most of us in the more mature category rate it about 7 or 8, which is where I believe it belongs, relative to all other good films. mild SPOILERS - "The Royal Tennenbaums" is a film with no lasting value, just funny. Gene Hackman plays Gene Hackman here, and he is at his best playing himself. He is Royal Tennenbaum and has managed to alienate his whole family over the years, 2 sons (Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller) and a daughter (Gwenneth Paltrow), plus his wife (Angelica Huston). Royal has been living in a hotel for 22 years, not clear how he paid his way, but now is being evicted. Needing a place to stay, he arrives back at home, claiming to be on his deathbed, and a fellow bum pretends to be his doctor, complete with "medicines" that look and taste amazingly like Tic-Tacs.Meanwhile, for unrelated personal reasons, all three children move back home too. As kids they all had been considered geniuses, one as a tennis player, one as an author, and the other as a businessman. Now they were all dysfunctional adults. When Royal's scam is exposed he is sent packing. However, each of the children come away with fresh perspectives and we are expected to believe that in his own unique way Royal was the catalyst to help them become productive adults. AFAIAC, the only reason to watch this film is for the performance of Gene Hackman, and to a lesser degree, Angelica Huston. Paltrow, Wilson, Wilson, and Stiller were all rather boring in their roles. They all can be fine actors, so I suspect the blame must go to the scriptwriters.I rate it a "7" of ten, the entertainment factor was fairly good, but the film delivers it fairly unevenly.</fullReview>

Another aspect that's been pointed out before is that it's very similar to some of J.D. Salinger's work, particularly his stories about the Glass family, a family of child geniuses who ended up having emotional problems as adults. If you like Salinger's work, chances are you'll like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My worst nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, talk about disappointment! And to think, I was anxious to see this one!I'm having trouble understanding exactly what anyone might have found amusing about this film (with the exception of the conversation during Ritchie and Eli's reunion scene). I will also reiterate the point made by several other people who have seen this movie - I spent a good fifty minutes waiting for something (anything!) to happen and then the remaining hour wondering why on earth I'd even watched it as far as I had.Nothing happens in this movie!Yes, there's a story. Contrary to what some people are gleaning from this film, there is a plot. It's very evident. The only problem is that it's not an interesting story. There are some scenes which are reminiscent of situational comedy and "upscale" humor, but they all fall short. I let out a brief chuckle in the aforementioned scene with Ritchie and Eli, but nothing else stirred me. There is an all-star cast with some of my favorite actors and actresses. I even like Owen Wilson, and EVERYBODY hates him!There's a very big problem, though. One that you might even miss since it's sort of obscured by the various other drudgeries: acting. This film was like my worst nightmare. It was as if the director sat down with the actors and said to them, "Okay, here's the deal, you're all great actors capable of some superb performances. What I want you to do, though, is pretend that you're Tom Cruise. That's right; I don't want you to put any sort of emotion into your lines, try not to move too much, and overall just seem like you're disinterested in your role." What they should have done, in fact, was just cast Mr. Cruise and had him talk his way through all of the roles. At least then I wouldn't have wasted my time watching the film.I'll take my dirty jokes and cheap humor any day. I may overrate "Pootie Tang" when I describe it to people, but it had much better acting, a much more interesting story, and infinitely funnier scenes than "The Royal Tenenbaums". I'm very glad that it was my free rental at the video store and that I didn't see it in the theaters like I had planned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went middle-of-the-road with a "5" on this one. The film was indeed boring at times, but the characters were off the wall enough to keep the viewer intrigued more often than not. The montage where Royal shows his grandchildren how to live on the streets as urchins was priceless and should be shown to all parents.However, all the characters are off in their own worlds, keeping the others at arms length and emotionally distant. The primary problem with the film is that this effect carries over to the audience; we can't relate to any of them due to the way they keep their emotions bottled up. This leads to us not caring nearly as much about them as we could, and therefore not caring as much about the film as we could. "Tennenbaums" is apparently highly autobiographical. The author should have been a bit less self-absorbed during the editing and considered what the audience might have considered an interesting film.</fullReview>

It couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a ruthless black comedy or a fluffy (that's what irritated me most about Rushmore's ending) movie, and that ends up making you feel like all these people are jerks. The worst part about this movie is of course the condescendingly overworked soundtrack. It was cast terribly, yes, you SHOULD be suspicious of the all-star billing. Bleeeeech. What is this? A satire of a satire? It doesn't work at all. That was one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. I just even saw Gummo, and I'd say that that, albeit completely pointless, was at least better in that it wasn't so totally mean-spirited and up its own rear in celebrity. The Anderson/Wilson duo are completely incapable of committing themselves to anything meaningful at all. I turned the movie off right after the plot twist, because I couldn't suspend my disbelief anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so excited to see this movie, as I really thought RUSHMORE had its moments. Now if you are the sort of person who is distracted by an all star ensemble cast, this movie will only reinforce your opinion that they don't belong in these sorts of off beat movies. It was horribly miscast and everyone was dead in their nasty roles. Not only that, but you get the feeling that everyone involved with this movie was a member of a special hip club that they assume you are dying to be part of. The boredom found in his other movie BOTTLE ROCKET is found even worse here, and his humor is not biting enough to say anything at all. Was this a satire or what? I'm told it is satirizing the way Hollywood portrays dysfunctional rich families, but good luck figuring that out. Why satire a satire? They canel each other out, don't they? The scene with Gene Hackmen riding go-karts was a very crucial moment for me, because I realized at precisely that moment that this guy Wes Anderson is only capable of fluff. I mean, come on, no matter how hard this guy tries to treat situations as honestly as possible, he's incorrigibly drawn to that fluff, with the complimentary 70's feel-good rock songs. Like the equally bad VANILLA SKY, this movie had an overworked soundtrack. I'm not even going to comment on the siblings "falling in love with each other." That was horribly stupid and unbelievable and nonsensical. I admit that I turned off the movie before the LAST TEN MINUTES it was so insulting and dishonest. I was absolutely convinced that no ending, no matter how truthful, could redeem the crap I had just seen. This totally turned me off to Wes Andeson/Owen Wilson (who seriously has a conceit problem) and his little exclusive club. Because it was mean-spirited while also being bad, I can say that this is one of the worst movies I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Big Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you'll check my review of "Rushmore," you'll see that I was highly impressed with Wes Anderson as a director a few years ago. I was completely floored by Amderson's style then, and continue to list "Rushmore" as one of my favorite films ever. This movie, however, isn't fit to tie "Rushmore"'s shoelaces. The problem is that Anderson seems to mistake strange and complicated for interesting, as if giving all these people quirks and tragic lives (the kinds that only movie characters ever seem to have) somehow makes them more watchable. It doesn't work, and neither does the movie.The plot is pretty complex, but here's a bare-bones rundown: **SPOLIERS AHEAD**The movie tells the story of a sleazy, ne'er-do-well father named Royal (Gene Hackman) who splits from mom in the seventies(Anjelica Huston) and abandons three kids. The kids grow up geniuses, as their mother engineers their lives to make them as successful and smart as possible. One plays pro tennis, one succeeds in the finance market, one writes plays. After the kids grow up, Royal tries to come back for some reason, either to regain a family's love or have a place to crash, depending on whatever story he's telling. He tells some lies and makes everybody mad, they find him out, kick him out, forgive him, take him back and the film ends somewhat happily as Royal dies and takes his family's love with him. In truth, a two-hour yawn.The film never really seems to get on track. There's a lot of build-up, as if a really good joke is somewhere over the horizon, but it never shows up. Hackman's performance was good, as was Huston's, but the rest of the lightweights in the cast couldn't keep up, especially Gwyneth Paltrow, who was in way over her head in this movie. Every time she came on-screen, I got drowsy. This movie was just a big disappointment. I was really excited about seeing it, and got let WAY down.Things to look for: actually, the weird things are made so obvious that it's no fun to spot them. Overall grade: C-/D+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, predictable, pretentious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums was marketed as a quirky, comic look at a family of prodigies and geniuses. I found that this movie had the same fundamental problems that director Wes Anderson's other train wreck, Rushmore, had: an absurd and overwhelming sense of its own quirkiness. This movie begs you to acknowledge and marvel at its "strange" behavior. I find this very annoying and somewhat pretentious. As if the Anderson, is so desperate for the fawning admiration of Cannes Festival attendees, that he made sure to slow down and point out all the "cool spots" in his work. Like a bad musician who replays his few moments of decent performance, over and over again. What is additionally frustrating is that the actors all do a very good job. Gene Hackman is, as always, phenomenal. Even Gwyneth Paltrow, whom I usually dislike, embodies her role exceptionally well. However, like Rushmore, the fine acting is cast inside a rather banal and ridiculous script. I didn't really care much about these people, and found most of them simply annoying. Moreover, we're told repeatedly what geniuses these people are, but we never see them actually behave like geniuses. We're expected to just accept them as such. I don't like that. If you're going to embody your characters with superpowers, you had better show them exercising them, at least once. As such, all we see is these geniuses spiraling into obsessive compulsive behavior and psychotic neurosis. Furthermore, I did not find this movie very funny at all. The funniest character was Danny Glover and his nerdy, unsure of himself suitor of Ethiline Tenenbaum. The only scene that made me laugh was when Glover's character suddenly falls into a pit at an archaeological dig. It was a bright spot of simple, slapstick humor among a sea of pretentious grandstanding. Ignore the reviews on this one. It's dumb. Save your money, go rent something good like Donnie Darko.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where did this come from?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't believe my senses when I was done watching this movie for the first time. I watched it again and accepted the unbearable truth. This movie had nothing original or new to offer. The bland, typical drama movie plot, and sterile dialogue fell way below my expectations. Rushmore was a masterpiece in all aspects; plot, dialogue, visuals, and character casting. The Royal Tenenbaums had none of these except for MAYBE the "visuals" part. In my eyes this film was so incredibly over-produced that Wes was completely intimidated. I believe that the visual aspects became such an issue for Anderson (seeing as how the budget for this movie was so far beyond anything Wes had to play around with prior to Rushmore's fame) that he forgot about the more important aspects of film making such as plot and character development; incidentally these were two of the outstanding traits that went into making Rushmore the insurpassable work of art that it is. I have seen drama movies in the past dealing with the issue of a family that had cast out there father. And just as in TRT that father would come back and decide he needed to be forgiven. The characters themselves were one-dimensional and under-developed not to mention the fact that I was already sick of the whole sibling rivalry thing in dramas to begin with. I am compelled to ask the question: Where did the idea to make such a bland and uninspiring drama come from? Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson must have forgotten that a well-written screenplay is essential to a film's artistic clout and over-all worth. This development, however, is not surprising when I remind myself that Wilson was starring in "Behind Enemy Lines" at the time this was being made. How conventional does it get . . . I mean really? Rushmore was original, inspiring, lovable, and had incredibly fresh characters. The Royal Tenenbaums was a salt-free cracker in comparison. I am sad. No I am distraught and angry that I spent hard-earned money to watch such a thorough let down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contrived and stupid... besides the occasional laugh I couldn't wait for it to end. And what a shame, it had a great cast. It was overtly weird but not believeable. Finally, the movie was put together like a patchwork, and though that was consistent with the personalities of many of the characters, it just didn't mesh well. A severe disappointment. Go see Zoolander instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An embarrassment for everyone involved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ugh! The Royal Tenenbaums can be blamed on one of two reasons. You know, I think Rushmore is a fine film, but it was far overpraised. Because of its outrageous success, Wes Anderson was probably so sure of himself that he didn't even bother to do any rewrites on his new film, of which it needs at least a dozen and a half. It's either that or that Anderson and Owen Wilson lost all their writing abilities before they went on to pen this screenplay. The Royal Tenenbaums feels like writing that was crapped out when its authors had severe writers' block. Or, a third alternative, Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson may just have been coked out of their gourds when they were writing this.I don't know how anybody could find this film clever at all. It's quirkiness for quirkiness' sake, and nothing more. The scenes arise and end randomly, nothing at all connects. The characters are all caricatures, dressing in the same outfits as if they were in a cartoon (which was meant, but God knows why). There are a few laughs, but 90% of the jokes fall flat. All of the actors are flat and emotionless, except for Ben Stiller, who overplays his role. I imagine that everyone wanted to work with the writer/director of Rushmore, but I can't believe anyone would have signed on if they had read the script.The Royal Tenenbaums is one of the worst films of 2001, and has possibly the sloppiest script ever written. An Oscar nominated script, I must add. I think the cinema has gotten stronger in the last few years, after a slump in the late 80s through the mid-90s, but this film demonstrates what is worst about the cinema right now, especially independent cinema. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prospect of classy cast fails to live up to early promise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of the film, Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) is living in a hotel and we learn that none of his three children want anything to do with him. All of the Tenenbaum children were child geniuses in one way or another: Chas (Ben Stiller) was a one-time financial whiz and is now a single parent bringing up his two sons; the adopted Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow wearing way too much mascara and eyeliner) was a promising playwright and is now married but chooses to spend most of her time locked away in a bathroom secretly smoking; and Richie (Luke Wilson), was a former tennis ace who due to an infatuation with his adopted sister, suddenly lost a crucial match and saw his career plummet. When Royal announces that he only has six weeks left to live, it brings together all members of the family under one roof for the first time in years. I was looking forward to the prospect of seeing this film as I had enjoyed at least one of the films which each of the cast members had been in. There are actually very few funny moments in ?The Royal Tenenbaums' but the characters are amusing in their eccentricity. Although one suspects that Richie has not played tennis since his career took a nose-dive, he still chooses to mooch around wearing a headband like John McEnroe in his younger days. Chas and his two boys are also memorable purely because of the fact that their wardrobe throughout the film consists solely of matching red Adidas tracksuits.The film is immediately engaging as the story is told by a narrator and unfolds like chapters of a book. This technique is very effective in quickly introducing the audience to the characters and their situation. However the downfall of the film is that it is a little slow. I prefer my comedies to have more laughs than this and I found myself shifting in my seat halfway through the film wondering how many more chapters there were until the end. Unfortunately, like the child geniuses of the film, ?The Royal Tenenbaums' fails to live up to its early promise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oops! I did it again. I really must stop listening to the professional critics. They liked "Bandits"; I didn't. They liked this film too; I didn't."Every picture tells a story". In that case every film must tell a million stories. Not this one though. There *were* several good stories lurking there somewhere, just begging to be brought out ("neglectful father regrets his children's upbringing and decides late in life to make amends with them and their own children"; "long-suffering mother sees early-flowering offspring apparently fail to live up to early promise but in the end finds that strong family bonds are more important than individual success"; "mutually wary children grow apart but finally find that their common flawed upbringing draws them together again despite disparate lifestyles and attitudes") but the film couldn't make its mind up which one to plump for, so in the end, as with the philosopher's donkey, indecision won the day. Shame. A waste of good talent too: Anjelica Huston and Gene Hackman coasted along as the long-separated parents while Gwyneth Paltrow seemed to have had most of her lines cut; Bill Murray did a fair impression of a neglected sheepdog; at least Ben Stiller tried to inject some energy, but I got the impression that the director kept having to tell him to tone it down as he was making the others look permanently spaced out (ironically, one of the other characters *was* permanently spaced out but didn't share many scenes with Stiller).To quote from the film itself, "Why did you do this? What was the point?"4/10, purely because of a generous helping of very funny one-liners.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading lots of good reviews, seeing the posters with the hillarious-looking cast I expected a lot of this movie. I was very disappointed.Let's face it: 1) The people are odd and wacky and weird. 2) They are crazy 3) Crazy stuff happensAnd yet, on its own, all of this isn't funny. The story about a rather horrible father who returns to his family after 17 years because he is broke, and because he wants to prevent his still-legally-married wife from divorcing and marrying another is not typical comedy-fare. The cinema was still and quiet throughout, with just the odd chuckle every 20 minutes or so. The movie feels more like a quirky tragicomedy, but it is too removed from reality for the drama to affect the audience, and too serious to be funny. Honestly, who wants a quirky comedy about incest and rejection and traumatized people? And the fact that half the family once were prodigies and geniuses does nothing for the movie. It's simply an excuse to dress them as geeks - they never do anything clever or wacky. All of this is occassionally interrupted by a narrator, which distorts the flow of the movie even further, and in one or two places the narrator is simply used to tell people what feelings the actors are trying to express on their faces, with their expressions. Especially in one place, it's as if they were unhappy with Gene Hackman's performance and wanted to make the point so that everyone gets it.All in all, a complete disappointment, if it weren't for the soundtrack (which helps setting the mood immeasurably), the looks and costumes, and the washed out brown colours that the movie is shot in. If you liked Rushmore, you'll probably like this too. Otherwise, avoid.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Royal Tenenbaums is a strange, different movie and it certainly delivers what the movie is meant to be about. I'm sure fans of Wes Anderson will not be disappointed. The movie features good performances from the good cast involved, including Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gene Hackman, Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson. The story to the movie is of course about the Tenenbaum family who are all basically a family of geniuses. As the family get older they begin to drift apart even more then they were before, but when Royal, the father of the family announces that he's dying, the family all meet up again. The Royal Tenenbaums is of course a comedy, but it sure does have it's drama in it and even though I wouldn't say it was the most brilliant movie around as it's not really 'my type of movie,' it is recommended for those who want to see a different comedy as it will and does have it fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but OVERRATED film about a bunch of misfits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, one of the more overrated films of the year, although that does not mean it wasn't good. It was. I just object to the glowing praise some have heaped on this off-beat, eccentric, rather black comedy.True, Gene Hackman did a remarkably fine job. He usually does. But his role does not, in its length, rise to the level of a Best Actor nomination, and he didn't receive one. He, as Royal Tenenbaum, is the miscreant paterfamilias of his dysfunctional family; some of his relations have not seen him for many years - and they were quite pleased to have separated themselves from his despised presence.Royal, down and out, attempts via another ruse to ingratiate himself back into the good graces of the family - a scheme that eventually also fails. But, eventually, he reaches some resolution with his oddball relations, before his final demise.A "comedy"?? I found some scenes cute and clever, and several I even smiled at. But neither I, nor anyone in the theater, laughed out loud. Generally, the ensemble cast that comprised his family were too freakish, self-indulgent, and unpleasant to be amusing. A very well put together movie, and I'm sure it will suit the tastes of some. But not me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This biting satire of a dysfunctional family shows offers several surprises: Gene Hackman's deftness at comedy, an amazingly deep performance by Ben Stiller, and the format (like a play or a storybook, with voice-over narration by Alec Baldwin) is one you won't see in every film! The cast is strong, except I feel Gwyneth Paltrow's character was the least developed at all. And I also felt the last half hour didn't totally fit in with the rest of the movie. Gene Hackman was hysterical, and totally deserved the Golden Globe he won. The only parts of the film that made me truly cringe were the "romance" of adopted siblings Paltrow and Luke Wilson (gave me the heebee jeebies) and the lesbian scenes involving Paltrow. Other than that, I found it a darkly funny satire, but not a film everyone will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie last night expecting great things. I liked Rushmore and found it entertaining, and I was looking forward to this movie about a quirky family, with such a great cast. First observation, maybe not the most important, this movie was filmed in New York. I'm from NY originally, and I couldn't believe it, they actually made it look like Toronto. Why pick a location like New York and then not capitalize on it? Second, the story was all over the place, none of the characters was developed emotionally, they were all empty caricatures, as far as I'm concerned. Those matching track suits and Gwyneth Paltrow's canoe-paddled eyeliner became leitmotifs for ideas that were never developed. Sorry, this one didn't resonate with me at all; I think that Hackman has loads of performances that he should have, could have been nominated for Oscars, but this isn't one of them. Feh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can definitely appreciate Wes Anderson's artistry and skill with costumes and set design and character quirks, especially if you haven't seen Rushmore previously, but he makes some serious mistakes in the script and compounds it with the way it was casted and the characters were portrayed.In short: if this is a drama, it is very shallow, if it is a comedy it doesn't generate many laughs because 7 of the 8 main characters are depressed or repressed, some quite severely. The only character with consistent energy on screen is Royal (Gene Hackman), perhaps that is why he has received some award nominations.I think that the characters were played with some degree of truth and everyone gave a good performance, but the writer and director have to take the ultimate blame for this - when 7 out of the 8 characters are flat, unemotional, listless, suicidal, uncommunicative and/or cold the whole thing starts to draaaaaaaaaaag out.I really enjoyed Rushmore and appreciated Bottlerocket, so I was pulling for this film big time, but if you've seen Wes' flair before then you don't have much left to enjoy here. Just some poor fundamental choices.It almost felt like an experiment - can we pull off a comedy about this many flat characters? unfortunately the answer is no.On one final note, I never thought I would think this, but I do dearly hope that Wes doesn't become another Guy Richie, who is so talented in editing and style that he doesn't seem to bother with character and story. Yes, seeing Rushmore affected how I viewed this film, of course, when you have seen so much come together it is harder to appreciate the few things that work in Royal Tennenbaums.By the way, did that "Wes Anderson's Masterpiece!!!!!" review strike anyone else as a poor studio schmuck trying to hype this for oscars or something..jeez, why not just sign it Rex Reed. :-) And I mean that seriously, I know that some studio starting trying to hype films on Yahoo's message boards by posting fake reviews by studio hacks, a sad sight indeed.</fullReview>

Not wanting to spoil anything for anyone, but watch for the pictures in "Eli Cash's" apartment. They are worth the price of admission alone.This is not a "slap you in the face" funny, it is extremely witty, and it is often the very small things, such as the paintings in Eli's apartment, which are the best.

The film is artistically worth savoring, in terms of the shot compositions, the framing (geez does Anderson have a penchant for putting mise en scene right square in the middle), and the use of the sixties music, but you need a little something extra called PLOT and character development to make a good film. Royal Tenenbaums tries really hard to be offbeat, and the audience that laughed wickedly through the first half hour, I think, was like NJ WritnGuy's audience finding itself dead quiet later on because they realized that was all he was going to be. Anderson relied on overkill, and he seemed to think that pauses and dry delivery would make for drama. Actually, this sounds a lot like how I reviewed that version of HAMLET that came out in 2000- a wonderful visual experience by a director who has yet to master how to work with his actors. Still worth seeing though, if only to find your own opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Royal Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Royal Tenenbaums" is the type of dramedy that looks really appealing in the previews, and the hype about it is top-notch, and the big name cast/crew is enticing enough to make you go see it. I assume that's the trick. Because once you see the movie, you see how the previews either showed all the funny scenes or skewered them to seem funnier (in this case, both), and the hype is just that--hype, and cast and crew end up being wasted by a weak storyline and not much material to work with.It all starts well enough, as we get to know this strange family of Tenenbaums in a nameless city, with the heartless and thoughtless father, the oblivious and obsessive mother, and their three genius children, Chas, Margot, and Richie. They all grow up physically, but not mentally, at least in Royal's case, as he claims to be terminally ill to his now estranged wife and even more estranged children. He returns to live with Etheline, only after being kicked out of the hotel suite he was living in, and the children, now depressing, aged shells of their once capable minds, come home to be with him. Throw in Etheline's new love interest, Henry, the wannabe Tenenbaum, Eli, Margot's neurologist husband Raleigh, Chas's soon-to-be carbon copy sons Ari and Uzi, and a show-stealing Indian servant named Pagoda who seems to be the only one willing to stick by Royal's side (even though he's just as willing to stab him in the back...literally), and you get a story that doesn't really manage to go much further from there.The movie quickly side-steps the guise by which it is marketed (this pseudo-"Golden Pond" reunion of a family), and the sad excuse for a plot falls apart. We find out what really goes on, and are left to wonder, "Wow, is that all?" But no, then the story pointlessly plods around for a while to, I suppose, a climax that is supposed to change everything and conclude it all, but only seems to mess things up even more, those these people don't seem to pick up on it.Watching "Tenenbaums", you pretty much sit there waiting to laugh yourself to tears. You walk in the theatre expecting that. But it never really happens, and more often than not, you find yourself feigning a laugh just so the one other person in the theatre who liked a certain joke won't feel so lonely, and you can pretend you got it. I was almost, strangely enough, embarrassed during the moments of dead silence when there should have been people rolling in the aisles. I thought, "Jeez, this is really sad. Nobody finds that funny--not even me?" And the moments that did evoke a laugh were not shared by all, so it was but a sporadic giggling here and there.The drama side of the movie is more dark comedy. There's a strange subplot of incest that really isn't, legally, but is still much too uncomfortable, and the early-on tensions between Royal and Henry, and of course, the issue of Royal's illness, and his children having to face the man who was never much of a father to them, are all dealt with as light-heartedly as possible, as one would expect. But they never come across as funny. Not that Wes Anderson (director/co-writer) should have felt any inclination to make this a very serious movie, but hell, the comedy never comes through, why not try another approach?The one thing the movie does have going for it is the sometimes great but sometimes dreary music, and a few performances. Gene Hackman as Royal is the only saving grace, because he's just a terrific actor, and given the only good role in the movie, he does a lot with it, and he's great. I would expect at least an Oscar nomination. Maybe not a win, but at least a nomination. He was worthy of the Golden Globe win. Angelica Huston is decent as Etheline; she isn't given much of a part, and only gets really one good scene, with Royal as they go for a walk in the park, and only then is she able to really get a chance to be good. Other than that, she only has a few good lines, though I blame the script more than I blame her, because she's a very capable actress. Ben Stiller is another highlight of the movie as the over-acheiver Chas, and his typical right-on Ben Stiller delivery of good lines is here. He comes away with his dignity, and I thought he did well. Luke Wilson, on the other hand, as Richie, isn't particularly memorable, and is more depressing than anything else. Gwenyth Paltrow is good as Margot, barely cracking a smile and never particularly enthused about anything. But like the character of Etheline, she isn't given enough good scenes or good lines. Paltrow has a lot of talent, and the role should have been good for her, but once again, I more blame the script for the hand she's dealt. Owen Wilson as the pointless character of Eli is actually quite annoying, probably more so than anything because he helped write this damn movie, so maybe I more don't like Wilson as a writer, but his performance is only mediocre. Danny Glover isn't given enough to do as Henry, but he comes through with a good performance, and the scene where he falls in the hole is one of the only really funny scenes in the movie, and much needed after probably a half-hour of no laughs at all. The saddest case of all is the treatment of Bill Murray in the throw-away role of Raleigh St. Claire. Murray, in my opinion, has probably one of the best comedic deliveries of most actors of his time. He's always great and he's always a riot...except here. His role is small and pointless, but he seems to keep popping up for no other reason except, I suppose, to pad the movie out. He's never given a good "Bill Murray line." He's never given a chance to use the dry wit he often uses so well. I, of course, once again, blame the script, but I think anyone else could have done this role, and not have given so wasted a performance. Kumar Pallana is great as Pagoda, and was the source of some of the only comedy in the movie, in a "Simpsons"-style "laughing at the minority" sort of way. He was much needed. Alec Baldwin narrates; I thought it was Gene Hackman the entire time."The Royal Tenenbaums" lacks any real plot, and there are only a handful of good scenes. I liked when Henry fell in the hole, I thought the scenes between Royal and Etheline in the park were charming there was a lot of chemistry between them there, I loved the stabbing scene, I thought that was maybe the funniest scene in the movie next to the hole scene, and I liked the much-too-quick dinner scene between the Tenenbaums. It could have been longer. Actually, there were a lot of scenes not milked for their potential. What also comes to mind is when Royal takes Margot out for ice cream. That could have been a great scene, but the only highlight of it you'll probably see in the preview, and it's not that funny in the movie.The movie has profanity (along with a lot of pointless, inconsequential dialogue, which I suppose should be an equal warning), drug use, and unnecessary nudity which seemed to only be there for the sake of nudity, and to beef up a very short flashback scene of Margot having a lesbian encounter (believe me, it sounds more enticing than it is). The plot bobs and weaves throughout the entire running time, and the actors seem to do the same with their parts. Skip this mess.</fullReview>

After that, it's a long slog through a cast of eccentric characters who "act funny", say "funny" things, and are placed in "funny" situations. Unfortunately, it's just bizarre for bizarre's sake. Wes Anderson is in danger of become a self-parody with situations and characterizations so "Wes Anderson-like" that they exist only in his films' world, with little or no connection to anything or anybody else (except for his cadre of self-appointed hipsters who "get" the humor. I "get" the humor, I just don't find there to be any "there" there).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** If you are considering watching "The Royal Tenenbaums" here is my advice: Go to a multiplex where they are showing another movie in which you are interested, starting about twenty minutes after "The Royal Tenenbaums". Watch "The Royal Tenenbaums" until the scene where Royal (played by Gene Hackman) explains to his estranged wife why he wants to come back into her life and the lives of their pathetic children. This was truly the *only* even remotely humorous scene in the movie. After that scene, get up and go watch the other movie or, if you feel that is unethical, stay, as I did, and be "treated" to one of the most insipid, self-indulgent films, ever! When I saw that the movie had been written, produced *and* directed by the same person, I wasn't surprised. This movie sorely needed some checks and balances. The whole thing is very heavy-handed. The jokes are so painfully obvious and trite that you will ask yourself repeatedly, "Is this really supposed to be funny?" Even the camera angles are tiresome, the dialog is dull, most of the acting is downright bludgeoning. Only the Danny Glover character could elicit *any* empathy and his is sadly a relatively small role. The rest of the characters are never fleshed out and certainly not people with whom you want to spend your time. I found that I just didn't care at what happened to them. In fact, they were so unmemorable that at the end of the movie I couldn't even summon the energy to try to recall their names. If you cannot leave the theater before total boredom sinks in, I highly recommend sleeping through most of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller and Gweneth Paltrow's acting in this movie should get them pelted with rotten eggs. They are unattractive characters -- nothing wrong with that -- but also made to be monumentally boring. Paltrow never seems to wake up and Stiller is entirely too awake. The whole movie consists of characters talking slowly with lots of pauses so the patrons can munch their popcorn. Timing is everthing in comedy, so they say, but this one seems to have been timed with a calendar. Gene Hackman is pretty good, as are his elevator operator buddies, but the Tenenbaums -- including mama Anjelica Houston, who I have always liked -- are zombies. In fact, that would be a good title for this movie: "Zombie Jamboree."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The appeal is mostly in the setup, not in the delivery. It handles itself most professionally, fully competent in its breezy absurdity and farce, its offbeat low-key gags (Hackman is particularly good with this), it's detached black humor (not too unlike Amelie, non?). But once all the amusingly quirky characters and their unconventional histories have been explained, once we're ready for some real-time action in the present, i.e., once the table has been set and we're ready for the main meal, the movie lets down, devolves to predictable, arbitrary plot and action. All in all, it's a harmless enough entertainment, not much more.Ps. I found the way a song would start cold on the soundtrack in the middle of a silent shot to be annoying/intrusive after awhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually write reviews, but the fact that several people decided to review this movie with one star propelled me to do so. The Royal Tenenbaums is by far one of, if not, my favorite, movies of all time. There is comedy, sorrow, happiness, and beauty perfectly placed throughout the story. Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson were obviously inspired when writing this story, and it shows. I think everybody knows this kind of family, and if they do, they can probably relate to Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) in some way or another. I don't mean to perpetuate cliché, but this is one of those movies that makes you laugh, and makes you cry... sometimes at the same time. There is a sentence engraved into the very end of the movie which perfectly wraps up the movie itself, and if it doesn't make you both laugh and cry at the same time, then you don't have a heart.I've noticed that many of the bashers are from the U.K. using words like "rubbish" to describe this movie. Maybe there is a cultural barrier at play here, but I think a better explanation for those who've given this movie a bad review would be some sort of psychological problems... anti- social personality disorder comes to mind. So I implore you, watch this movie. I guarantee you that within a week of watching it for the first time you will own it, you will have seen it 4 times, you'll have the poster, a clipping of Wes Anderson's hair off of Ebay, and will be posting a review as I am now, praising the work of everyone who worked on this project. Thank you Owen and Wes for making one of the greatest movies of all time.Brian</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen a few of Wes Anderson's films, and sort of enjoying them, I thought I should try this one. I'm glad I did, it's my favourite of his films.The quirkiness of the characters in this film seemed to have more purpose (for lack of a better word), somehow, than in the other ones I've seen. The selfish patriarch, the house, the passing of time, all contributed to a framework within which the failures and misadventures of the characters felt more connected. And more beautiful, poignant, even. I think in the other films I got a more disconnected, existential feel, which partially drained the humour out for me and made me a bit irritated... but still very much fascinated by this director's distinctive vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can so many people hate this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Described elsewhere as a 'quirky dark comedy', the director evidently forgot that quirky and dark do not on their own produce comedic elements. It is definitely quirky, but the 'quirkiness' feels forced, as though Anderson felt that to make up for tedious and virtually non-existent storyline he would have to inject another element into the film."- dwblurbWhat is this guy talking about? Non existent storyline? A bad father trying to make up for all his mistakes. That's one storyline. One son dealing with a tragedy, another son dealing with depression, a daughter not sure of who she is or who she loves, this is a true family comedy that deals with almost each family member and their struggles to forget the past. Some call it dark and some call it quirky and it's a little of both. I'd say that the story line makes this dark, not necessarily the humor of the movie. This movie is a film that is very serious while being funny at the same time, and give credit to Wes Anderson, who I greatly respect as a writer and director, along with Owen Wilson, these two really put together a great script which leads to a great movie.Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) falls in love with Etheline (Anjelica Huston) and decides to marry her. Then they have 3 children: Chas Tenenbaum, Margot Tenenbaum who was adopted (her father would always mention this), and Richie Tenenbaum. After Royal and Etheline divorced, Etheline raised the kids to be child geniuses. Chas specializing in business, Margot a famous playwright, and Richie a famous athlete. Royal did not spend much time with the kids, with the exception of Richie who he would favor over everyone else. Royal to say the least, was not a good father. One of my favorite lines from the movie, Royal just watched his daughters first ever play. After the play is over, the kids sit with Royal and ask him what he thinks, Royal didn't think it was very good, Margot can't believe what he said. Richie asks if he thought the characters where well developed, and Royal dismisses that they were characters at all. Margot "I'm going to bed now" begins to walk away, Royal "Honey, it's just one man's opinion." Margot walks off. That's the kind of father Royal was, brutally honest and just seemed like he never gave a damn about them. 22 years go by, and the kids grow up, but none of them were they same. Richie (Luke Wilson) loses his ability to play tennis, Chas (Ben Stiller) lost his wife in an accident, and Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), who has not written a play for many years, is clearly unhappy with her husband Raleigh St. Claire (Bill Murray). Royal learns that he is about to die, and realizes that the only people he actually loves absolutely hate him. So he decides to take on the task of reconnecting with his family. You know what's cool about all this, there is still more elements and story lines to this movie. Eli (Owen Wilson) is probably my favorite character in the movie, and he is best friends with Richie (Luke Wilson) which leads me to point out that when the Wilson brothers are in the same movie, they are flippin (stupid profanity rule) hilarious.This movie was very well written, and in my opinion very well directed, but this is where I think a lot of people lose interest in the movie. Wes Anderson has a goofy, quirky style. That's really the only way to explain it, I mean, I could try to explain how all his shots are goofy, and how all his angles are unbelievably unique but boring and plain at the same time, but it's a lot to talk about. I think this is the best thing about Wes Anderson, he has his own style that no one can touch, but for some it's a turn off. Saying that...The performances of the actors are great, some performances might be dull as many have stated, but it fits the characters and the direction of the movie. A lot of these characters are not all there emotionally, so their reactions are not going to be as intense as other characters would be. Danny Glover's character (Henry Sherman) has a great deal of pride, so when he is insulted he takes it very seriously and stands up for himself and gets loud and brutish, yet Margot when she finds out some disturbing news, doesn't even look like she cares, but she does, and you know she does, but she refuses to show it. These characters are different and unique, and the performances, each one of them fits the characters perfectly. You should not skip this movie because of some really awful reviewers, in fact, this is a must at least try to watch movie. Don't listen to anybody who says that there is not a story line, cause they don't know what they are talking about. This movie is smart, this movie is serious, this movie is touching, and so much more could be said. Watch The Royal Tenenbaums.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After nearly a decade, I'm still fuming over this awful piece of crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why? Why would anyone watch this movie? Why would anyone WANT to?This movie is the most infuriating and insulting piece of crap that I have ever seen. Anyone who finds this movie funny means that I do not want to know them. This is a "dark comedy," something that while I admit is not my forte, I can enjoy (I liked "Very Bad Things"). And while I will be the first one to agree that ANYTHING can be funny given the right treatment, the way Wes Anderson presents this material makes his "comedy" not only unfunny, but cruel. So cruel, that it freely crosses the border into downright sadistic.The movie is about the Tenenbaum family: Royal (Gene Hackman), Etheline (Anjelica Huston), Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Richie (Luke Wilson). After Royal leaves, Etheline makes her children into prodigies of various sorts (Chas is an economist, Margot is a playwright, and Richie is a tennis pro--all before they hit puberty). Then Royal re-enters their lives, claiming that he has terminal cancer.The problem isn't with the story, or the acting. It's how Anderson treats his characters. All of them are deeply troubled characters, and are in dire need of psychiatric help. But Anderson has his actors play mentally ill individuals realistically, and it's pretty clear that he expects us to laugh. But how can we? In order to laugh at these characters, we have to be people who are so sociopathic that we would be convulsed with laughter on a tour of a real mental hospital.All the cast members are gifted actors in their own right (save for the Wilson brothers, especially Luke, who always seems to think of himself as Marlon Brando but doesn't realize that he has zero talent). Why would the appear here? Two reasons: they were offered giant paychecks, or they were so desperate to be able to play a character instead of mailing in a routine performance for the big studios that they were willing to appear in this godforsaken piece of crap. My guess is number two, since major studios would never spend money on something original. Then again, a number of the actors (Angelica Huston, the Wilson Brothers) have returned to act with Anderson again, so maybe I'm underestimating Anderson's appeal (the fact that he is allowed to keep making movies means SOMEBODY has to be watching them).I've been told that I "don't get" Anderson's films. If that's the case, I hope I never do. I'll admit that this is a well-made movie. But in his review of "Very Bad Things" (a dark comedy that I liked and he didn't), Roger Ebert said "This isn't a bad movie, just a reprehensible one." I could say the same thing about "The Royal Tenenbaums. But I wouldn't want to. It would make it seem like there's a silver lining to this movie (trust me, there isn't).For the love of all things holy, AVOID THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fits right into the current fashion of substituting posing and attitude for genuine humor and real emotion. Or maybe I'm just not cool enough to get the joke. To me, stylized doesn't automatically equal smart and deadpan doesn't automatically equal funny, unless you happen to be Buster Keaton. (Don't get me wrong, I love non-traditional approaches to storytelling, but only when they support the narrative thrust of a piece rather than simply calling attention to themselves, as is the case here.) The characters here feel like poorly fleshed-out types rather than real people, and the actors seem to have to fall back on physical gestures and mannerisms to try to breathe some life into or give some specificity to these shells. Anjelica Huston, of course, rises above the fray, as always, and gives a nuanced, beautiful and very real performance. But the other performers could have used an injection of good old-fashioned earnestness. Of course, I suspect that any attempts at portraying real people would have been squashed by Mr. Anderson, as his directorial style doesn't seem to leave any room for unstylized, honest-to-goodness affect. For an intelligent, heartfelt, off-beat, emotionally rich take on a dysfunctional family, try "Late Marriage," the little Israeli film directed by Dover Koshashvili. It's soooooo much more interesting than this turd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Anderson is one of my favorite film makers today. He can truly capture the meaning of the human race and how we interact. He can show the beauty and also the evilness in humans. This movie I really enjoyed. The characters were well developed and the storyline i thought was heartwarming and also had a lot of depth behind it. I also like the fact that some of Wes Andersons movies are made to look sort of retro. For some reason, I like that style and it makes everything seem like the past which isn't a bad thing. To go along with this retro idea, all of Wes Andersons movies have very good music in them, primarily old, classic rock, or whatever it is, it fits. Anyways, I thought that Gene Hackmans character was funny and also charming in his attempt to essentially regain his family back again. I just love the part when Royal takes Ben Stillers two sons out to do some misbehaving fun. I kind of wanted to see the two sons actually get to do something a little exciting and mischievous for a change, and Paul Simons, "me and Julio down by the schoolyard," was a good song choice for that scene. I would recommend this movie for anyone who would like to see something particularly meaningful. You will leave the movie feeling like you've seen a work of art. I would also recommend Wes Andersons other movies. Rushmore, Bottle Rocket, and Life Aquatic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many fans out there can say they have a more dysfunctonal family than Royal Tenenbaum? You can raise your hands. Every family even the the geniuses are dysfunctional. I was impressed with the writing although I thought it was set in another decade. The car and wardrobe seem to indicate an earlier time period. I thought this was a New York City story but I think it happens in the Bronx. Maybe it is set there but it's not the Bronx that we as fans imagined it to be. The Bronx representation of this film is one where even elite intellectuals like the Tenenbuams can live and have pride in. Even though, the film never says New York City at all which is a great puzzler to me. I thought Gene Hackman gave an Oscar nominated worthy performance as the father of this dysfunctional family. Angelica Huston who I usually see as strong was shown as vulnerable in this role and yet strong as well as Etheline. I liked Ben Stiller who shows that yes he can act besides do comedy. I was surprised by Gwyneth Paltrow's performance as the depressing, private, closet smoker Margot. I don't understand why she is adopted by this family in the first place. They have two sons. Ben's character is afraid after his wife's death in a plane crash. Owen Wilson's character is the brother, a tennis player burnout. I don't know if Dudley is his son or that would make sense. I did like Danny Glover as the man who loved Etheline. It's nice to see interracial romances portrayed as normal as you can get with this film. By the end, you become sad for these characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: This entire review is basically a spoiler. If you saw this movie and hated it, then you lived an idyllic life and shouldn't have expressed an opinion on it anyway. The movie really requires a perspective to appreciate it. I don't mean that in a condescending way, but really, if you've never known dysfunction in your family, you probably won't like the movie. What i really liked about this movie was Wes Anderson's ability to fuse music with the action in the movie. When Richie attempts suicide and Elliott Smith plays (Needle in the Hay), or when Nico plays as Margot gets off of the bus early in the movie, the music puts a particularly poignant feeling into the audiences' minds. A lot of people say things about not getting the humor even in a subtle way... how could you miss it? Even the camera angles were humorous at times. For instance, when the camera focuses in on Henry Sherman's face after listing Etheline's previous suitors, or the stark perspective change when Raleigh moves the board from in front of Dudley's chin. And what's not funny about Gene Hackman getting stabbed with a pocket-knife? Some also complain of the writing being shoddy. Well, the movie transitions nicely, and the voice-overs done by Alec Baldwin fit in nicely as the plot goes along... And lastly, some denounce the movie as having no redeeming qualities or values. Come on, the entire movie builds up and up and up with the various plot-lines to the last scene, where Chaz finally starts to forgive his father, after Royal has finally come clean with himself and lets Etheline go... the entire message of the movie is one of redemption and forgiveness. It's pretty hard to miss. Anyway... I'm probably biased. Bill Murray is my hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought a copy of this film on VHS without having seen it. I watched it twice before I actually began to like it. This is an enjoyable film although it doesn't exactly jump out at you. You may not be sure at first if it is a comedy or drama and, to be honest, I'm not sure if I could classify it as either one. It is funny but in a quiet subtle way. All of the characters are quite odd, and the patriarch of the family, played almost perfectly by Gene Hackman, is a jerk, but not so much that he isn't likable. He loves his family but never seems to say or do the right thing. With a cast that also includes Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow and Bill Murray (palying a character it seems only Murray could play) this is a film that requires some patience on the part of the viewer but it's well worth it in my opinion. The DVD is a 2 disc set. The first disc is the film and the second contains extras including 2 trailers for the film, interviews with the major cast members and more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Bottle Rocket and Rushmore I wasn't quite sure what to expect in from the Royal Tennenbaum's. In my opinion Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson's collaboration has joined the list of "Director/Writer/Actor formula cult filmmakers" with the likes of Neil Simon, Billy Wilder, Woody Allen, Robert Altman and The Coen Brothers. The intentional settings, detailed dialog, character development, musical motifs and the unsubtle spot light on character flaws makes it enjoyable for anyone with a little patience and general observation. If you want to see an edgy comedy this is one of the better films of that type with its wide range of vision from holiday like images to city living insight. The Tennenbaum's are an estranged family told through documentary style format centering around there uniqueness and eccentricities. They are one film family that I will never forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To what consequence?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies stick in your mind because they are good. Some others because they are bad. Very few manage to persist because they are of no consequence, and yet are highly touted. The Royal Tenenbaums achieves this latter distinction very well.What I got out of it was a story that pretty much runs in any average household. Marriage, divorce, estranged kids, remarriage, angst, falling in love, falling out of love, etc.The blurb claims that the movie has an underlying theme of redemption - the divorced father trying to get back to his family, not so much for reasons of love, but rather for material gain (he is flat broke). His trying to wheedle back in with his wife and kids requires him to try his best to sabotage his ex-wife's relationship with her other prospective suitor. Eventually, he realizes that that won't cut it, because he's pretty much a cur deep down inside, just as he was when he got divorced the first time.Well, it doesn't really make for a movie, in my opinion. Maybe a chapter in someone's journal (which is kind of what the movie is based on, BTW). There are a few kinks thrown in, such as hints of incest (if step-siblings can be considered candidates for incest), an interracial relationship, promiscuity, drug addiction, an Indian manservant, etc. Unfortunately, none of these seem to blend in with much conviction or harmony, and simply come across as tedium-relieving contraptions, and don't really mean much otherwise.I've read other reviews that this is a "dark comedy". I've pondered it, but to me, it was neither dark nor comedic. All said and done, I'm kind of bewildered why Criterion backed this one. This simply does not contain enough artistic originality to make the cut, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just could not get into this movie. I didn't find it the least bit entertaining and of the 3 times I have tried to watch it, I still have not made it through the whole lot. The cast line up is impressive, however the film fails to deliver the goods. If I would have paid money to see this film, I would have been very annoyed. This is one of THE WORST movies I have ever tried to sit through. It is a constant bore, with nothing at all to keep the viewer from falling asleep. I know all the intellects out there will think this film is a masterpiece, but for those of us who see movies as a form of escapism and not something that you have to constantly concentrate on whilst watching, this film is a load of garbage. 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not that I thought it was all bad... Even as I strenuously fought my desire to fall asleep, I was able to detect a subtle genius in the movie (often times, too subtle). It has a great cast, to be sure. And if the writers/director were trying to achieve making this a reasonably believable story about a bizarre family, then the actors pulled off their parts perfectly.Other kudos: Good attention to detail/continuity, good cinematography, good music. But otherwise, slowwwwwww....I felt the entire movie was spent developing the characters and setting the stage for the "real" story, then POOF, it was over (thankfully). It definitely required a "Train Wreck" mentality to stick it through to the end (ya don't want to look, but you just have to).While this was no "Leonard, Part 6", it certainly was no "Ishtar". Though beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I'd have to caution against renting it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Rushmore again instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pumped up for the Royal Tenenbaums-- it has a great cast-- but none of the cast who are usually funny are funny in this film. Being a huge Bill Murray fan, I thought he'd have at least a few jokes or pokes fun at his character... guess what: he had none. Ben Stiller a dramatic actor? Not exactly... more of an extra-- just as much of this cast was.This film tried TOO hard to be another Rushmore, which is SO was not. I began looking at my watch 29 minutes into the film... the last movie I did that with was Summer of Sam (which was much earlier).I was really disappointed because I thought this movie would be right up my alley-- I thought it'd be another Rushmore or Big Lebowski or Election-- along that line of humor, but I was quite wrong. I laughed exactly ONCE and that was about 10 minutes into the movie, before they tried so hard to be ridiculous to get laughs.Watch Rushmore again and hope for more films like that; if you waste your time watching this one, it'll do nothing more than anger you how much they TRIED to NOT TRY to be a stereotypical comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was definitely the worst film I have ever seen. We were with a group of people so we thought to go see a comedy to keep everybody happy. Well, this was not the right film to choose! The whole film was awfully slow and there was an excess of shots without meaning. The story began very slowly, was totally unbelievable to be realistic and too boring to be a comedy. The last ten minutes of the film were the least boring as suddenly it appeared there was some normal sense in the characters. Unfortunately, even that was absolutely not enough to make up for the preceding one-and-a-half hours.I think even Britney Spears in her Crossroads would have been more interesting. Many people walked out during the film, it was only that we had to pass some ten people in order to leave that we stayed and hoped the film would get better. So not! Go see this film, the easiest way to waste your money!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a major difference between American humour and British humour. This film has a very high star rating, but to me was a complete waste of time. There is a collection of half-amusing/half-stupid events (as seen through the eyes of a Brit!), much in the style of Woody Allen or maybe Steve Martin, but without the ingenuity, charisma, depth of characters, storyline, start or end. A real shame, given the calibre of the cast. All of the characters were flat and depressing. How can it possibly deserve 8/10? I've been robbed!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing royal about this family...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've started to write this review at least 4 times, and I can't find the right words to describe the terrible experience I had watching this film. The story is supposed to be about a family of geniuses who get together when they find out that the father is dying. And that's it, there is nothing more to the movie than this.The characters are not well-defined: The father who walked away from the family and everybody hates (except for one of the sons). The mother who raised the children but gets no appreciation from them. The oldest son who was a tennis pro and 'dropped out' for love, and who is the only one that has some respect for the father. The adopted girl who is a chain smoker, is always depressed, and does not appreciate anybody, including her husband and his son(?). The youngest son who doesn't care for the father and has his children dressed like him and crunching numbers for him. The family friend, who is a drug addict. And the mother's boyfriend.That's it for the characters, who never develop (and when only one of them does, you can't understand why), and that's it for the plot. Nothing really happens throughout the movie, up until the last 3 minutes of it. It's not a drama, it's not a comedy, I can't define the genre.It's been a long time since I've seen people walking out of the theater during the movie, and I just saw that yesterday. I spent the whole movie waiting for something to happen, waiting to see if it gets better, and when something finally happened with the story, I saw the ending credits.It's not worth it, not even for the performances. When studios put together a cast of 7 big names in one movie, it's either a great movie or the worst thing available. I'd rather watch 'American Pie 2', at least that one was sort of entertaining.</fullReview>

The trailers for this film are dramatically misleading (as I'm sure the producers realized what a piece of crap they had on their hands).. Anderson's film tries hard to be different, dark, imaginative or whatever, but it simply sucks. A comedy? Maybe for a depressed serial murderer, not for most people that were in the theater with us that night. This is one of those films that a portion of people are going to exclaim "A Masterpiece!" because they don't want to feel left out of the invisible "Cool" circle of underground filmgoers that are heads above the rest of us that "don't get it". Well I got news for you: there is nothing to get but a poorly written and directed script that is nothing short of dismal. After the premier in NY, members of the cast were riddled with questions from the media; "Why did you agree to do this film?" Clearly some of the stars didn't know how to answer, and it's my opinion this will be the first and last star-studded vehicle Mr. Anderson will ever direct again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the worst films i have ever seen!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Putting aside Wes Anderson's pretentious and irritating personality for a moment in an attempt to consider this film from an un-biased point of view, I would still have to say that it was one of the worst films i have ever seen. Every merit you would use as criteria to evaluate a film completely falls through the toilet in this third feature of Anderson's. The camera direction is awful with countless sweeping blurry pans that stink to imply that he was too lazy to edit two separate shots. It is nauseating to watch this film through the p.o.v. of a thirteen year old with a camcorder for two hours while still trying to figure out exactly what the film was about. The general plot is of a father(Gene Hackman) who stages an act that he is dying in an attempt to reconcile with his three sevant children and ex-wife (Angelica Houston). The problem here is that in two hours NOTHING REALLY HAPPENS! The acting in general is decent in light of the films gratuitous shadow of bad taste comedy and dis-jointed rhythm, although Gene Hackman especially offers a rewarding performance. This film is obvious and simply just not funny. it resounds a dry inane humor that is stale and just plain corny. The most frustrating thing within the entire piece is the reoccuring use of beatles songs to distract and amuse the audience from the feature in a meek attempt to shadow the obvious short-comings of this film. Although I greatly enjoyed Rushmore, and give credit to Bottle Rocket. I would strongly suggest against The Royal Tenenbaums, take your eight bucks and go drink it across the street. You'll still walk away feeling more productive than if you sat through this absolutely rank film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It scares me that so many people think this is not only a funny movie, but a satisfying drama. I enjoyed Rushmore somewhat, but I far from creamed over it. Since I heard nothing but raves about this movie, I was excited to see it. It also contains some of our finest actors and comedians. But my view is that a great soundtrack, great actors, beautiful cinematography and whatnot does not a great film make. It is a far cry from this movie to, say, Harold and Maude. If anyone wants to see a great ensemble movie that fleshes our characters fully and is funny and has great drama, filmwork, etc. try Hannah and her Sisters or MASH or Fast Times at Ridgemont High, to use a scant couple examples. I'm not saying we don't have a talented filmmaker here, it's just that it's obvious he comes up with the music first, story second. If I wanted a video I'd watch MTV. Dramas can be humorous and comedies can be deep and dark, it's been done a thousand times or more in the past. But I am thoroughly convinced that a generation (or older) of moviegoers brought up on fast edits, commercial breaks and films with soundtracks that play like someone's "real cool" mix tape doesn't understand or crave the real thing. It entertained me slightly, so does a game show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Anderson Deadpan Light Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me say that I like realism in most of my films, be they comedy, straight drama, thrillers, or horror films. I especially dislike when a director calls attention to himself so that you are immediately aware of the style involved and can identify who he is. This is the problem I have with Wes Anderson. This was the third of his films I have seen, after Rushmore and Moonrise Kingdom, and I don't like any of them. Yes, the sets are detailed and beautiful, the colors are bright, and the plots are complex. But in all his films, everyone is almost always deadpan, the comedy is light and occasionally amusing, and everyone seems depressed and rather one dimensional. This film reminded me more of an extended version of an old Carol Burnett skit where she and the cast satirized a soap opera. The cast is first rate, but only Gene Hackman displays a wide range of emotions and seems real. I admit I did laugh a few times, and was sufficiently interested in the story to see how it turned out, and that's why I gave it a generous 4. I realize that most people and critics absolutely love Wes Anderson's style and films, and if you do, my review will not impress you. I also dislike Tarantino films for the most part. So if you hate quirky like I do, you probably won't like this film or any other Wes Anderson Film either. Since there are hundreds of reviews already, I won't review the story itself. One thing I noticed was that almost no one smiled once in the entire hour and 45 minutes. Totally joyless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do love this sort of film, and The Royal Tenembaums is for me a masterpiece and one of the best of its genre. Not only is it filmed absolutely beautifully with striking photography and scenery, but it has very well-defined characters, adroit direction and an engaging story.It was the script and acting though that elevated The Royal Tenenbaums. It has been a long time where I have heard a script this good, with a ideal balance of comedy and drama. When it comes to the acting, Gene Hackman and Anjelica Huston, who I both love, are brilliant, and Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Stiller perhaps give the best work they have done.In conclusion, just a wonderful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say about a comedy that's not funny? There's just nothing particularly interesting about the entire movie. The highly untalented Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are playing their usual characters, in their usual way. Gweneth Paltrow and Luke Wilson are of no particular interest. Even Bill Murray is a stiff. He looks like Robert Fulghum, but isn't nearly as interesting.It has the appearance of being an adapted novel. Lots of scenes that don't really make any sense and aren't necessary to drive the plot. Seems that they just needed to be thrown in somewhere.And some unnecessary nudity just tossed in for no particular reason, except perhaps that the director wanted to look at some nekkid chicks.I call it a three, but writing about it makes that seem generous. It's not in "Manos, The Hands of Fate" class (which actually would have been more entertaining), but it certainly was a waste of two hours and NetFlix pick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A soulless, dismal wreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Were Wes Anderson and the Wilson brothers forever banned from conceiving another "comedy", it could not happen soon enough. Patriarch Royal Tenenbaum is a selfish, egotistical character. He has been estranged from his wife and children for years and upon learning that he will be kicked out of his luxurious digs, he decides to fake a fatal disease in an effort to move back into the family home and cause assorted consternation to his family. The comedy is supposed to come from the clash between Royal's brutishness and the myriad of dysfunctions of his offspring. We are supposed to be falsely wooed into believing the film is quirky and intelligent because we are told that the three Tenenbaum children were child geniuses who peaked too early and then withered under Royal's influence. One must credit Gene Hackman for throwing himself into the central role, but despite all of his best efforts Royal is still a one-dimensional, loathsome bastard. The film proceeds at a deadly pace as though it were too-cool-for-the-room by giving its characters ludicrous illogical flourishes that have little tie to the flimsy plot. There are maybe two minor titters in the set-up, but then nary a laugh for the remainder of the interminable running time. Talented actors are either wasted or fasten in on one character trait and allow that to contribute their performance. Gwyneth Paltrow, with Goth raccoon make-up tattooed to her face, is utterly joyless as the Tenenbaums miserable adopted daughter, and she is equaled by the colorless performance contributed by Luke Wilson as a failed tennis pro brother who pines for her. Anjelica Huston, one of our best over-50 actresses, is reduced to the thankless task of clucking disapprovingly and ineffectually from the sidelines at Hackman's behavior. But she has it made compared to Ben Stiller, Bill Murray and Danny Glover, who literally are given nothing to work with. The less said about Owen Wilson, the better. He has written himself an obnoxious role as a nut-job intrusive family friend, whose ties to the central characters and events are tenuous at best, but he keeps showing up for extended periods of time ? like a drunken party guest that one cannot get rid of. Midway through this lighthearted comedy, there is a disgustingly bloody failed suicide sequence that seems to come out of no where. And just in case one still doubts its off-beat pedigree, Anderson periodically trots out stale montages of past events set to hip 60s era music or interjects coy narration from Alec Baldwin sounding like he is aping Sir Anthony Hopkins in The Grinch Who Stole Christmas. Yet all of the quirky flourishes in the world cannot disguise that the film is a tedious, unfunny dismal wreck populated by characters that could empty most rooms in seconds flat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Fod had already directed 75 movies (mostly silent) before his first well-known film Arrowsmith (1931). Robert Altman had been making films and working on television for two decades before MASH made him famous. Times have changed and the pressure to prove and sustain a successful image is far greater now. Imagine the pressure on a reasonably talented actor like Matthew McConaughey when a good performance in A Time to Kill suddenly has the whole world calling him the next Paul Newman. It must be terrible having to face and live up to those high expectations. The mental pressure must be a killer. Wes Anderson is one of the young wave of directors who was labeled a quirky genius after only two films in three years - Bottle Rocket and Rushmore. I've seen and liked Rushmore and its certainly possible that its director could become an Altman caliber director one day, a decade or two from now.The Royal Tenenbaums with its all star cast is Wes Anderson's third feature and its obvious he tries hard to sustain his image as maverick genius. The fact that he got a dream cast, at least three of them refusing to work in the more lucrative Ocean's Eleven, shows that many in Hollywood accept his image as valid. Royal Tenenbaums is certainly quirky and unusual, but is it good? Well, Gene Hackman is always a great actor to watch but Tenenbaums is not a complete film. The overall acting is quite poor. Anderson is no Altman when it comes to handling an ensemble cast, at least not yet! The storybook style is very pretentious as is the photography and set design. Actually, the set design was quite inventive and that may be a talent Anderson can explore further. The music selection made no sense either.Personally I think Royal Tenenbaums was a waste of time. Anderson needs far more experience and a few hard knocks. He may come out the better for it. But instantly hailing everything he does as a classic is not helping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wacky, whimsical and a bit alienating.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Royal Tenenbaums" is a well-made movie with a very strong cast, but I personally found it a bit alienating. I prefer Wes Anderson's "Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou" -- they're both equally pretentious, however "Life Aquatic" was funnier to me and also more appealing because its themes were better developed than "Tenenbaums," which deals with so many characters that it can become a bit muddled at times.I like both films, though. This one's advantage is that it came first and therefore the whimsical, wacky nature of the story was more original ("Rushmore" was weird too, but in a more traditional sense)."Royal Tenenbaums" stars Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum, an ex-millionaire who has been exiled by his family and lives alone in a fancy apartment downtown - until he loses all his cash and is kicked out onto the streets.Faced with nothing, he tells his family he is dying of stomach cancer in the hopes that they will accept him back into their lives.The family - Anjelica Huston, Luke Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Stiller - don't care one way or another, except for Stiller, a braniac whiz-kid who has grown up into a neurotic man. His wife has just died and he's alone with his two kids, wanting nothing to do with the father he never had as a child.There are other wacky characters - Bill Murray as Paltrow's shrink husband, Danny Glover as an associate of Huston's (and a potential love interest), and Owen Wilson playing Luke Wilson's best friend.The movie is good and I admire how its fairy-tale/children's book-structure is so well captured - even with the turning pages that appear on screen to introduce new "chapters" of the story.But overall I was left feeling a little underwhelmed when it was over, thinking I preferred "Life Aquatic" a bit more because I just found it more easily accessible in terms of humor and narrative."Royal Tenenbaums" is pretentious and showy, but if you like unique films, you'll find something worthwhile here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to join the ranks of the tools who know nothing about film making and story writing go on out and rent yourself a copy of this atrocity to literature. The main problem with this movie is THERE ARE NO CHARACTER ARCHS! There is no story. They start the movie off and their life is crap, they end the movie and their life is crap. Plus with that overrated hack Ben Stiller added into the mix, the movie had me sighing the whole way through. On top of that the Wilson brother's are some of the worst actors you will ever come across, Gwyneth Paltrow should be laughed out of Hollywood anyway, not just for this film. Finally, this film was an insult to great actors like Angelica Houston, and Gene Hackman. Anyone who thought There's something about Mary was a witty piece of movie magic should run out see this film, love it, and then never again comment. This movie is trash, and is just praised by the legions of no talent hacks who have no perception of what makes a good movie is, but want everyone to think they do. In all of my life, this is the only movie that made me want to get up and leave the theater. Wes Anderson is not a genius, and should be scoffed out of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is, quite frankly, the most boring movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I sat down on a cool Sunday evening hoping for a nice comedy to give me a good laugh to end the week, and I expected that from this movie, what with the likes of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson.Instead, I got served up with a dull, lifeless movie with no real meaning. The was nothing to be achieved from this movie, and I have completely no idea as to how or why the producers managed to get such an all-star cast for such a boring movie.Somehow, I don't think I am alone in my opinion. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are in many movies, Meet The Fockers and Starsky and Hutch for example, and most, nee all of them are good comedies, good for a nice laugh. How on Earth they managed to keep such a straight face in a movie they would not have been used to is amazing.Gene Hackman: I admire him. I admire his movies, but this spoiled my view of him. He plays such a boring role in this movie. He is, and I apologise for frequent use of this word, dull. His character lacks any life.Overall: 1 out of 10, and it purely gets that point for its cast, nothing else.And let me say, Thank you for ruining my lovely weekend with your lifeless, boring movie.</fullReview>

And they do their parts well, Danny Glover especially with such enthusiasm for his part.What am I saying here? That the movie was bad, poorly written, and poorly presented. The actors did a really good job but were given really bad writing.Overall, it was very hard to follow and not very interesting.

		<shortDescription>Sub-Mediocrity with a dash of Boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most important thing to note about this film is that the plot and characters lack focus, direction, and passion. By presenting such a wide mosaic of eccentric characters, any focus on a certain one is lost. All actors in this film have only about twenty minutes screen time as they try to share the lack of plot with everyone else. Every character is bereft of most emotions, and instead exists only as a specific scenario. With a few exceptions, all that was required of the actors in this movie was blank, vacant, disconnected stares, and deadpan dialogue. Through the first half of the movie I kept thinking that it was just about to get to the good stuff, but it never did. The movie has no plot direction except for in Gene Hackman's character trying to regain a place in his family, everyone else is just simply thrown at us, as if a mere character's presence was reason enough to make a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I hate to be picky here. Call me ridiculous if you must for making this correction, but here it is: this film does not take place in New York. Although clearly filmed in New York, this film takes place in a fictional city. Why do I say this? No recognizable landmarks from New York, or any other city for that matter, are depicted. No street names or place names used exist in New York. The colors on the buses are not correct. One other commenter's statement that he had never seen New York look like this was correct for a specific reason: Wes Anderson tried to make the fictional city in the film look reminiscent of New York, but not the same as New York. Because it's not New York. In fact, I don't think the city in the film is ever called by name. (One could, almost as equally justifiably, say the film takes place in Chicago or Philadelphia.) And yes, a richly imagined, highly-detailed, sweeping American tale that rewards the insightful viewer. Is it the "Great American Film"? If it isn't, it certainly deserves a nomination for that title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know the feeling - you've been watching a movie for 30 minutes and you're still waiting for it to start. I rented "Bottle Rocket" and thought it was kind of funny, mostly due to Owen Wilson. So I rented another by this supposed genius Wes Anderson: "Rushmore". Not very good. And now this movie. All I saw was a bunch of people doing and talking about boring things. I never was absorbed into the movie. I always knew I was watching a bunch of actors and actresses saying their lines. Why was the Ben Stiller character so angry with his Dad? Was this supposed to be funny or sad or what? I didn't care. Gwyneth Paltrow spent 95% of her time on screen silently and sullenly smoking a cigarette. Is this entertainment, or what? I've only quit watching a handful of movies in my life, but I had to fast forward through this one to see if anything interesting happens (it didn't).

Like laughing at a joke when you're at a party and didn't actually hear the punchline, but you dn't want to seem stupid.I'm positively stunned by the number of favorable reviews this stinker got.Gene Hackman was recently on James Lipton's show, and they made nomention of this dog whatsoever. -I bet Gene ask James not to, as he was tooembarrassed to talk about it.I'd give this 1/2 star if I could.</fullReview>

Swill.I had the fun yesterday of seeing the same experimental principle applied cinematically to a roomful of adults who were looking forward to watching a DVD just rented from Blockbuster, Cinematic Experiment A, a.k.a. "The Royal Tenenbaums".The fidgeting began roughly ten minutes into the film. A further five minutes in, and the first experimental subject had her arms crossed. This was followed shortly thereafter by the significant crossing of the legs.At the half-hour mark, a subject left the room entirely because he "had work to do". I was the next to leave after an hour because I "had to check on something".Returning for the closing credits, I was informed that I had missed one (1) funny incident.So much for a film billed as wacky and eccentric. Oh, and funny. The other intrepid aesthetes stuck it out to the end, but the verdict was unanimous. The reaction was something akin to narcolepsy. Fortunately the condition wasn't terminal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tracing family reconciliation, this is a goes-nowhere-does-nothing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've no idea what the makers of this film were trying to achieve. On a more personal level I've no idea why i continued to watch it, even when it was clear that the plot line was not going to develop into something more interesting.The story follows the return of Gene Hackman's character, Royal Tenenbaum, to the family home, by weasling his way back into his estranged wife's aquaintance with a claim that he's dying. There's a lot of voice over work, with broad sweeps of the narator's brush cutting through the family history, something that continues right until the end.All the family children return home too, by one way or another, plus there is the family friend "Eli Cash" played by Owen Wilson. The dysfunctional aspects of the family can the be explored (Oh how novel), with Gene Hackman's caracter being revealed as a lying, cheating, busted ex-lawyer; Ben Stiller is an over-achieving widower who lost his wife in a plane crash &amp; who has look alike kids who's lives he's screwing up too; Gwyneth Paltrow is a disaffected daughter who's never adjusted to her adoption into the family; Luke Wilson drifts along as the ex-tennis pro &amp; Anjelica Huston stars as Mrs Tenenbaum, the only member of the family to show any signs of being reasonably well adjusted.There's sub plots, twists &amp; avenues along the way, but in reality it's all so limp wristed that it fails to hold your interest for long. It's not that important messages are lost under a veil of subtlety, the narrator holds the audience's hand far to firmly for that to happen, it's rather that nothing really happens.This is no more than a cheap TV drama, dressed up with a big budget, given a slight (&amp; I do mean SLIGHT!) comic twist &amp; sent scurrying off to the big screen by way of an all star cast.To be fair there are a few comic moments, best of all with Danny Glover falling down a trench as he walks alongside Huston. This scene is well done, but it's been seen a thousand times before since the days of silent films. As for the druggy Owen Wilson's appearance with his crazilly painted face that was enough to raise a smile, but that's about it.Ben Stiller can usually make me laugh, but not this time, as he didn't seem to get much chance to use his comedic talents. Gwyneth Paltrow played such a disipated character that she was almost forgettable &amp; might as easily been invisible. Luke WIlson's failed tennis pro also just seemed to drift around the screen, as if lost, which just about summed up the matter for me. They all just drifted around.Bill Murray was a surprise, sporting a greying beard &amp; glasses he seemed uncannily like Salmand Rushdie! You can tell it's getting desperate when it's something like that generates interest.All in all what this film was about baffles me. Family reconciliation.. so what, it's been done a thousand times before, done better &amp; far cheaper too, no doubt. My advice is to avoid this dog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, Stupid, Pointless.... And I am holding back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must have seen 25 films in the theater in 2001 and this movie was by far the worst.My understanding from the trailer was that it would be a dark comedy. It was indeed dark, but it was utterly lacking in comedy. I didn't laugh one time, and almost never smiled (and I am generally easy to get a lough out of). I almost enjoyed "Manos, The Hands of Fate" more than this movie!I think this quote from a "positive" review almost says it all.."A mellifluous, labyrinthine thing, indescribably delicious and ambitiously literate." -- Walter Chaw, FILM FREAK CENTRAL"melliflous" means smooth flowing... "Labyrinthine" means maze-like. So we have that is a "a smooth flowing maze". What I then get from that quote (after translating it back from "intelligencia speak" is that the movie is long, confusing, more or less pointless, and keeps moving along so you don't have time to realize how lost and pointless it is until it is all over."ambitiously literate." When I hear about a BOOK that is considered "ambitiously literate" I know I don't want to read it because it will doubtlessly be "incredibly dull". The last thing I want from a movie is something as dull as the dullest of books."thing" This clinches the issue for me. What you are seeing on the movie screen when you watch this film is not in fact a movie. It is something else. As far as I can tell it is a book... I will get back to this in a minute...When I actually sit down to analyze the movie there are a few primary problems with it that jump out at me...Every single character in the movie is a sterotype (All sterotypes rarely works unless the movie is a pure comedy). Every single character is completely dysfunctional both in their personal relationships and within themselves (When EVERYONE is dysfunctional to this degree no matter what happens the whole movie is usually a downer). Their is almost no character development of any character but Royal himself (this is probably because of the sheer number of secondart characters in the movie). The lack of character development is clearly meant to be covered by the fact that everyone is a stereotype. Clearly the writers felt they didn't have to do much more than introduce them to you for you to understand them since they are all sterotypical. Unfortunately understanding the characters is not the same as BONDING with the characters. The lack of a bond with any of the characters for the first 90% of the movie (you don't even get close to Royal until nearly the end) means that all the character interactions that take place are disconnected from the viewer. Basically the you (as the viewer) end up a disinterested 3rd party watching a bunch of complete losers you don't care about try to resolve a bunch of problems that you don't give a damn about.By the end of the movie you are supposed to have a connection with Royal and actually be interested in what he does. You are supposed to be rooting for him to get his life, and hopefully his families straightened out. Unfortunately you know he is an ass and after seeing everything he has done, while you have a connection with him, it is a connection of either loathing or pity, or both, depending on your nature. No matter how you slice it you end up feeling very negative emotions and no minor laughs can completely correct the problem. ...Back to the book thing. The movie is presented as a book. In my opinion that is what it should be, a book, and not a movie. With a book that actually explored the inner thoughts and emotions of the characters you would have time to develop the connection needed to empathize with the characters and thus be entertained by what happens to them rather than bored.The final nail in the coffin is that the humor is just not that funny. This is actually mostly a matter of timing. Lots of the best humor is in the intro. Then the rest of it is squeezed into or between scenes that are very negative. It just doesn't flow right in my opinion. Also some of the humor is to quick, some is to subtle, and some is too long. All of it could have been tweaked for greater effect I think. At least part of those issues are probably due to having the writer in the cast and on the set every single day. Most directors will tell you that most writers just shouldn't be on the same set with their work during filming because they don't have sufficient objectivity to not interfere when something that they thought was great on paper ends up sucking on film and is changed.Anyway, if you want to see it then by all means do so. However when you come back here give a review based on how you felt as you left the theater (bored in my case), and not just one that makes you part of the crowd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How dare this movie be billed as a comedy? At it's best it's a poorly done drama. The few people that did laugh in the packed theater smacked of the fake Broadway play guffaw. The sound was coming from a person so desperately trying to convince everyone else that this film was funny.My wife &amp; I wasted two free tickets on this piece of garbage. The movie starts off really slow introducing characters. Every few minutes you meet another person and get a little background all the while thinking it's going to get funny any minute now. You soon realize that will not happen, but you continue to wait.This was the first time my wife has ever walked out of the theater before the movie credits. Unfortunately it took 55 minutes to get that annoyed. I was ready to leave after 8 minutes, but instead I counted the total number of people who walked out early. Eleven people walked out prior to our hasty exit and countless others were discussing how bad this movie is.In summary it was one of the slowest moving movies I have ever witnessed. Save your money it will be on network TV soon enough. I really doubt a premium movie channel will even purchase the rights to air it.</fullReview>

I, too, respect Gene Hackman as an actor. His natural and typically seamless character portrayal did not resurrect this film for me, however. It seemed to be edited in such a way as to confuse the viewer as to chronology ... the dialogue was occasionally unintelligible. It had a general mood of depression and hopelessness and dysfunction, which I realize was intentional to the plot. The color shift was predominantly to the red, which created a disturbing mood... hopefully, this was intentional... and it worked. I literally forced myself to watch it to completion because I am a voting member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and wanted to give it full consideration. But, I found myself not caring one bit about any of the characters personally... and this is a fatal flaw in my book. I found the film editing confusing and awkward... almost amateurish. This is like a piece of non-subjective modern art that seems to appeal to those who appreciate a departure from the mainstream. It certainly is THAT! Not every departure takes one anywhere edifying, however.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>can't believe I bought the DVD, what was I thinking?!? I got so terribly bored I stopped at 48 minutes, took it out of the player, broke it into pieces then threw it in the bin. watching 48 minutes of it was a "Stupendous" waste of time. 48 minutes of my life wasted and money spent to buy it went down the drain. there have been other movies with high ratings turning out to be rubbish. but this one takes the "Dais" at the "Pinnacle" of all other rubbishes. even rating it 1 ("Dreadful") serves as a "Humongous" insult to all the other movies rated 1. this movie is so "Awful" that rating = 0.009. it deserves the lowest ratings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't get it, I really don't!! The plot was thin, the characters were thinner. Whoever described this film as comedy clearly has no concept of comedy. Gene Hackman as a comedy lead - come on!! OK so it's a dysfunctional family, I get that, OK so they are child protégés, I get that - but it goes no where, no development of plot or characters. If you want to see a real comedy about a dysfunctional family see The Adams Family where at least Angelica Huston acts. The scene when Hackman tells her he's dying is so bad as to be unbelievable, she is not a bad actress but the direction and lines in that scene destroy her credibility. How this film was nominated for an Oscar is beyond me, well actually when you think about it no, because the academy is full of pretentious sycophants who just vote on what they are told is good writing rather than actually putting some thought behind it - avoid this film like the plague.</fullReview>

Who is voting...Reading a few comments here most people hate it. They are obviously so annoyed as to not vote it 0/10. Obviously a picture of extremes. Lost on me. I'm not sure what the Director was trying to do with the film. Its fragmented with a range of unsympathetic quite weird characters that have no redeeming features. After the first 30 minutes a third of the cinema left. By an hour another third had left. By the end only 20 people remained and that sums it up. Maybe it works to US audiences but in England it fails. I really suggest you spend your money elsewhere. 0/10 its that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the thing of it is, the director is not nearly as clever or original as he thinks he is. Not nearly. Not at all.People don't behave as they do in this movie, at least not on planet Earth they don't.What were we supposed to take from this film? Bad parenting can lead to screwed up kids?And this is a fresh insight ... how?Anderson fills his cast with excellent actors, and then refuses to allow them the freedom and latitude to actually go to work and find and express some honest emotional truth in their characters. Only the always dependable Gene Hackman manages to create an identifiable human being, in spite of the trappings they seek to impose on him. For instance the scene where he talks about having his life saved in India by the Tenenbaum's Indian butler -- or whatever he is. Royal had been stabbed by the butler who was seeking a bounty; instead the butler had a change of heart and rushed Royal to a hospital. This is a prime example of cute and ultimately bad writing. It says nothing about humans because it is incident that has never happened ever to a real human being, nor will it ever happen. It is a writer's conceit only. Too clever. The film suffers for it; it is but one of dozens of such transgressions.Anderson populates his films with human cartoons, then would have us believe he is filling us in on actual human behavior. There is nothing wrong with the human cartoon approach -- Dr. Strangelove leaps to mind -- But that film uses the humans to lampoon human short-sidedness and lack of self-awareness.For the life of me, I can't figure out what points Anderson is trying to make in this film.2 out of 10; film is boring, pretentious and tedious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who let this dog out. Artsy fartsy is one thing, but this one lives up only to the latter half of that image. I spent the first fifteen minutes waiting for the narrator to finish so they could get on with the movie. Then they had about five minutes of acting and right back to the narrator. I finally realized who the narrator was and that we were not going to see him in the movie (smart move, Al).All right, I admit I watched the whole thing. Maybe I thought all those brilliant actors would break out of the script. No such luck. The editing zeroed that hope. Usually I like seeing popular actors like Gwynith Paltrow doing something creative. And I like off the wall stuff, too. This was just off the ground, and not very far, either. If you have to have a narrator explain the story all the way through, there is something wrong no matter how famous that narrator is. These actors could have made it work and if they had Alec Baldwin play the other brother instead this ridiculousness may not have stank.</fullReview>

Creating offbeat characters and having an interesting idea on the surface doesn't translate into a good picture. I'm like a lot of people, I enjoy films like Memento, Run Lola Run, others like that which break the mold of formula filmmaking a bit, but like others here, I got sucked in and it was a huge waste of money seeing this.

The trailers suggest a comedy of sorts but the humor is almost non-existent ... character development takes forever, and one finds oneself not caring and wondering why anyone would make a movie like this. I'm embarrassed to say that I forced myself to watch the whole thing - hoping that with such a stellar cast it would pick up steam or get better somewhere along the way.

		<fullReview>I will begin by saying I love movies that many people won't even attempt to view. Robin Williams in Toys, and Being John Malcovic come to mind. Dark satire is not lst on me, and neither are many of the subtle things that go into these types of films. That said, I rented this movie with very high hopes after all I had read about it. I love Gene Hackman and Gwyneth , and when I heard Bill Murray was in this too, I was intrigued...I was even willing to deal with Ben Stiller! I am sorry I did. This is the first movie I have ever commented on in this site, primarily due to laziness and not wanting to register. I registered simply because this film was so awful I had to let others know. The idea behind the film isn't bad, but the way it is done is almost hypnotic. My wife fell asleep twice, and it took all of my patience to not just pull it out half way and take it back. Hackman was good (but this is not his best work by far) and this may have been the worst performance I have ever seen by ALL of the other cast members. This movie starts off slow, and then slows down while taking the viewer on a trip to nowhere. The constant narration became a huge distraction, and it may have been the best part of the film. This movie is not nearly amusing enough to call a comedy, nor is it remotely close to realistic enough to be considered drama. I only gave it a 1 because 0 was not an option.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A place where absurdist humor that works and eccentricities scream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums is a beautifully crafted work of offbeat art, delightfully presented with a touch of elegance and humanity. I'm currently in the process of exploring Anderson's entire filmography and have finally found the film that sided with me competently. After Bottle Rocket, I was underwhelmed, yet optimistic at the man's future efforts. After Rushmore, I began to question if this man was the kind of director I wanted to continue to pursue. After The Royal Tenenbaums, I knew I saw something majestic.The film is more than a character study, but a character experiment, erected on the idea of creating the most eclectic characters humanly possible and seeing if the audience can resonate or respond to them in a reasonable fashion. We are greeted with the Tenenbaum family, lead by the father, Royal Tenenbaum (Hackman), a rich yet somewhat off putting soul, who is married to Etheline (Houston). Royal and Etheline give birth to two exceptionally skilled children and adopted one of the same breed. Chas, who is professionally skilled in financing, and Richie, a tennis prodigy are the biological kids, while Margot, the adopted daughter, was a published playwright at the tender age of eleven.The Tenenbaum children should've endured very meaningful and successful lives, but instead, endured three disheartening years of betrayal, failure, and tragedy. Chas (Stiller) sued his father twice for stealing bonds from his safety deposit box and lost his wife in a plane crash, Margot (Paltrow), overtime, became a closed book, smoking, marrying Bill Murray's character Raleigh, who is much, much older than her, and looking miserable throughout her lifetime, and Richie (Luke Wilson) suffered a panic attack on the tennis court during a game, cementing him into a block of uncertainty.Royal has been separated from Etheline for a long time but never divorced. Etheline is currently smitten by her comforting and unanimously caring accountant, Henry (Danny Glover) and is the first to hear the news that Royal is dying from the man himself. He claims that have a mere six weeks to live, and wants to "make nice" with the family he has become so disconnected with. Richie's good friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) also comes into play, joining the reunion, but he doesn't truly get his time of day until well into the second act.Knowing about the plot when going into the picture, I had one looming question; why didn't Wes Anderson choose to make the film about the kids in their heyday, rather than them when they're directionless, depressed, morose, melancholy, and vague? I conclude that it is much more interesting to learn about people who are floundering rather than thriving. While the ensemble cast works on so many levels, going back to Gene Hackman, one can not deny that he does a brilliant job at creating a character so insensitive and oafish, that he is able to carry a good weight of the film solely on his subtle gestures and expressions.Being that this is a Wes Anderson film, one must keep a close eye out for those serene nuances likely to be brought to the foreground with repeated viewings. One can tell that Wes, himself, loves primary colors and ones that will ignite the screen with flavor. Stiller and his kids (Grant Rosenmeyer and Jonah Meyerson, respectively) with their gleaming red track suits, Margot with her noticeably different way of dressing (take note to the heavy black eyeliner making her eyes protrude out to the viewer), Owen Wilson's fancy cowboy attire, and Richie excessive use of psychedelic nic-nacs. Because Anderson is so concerned with detailing characters, he makes sure none look to ordinary and none look the same. Providing them with their own little story to tell is nothing short of brilliance on his part as well (credit should too be given to Owen Wilson, who assisted in penning the film).The film is laid out like a book, with chapter titles punctuating the film every so often with a sentence and a half accessible to the viewer, reading like an actual book. If one were to quickly skim the words of the page, they will take note that the details are wonderfully replicated on screen, once again, putting emphasis on Anderson's ability to greatly detail a picture.The Royal Tenenbaums is, without a shadow of a doubt, Wes Anderson's first recognizable masterpiece. Finally he has figured out a way to blend his trademark warmness (heavily examined in Bottle Rocket), offbeat, uncomfortable quirkiness (as shown in Rushmore), and his methodical pacing efficiently and beautifully into a film full of absurdist humor that works and eccentricities that scream. The film is rarely cutesy, always upbeat and fun to look at, precious in fields that floundered in the past, and polished to great detail. What an eccentric gem of a story, conceived brilliantly through the mind of a vivid creator.NOTE: When watching the picture and paying close attention to the particular shot framing, it seemed the film was very concerned with the idea of formatting and camera tactics. Perhaps it's just me, but it's extremely rare that I see a film so concerned with the elegance of framing and technique that, after a while, it becomes so welcoming and unique that sitting down to watch another film or Television program makes you question if something is wrong.Starring: Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Grant Rosenmeyer, Jonah Meyerson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Danny Glover, and Bill Murray. Directed by: Wes Anderson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before anything else, I'd like to tell you all that this is my first Wes Anderson film. I've heard lots about him, but never got around to his films. With the release of Moonrise Kingdom coming closer and closer, I've decided to hand-pick one of his "classics" and click play. Let's just say I've came out happy..My favorite thing is Anderson's style. You can obviously tell his style in films, because their quirkiness is off-the-wall hilarious. He obviously has the sense of very subtle humor at times, but turns right back around and gives us a very dry sense of humor. I loved it, because it enhanced the film greater narratively and artistically.I found the acting great. There's lots of well-known names in this gem, but none of them play their usual roles. Anderson made them play good to their part, and good to their material. I especially loved Bill Murray, who plays the not-so sarcastic one in this movie, which is different because in all his others, he played one. He had short-screen time, but the scenes he was in, keep all eyes on him.The film had it's faults. Not sure if they were done purposely but they set off the mood (pun intended.) The film suffers from strange tonal shifts, that kind of give off the wrong impression. My brother watched the first twenty minutes, fell asleep, then woke up in the last twenty minutes. He thought he was watching an entire different movie! The first half is built of it's main source: quirkiness. But then the second half turns right around and turns melodramatic. Some scenes dragged out, the style seemed to fend out some great scenes, and blah, blah, blah. It still was a great film, which I greatly enjoyed.For my first Wes Anderson film, I can tell what this man is doing and accomplishing. He feeds the film his style and projects it so it makes you feel an array of emotions. For my first Wes Anderson film, I liked it. It suffered from strange tonal shifts, but all else was great. It was quirky, witty, and had a subtle amount of poignancy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Writing/Director team Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson follow up their wonderful 1999 film Rushmore with something not completely different but altogether more satisfying and a good deal more powerful.The Tenenbaums are a wealthy New York family of eccentric genuises, headed by Angelica Huston. The pater familias Gene Hackman has been kicked out and estranged from the family for twenty years. The film begins with a prologue detailing the lives of the Tenenbaum clan - Ben Stiller, the real estate genius and safety obsessive, now widowered with two boys. Luke Wilson a former tennis wunderkind, now an isolated, lonely character all alone in the world and Gwyneth Paltrow, the adopted daughter, playwright, depressive and all-round misery guts. Other players include Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Danny Glover.The excellent cast is testament to the fantastic script. Filled with one-liners, hilarious situations and visual gags, it is a real winner. However, it would be a mistake to take this for an out-and-out comedy. Two-thirds in, the script takes a turn for the utterly dark with a bloody, affecting scene, not to everyone's taste and at odds with the film gone beforehand. It's a brave move by Wilson and Anderson and one that pays off in dividends, elevating this movie above others in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Anderson gets the best out of people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson films are like exceptionally well done home movies. Its always the same actors in different costumes playing different roles as if to say; "what shall we do now?". The Royal Tenenbaums is the story of a family of five headed by Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman). The three children in the storm of their parents divorce all become child prodigies of sorts. Chas, played by Ben Still, is a money man making a killing on the housing market. Margot (who is adopted), played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is a playwright and Richie, played by Luke Wilson, is a world champion tennis player. Another character thrown into the midst is Eli Cash, played by Owen Wilson, who is Richie's best friend.The film begins by portraying the three as children all of whom seem to have massive potential, however, fast forward twenty-two years and the family is in rather a grave state. Chas's wife died in a plane crash and he has become extremely overprotective of his twin boys. Richie has had some sort of nervous breakdown and has been travelling on a boat, going around the globe, for several years. Margot, who has married Raleigh (played by Bill Murray) has not written a play for years and seems to have entered a state of uncertainty in her life. She is also having an affair with Eli, who has become a successful author. Meanwhile Royal, who hasn't seen his wife (they never officially divorced) for seven years and after falling on hard times is kicked out of his hotel.When Chas comes to stay at the house the three children grew up in, Richi and Margot become jealous and also want to stay. Meanwhile Royal, who supposedly has six weeks to live, also needs somewhere to stay. A strange family reunion is formed and the movie really kicks off from here, with Royal trying to salvage some sort of relationship with his children in his last remaining weeks and the children themselves trying to work out and resolve what exactly has gone wrong in their lives. As a kind of side story that seeps into the main one, Eli has developed a comically performed drug habit.Acting wise I loved this film. I love the choice of actors as aside from Jason Schwartzman this film seems to encompass all of the usuals. Characters who some people usually find annoying or of poor quality (although I like him, everyone seems to be annoyed by Owen Wilson) do a great job. I thought Ben Stiller, who I usually find very average / type cast, performed exceptionally well, especially on his comedic side. Gene Hackman was fantastic as Royal Tenenbaum, the lovable asshole and the rest of the usuals were good as ever, I especially love Kumar Pallana, who plays Pagoda.In terms of directing Wes Anderson is on point as usual. He has a real life doll house and whilst, annoyingly, he couldn't open it up to pan down the innards, the shots the scroll down the windows were wonderful. I also love the way he follows people, particularly in chase type scenes, because though showing you the action perfectly you also get to see everybody else's reactions whilst he simultaneously shows off the house / set that he's working in for all its weirdly wonderful characteristics. The soundtrack, as for all Anderson films, is really superb. Everything comes on and disappears at the right moment, and the music always matches the action.The writing is possibly the best bit. The story is very enticing, and within the film there are several different stories, secrets held by characters etc. that come together and manifest themselves in a perfect ending. The film is also very funny, there is a mixture of deadpan and just very silly humour that will make you laugh out loud and smile your way through this picture. Overall I think this may be Wes Anderson's best movie (apart from maybe Bottlerocket). Its very clever and you definitely won't have seen anything like it before. I would say that this would definitely have been Oscar worthy, its just that its probably not really serious enough for the expletives at the academy, though perhaps not for any acting (still, maybe Ben Stiller should have got best supporting?). Anyways this is a must watch, definitely go and see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's a film reflective of the breakdown of the American family absent of any analysis of the social, cultural and political forces in American life that have been besieging and savaging this institution." ? Dennis Grunes Wes Anderson directs "The Royal Tenenbaums". The plot? Having abandoned his family years ago, Royal Tenenbaum returns home to find his once talented kids living depressed and dysfunctional lives. Though initially hated, Royal slowly rebuilds broken bridges and helps his family overcome various problems and grievances. By the film's end, everyone has learnt to open up, empathise, talk, and lend one another a helping hand. How cute.Unsurprisingly, the film's aesthetic stresses a certain one dimensionality. Anderson's images resemble flattened postcards, doll houses or pop-up story books. Elsewhere his characters are all cartoons, each with their own uniforms and wafer thin personalities. Likewise, repeated motifs (paintings and portraits of animal masks, school plays with masked children etc) draw attention to the fact that virtually every character in the film is playing a different "character", either putting on false faces, wearing masks to keep others from worrying about them, or pretending to be something they're not (happy, dying, in love etc).Coupled to these phony projections is a sort of implied voyeurism. Everyone in the film is under observation, either literally stalked by photographers, spied on by Anderson's 1960's faux documentary camera (complete with mock snap zooms), or under the heavy gaze of family expectations. In response, Anderson's films tend to advocate throwing away all our meta-contextual baggage, all our voyeur-anxieties, and embracing a kind of stripped down, far Eastern simplicity ("Darjeeling Limited"), or in the case of "Moonrise Kingdom", literally escaping to the woods. The problem is, while it advocates tearing off masks and latching onto some semblance of "authenticity", "Tenenbaums" is itself a series of masks, a series of flat, postmodern references.In the 1940s, Orson Welles directed "Citizen Kane" and "The Magnificent Ambersons". Those two films aimed for the richness of literature's great family sagas, though Welles would later denounce parts of both films for their hokey psychologizing. Between Welles and today's directors you then had various novelists - John Irving, Frank Herbert, John Salinger etc - who specialised in "family sagas". What Anderson does with "Tenenbaums", though, is style his film as a quirky adaptation (narrated by Alec Baldwin) of a fictional version of one of these novels. In this way his film is an abstraction of not only Welles, but the "family novels" of "great American novelists" (particularly Salinger's "Glass Family" novels). But with each layer of abstraction, and each subsequent film, Anderson's characters get both increasingly flatter and more neurotically obsessed with their own superficiality. The end result is that Anderson's characters are doomed to exist in a kind of vampiric media-scape. As Anderson's aesthetic merely replicates what is really an all pervasive, socio-historical condition, they can't really find fulfilment. Authenticity resides in other spheres.Like most postmodern works, the film epitomises a decline in sincerity and a kind of rise in self-consciousness. As examples, study the jaded characters and deadpan meta-irony served up by directors like Jarded Hess, Jim Jarmusch and the Coens. Or simply glance at Facebook photo-albums and notice the rise of self-conscious "duckface" or "middle finger" poses; exaggerated mask-like expressions designed to keep people from seeing how you really feel, whether its high, low, or anything in between. Just be really silly and consciously fake and your emotional state will be guarded, people believe. Today this condition is now so widespread as to be the norm. The average Westerner is not only meta, but trying to be further meta.Still, Anderson's aesthetic is seductive, featuring a whimsical tone, wacky architecture, quirky music, lovingly composed postcard images and eye-popping colours. The love child of Martin Scorsese, Ashby, Woody Allen and a fluorescent popcorn machine, the film dazzles you with zany sounds and sights, whilst its emotionally damaged cast looks the camera in the eye and reflects their audience's glass eyed flatness back at them. It's schizoid art for a world of schizoids.The film shouldn't work. It should come across as just another trite "American Beauty" dysfunction movie, but Anderson's mix-tape is so esoteric, and at times so achingly wounded, that you eventually get suckered in. Unlike most post-modernists (say Tarantino, who draws from 1970s exploitation cinema), Anderson's wearing masks from 1960s European vogue, 60s French cool and guys like Louis Malle ("Le Feu Follet"), Jaques Tati, Andy Warhol, Fellini, Godard and Truffaut. The sound track comes from a similar place, soaked in the precious quirkiness of the Velvet Underground, the Beatles and Nico.Keeping with the film's fairytale style are references to Greek odyssey's and the Helen of Troy myth. The name "Royal" alludes to an ancient King (who returns home after a long absence to dispatch his wife's suitor), Royal's sons sport the names of British nobility and he lives on Archer Avenue (conjuring up Homer's Odyssey). In addition to this, "Helen" is the name of both Royal's mother and his wife's middle name (her first name, Etheline, also has Helen in it), whilst ships in the film are named Helena and Halifax (Halifax means "holy hair/head"). There are some Biblical references as well: Royal's "death" and "fake resurrection" bring the familiar together, he's pierced in the side and is constantly drinking bloody Mary's etc.Ultimately, though, you have a film about emotionally damaged kids, watched by emotionally damaged audiences, with an aesthetic that participates in, or is a product of, a different kind of collapse. The film doesn't speak, so much as it cosily lets its audience know that they're not the only ones a little bit scrambled.8.5/10 ? Worth three viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't know what else to say. It was not funny, it was not dramatic, there was no action, there was nothing. I have been coming to this site for years now and this is the first time I have given a review, that is how much I hate this film. With such a great cast I expected a lot more. This is no Bottlerocket. A friend of mine was raving about this movie, talking about how he laughed for 10 min about the painting on Owen Wilsons' wall (the four wheeler guys with the wrestling masks). So I went to see it on a double date(I know...Lame) and all four of us almost walked out. Needless to say my respect for his movie picks has dropped dramatically(even more when I found out the he hated Clerks among other greats). Please take this into account before you waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was there any point at all to this film?? It never went anywhere, was never interesting. No plot, no laughs, nothing. The characters were never developed, they were all pretty much alike: DULL. I was beyond bored. SPOILER ALERT-STOP READING HERE: I have walked out of few films. But during the suicide scene, I couldn't take it, it hit a touchy nerve. (This is an extremely personal topic for me and that was just way too much. There ought to be some rating for scenes like that, when something might be way too personal for the audience.) The character's suicide seemed to come out of nowhere, unmotivated, unnecessary and unsubstantiated. I think if the a-hole directors/writers had ever truly experienced a loss that awful, they would have never included it in the film. Don't waste a second of your life with this nothing film-don't rent it, don't recommend it to anyone. You'll be better off staring at the wall for 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never had I wanted to leave a movie in the middle of it. People said that it was a comedy, of sorts, but everyone in my party , and myself found it very depressing. It was like movies being labeled a Black Comedy, as someone in the world might smile once. This was definitely linked with that title. I loved most of the actors, but where did the story go? Gene Hackman, whom I love, tries to bring his family back together again, now that he is broke, and a pathetic figure that one can not even root for. I guess I really like a comedy, with feel-good moments and do not care if a picture has a message, which seems to be the thing today. I remember action comedy movies by Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner,,,Romancing the Stone, and Jewel of the Nile, both exciting, funny, and romantic. Then that duo decided to do a black comedy, War of the Roses, which was depressing and put an end to that successful duo. I really think the Royal Tenenbaums should meet the Roses. And the new definition of Black Comedy is Not Funny......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most dysfunctional family movie I have ever watched. I was surprised at the high rating. I guess the ratings reflect the state of the times we live in. Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston and Gwyneth Paltrow do play their roles well but whatever made them accept their parts. Ben Stiller, Danny Glover and Bill Murray were fit for the roles they played which was not acting. It appeared as if Hackman was trying to save the movie. While Huston and Paltrow gave up on the roles and appear to want it over as soon as possible. In general it was not a good movie and had no value. A waste of film would be putting it mildly. I do normally rate movies so critically but this one needed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was quite possibly one of the worse, absolutely crappiest pieces of film I have EVER seen!! The plot was absolutely pointless and the movie itself was downright BORING! I had much better things to do than sit through THIS 2-hour torture. Watching Ben Stiller and listening to his constant rants and staring at Gwyneth Paltrow's constant creepy-eyed blank stare is enough to make someone almost beg to be strangled. Wes Anderson is probably one of the most God-awful directors on the planet when it comes to movie-making and talent. Plus, does ANYONE actually think this movie is FUNNY??? Give me a break!! I'd rather eat a bowl of vulcanized rubber for breakfast in the morning than sit through this thing again and another one of Anderson's crappy films. DO NOT EVEN RENT THIS MOVIE, IT IS SO BAD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lately, I've been enjoying my social life more than getting back into my movie hobby, so apologies for the delay on my comments for those who enjoy them. ;) I was looking for a movie to watch and my mom had recommended for me to watch The Royal Tennenbaums and that it is a very dark humor type of movie. So I figured I'd give it a shot.I really did enjoy this movie. For some reason I really got into the humor, which is kind of weird, but I loved how quirky it was. Gene Hackman without a doubt steals this movie with his incredible performance as Royal, who fakes his fatal illness just so he can get back into his family. Actually to be honest, all the actors pretty much had flawless performances.I can see where people wouldn't like this movie, but I think it is one of those love/hate movies that you just have to give a chance. But I would recommend this one for drama and independent movie lovers.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies make you laugh, some movies make you cry, some movies make you indifferent. This movie can do all of these or none. If you looking for a movie that doesn't make you feel anything and you get no feel of who the characters really are then you'll hate this movie. if you want a movie where the characters are like real people and you get a sense of who they are then you might like this movie. People are messed up. Being a person you most likely can vouch for the fact that we are all strange and have deep seeded emotional problems. The Royal Tenenbaums reminds us that everybody is like this so maybe we aren't that strange or troubled after all. Maybe we are just people. This reality is what makes this movie. However, if you don't want to think or feel and you don't need character development then there are lots of mindless high budget movies out there just for you that aren't this movie.The entire cast of this movie came through with strong performances, even the butler whom I don't even believe was an actor (he just fit right in there). The artistic level of this film was perfect, not pretentious at all. The soundtrack was perfect. This movie is memorable, quotable, and always a treat to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some people never can let go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess everyone gets something unique from a movie, and perhaps the hallmark of a great movie is that it can be interpreted in different ways. I'll say right off that I didn't find it all that wildly amusing ? it's perhaps too true to life for that. However, I did find it touching. In places.Judging from the comments I have seen so far, the rogue in the piece is Royal himself, who is seen to be selfish and somewhat uncaring as a father. Royal deserted his family and now look what's happened.I don't see it this way at all. I see Royal as the only refreshing person in the family and the only hope for their salvation. He left them because he got sick of them. They were all high-achievers, egged on by their high-achieving mother. Not surprisingly, they burned themselves out and are suffering the consequences of it, each in their own way. They have one thing in common ? none had a real childhood.Royal opted out of it. No doubt fed up with the pressures of being a high-achiever himself, he holed himself up in a hotel room with his encyclopedias and enjoyed the childhood which he had had stolen from him. Now he wants to give that childhood back to his family.However, he is too late ? they are too set in their ways. The only one who moves forward somewhat from his time-frozen state is Richie, but he can't cope with the consequences. Chaz is an a**hole, who is set to destroy the lives of his young sons through a life of regimentation and high-pressure. Royal sees the dangers and tries to rescue them (notice how he first talks to them through the mesh of a "cage"), but is thwarted. Margot is on the path to suicide herself. She is clearly beyond redemption. Hard-nosed Etheline sails on regardless, but she has given up love for financial security.For me, this movie is not so much about holding on as letting go. Royal let himself go and his life was so much the better for it. He wanted his family too do so as well, but they couldn't. They just couldn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you get when you take artful set design, beautiful camera work, a seamless score and great writing that is held together by a stellar cast?... A quirky little diddy called "The Royal Tenenbaums". Watching this movie is like watching a cheap family portrait, painted on velvet, come to life. Each character is just cool, that really is the best way to describe them. You don't know anyone like these characters but if you did you would want to be their friends. I would say the most important player in this story is timing. From the way the perfect song plays at the perfect time to the way each actor holds and delivers their line. This has the unsteady rhythm of a Rolling Stones song, and so their contributions to the score are fitting.The relationship that Richie(Luke Wilson) has with his adopted sister Margot(Paltrow) is as tragic and sweet as any I have ever seen. And the love that everyone has (or finds) for Royal is complex and pure. This is just a great, warming story.If you think the only kind of comedy that is funny is that which you would find in "Airplane", that great drama is "Forest Gump" or if you the phrase "Titanic a great cinematic event" has ever come from your mouth, then you probably wont like this and you should stay inside watching your CBS and listening to pop music.Wildcat..wildcat...wildcat....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this film has lasting value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prefacing this by saying I am in my late-20's...The reason this film is so great is that everyone involved was dedicated to the director's vision of the film. This film never sells it's characters out, it never compromises it's vision of an alternative-70's era New York City, and it features great performances including what should have been an Oscar-winning lead by Gene Hackman.I think the film has polarized a lot of people, who are turned off by the oddness of the setting and the somewhat bizarre actions of the family.There was a film that they showed us in grade school where two kids hid in a museum...Wes Anderson, doesn't steal from that film, but pays homage to it....I'd love to know what the name of that movie was.If you went to school during the 70s and early 80's maybe you get on the wavelength of this film....to me watching it is like wrapping myself in a blanket and remembering the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about this film? The richness of its detail and whimsy is fantastic. Literally, fantastic as in it has created a fantasy world down to the smallest elements. Ultimately moving and human, however, it is the product of great care and intelligence. The director's other work (Rushmore) is similarly detailed his style is instantly recognizable. The movie is a great ensemble piece of talented actors who inhabit characters at once offbeat and familiar. The music is also completely thought-out and a great backdrop to the action of the film. The dialogue is spare but full of meaning and never rings false. Gene Hackman is great as the unseated patriarch of a family of failed geniuses. The Wilson brothers also deliver with their unique blend of solemnity and wise-stupid behavior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a tremendous film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I disagree with most of the comments posted here. Contrary, I think the film struck a subtle and persuasive balance between comedy and tragedy that won't emerge fully with only one viewing. Eventually a subdued air of tragedy takes precedence, punctuated with comic moments. The film may be rightfully called "bittersweet." I saw this in the theater, originally, expecting a comedy (the media had been touting it as such), and left feeling vaguely disappointed, thinking the movie hadn't been really that 'funny,' nor had many of the performances been particularly persuasive. But- there was something, a lingering pathos, that brought me back a second time, a few months later. This time came more of a revelation: it took a second viewing to adjust to the idiosyncrasies of the film that, upon first viewing, may seem the fault of poor direction: lack of "story," apathy, and so forth. The pieces came together; the meticulous set design and cinematography; more than meticulous attention to detail; performances which, upon second viewing, gelled, and seemed more or less uniformly exceptional, Gene Hackman outstanding; quirks which first seemed non-sequiturial and throwaway, now coming to make sense; and the delicate balance between tragedy and comedy--- in short, it "made sense." I was impressed this had been made by a contemporary American director, and within the Hollywood system, nonetheless, with "big name" celebrities. I also understand why the film may be offputting to many American audiences and viewers, especially those predominately accustomed to Hollywood films and little else. A fine film. Hope he makes even better ones.... And to all those who say there's nothing funny here: the Owen Wilson character on mescaline-- and the Miguel Calderon paintings-- this is one of most ironically humorous scenes I've, dare I say, ever encountered in cinema... I think, in time, this movie will emerge as a classic. I think it'll stand the scrutiny of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An open letter to the nay-sayers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think the reason that so many of us have shown disbelief and frustration with the negative reviews on the site is due to relegating them all to "boorish" or "Jim Carrey"-loving. I think it is because we expect a higher level of film appreciation from anyone who would take the time to comment on a message board intended for "film people" (okay, cinema geeks!) The fact that subtle humour and dry wit is horribly unappreciated in America is sad - Brits and Canadians have made this art form our bread and butter for years, why are the best complete and innovative comedians from these countries (Python, Young Ones, Mike Myers, Kids In The Hall, etc.)?!! If someone didn't like the movie, that's fine . But to call it boring, slow, or unfunny is just ignorant and narrow... in real life there are funny moments in tragic figures' lives! Sorry. I, personally, used the "golf-ball-in-crotch" analogy in a negative tone because I am so infuriated with that which passes for "great" in hollywood - or at least financially successful - that I take it personally as a lover of great cinema. Imagine how boring Bergman's "The Seventh Seal" must seem to those people! Just because Ben Stiller doesn't over-play a "model look" and there isn't a car chase every 5 minutes doesn't mean that the pacing and humour is flawed! The point is that most of the negative comments I read (and I read over 100 comments for Tenenbaums) were inane and showed little grasp of the value of tragedy in a comedic melieux. Having said that, I do blame the studio for not knowing how to market a film of this type to a mainstream American public. As a default, they chose comedic trailers and tv spots, which was a misguided decision.Tenenbaums is not a comedy (not as North American audiences would categorize anyway). It is truly a dramatic piece with an underlying sense of humour (which is why you laugh and cry in a matter of 10 minutes at points). The laughs do come in a big way if you watch it as a drama with moments of comic relief. The comments that sight the writing as a weak point are baffling to me, as are those that called Bill Murray under-used (his best performance in years), Gwyneth Paltrow's "Margot " pointless (her subtle cynicism and indifference is the most overt link to the themes of the film) and Ben Stiller disappointing (there is so much depth to his character... but you have to work for it, as it is all in the details). Anyway, to be disappointed in us for "calling" America's complacency and desire for more fast-food comedy is unfair. We want the bar raised and, while Jim Carrey ( a Canadian) has his place in comedy, there is more to intrigue, inspire and engage us out there. So for all of us who choose The Coen Brothers over The Farrelly Brothers, someone has to speak up and let people know that "America's funniest home videos" is not auteur film making! Just thought I should let you know that we're not all mindless snobs who just like anything with the word "art" attached to it for the sake of being poo-poo intellectuals. Take care.</fullReview>

The film was described as being darkly humorous and quirky. It was even nominated for an Oscar. So I sat down and started looking forward to smiling or laughing or at least being entertained in some way. I struggled on for forty minutes as the characters were introduced by the painful narrator. I couldn't stand it any more and had to stop watching but felt that I ought to persevere as things must surely improve. So I alternated between ten minutes of snooker and ten minutes of the film and managed to get to the end eventually. It was such a relief when the credits appeared and I knew I had to endure no more. I felt that not only was the family dysfunctional but the film was also. I know a lot of people thought it was wonderful but unfortunately this film didn't do anything for me.</fullReview>

Hackmann, Stiller and the great Anjelica are fantastic. She is really a queen. The cold and somehow dark humour have few equivalents except maybe Aki Kaurismaki the Finnish movie maker.The plot and world here is close to the world of early John Irving : eccentric families, tragedies and widowers, obsession about the kids'safety (Garp), dysfunctional fathers, weird pets, love between brothers and sisters (Hotel New Hampshire). I also feel the same tenderness for dysfunctional people (semi-freaks) you find in the works of Tim Burton.Even better than Steve Zissou.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film...possibly ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film should be hailed as one of the top-ten best ever. Its greatest assets rest in the untold and unexplained bits of the film and the tongue-in-cheek stabs at all of the characters, people (with the exception of Pagoda, The Butler) who have been taking themselves way too seriously for way too long and their discomfort around their father, a man who never took anyone seriously in his life, least of all himself.The subtle character development IS the story. Unlike most films, where the characters are boring and easily explained within two minutes, this film relies on the observer's knowledge of human nature, their empathy, and most of all, their willingness to explore a story that doesn't rely on a big, flashing red arrow pointing out each significant detail.I loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, to be fair, I can only review the first 45 minutes of this movie. That's because my friend and I walked out from boredom. While watching this film, I kept thinking to myself that I should be enjoying it. After all, it has a great cast and a goofy sensibility. But after the third time I checked my watch, it became obvious that the film was just plain bad. Once again the writers seemed to believe that since the characters were quirky and off-beat, that they didn't need a decent storyline.Do yourself a favor - skip this not funny comedy movie and rent a true gem like Danny Kaye's "The Court Jester." You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting, Great FILM !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyed this film and the great acting skills performed by all the great stars. The complete family was nuts and also quite normal at times and went to all kinds of extremes in showing the various personalities of each member of the Tenenbaums Family. Gene Hackman(Royal Tenenbaum),"Behind Enemy Lines",'01, was a very misunderstood dad who did everything possible to get the respect he needed as an up standing DAD! Angelica Huston,(Etheline Tenenbaum),"Daddy Day Care",'03,tried to be a faithful wife and seemed to get deeply involved with Danny Glover(Henry Sherman),"The Cook Out",'04 who was quite funny and very entertaining through out the entire film. Gwyneth Paltrow,(Margot Tenenbaum),"View From the Top",'03, looked very comical and had me laughing about her horrible habit of smoking and she never seemed to stop through out almost every scene. If you love these actors, you will see them perform very difficult roles with great professional skills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it in the theater years ago with my mother, and we expected it to be a comedy. Well, I didn't laugh or even smile once. Neither did my mother. And though the theater was full, I never heard one audience member laugh throughout the entire movie. Nor did we find anything else to like about it, other than it finally ended. Everyone in the theater walked out in silence.What was wrong with the movie? Basically, there was nothing right with the movie. The characters were repulsive, the direction was erratic, the storyline moved ever-so-slowly, and the performers behaved as if they were all on tranquilizers. Presumably the people who found laughs in it considered things like incest and dogs being crushed to death in car accidents hilarious.I am at a loss as to what the movie's apologists saw in it. If there was some sort of deep meaning in it that I missed, no matter. Nothing could possibly compel me to ever watch this wretched train wreck again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comedies of the year, quirky and definitely inventive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Anderson's third film The Royal Tenenbaums is the best film from him I've seen (though I haven't seen Bottle Rocket, it's an improvement over Rushmore for me). He and his co-writer/actor Owen Wilson have created a fictional group of characters that are and aren't like people you would usually know, in other words, it's realistic with both comedy and tragedy.Gene Hackman plays Royal Tenenbaum dead-pan as a sneaky, mostly low-down nasty yet also with a bit on conscience side he decides after not seeing his family for a number of years to come back to them with a scheme of having stomach cancer. His family includes his not exactly ex-wife (Angelica Houston) who is considering marrying her accountant (Danny Glover), his two sons played by Ben Stiller with accurate bitterness and the other played by Luke Wilson with accurate sorrow and inner-pain, and also his adopted daughter played by Gwyneth Paltrow who is secretly the apple of Wilson's eye. Other stars include Owen Wilson as a western writer who is into a lot of drugs and Bill Murray as Paltrow's empty husband.All of these characters come together (more or less) to create an engaging and really amusing dramedy, full of (possibly too full of) creative ideas for each character, in particular for Royal which gives Hackman a chance to give one of his best recent performances. This added with some interesting cinematography and writing (sometimes it's like watching a book on tape) plus the best soundtrack of the year make this a good watch any time. Soundtrack by the way includes The Ramones, The Clash, Paul Simon, The Rolling Stones, Elliot Smith and a cover of the Beatles. A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My essay titled What I Think About The Royal Tenenbaums (The Movie, not The Family).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched The Royal Tenenbaums I was with my dad and he doesn't really like movies like this, the kind that move quite slowly and not a whole lot happens but it's about a pretty neat group of people (I guess typical of whats that guys name?'s movies). So my dad and I are sitting on the couch watching Gwyneth Paltrow look miserable and smoke cigarettes and Ben Stiller be a funny dad and that guy from Seinfeld be another great character (and a dad, although not necessarily great), and I guess we both got bored so we turned it off. I didn't watch it again for a long time and never really thought that I was missing out on anything having never seen The Royal Tenenbaums in full.But then one day I rented it with a friend with equal "strange-movie" appreciation, and watched it the whole way through. I even laughed aloud at bits and pieces. The best part of the movie, the same as all the other movies by this guy, is how awesome the characters are: if I could remember more about them I would describe this in a little bit more detail. But it was a really great movie and now whenever people talk about how much a certain situation is like that one in The Royal Tenenbaums, I can join the conversation because I've seen the entire movie, start to finish.Written with love and respect by Megan, for piapet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who thinks this movie is boring or unfunny is...well, there are some anyway, they're a "tard." This is the best movie in the world. It has to be at least in the top ten best since the new millennium. When I worked at a movie theatre at the time, almost everyone walked away disappointed. This is the type of movie that gets better with more viewings. This film gives off so many different emotions: Life,Art,Love,Death, and the the feeling that any family can overcome their differences. Nothing in this movie seems unnatural and the characters seem so close to home. Since I'm not a writer,filling up a minimum of ten lines seems like a chore. I never liked Gwyneth Paltrow until this film. Even the movie poster is great. There are so many memorable lines in this movie "You sonof abitch," says the Indian man in pink, as he stabs Gene Hackman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything that was good in "Rushmore", transformed into something truly wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a weird year at the Oscars. They managed, to a greater degree than usual, to nominate the right films, but for the wrong awards. It's easy to look through the list of nominees and find five films more deserving of winning Best Picture than the five official candidates - even if you leave the foreign-language films out of consideration. "The Royal Tenenbaums" (deservedly nominated for its screenplay, otherwise neglected) is one of them. It also boasts subtler and finer art direction than the half-thought-through nominees for that award, and incomparably better cinematography (real widescreen! real Technicolor! - but that's only part of it: we see the characters related meaningfully to their world in every warm, gorgeous shot) than the five lacklustre nominees for THAT award, although to be fair, "The Man Who Wasn't There" was less lacklustre than the rest. But I won't go on.An "ensemble" film of the kind that's becoming all too popular these days, this one doesn't turn into a crossword puzzle: we know at the start how the characters relate to one another (there IS a surprising revelation, sort of, but it isn't there just to startle us; rather, it helps us make sense of what we already know), so we're free to sit back and enjoy the show - those of us who have normal pulses will have already fallen in love with most of the characters during the prologue, anyway. Part of the reason for this is their real and partly unpredictable intelligence. We can't distance ourself from the action (i.e., insulate ourselves from caring) with the smug thought that we're so much smarter than the bozos we're watching.The spoken third-person narration is tactfully handled, there when we need it, absent for long stretches when we don't. (I'll chant it again and again until I'm hoarse: in films, third-person narration, good; first-person, bad.) The colours are lovely. Simply speaking, "The Royal Tenenbaums" is pleasure. It's pleasant to look at, to listen to, to inhabit the world of. It neither insults our intelligence nor (except just once, in a scene which can be justified) present us with something gruesome that we'd rather not see. No wonder modern audiences didn't know what to make of it.P.S. One or two people have claimed that what we're seeing is a play which Margot wrote about her family. Luckily this theory is rubbish. It's a nice touch that we see sentences (and illustrations) from her later book, but these occur as "chapter" headings, not stage directions. My guess is that that book is an honest, private document, not intended for public viewing - and in the world of the fiction, which we do not inhabit, the book WAS private, unseen by ANY outside eyes. And the footage that makes up the meat and bulk of the film has nothing to do with the book (except inasmuch as the book is probably, with one or two trivial exceptions, accurate). What we see is what happens. Don't worry: this is a real film, not some flippant exercise in narrative confusion.P.P.S.: I don't mean to imply that the actual Best Picture candidates were entirely worthless. "A Beautiful Mind", "Gosford Park" and "In the Bedroom", little though there may be to say about any of them, no doubt deserved notice for their acting. "The Fellowship of the Ring" had decent make-up. "Moulin Rouge" had fine costumes, and it was nice to see Catherine Martin accepting an award, looking ten times sexier than any of the actresses she or anyone else had been payed to clothe. A weird night indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS (2001) ***1/2 Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Danny Glover, Seymour Cassel, Kumar Pallana , Grant Rosenmeyer, Jonah Meyerson, Stephen Lea Sheppard, Alec Baldwin (narrator). (Dir: Wes Anderson) Gifted filmmaker Wes Anderson re-teams with his childhood buddy Owen Wilson in telling the tale of a dysfunctional family of genius prodigies going to seed with odd ball affection. The Royal Tenenbaums (a play on words in the literal and metaphorical readings) consist of paterfamilias Royal (the wonderful Hackman, one of my all-time favorite actors who can never do wrong), a wily horrible father financier who is down on his luck and decides to re-enter the lives of his estranged progeny: Chas (Stiller), a financial genius who has suffered the recent death of his beloved wife and is now over-protectively obsessed with his children Ari and Uzi (Rosenmeyer and Meyerson respectively); Margot (Paltrow), the adopted daughter who became a child playwright and now in a loveless marriage to behavioral psychiatrist Raleigh St. Clair (Murray) who is trying to make a breakthrough with the problematic Dudley Heinsbergen (Sheppard); and Richie (Luke Wilson), the international tennis star who has suffered a nervous breakdown and quasi-incestuous desire for Margot.  Royal's half-baked deceit is faking the idea of having stomach cancer with only weeks to live and infiltrate his ex (Huston) Etheline's good graces but finds his work cut out for him when the children (except Richie) don't seem effected by his condition and the would-be suitor of Ehteline, Henry Sherman (Glover), her accountant. The ensemble of truly gifted actors is a wonder to behold and Anderson and Wilson's unique blend of absurdity and J.D. Salinger angst and anomie (the Tenenbaums are clearly a secondary cousin of his Glass family in literature) are funny and sad at the same time. Clearly Royal wants to make amends but his tactless ways are what makes him a display of how some people should not be parents. His outspokenness is only outweighed by his failures to connect with anyone including his kids and the manner he goes about them only puts his shortcomings in a garish light. Royal tries to even connect with his grandchildren in a montage of hilarity in thumbing their noses at authority. Hackman's nasty little chuckles of rue are full-fledged underscored irony and his boisterous manners a breath of fresh air. He's a riot undone. The ?kids' however have their own issues : despair, feeling alone and directionless, loveless, desire and finally an innate pain that each recognizes but can't contain a balm to tend to their self-inflected wounds. Stiller's bottled-up ire has often been in many of his past performances and only makes his Chas the one Tenenbaum who needs a hug; Paltrow's Margot is a self-pitying mope who wants love but can't figure out with who and Wilson's Richie is an old soul coming home to rest with no where else to go. Clearly all three representing generations past and present in the awkward stages of peaking at an early age and dwindling in the wind as the future doesn't look so bright. Owen Wilson's Eli Cash, the Tenenbaum's childhood buddy from across the street, is a hack Western novelist who too wants to be one of them so desperately he mails his press clippings to Etheline when he's not sleeping with Margot. Anderson, who is on a roll from his debut with "Bottle Rocket" to one of my faves "Rushmore" , has a way of making unlikable characters likable and their environs unique (New York has never felt so literal as it does here in a John Irving/Cheever kind of way) as well as a flair for costumes and production design. Even the jocular avuncular Baldwin narrating each ?chapter' headings beguiles the viewer. One of the year's best and funniest films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy to enjoy, but Anderson tackles too much material. **1/2 (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS / (2001) **1/2 (out of four)It's easy to enjoy a movie when we love all the actors involved, and "The Royal Tenenbaums" places charismatic, top-notch performers in even the smallest of roles. Perhaps this explains the film's overwhelming positive consensus-it's not so much of a good movie as it is a well-cast movie.In a role he was born to play, a very funny Gene Hackman stars as Royal Tenenbaum. He's the aging separated husband of Etheline (an eccentrically elegant Anjelica Huston) and the father of three previously successful children (Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Gwyneth Paltrow).Unfortunately, the kid's have lived dysfunctional lives since their parents separated 22 years ago. Now, Royal understands his mistake and wants his family back. But Etheline, currently in a relationship with her business manager (Danny Glover), wants no part of her ex-love. Royal concocts an excuse: he's dying and seeks redemption.Like all Anderson's films, this is a vivid character study. It includes some harshly funny, but also touches the grim realities of life. The story, by Anderson and Owen Wilson (who also acts in the film), gives the Tenenbaums plenty of dimension and heart. But there are so many characters to keep track of here, we are pulled in far too many directions.Few of these characters have much to do on screen. Gwyneth Paltrow, Owen Wilson, Billy Murray, Danny Glover, Luke Wilson, Seymour Cassel, and Ben Stiller all fight for our attention, while the relationship between Etheline and Royal takes center stage. We care about the later characters, so much that the others feel like intrusive. They certainly contribute to the unique style of the movie. But they quickly outstay their welcome, eventually becoming an intrusion. Speaking of relationships, "The Royal Tenenbaums" complicates itself with far too many. The various connections don't become overwhelming because Anderson knows who is who and who is with who and why, and he keeps the dialogue very casual. The film never loses it's sense of humor. Thus, as confusing as it is, "The Royal Tenenbaums" is always an easy movie to watch.Some of these relationships have great truth, but they are mixed within the jumble. Anderson tackles way too much material in a single film?and his talents with style and characters cancel each other out. We're left with a movie that juggles so many characters and so many emotions, that we don't know what to think. "The Royal Tenenbaums" is the third feature film by Wes Anderson, following "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore." I haven't liked any of his movies, but I admire his inspiration and acknowledge his talents. He's a fine filmmaker with refreshing style and a passionate vision, yet his work has yet to make a connection. I eagerly await the moment he learns to blend good filmmaking with good storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, this film has one stellar cast: Bill Murray, Gene Hackman, Owen Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson (Old School!), and Danny Glover. It also has the common villainess, Anjelica Huston. You'd think with this kind of ammo, it would be one hell of a film, right? Well, I'm not going to say it was necessarily bad. It's just the story didn't seem to have any real direction or zest enough to enthrall. Owen Wilson (also the writer for this piece) got a little too carried away and perhaps lost."The Royal Tenebaums" is a story about a dysfunctional family abandoned by their father. The father, years later, wants to try to make amends for what he'd done by reacquainting himself with his wife and children. This, of course, starts out miserably as the family has only hatred for their father.The children are a bit eccentric and their intelligence creates them as some sort of oddity. Ben Stiller plays Chas Tenebaum, a widowed genius who feels nothing but contempt for his dad. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Margot Tenebaum, a bizarre avante-garde playwright whose emptiness applies to her father as well. Luke Wilson plays Richie Tenebaum, a tennis pro who seems permanently stoned. Anjelica Huston plays Etheline Tenebaum and Gene Hackman plays her estranged husband, Royal Tenebaum. As the name suggests, the film is really about him. However, it also shows Royal through his children, their reactions, and own bizarre lives.But other than showing the inner workings of a disgruntled family and giving the convincing father-redemption bit, I was unsure why this movie was made. It throws you off a bit in the beginning and then ends with an emptiness of its own. The bizarre antics make it somewhat entertaining with fleeting bits of humor. But these are knocked off kilter by some of the shocking and almost morbid parts (e.g.: Richie Tenebaum's attempted suicide). I think Owen was trying to make the film as convincing as he could (tweaking things a bit here and there) and thought in the process that it would be a hit. The story is simple enough, about a father wanting to set things right towards his later years. Add a little bit comedy from "Meet the Parents" and a little far-fetchetyness (not a word but should be) and you get this film. I was semi-entertained, but ultimately, I felt abandoned. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Royal Tenenbaums" tells of a disenfranchised aging patriarch's (Hackman) attempt to reclaim his dysfunctional family of peculiar, self-absorbed, laconic, and idiosyncratic people. A meandering brut farce, the film sports an excellent cast and good technicals and art. However, it's peculiar nature is just enough off center to make any emotional buy-in impossible and just enough near center to make more than an occasional tongue in cheek unlikely. "TRT" is fodder for film buffs, dilettantes, and critics and will likely receive a lukewarm reception from the public at large. Just more proof that creative is not necessarily good. B-Note: I rented the DVD but couldn't find anyone else in my household to watch it. Caricatures are easy but portraits are difficult. This is a film of Caricatures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously, weird/dysfunctional/neurotic families always make for interesting movies, but "The Royal Tenenbaums" may have brought the genre to its zenith. Gene Hackman plays Royal Tenenbaum, the estranged patriarch. Mother Etheline (Anjelica Huston) continued raising sons Chas (Ben Stiller) and Richie (Luke Wilson) and daughter Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) on her own. Now, Chas has two sons, whom he is raising to be as neurotic as he is, Margot has hooked up with the pompous Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray), and Richie is a tennis player who deliberately lost a game (I got the feeling that he was obsessed with his sister). Meanwhile, Etheline has hooked up with the cultured Henry Sherman (Danny Glover). And there's something up with friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson).In the midst of this all, Royal finds a way to get the whole family back together: by telling everyone that he has an illness. Getting back together, the entire family is forced to reevaluate their relationships with each other and how they've been living and...look, I can't do justice to the movie by trying to describe it. It's a masterpiece. You have to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this and enjoying bits and pieces, I knew I had to see it again to see why critics give it five out of five stars. Basically rude, lying and unaffectionate Royal Tenembaum (Golden Globe winning Gene Hackman) has not seen his family in seven years ago, after wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston) chucked him out to raise the kids herself, and he lies saying that he is dying of cancer to see them. So he is reunited and making amends with everyone, his wife, and the kids: daughter Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and sons Chas (Ben Stiller) and Richie (Luke Wilson). Of course everyone was going to find out eventually, but everything is settled in the end, and by the end of the film, when Royal has genuinely passed away, everyone is remorseful. Narrated by Alec Baldwin, and also starring Owen Wilson (also writing with director and producer Wes Anderson) as Eli Cash, Bill Murray as Raleigh St. Clair, Danny Glover as Henry Sherman and Seymour Cassel as Dusty. All performances are fantastic, especially from Hackman, with a marvellous script this is a terrific comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay. Gwyneth Paltrow was number 89, and Gene Hackman number 42 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Hackman was also number 31 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 34 on Film 4's 50 Films You Must See Before You Die. Very good!</fullReview>
