		<shortDescription>Perfect narrative, thrilling documentary, wonderful music, pure emotion!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary is flawless, it's narrative perfect, it's thrilling, I could not imagine another way of depicting this awesome history. The soundtrack is great, the documentary flows in such a wonderful way, real drama, marvelous histories, some funny parts as well, it's life in it's beauty and it's true form.We get to know so many things about the formula 1 politics and internal struggles at that period.Memorable sentences from the documentary: Senna: -¨Formula 1 is too much money, too much politics¨Jean-Marie Balestre (FIA ex-President): -¨The best decision is my decision¨It's so exciting to see the rivalry between Alain Prost and Senna, possibly one of the greatest duels on the history of sports. There are few movies/documentaries that I would give a ¨11¨ out of 10 and this is one, together with amazing documentary Bus 174, from José Padilha (the director of Elite Squad).A documentary is good when is true to reality, and is awesome when is great to watch as ¨Senna¨ is, a perfect tribute to such a hero. The history of Senna is so inspiring, he is a true champion by all means, as a professional, and as a human being, that's way this is for sure a "must see movie".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just returned home from watching "Senna" and am struggling to recall a time I have ever been moved by a piece of film so much.What has been created is much more than just a documentary, it charts Ayrton's F1 career and gives the viewer an insight into the man, not just the public face we saw and loved so dearly on the TV. As a F1 fan I could be biased, but I believe this film will appeal to any film lover, it creates a sense of connection and understanding of the man, and unashamedly tears at your heart when the inevitable scene is played out, even though I knew it was coming I was fighting tears in the cinema, it brought back memories from all those years ago.It is some feat though for a film to leave you with such an overwhelming sense of optimism despite the tragedy, but nevertheless Asif has done this in my opinion, as Ayrton's humanity and personality are explored, as is the influence that this one man had on his homeland.I can't recommend this enough for motorsport fans, and anyone who loves film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly great documentary, regardless of your interest in racing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So first things first - the obligatory "you don't have to be a fan of Senna or even a fan of Formula 1 or even a fan of racing or even a fan of sports at all to enjoy this film" disclaimer. Maybe in the past you've been coerced by this sort of lead-on by a friend or significant other, only to suffer and moan. I asked my wife while leaving the Paramount Theater if she enjoyed the movie. My wonderful, accommodating, supportive wife, who has absolutely no interest in racing whatsoever (strike whatsoever - I think she might have an unhealthy and/or impure appreciation of Mark Webber and Jenson Button), responded, "How could you not?" From across the theater, my friend Eric, whose interest in sports essentially begins and ends with the University of Arkansas Razorbacks, hallowed be thy name, flashed two thumbs up, then pantomimed tears falling. Then two more thumbs up, so as not to end his review on an unmanly note.Ultimately my appreciation of Senna derives from the perspective of how it immortalizes Ayrton Senna, a god among men, as a human being. If you're disinclined to be all gung-ho about a documentary, I have some encouragement. Kapadia forgoes the typical talking head, television style interview with someone who knew Senna recounting their experiences and memories. Instead he lets the characters, primarily nemesis Alain Prost, McLaren team boss Ron Dennis and of course, Senna himself, tell the story, more or less chronologically, and in the moment. With hundreds of hours of footage available, from interview to candid behind the scenes to in-car, supplemented by more recent interviews specifically for the film, the narrative of Senna's rise to the pinnacle of the racing world is already extensively documented and well known, at least in a mythological sense. The drive and focus of that narrative then is a masterstroke of tireless research and judicious editing. Senna is undeniably a good film, full stop.Senna, as the protagonist in the drama, develops as thoroughly as a character in any of the best films you could name. One of the most controversial moments of his career, the infamous shunt with Alain Prost (our lead antagonist) at the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, is suddenly re-contextualized from its usual portrayal, with the background to color the incident (accurately, you could argue) as a righteous middle finger to the sport's governing body, and particularly its then demagogue of a master, Jean-Marie Balestre. In many circles, purists will cluck and bemoan the unsporting intent of Senna's defiance by charging for a gap and holding a line that would likely, and in fact did, retire both drivers from the race. The crash brought cheers from the audience in the theater. Senna went on to clinch the championship. Unsportsmanlike or the very illustration of competitive purity? There's room to argue but the context underlying the whole ordeal is undeniable. My favorite sequence, and the one that honestly caused something to get in my eye, was the 1991 Brazil Grand Prix. Piloting a broken car, but having never won in his home country, Senna drove an impossible drive to cling to his victory. If the story ended here, it would be Roy Hobbs slamming the ball into the lights. Senna winning in Brazil exemplifies my theory that athletic competition can be art, or at least artistic. Senna's drive was a pure expression of the human spirit, and it is beautiful to behold. Seriously, truthfully beautiful. If you could package this segment of the film, a model of Michelangelo's David and maybe a recording of Mingus Ah Um, and send it all into space for aliens to understand what humanity is and is capable of, you wouldn't be doing the universe a disservice. Watching the footage of him on the winners' podium in sheer agony, try and fail, then try again to hoist his trophy over his head, and knowing that he wasn't doing so out of a need to satisfy his ego, but to salute his country and its citizens - it's moving. But this is all a bit like the Titanic, isn't it? Most racing fans know what happened to Ayrton Senna on May 1, 1994. We know every race, every victory, brings us closer to The Monster at the End of This Book. Few serious accidents are shown in the film. Only the outcome of Martin Donnelly's career ending but amazingly not fatal 1990 crash is shown, his broken body lying motionless on the circuit. It's a nauseatingly frank shot. Rubens Barrichello's airborne shunt during practice at Imola in '94 that ranks in the majority of morbid but somehow requite top 10 crashes of all time lists. Roland Ratzenberger's fatal crash at qualifying for the same race. And finally Senna. It's jarring, even when you know it's coming.Throughout the film are shots of Niki Lauda. Although he's never named either in narration or by subtitle, the burn scarred face of the three-time world champion, and still competitive driver at the time, is a frequent, looming reminder of the supposedly bygone age when the life expectancy of F1 drivers was not the job's mot vital selling point. But in the "modern" era, no one expected the greatest driver possibly in the history of the sport could be snuffed with so little effort on the part of the universe. It was tragic and will always be tragic, like the last man to die in the battle before a truce is called, but that doesn't make it senseless. If the Spirit of Racing Future floated down to Senna and handed him a signed declaration of his impending death, he'd likely have strapped into his wobbly Williams and tempted the Almighty's resolve. Because that loving, thankful, but nonetheless defiant middle finger to the institution he loved so much, whether we're talking racing or God, defined him as a human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Senna a must-seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know much about Senna, before watching this documentary. Just obvious things: great rider who died young in a F1 accident. Topics, nothing more. When I started to watch "Senna", I was surprised by the eyes of a rider who seemed nearly shy in the interviews, but fiercely strong and daring on the truck. His face was a canvas where his soul sketched the mixed feelings that were born as he and life slowly sprang up. You see Senna as a true consistent human being, who debated between what he loved - racing, his country- and what was surrounding him and , sadly, growing up -Brasil's poverty, politics infesting F1, too much engineering against pilot's talent.. This is a must-seen documentary. A must-seen film indeed. Traces of archive footage that let you be a little closer of a great man who loved and lived for a passion, who had errors and fought against them, and who taught us a great lesson of attitude and coherence.

		<fullReview>Throughout the movie, you start to see how Senna is much more than a racing driver. senna's passion for his country and his fans are second to none. The movies well balanced makes. for a truly entertaining movie. The sadness surrounding senna's is subtle and delicatly done. Nobody comes out bad in this movie. The director has not used any cgi or any reconstructions. The material is completely archived and well put together. The movie won an award last year for documentary of the year, which is truly deserved. On the big screen the onboard cameras add tension and gives a true sensation of speed. I love this film as it suits all f1 and none f1 fans. Senna was loved and ,admired all over the world. This is evident as the movie progresses. Truly magnificent film and well worth seeing. All thats for me to say is go see it.... ENJOY!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I have to say I'm an F1 fan, so take whatever You want from that. Senna has to be the best documentary ever made, It simply tells the story of the great man trough, Mostly. old TV footage. This brings back memory s of late night highlight shows of a race that happened hours before. Its Shocking to see the total unfairness of the sport at that time, Its trilling to see the racing. Its so sad to see senna's Last lap at Imola. Overall It's a peek into the life of one of the worlds greatest sportsmen, a wort's and all account of a good, but sometimes, flawed man. If for no other reason than seeing how well the old footage is spliced back together, Go and see Senna, You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seventeen years after the passing of one of the greatest Formula 1 racing drivers of all time a documentary has been released that examines his ten-year career in the sport. Directed by Asif Kapadia ('Far North,' 'The Warrior') and produced by Universal and Working Title, 'Senna' shows the audience the untapped potential and brilliance of the Formula 1 driver Ayrton Senna, while also examining the rise of this shy, young Brazillian boy; from go-karting circuits to a televisual audience of millions. 'Senna' is as moving and touching, as it is interesting and captivating.Born Ayrton Senna da Silva to wealthy middle-class parents in the Santana district of Sao Paulo, he always had a dream of becoming a racing driver and began by driving in the Karting World Championships until he was approached to join Formula 3 for the 1983 season and then Formula 1 for the following season. From his first controversial podium finish in the Monaco in Grand Prix in 1984, two things were born; an intense rivalry with the future French Formula 1 champion (and soon to be team-mate) Alain Prost and a desire to race, dominate and win which would see Senna not only claim three World Championships, but also lose his own life on the track.Where Kapadia's 'Senna' documentary works is in its ability to appeal to wide array of audience members. For the fans of the Formula 1 racing there is a copious amount of footage documenting select races and the events taking place around his career. Rather than use cutaway segments to show various celebrities and sports men and women discuss their memories and recollections of Senna, Kapadia instead utilises a voice-over to accompany the archive images on-screen. By allowing the voice-over of the various people associated with Senna (most notable this consists of McLaren's team principal Ron Dennis, his mother, father and sister, F1 team Doctor Sid Watkins, and Brazilian commentator Reginaldo Leme) to supplement the footage, it both preserves he power of the on-screen image and provides the audience with additional information regarding the situation or event that is being presented.While for the casual viewer who may only know of Ayrton Senna in passing, there is the psychological unravelling of a man trapped in a boy's body. Senna is shown not to be ignorant of the politics of Formula 1, but simply uninterested, he was always that middle-class boy from Brazil who only wanted to race, win and repeat. There is also an interesting inclusion of footage of Senna as a modern hero of the Brazilian people, he's shown as the racing driver who transcended the social and political problems of a nation on the edge of poverty and economic instability and provided them with ray of light and joy that was unfortunately extinguished on the 1st of May 1994. 'Senna' is a brilliant and moving examination of a rising sporting star caught up in the whirlwind of politics, rivalries and stardom, when all he wanted to do was race and win by any means necessary, not for the adulation of millions, but his love for sport so close to his heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Remarkable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been a Fan of Ayrton when I was a child. I distinctly remember watching the F1 highlights with my dad. My dad was a seasonal fanatic of sports and kept updating me with the news from the papers/sports magazines and the television. To relive the moments of Ayrton (the idol) in this emotionally gripping documentary was unbelievably comforting. The script and flow of the events were so flawlessly presented taking one's memory into the Time travel of decade gone by. It was nothing short of Excellence in execution. The documentary dissects Ayton's persona in a subtle way, making it the most compelling Biography of all times. The back-ground score by Antonio Pinto was Enthralling and Sensual delight. This is not to be missed, sad that I had been to the cinema only on the final day when it was shown-much regret the delay. Nevertheless, Its a true Masterpiece which portrays the subtle sadness of a legend's demise in a sweet throat stifling moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exotic Tale of a Truly Unfathomable Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People could be forgiven for not remembering Ayrton Senna De'Silva. Almost 20 years after his death, the true intricacies that embroiled his career and personal life have yet to be unraveled, however this movie does a hell of a job connecting the two in perfect harmony. A bitter sweet taste is left in the mouth of the viewer as they watch a film with subtle undertones of competitiveness and strong hues of emotion. A soulful film, you really find yourself unraveling the charisma and Jues De Vivre that is Senna. From the offset of the movie you find yourself in a somewhat cheerful, unknowing state, as it lightly unravels his early career in Formula 1, whilst hinting at the precursors that led him there. The hard, pressing, and very tight competition of him against Proust is another aspect that the viewer will find to be nail biting, as you truly begin to see the emotional aspect of Senna open at this point. Thus, the ending could come to a heartbreak to someone who had never heard of Senna. But alas, the legacy that lasts, transcends all documentaries, and all books. For the truly afflicted car/racing fan such as myself, you feel torn, and yet very motivated to be the best you can be. To the regular viewer, you feel emotionally attached to a man who affected the lives of millions positively in his home country of Brazil. A perfect mix of a movie, in which you can watch as either an auto-racing fan, or someone who has never heard of Senna; It delivers on a highly emotional level, surrounding you in the warmth that he brought to many.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My local cinema is only small, it only has two screens and consequently, to make money, they have to show a lot of mainstream films. Most of these don't interest me too much and I sometimes despair that they will ever show anything like this. So you can imagine my surprise when the weekly email I receive from them listing the upcoming films included this little gem. I've had it on 'The List' (that's my 'To See' list for those that don't know) for some time and always thought I'd end up seeing it on TV. But no, the Picture House are showing it! Admittedly it's only for two screenings, but they're actually showing a film I never thought I'd see on the big screen.Two of us went to the first screening; myself, a Formula One fan for many years and my buddy Dave, who isn't into Formula One but is a bit of a connoisseur of film. He had heard about this one and was interested to give it the once over. The film tells the story of the Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna from his early days in carting through his rise to fame and fortune in Formula One to his untimely death in an accident in 1994. We are told about the feud he had with fellow driver, Alain Prost, and the battles they had both on and off the track. How he dealt with the politics of the sport and how he became a huge star, giving hope to millions, back home in Brasil. And also the thoughts of those involved in his life and career.I love the way this film was put together, there is no commentary and no interviews with people made after the fact. It's all archive footage and interviews, mostly with Senna himself, that tells the story. As has been said many time before, real life can be so much better than fiction and this story has so much drama and emotion in it I firmly believe, in this case at least, it's true. The section of the film concerning his death I remember watching events unfold live on TV very well. It was the blackest day on Formula One history and I don't think I'll ever forget it. In the film it is very emotional and even Dave admitted to shedding a manly tear at one point.To many, Ayrton Senna was the greatest driver ever to race in Formula One. I'll admit that I wasn't his greatest fan when he raced; I wanted the British drivers to win (of course). I always admired his talent though, and now I know more about him I am inclined to think that, yes, he was one of the greatest. This is a truly remarkable film and one I can highly recommend to fans of the sport and those that don't follow it. It's a remarkable story and one I'm sure you will find yourself thinking about for a long time afterwards.My Score: 9.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cross between action movie and documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having no definite release date in my country I've decided to import the Bluray directly from Japan when it was released on Senna's birthday, it turns out that it doesn't matter whether I watch it at home first, I definitely wouldn't miss the chance to watch it on the big screen again. The visual impact on the viewers cannot be substituted unless you have a mini-cinema installed at your home. It is as amazing as this!For anyone following Formula 1, Senna is more than a household name, it's an equal sign! The story told won't be anything new to the fans yet for those who doesn't know the Man, you'll be in love with him by the end of it.The movie itself captivate the viewers by the smooth flow of the movie, every moment is gripping, attention to details can be felt everywhere. Without spoiling the movie itself, personally I think some of the clips appeared in the end credit should be included in the movie itself as it helps to solidify the Man's character.The reason for the vote from reaching a 10/10 is that the length of this documentary/movie is too short. You cannot get enough of the Man, as in real life, sadly...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional roller-coaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while, upon visiting the cinema, you experience a movie like no other. A movie which leaves on the edge of your seat, leaving you with the most extreme of emotions, ending with a fitting climax and warranting a tissue or two. "Senna" does just that armed only with hours of archive footage, a magnificent soundtrack and a compelling tale of triumph and despair.Admittedly, I'm obsessed with Formula 1, so I naturally made it my priority to go and see this film, a priority requiring me to go to a cinema on the far side of the country. I was aware of the major success that this movie was, but I needed to see it for myself to believe. I wasn't disappointed. It was absolutely incredible! The first 5 minutes warrant patience as the movie kicks into gear, but from there on in it is a piece of cinematic genius.The array of unseen footage included in the film was a huge surprise for me, and is seriously useful for unraveling the enigma that is Ayrton Senna throughout the movie. It really focuses on his intense rivalry with Alain Prost throughout the movie. It was the defining rivalry of their era, as the greatest drivers of their generation went toe to toe for supremacy within the McLaren team. It also brings to light the unseen element of Senna, the devout Christian, the man who felt a deep humanitarian responsibility to his native people in Brazil. In the midst of an unfair regime and national poverty, Senna was a glimmer of hope to all.When the clips of May 1 1994 were echoed around the cinema, I could fell the build-up of tears in my eyes, and as it showed Alain Prost holding Senna's helmet at the funeral, and the streets lined by thousands upon thousands upon thousands to try and get a glimpse of their godly sporting superstar, it was all too much. As the credits rolled, so did the outburst of emotion. Not only is this film recommendable for anybody with a burning passion for motor sport, but for anybody with the slightest bit of compassion, anybody who has a soul and anybody who possesses life. It is truly incredible....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was concerned it wouldn't live up to the hype- and was happily proved wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As somebody who was 4 months short of my 9th birthday when I saw the news update reporting Senna's death, I had been waiting years for a movie to be made about his life. My growing years were spent regretting that I didn't follow the great mans' career for longer, and so I made up for lost time after his death accumulating as much information on his F1 dynasty (and his life outside F1) as I could. It got to that point where you feel as if you know/ knew somebody very well, despite never meeting them.When I heard that a movie was being made about Senna, I couldn't wait, but at the same time I worried that it may not do his life justice. Having seen the movie at last, it's definitely one to watch, even if you don't follow motorsport. The editing is sharp enough to keep even the most casual viewer interested, which is all the more impressive considering 'Senna' is made up entirely of archival footage.The movie is an emotional roller-coaster from start to finish, however the only time I felt close to shedding tears was when he finally won the Brazilian Grand Prix. It's a pity they didn't mention it in the film, but only a few hundred metres after crossing the finish line, his gearbox conked out and the car coasted to a halt. That's how close it was. It was truly meant to be the day he won, and you would be hard pressed not to get caught up in the enormity of the moment, even if (like me) you had seen it plenty of times before.To that final weekend at Imola, and although I had seen much of the footage a number of times before, for the first time I had the feeling of actually being there and living through the events taking place. Strangely, I found Ratzenberger's death more harrowing than Senna's. Perhaps it was because I have seen Senna's death and events before/ after it many times on TV or youtube, but for the first time, Ratzenberger is presented as more than just that other guy who was killed the day before Senna, and instead as an actual person, taking part in a sport he loved and doing the best he could in an inferior car.I give this movie 9/10. It misses a mark for some minor details that would only interest a hardcore F1 buff like myself: - Virtually no mention/ vox pops of Mansell (a great rival of Senna's on the circuit, he was Prosts' Ferrari team-mate in 1990 and in his autobiography called him "the lowest human being I have ever met". This would have given a more balanced view of Prost and shown that it was not just Senna and his fans who were disdainful of Prost. Berger (Senna's team-mate after Prost and a close friend) and Murray Walker (for so long the voice of Formula 1) would have been welcome inclusions as well.- The dates are occasionally wrong (e.g, the 1991 Brazilian Grand Prix was on the 24th of March and not the 21st, which incidentally was Ayrton's 31st birthday). Another incorrect detail is when on-board footage of Senna qualifying in the 1990 McLaren at Monaco is shown, while the caption claims it is from the 1988 race. Occasionally, the engine note doesn't match the in-car footage, and has clearly been lifted from other footage. These are tiny details, but considering the effort that went into the rest of the documentary, it's a shame they didn't clean those bits up.- Surely time could have been found in the film to include Senna's battle with Mansell at Monaco in '92 and his masterful wet weather display at Donington in '93? And although footage of Senna racing to the aid of Comas's wrecked Ligier features in the end credits, it would have been great to have included it in the actual feature itself, linking it with Donnelly's accident to emphasize the concern Ayrton had for the welfare of the other drivers.Those are my only reasons for not giving this film a perfect 10, and they are only minor reasons admittedly. I am already looking forward to seeing this movie again. If you haven't seen 'Senna' yet, watch it as soon as you get the chance. One of those inspirational films that stays in your head after you see it, leaves an impact, and then leaves an even bigger impact when you remember that everything you saw really did happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just come back from the cinema, which had, at a rough estimate, 150 people watching this film. This is quite amazing, since the last time I shared that screen with so many people was the Star Trek reboot in the first week after opening! For a documentary, this seems to be very popular.First of all, a disclaimer - I'm a died-in-the-wool petrolhead, and have been since before Senna entered F1. It was, therefore, with some trepidation that I went to see this documentary, because I wondered what liberties might have been taken with history in order to paint a picture of Senna, and, by implication, the sport. I'm pleased to say that I was not disappointed - this film captured many of my memories of the time very well.My biggest criticism is that the film is too short - a few more minutes would have painted a different picture of Senna's relationship with other drivers. Sure, the focus on the Senna/Prost battle is understandable, but some time spent showing how they reconciled after Prost resigned would have been nice. Also, the fact that Senna's humanity, amply demonstrated with regard to the people of his country, could have been underlined with regard to his fellow drivers by giving some time to the (briefly seen in the end credits) incident where he stopped his car on the track and ran back to assist Eric Comas following an accident at Spa in 1992.Perhaps the film is a little harsh on Alain Prost, but, as I wrote earlier, this documentary captures my memories well. Prost was a difficult driver to like, because he was always so calculating (I have the same opinion of Michael Schumacher - I don't want cold-blooded winners, I want ones where I am not sure what is going to happen), but was he really as bad as painted here? I'm not sure.This film is very accessible - there were a lot of people in the cinema who were probably not alive when Senna died, and they seemed to be as affected by the drama as I was. The accidents that took the lives of Ratzenberger and Senna in the same weekend are truly horrifying on the big screen - and I remember seeing them when they happened - and I was not the only one dabbing at my eyes after each one.To cut a long story short - I hope the DVD has a "director's cut", with a lot more about a man who could have done so much had he lived longer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film's style is as sublime as its protagonist, but that perhaps is its flaw.The film is more a piece of reverence for a man who attempted and accomplished, sublime performance, perhaps even something greater. This is where the director wants our minds, and he's not wrong for that, but then the film is more about him and his idea, than about Senna.I read up on Senna after seeing the film and while nothing shockingly contradictory was revealed, some of the human nuances that would have rounded out his character were left out of this narrative. Instead, all the story's conflict is external, and he, the victim.In truth, he did bring many problems on himself. He was a fierce competitor. There is no blame here, but the film just didn't show a flaw in the man, which we all know is unrealistic.It also romanticized the idea that because he was Brazilian, he had hardships making his way in the European-centric formula 1 world. Brazil, in fact, had many great drivers before Senna. Therefore, it was more convenient to twist things this way to the director's fantasy of life, than painting a more complex and flawed man in Senna.Without these issues, I would have voted 10.Still, beautiful film, beautiful human being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No where near as good as it should have been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a very keen motor racing fan who saw most of A. Senna's F1 races, (including the race where his car crashed at Imola as a result of a serious mechanical failure), I thought the film was very understated and did not do sufficient justice to one of the most outstanding motor racing drivers of the post WW2 era. I have seen the DVD with the narrated commentary by the makers of the film. It explains why they chose the scenes they did and offers a great deal of explanation of events but none of this information was included in the film. It assumed audiences already knew quite a bit about this man.The problems with the movie included:1. Very minimal narration which left audiences trying to grasp what was really happening at times and lost the opportunity to tell the audience a much richer and more complete story.2. An appearance in the film that he jumped from go-cart racing straight into F1. No one does that and he didn't either. He was driving Formula Fords and then Formula 3 cars successfully over a period of 3 years before progressing to F1.2. Very, very poor descriptions of the man's amazing results in just 10 full years in F1 including 4 of those years in second rate cars. (see below).3. Poor reflections of just how he managed - by pure talent - to consistently out drive his competitors so convincingly with only minimal evidence of just how talented he was. There was no reason why the film should have been limited to only 100 minutes when another 10 minutes of footage could have shown and added so much more.4. Insufficient descriptions of just how committed he was to the safety and well being of other drivers. During the end credits you see a film of a driver stop and jump out of his car during practice and put his own life in danger to sprint back down the track (in the face of other cars) to the aid of another driver that had crashed and was sitting injured in his car across the track. This should have been part of the movie, explained and highlighted because it showed what a magnificent human being that driver was. It was Senna of course. They don't make them like that anymore - at least not in F1.5. There were massive investigations following the Senna crash at Imola, not to mention court cases but none of this was mentioned in the film. It was clearly established that a major mechanical failure in the car (steering column) had caused the crash leaving Senna a passenger in a car racing at 330 km per hour. None of this was covered in the film (other than one minor speculative comment) leaving audiences (who did not know) wondering what had really gone wrong.I could go on but I won't. The film underwhelmed me and is found wanting. It could have been just so much better and so much more emotional and heart breaking. A great deal of improvement could have been made with much more factual narration which would not have even added to run time. The man's achievements at death were amazing but these were never shown to the audience. Here they are and the list is indicative of what a great race driver and champion this guy was:A. Senna held and in most of cases below still holds the following Formula One records: - Most wins leading the entire race... 19 - Most consecutive pole positions... 8 consecutive pole positions- Most consecutive starts from front row... 24 - Most consecutive wins at the same Grand Prix... 5 wins in a row at the Monaco Grand Prix (1989 Monaco Grand Prix?1993 Monaco Grand Prix) - Most consecutive pole positions at the same Grand Prix... 7 pole positions in a row at the San Marino Grand Prix (1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991)- Most pole positions at the same Grand Prix... 8 pole positions at the San Marino Grand Prix (1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1994)- Starts from front row in every race of a season... 16 out of 16 front row starts in 1989- Most seasons leading the pole-position statistics... 6 (in 1985,1986, 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991)A. Senna also held the following records at the time of his death:- Most pole positions... 65- Most laps led ...2,982 -Longest distance led... 13,672 km - Most GPs led... 86 - Most Doubles (pole and win, same GP race)... 29- Most Front Row starts... 87 - Youngest triple world champion... 31 years,227 days - Youngest driver to score a Grand Slam (pole, win, fastest lap, led every lap) ...25 years, 31 days</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A must see for formula 1 and motor-sport fans. Formula 1 used to be different from what we see today and, in addition to this unique insight into Ayrton's life, it also brings a lot of F1's skeletons out of the closet.I have never watched a documentary so moving. Right from the brilliant on-board footage of the racing cars to very real narrative by Ayrton himself.Brilliant work. The entire film is made with archived footage, most of which is very rare. The filmmakers do a great job of bringing some of the key characters in F1, and in Ayrton's personal life to the forefront.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this was an extremely emotional film. At the age of 10, Senna was my idol, and I was fortunate enough to be there to see him take his final victory. Reliving those moments on the big screen was a truly exhilarating (and tear-jerking) experience.I have consumed volumes of Senna-related material over the years, so to say that this film adds something substantive means a lot. Of course, the stories themselves won't be new to a lot of motor racing fans, but there is something delicious and comforting in the retelling of a beautiful fable. And the film makers are to be congratulated for paring a complex story down to its dramatic essentials, while maintaining the necessary context and without reducing it to a Hollywood narrative. They certainly did a much better job of conveying what Senna was to my girlfriend than I could ever do. The fact that she thoroughly enjoyed the film - and came out of it with a good understanding of many of the nuances of Senna's life - despite being ardently anti-racing speaks volumes.If I have any criticism, it is the lack of audio/visual sync up in many of the onboard shots. And in one shot there are audible gear changes when Senna is supposedly stuck in sixth gear. For the casual viewer these count for little, but for a racing connoisseur these mistakes are like nails on a chalkboard. It's hard to believe that the film was previewed by anyone with a deep understanding of motor sport. One could also criticize the film for telling only one side of a complex history (Senna's), but given the film's scope that is no fault at all in my opinion.All in all, this is a beautiful documentary. It is well-paced, with a perfect running time and wonderful score. I highly recommend it, to racing fans and film fans alike.</fullReview>

You see him with his family and his fellow drivers. you hear him talk about what drives him, and what makes him go that one step further than anyone else was brave enough (or good enough?) to take. The staggering events of the fateful weekend are shown simply and quietly. A fitting way to show a loss that affected millions around the world. Watch it.

		<fullReview>I knew absolutely nothing about Grand Prix racing when I went to see this. But it blew me away. It was absolutely brilliant, probably the best film of the year so far. And these are my reasons why.First of all, the way it was made was amazing. The film has no new footage at all; it is entirely made up of 100% archive material. It is amazing how they pulled off such a feat, and it really added to the film's unique feel. You're essentially seeing everything described in the documentary as it happened. It really does add a lot of emotion to it. The ending is extremely powerful. It shows Senna's crash, and what follows is a really emotional montage of the distress and sorrow it caused in Brazil. I have to admit, I was holding back tears.Overall, this was a truly brilliant film, and probably the best of the year hands down. I give it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a F1 fan but this documentary captured me emotionally. It was an awesome experience.What makes the film so great is that its more than about racing, its about Ayrton Senna and his intensity and drive. His courage is truly admirable and his skill as is evident from the footage is almost mythical.We follow Senna through his life very closely. Everything in the documentary is focused on Senna. There's very little cuts to show interviewees talking, mostly its just their voice in the background and the camera will be showing footage of Senna or from Senna's perspectives. Its makes for a very engrossing movie, you feel like you are living through Senna's life, bit by bit, and understanding his troubles, his competition, his interest, his dreams and his happiness.In the start of the film, we see the competition between Senna and another great driver Prost, and this is captured magnificently. But as the film progresses, the thing that makes this film so great is that we begin to realise that the real obstacle, the real competitor, that these young men faced were the cars and the race itself. Despite knowing the dangers involved, the drivers still race and we admire them for this.My heart was beating loudly in the final sequences of the film (you'll know what I mean). The onboard cockpit views shows the legendary speed with which Senna tackled the road. Its truly amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life At The Limit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A documentary about Brazilian Formula One motor racing triple world champion Ayrton Senna Da Silva, cited by many as the greatest driver of all time, who died tragically aged thirty-four in a crash at the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola in 1994.I'm a Formula One fan, and while there have been many truly outstanding drivers in this incredible sport it is no exaggeration to say that perhaps none have been as talented, fast, intense, intelligent and enigmatic as the great Ayrton Senna. This outstanding film gives an insightful window into his world, wisely choosing to use only authentic footage from his life and career combined with some voice-over work, but no talking heads or cutaways to distract us from the drama. With a symphonic score, it somehow plays more like a drama than a documentary, albeit one populated with real people and events, as we see Senna's struggle for recognition, his defining moments, his often bitter rivalry with the brilliant French driver Prost (whose style was the polar opposite), his frequent abuse by the authorities who didn't like him, and the terrible events at Imola, which also claimed the life of Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger. That Senna was an incredible racer is in no doubt, but he was also an extraordinary personality; he was a forthright ambassador for his country and helped enormously with its social problems, he was a deeply religious and philosophical man, and he seemed to be constantly chasing perfection in everything he did. Comparing anyone to Christ is fairly ridiculous, but Senna is one of the few where the analogy is legitimate - unlike almost all sporting heroes who strive for personal glory, it has always seemed to me Senna was carrying the weight and expectations of others; his fans, his country, his team, the money men. It's as if we were all saying, come on Senna, show us the magic, push it further and faster than anyone else dares. Which he did, and which never backed down from until he paid the ultimate price, to our irrevocable loss. His search was for a kind of spiritual truth in speed, and his accomplishments speak for themselves. He was simply an extraordinary man. A great film by Kapadia, the director of The Warrior, The Return and Far North, produced by Working Title and distributed by Universal Pictures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You don't have to be a fan of auto racing to appreciate and enjoy the film "Senna". From the start of the film to it's historical tragic ending...you are pulled into the world of open wheel racing and the life of legendary Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna.Some people are born to do one thing and in Ayrton Senna's life he chased the dream of being the best driver of the world, welcomed the controversy and challenges that comes and welcomed the burden and responsibility with being as important to his country as anyone had ever been in Brazil's history.Through it all, you are pulled towards the energy and confidence Senna exuded as a race car driver, you feel his passion, at times you bristle at his brash demeanor towards his racing peers but you understand and marvel at Senna the whole time. He made every car he drove better, he made every team better whom he drove for and ultimately he became the driver that everyone else wished they could be.A perspective that this film also shows is the razor edge nature of the drivers respecting the sport and the ever changing political climate that seems to be a constant shadow of Formula One racing. No driver was ever in control, no team owner was going to get an edge.In Senna's case, it was apparent that his success would always be envied by those who had more...yet he was the driver that everyone wanted at any price...his excellence as a driver was always on display...the glamor of being the best ever never seemed to phase him.In the end, the film humanizes Senna to the audience and to himself...you see his mortality on trial, he knew he loved racing, he knew he could win with any car on any track under any conditions and ultimately he knew it could all go away within seconds...Senna's impact to his sport will forever be footnoted. His impact to the people of Brazil will be timeless...Ayrton Senna was Brazil's first son.This film is a masterpiece...it's human, heartwarming, touching, poignant and tragic...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a movie! What a driver! What a sad sad ending! I never truly appreciated Senna the way I should have done. In those days I was in the Mansell camp wishing that Senna would stop being so hard to beat and that he and Prost would keep knocking one another out of races. Saying that I also supported Borg when McEnroe was spouting his mouth off in the early 80s and now I appreciate what he did for the game! Obviously with documentaries like this the temptation is to take everything literally. Was Senna treated with the contempt that is portrayed in the movie? Were the thoughts of Senna truly translated when people make claims of how he felt at certain times? All I know is that he is a man who should be remembered as the greatest! Its what these men can do when the cars are not the best..... and with exception to a few successful years with McLaren he didn't have the best (or even close to the best).Left me in tears as a true genius was taken away from us.

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the greatest biographical documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Senna is often remembered as the greatest racing driver of all times, not only in Formula1 but in Motorsports. However, not a lot of people know about his life or even his racing, which ended in 1994. These days, one would just look at his records and/or some YouTube footage of his races to gain an insight on the man. Even I belong in this category. I never got to see any of Senna's race on TV. I looked at his records and never understood why he was often called the greatest racing driver who ever lived. Well, now I do. This movie shows why he is one of the greatest racing drivers of all times. This is a beautiful movie. It is mostly a documentary and consists of a lot of racing footage and interviews by Senna and several other people in F1 during his time. There is good amount soundtrack throughout it though which gives it more of a movie feel than a documentary. It is also the best documentary I have ever watched. The more you watch it, the more you gain perspective towards life of a man who was truly a legend. Don't dismiss this even if you are not into F1 or Motorsports. I think the beginning 20 minutes maybe hard to follow for someone who isn't into racing but it's mostly the event in Senna's life, his attitude and his intensity that make this documentary so interesting. The movie is very intense and almost left me in tears at the end (rarely happens with a documentary). Also, this movie has quickly become very popular among racing fans all over the world. If you follow F1, like me, then you will hear many references to Senna and this movie every now and then so it's almost a necessity to watch this. Overall, a great documentary and I could watch this in a movie theater if they play.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Senna tells the tragic tale of Ayrton Senna. Often considered the greatest F1 driver of his generation, Senna was successful at his chosen sport, as well as raising the profile thanks to media coverage. This documentary is compiled of only archive footage with voice overs from those involved. This successfully captures the time period. Kapadia, manages to compile the footage so that he actually tells a fairly straight forward narrative.This makes it exciting, even for those with no interest in the sport. He has the rise and fall, conflict, and an antagonist in Prost. What he doesn't do is vilify Prost, nor does he make Senna out to be some kind of saint. Prost's frustration is completely understandable, as Senna begins to make a few too many risks. The film builds to its obvious emotional climax, but some how avoids being completely predictable. Informative, passionate, and entertaining, this does more than a documentary needs to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a great fan of Formula One motor racing and wasn't intimately aware of the life and times of the late Ayrton Senna but I've always admired sporting geniuses with a touch of the maverick about them (think George Best, Alex Higgins, Seve Ballesteros, Muhammad Ali and others) and after seeing this rivetingly exciting documentary, would certainly grant the same status to Senna.Concentrating almost entirely on his Formula One years, with only a brief introduction to his beginnings as the go-kart crazy child to well-off parents in the almost otherwise universally poor country of Brazil, we chart his speedy rise through the ranks until he reaches the pinnacle of his success with three World Championship successes at the end of the 80's and early 90's where he frequently clashed with the racing authorities and some of his sporting rivals , particularly his nemesis, the French "professor" Alain Prost. Theirs indeed was one of the great sporting rivalries like Ali/Frazier or Borg/McEnroe where opposites (in terms of temperament) repelled.Senna's career was very much in the spotlight right from the start and while we get to see many of his greatest races demonstrating aptly his singular talent on the track, it's arguably even more interesting to see a little behind the man, particularly his concern for driver safety on the circuit, his massive popularity in his native Brazil and his closeness to his family, although we get only glimpses of his relationships with the women in his life. Told in chronological order, the film naturally ends in graphic tragedy at the 1993 San Marino grand-prix, ironically the day after another young driver died in a crash in practice.The movie makes a virtue of not using a narrative voice-over, using instead commentaries both contemporary and retrospective by those who knew him at work and at play, together with many interviews with the man himself.What comes across, not surprisingly, is a picture of a driven individual, but also with charisma and a social conscience. This film won't make me a fan of Formula One but it did make me a fan of Ayrton Senna.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was born and raised in Brazil. Although I'm not a big sports fan (not even soccer!), something I always get made fun of for, I remember vividly the 1st of May, 1994, the day Ayrton Senna died; even though I was only 6 years old. He was indeed a national hero, whether you cared for Formula One or not. This is a solid, often fascinating documentary about a man's passion; in Senna's case, racing for the win. He won the F1 World Championship three times. His tragic death brings to mind the protagonists of Darren Aronofsky's two latest films: Randy "The Ram" (Mickey Rourke) in "The Wrestler" (2008), and Nina Sayers (an Oscar-winning Natalie Portman) in "Black Swan" (2010). Still, I wouldn't call this a story about the search for "perfection." Senna's main appeal is its emotional journey. Brazil is a land of so many paradoxes, and so are its people. At the same time we can laugh at our own adversities (poverty, bad politics, crime history, etc.) by seeing the best of everything; Brazilians tend to inherently suffer from low self-esteem and disguised hopelessness which is only defeated at moments of national heroism, often in sports (Pele in soccer, for instance). I'm not saying Senna was a martyr of any sort. I believe he deserved to be called a national hero because of his talent, passion, and the way he entertained and made an entire nation proud. I never personally cared for Formula One, but I still remember the (sometimes annoying, but always nostalgic) friction noise of the racing cars we all saw on TV every Sunday morning. And the victory song that Brazilians will always associate with Senna. This film brings both elements (alongside some great footage) to introduce all these facets of Senna to a larger audience; and for others, like me, to celebrate the life of a true national hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's true you know, you really don't have to be a fan of Motor Racing to enjoy, be fascinated by or touched by Senna. Much like Julian Temple's Sex Pistols music documentary encompassed the climate of the times, looked at the press and public reactions to something making waves in the entertainment world, so too Senna is dealing with more than a big name racing driver who tragically lost his life at Imola racing circuit in 1994. Director Asif Kapadi and his team have constructed an in depth and poignant picture that follows Ayrton Senna of Brazil from his humble Karting beginnings, right up to that fateful day on 1st May 94 when a country as one sank to its knees in mourning for the man who was their one joy in a country full of hurt and political confusion.Ayrton was a genius in the rain.On the driving/racing side the fascination comes from learning how Senna pushed himself to greatness, a very driven man who was never shy in coming forward. He challenged authority when needed and his on going career spat with Alain Prost often made the news for the wrong reasons, these are insightful and excellent splinters of the film. Incredible feats achieved in the car, like how he finally achieved one of his greatest ambitions, and won the Brazillian Grand Prix with a broken gear box stuck in 6th gear! Things he did seemed like magic to his millions of fans, very religious he felt very close to God, some of his driving had the air of a deity about it! Of course it's all building towards the tragedy, where it hits hard and even there there's a mysticism about proceedings. Foreboding warnings that came when Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger was killed the day before Senna, the Brazillian's reaction unerringly prophetic.He would take the car beyond its design capabilities.It's not warts and all, Kapadi has said that the Senna family oversaw production and much of the maverick driver's persona has been smoothed over. It's also worth mentioning that it's no rags to riches story, Senna was no Slumdog about to become a Millionaire. But this is real, a real man with a real interesting story, a story strung together with real clips and real home footage, not some hack job where a number of people from the same field share their own thoughts on a star that no longer shines. The Blu-ray release offers both an extended cut and the theatrical release, the former contains an extra hour but nothing of significance is gained. That cut is probably more for die hard F1 fans. At 1hr 45m the theatrical cut does an exceptional job by always being compelling with not a dull moment in sight. Quite simply this is one of the best sports person documentaries out there. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling documentary about a captivating man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The documentary genre, in my opinion, is capable of reaching heights that is impossible for regular features. It has the advantage of being true, and a fascinating story told well that happens to be true is always going to be that little bit more special. True, it can be used as a propaganda tool, but after the documentary boom that started near to that start of the millennium (and it still going strong), the genre has been taken to new heights. And with Senna, a profoundly moving and thoroughly exciting film, it has blended documentary film-making with drama, action and a genuinely touching rags-to-riches tale that goes way beyond the sport of car racing.Ayrton Senna was a Brazilian Formula One racing driver, who took the sport by storm in the mid-eighties with his no-holds barred attitude to driving, fierce competitiveness, and patriotism for his native country. Senna was simply untouchable. Tensions rose when his McLaren-Honda partner Alain Prost accused him of being reckless and dangerous in his driving, and the two fought for dominance until Prost eventually left. Yet Senna was always at the forefront at campaigning for safer conditions for him and his fellow professionals in the face of the politics of the sport, and it seemed inevitable that the sport would tragically kill him in 1994.Being a person that usually falls asleep whenever Formula One appears on my television, I was more interested to see a documentary about the man himself. But kudos must go to director Asif Kapadia, as I was completely caught up in the archival footage of the races themselves. Added to the fact I didn't have a clue who won what, it was made all the more exciting. The film starts at a running pace and never lets up, much like Senna himself. It is never sidetracked and the pace is never held up by the use of talking heads - Kapadia instead has small soundbites playing over the footage, and therefore we never leave Senna.The man himself, who I knew next to nothing about before seeing the film, seems as enigmatic and as captivating as his reputation precedes. He is portrayed here as spiritual, intelligent and warm. His rivalry with Alain Prost is often shown a little one-sided, with Prost being initially a bit demonised, but it makes the sight of Senna stood with him on the champions podium with their arms around each other years later, and eventually Prost carrying Senna's coffin, all the more profoundly moving.As the tragic ends approaches, Kapadia shows how the drivers were getting increasingly concerned about safety, and Senna is always at the forefront of it. Here the film takes on an almost apocalyptic tone, as Senna's tragic death approaches. As the camera focuses on and studies Senna's face as he prepares for the race, it's almost as if he knows. He looks unsure, concerned, and yet somehow resigned to his fate. As if this is something he must do for the greater good. Perhaps I'm almost romanticising his death, but I was captivated by the man, and when the end came, I was deeply touched.A powerful documentary about a fascinating sportsman, and although it's not going to get me into the sport, I certainly have a new-found respect for it.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charismatic subject let down by a one dimensional documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmmmmhh... I had high expectations about this film, genius young driver involved in the world's most expensive and glamorous sport whose life is cut tragically short by a race track accident... as a film this can't fail. Strangely I was wrong, for although glimpses of Senna's undoubted charisma does manage at times to seep through it is by and large submerged and almost lost in this documentary rather than being brought to the fore. The film follows a fairly straight narrative starting with his early karting career before moving onto all of the excesses of F1. Archive footage only is shown throughout and this I would suggest is the first problem with the film in that although there is an obvious integrity in using only the footage from the time there is also an inevitable limitation on what can be said. Often it is the advantage of hindsight and the passage of time that brings clarity to why something is special, why particular races should standout, with the absence of contemporary interviews that benefit is lost.The only real personal insight offered into Senna the driver is his conflict with Prost. The initial pairing and friendly rivalry of the two at McLaren to the bitter animosity that differing personality's and approaches bring, leading to the eventual cessation of communication and dislike between the two. Senna is portrayed as the "pure driver" not interested in the political machinations of the sport whilst Prost is the opposite, doing just enough and pleased to play the PR game that being at the top of any profession necessitates. It is from this conflict that one of the films more bizarre irony's seems to spring; Senna insists he is not political only wanting to drive yet the film seems more interested in Senna's political relationships with the F1 hierarchy and his place in it rather than his driving skill. For example the film fails to interview the people who Senna had to obviously work closely with in the pits to get his car performing to his goal of perfection. F1 is as much a team sport as it is an individual one and we are not told how he worked with the team and whether his approach was successful or not or even if it differed from other drivers. Yet we are shown various F1 drivers meetings and his annoyance at one i.e. walking out and his success at another in getting a vote from his fellow drivers to improve safety. Ironically the film is busily focusing on the very political matters which Senna disliked at the expense of his work and relationships within the driving team. Although a lot of time is spent in following the Prost vs Senna relationship the Prost character is also frustratingly one dimensional. Although I am not an F1 expert or historian this man was also a multiple world champion and yet the film seems only to paint Prost as a political opportunist, driving within his limits, swapping teams when it suits. Whilst these statements may be true in themselves it is the films rigid line of Senna is "good" and "Prost" is bad that I feel does both men a disservice. Strangely at the films end Prost is seen as one of the pallbearers at Senna's funeral and noted on the credits as a trustee of the Senna charity. Presumably somewhere along the line there must have been some sort of reconciliation between the two rivals but again another one of the films weaknesses is that this is never explained. I don't know whether Prost has watched this film but I would imagine that he may have a very different story to tell and it is the failure to tell the story from all angles that is another of the films faults. I am aware that this film was made with Senna family approval. Understandably for so loved a man the family do not want to have his character or reputation tarnished by a film. But this again is another difficulty for unless someone is portrayed in a more balanced light it is very difficult to relate or care about that person on any kind of a human level. Obviously I would not want to see a film denigrating the man but the introduction of a few more grey areas would have made it easier to connect and appreciate him. Ultimately I found this film frustrating, the subject matter and footage are there to make an exciting an interesting portrait of an undeniably charismatic sports man. Unfortunately this isn't it, other more successful documentaries such as Man on a Wire, Grizzly Man and in the sports arena the excellent Tyson film offer different aspects of the protagonists character to flesh them out to enable the viewer to connect and empathise with both their good and bad qualities. Senna doesn't do this and as great a driver and inspiration he undoubtedly was he is ultimately let down by a film that fails to reach the perfectionist standards its lead so struggled to achieve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Formula 1 film you will ever watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Formula 1 is a edgy and compelling sport and films about Formula 1 or Motoracing for that matter are heavily scrutinised for their lack of content and unrealism.So formula 1 fans worldwide rush the cinema to see this, we want Senna to be a brilliant film after him being such an iconic figure.The film is brilliant. It is so well documented that you will forget that it is a documentary you are watching and will be cheering and weeping at the film from start to finish.It is hard to believe that so much footage was captured in the late 80's early 90's and tells the story brilliantly. What it also does well is that it balances what to think of Senna from start to finish with his battles with Alain Prost being highlighted throughout but the director still makes us back Senna.The film digs deep in his family life, from holidays on the beaches of Brazil to his funeral which brings the audience closer than ever to the action.To conclude, personally I believe Senna is one of the best Motorsport films ever. If any Formula 1 fans are reading this then maybe we could join together in trying to get a Senna film like Rush which will be an epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant!! ...but with one major flaw...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big motor racing fan, my expectations were high and Senna certainly does not disappoint.Whether you are a fan of the man or not (I most certainly am), this documentary serves as a fitting testament to a racing god, who was flawed but never the less a genius behind the wheel. The documentary explores all aspects of Senna's life including his frailties leading up to his tragic death at Imola.Certainly Senna made many mistakes and many errors of judgement in his illustrious Formula 1 career. But the film rightly focuses on the man's inner spirit, his relentless will to win, his genius behind the steering wheel. But there is one downside to the documentary which I feel compelled to comment on - the famous relationship (or should I say non- relationship) with Alain Prost.In many ways, the documentary is good in the sense that with real footage, it ramps up the tension of their hateful relationship culminating in outlandish statements, especially by Prost who would 'like to punch him in the face'. These things are all true.But there is one big omission in the documentary, which makes Prost's portrayal as the master villain quite scandalous. In Prost's last race before retirement, Senna wins the race. He then gives a fitting tribute to his pal over the radio, wishing him a happy retirement. This was honest, not a sarcastic or tongue in cheek statement. The two had finally begrudgingly become friends, certainly out of mutual respect for their skills. But this part was never featured in the film. To be fair to the film makers, the audio on this broadcast is low quality but it could have been included with sub titles. It puts a very different spin on things, especially as we only realise in the documentary at the end of the film that Prost is a patron of Senna's charity in Brazil. This is portrayed as more an act of guilt but in fact they had finally become friends.By all accounts, Prost was horrified at the way he was portrayed in the documentary and quite rightly so. I have never been a Prost fan - I always looked for the flamboyant skills of Senna over the smooth, calculated driving of the French Professor. But Prost did not deserve this portrayal, and the films editing does little to dispel the myth that they hated each other until Senna tragic demise. It simply isn't true.This major flaw aside, the documentary is in the most part wonderfully pieced together with great interviews including Dr Sid Watkins who became a personal friend of the Brazilian legend.It is a tragic story but a warts and all celebration of the life of a racing genius who with Fangio, has to go down as one of the best drivers ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Senna" a great movie with many different with perspective of racing drivers and partially Ayrton Senna. The story line is a well thought out time period of his amazing life and how he came to the top of his racing career to the tragic and sudden death. The story goes above just the simple facts but the behind the race scenes and story of Senna's life from the love of his country to the controversial win. The great shots from different camera angels was a thrill to watch to see what the driver sees and to feel like you are almost there was amazing to watch. The power and the sounds of the f1 cars as they race along the best tracks in the world at the highest level of racing are spectacular. This film uses past video of old races and current interviews of some of the best-known names in racing to comment on the racers driving and how to this day some of the videos are still exciting to watch. In a race with a bad start he ended up fifth and on one lap in the rain manage to pass and overtake to get first place in one lap!The cinematic aspects were amazing and dramatic. The different in car views to the race cameras and the behind the scene view of how Senna describes the cars behavior and how little things that he wanted to change to make one of the best F1 cars on the track. Senna loved by many racers and his country of Brazil but as the movie progressed you will find yourself to love him too and what he did for everyone. One of the best if not the best racing documentary today must see for racing fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly engaging documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should say from the outset that I have no particular interest in watching Formula 1 racing, or any sport for that matter. The arts (movies, books, etc.) is where my interests lie. So the look of this documentary about one of racing's most tragic figures didn't appeal to me at all. Then I noticed it was directed by Asif Kapadia, who handled FAR NORTH, one of my favourites in recent years, so I decided to give it a run.It turns out to be an excellent documentary, one that takes great pains to really get into the psyche of its subject matter. You come away from having watched this with a feeling that you've really learned something about F1 and the men who participate; Kapadia, as usual, gets to the heart of his subject matter and gives it his all.SENNA is a technical marvel; the editing, which is a big part of any documentary, is handled admirably and the pacing of the narrative is just right. The way the storyline is shaped into a bitter battle of rivalry between Senna and Prost makes it entirely watchable, and I deny anyone to be moved by the poignant ending. Altogether, it's a great movie, and one I'm pleased to see got the attention it deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an avid F1 fan since 2003 (I am 23 years old) I grew up with the dominance of Schumacher and Ferrari. They would compare him to Senna. I was too young to watch Senna at his best. However, after watching this amazing film I truly understand why Senna was and always will be the greatest driver F1 has ever seen. The way he controlled the car was just magical. His passion for everything and spirit was amazing. The things he did to help Brazil cannot be forgotten.This film illustrates what a true champion is capable of. It is too bad his life was cut short on that tragic weekend.Fans of F1, and non-fans as well, will enjoy this amazing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Senna contains an excellent blend of on-board racing, driver meetings, and Senna family footage. It is refreshing to see a world champion athlete who appeared to be such a good person. Since I was caught-up in the Ferrari mystique I did not closely follow Senna's career. From what I see of him in the movie, I wish I would have. I worked in Brazil in the late 1990's-early 2000's; Senna was still their hero. Senna t-shirts were available everywhere. As a matter of interest, I attended the 1984 F-1 race in Monaco. The rain became very heavy as the race progressed. In my opinion the officials made the correct decision in halting the race.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lives up to the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was touted as one of the movies of 2011 and one of the best sporting documentaries ever and it doesn't disappoint.It tells the story of Brazilian Formula 1 legend Ayrton Senna's time in the sport. He arrived in Europe as an unknown go-karter but his talent was obvious and he soon joined Formula 1. He graduated from the small Toleman team to the more prestigious Lotus and finally to McLaren where he was a team mate of Alain Prost. They were the two best drivers at the time and their rivalry was so intense that they eventually stopped speaking to one another after many racing incidents between them.The best parts of the movie are the brilliant race footage and the many interviews with Senna at various stages of his career. Senna was remarkably frank in describing his feelings about the internal politics of Formula 1. There is also great footage of pre-race drivers meetings. At these Senna wasn't slow in expressing his feelings at what he saw as the favouritism of the FIA authorities towards Prost.All commentary and interviews are included as voice-over or sub-titles. There are no "talking heads".Senna comes across as an unusual character in Formula 1. People such as McLaren boss Ron Dennis and chief F1 doctor Sid Watkins speak of what a great man he was, as well as being a great driver. There is plenty of footage of Senna's personal life, including his charitable work in Brazil and a fascinating clip from a Brazilian TV show where the blonde presenter unashamedly chats him up! Unfortunately most people watching the movie will be aware of how tragically it ends. The fatal weekend at Imola is covered in depth from the death of Roland Ratzenberger in practice to on board footage of Senna's final lap during the race. The scenes in Brazil on the return of his body and during his funeral make it clear how important he was to ordinary Brazilians, at a time when they had few reasons to be proud of their country.Senna is most definitely the "hero" of this movie and the story is told from his point of view. Perhaps the filmmakers could be accused of some bias of their own. However given the character of the man and his life story they can be forgiven for this.A great movie for followers of motor sport as well as anyone with an interest in fascinating life stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't vote 10 because something is missing on that film. I can only hope that we going to see Senna part 2 soon. I was a big fan of Senna, and F1 in those times, and i was only 15 when Senna dies. I still remember today when i jumped from the couch and screamed "nooo". But as i said, something is missing, a lot was not told in the film. He had another several disputes with the system and regulations, even about security. Only after his death, several regulations about the drivers security where created. And the great races that he had and was not seen???... I never forget in Donington in 1993 when, with the inferior Macclaren-Ford, in the 1st lap, he came from 5ft to 1st in 4 turns... in Rain... Even Michael Schumacher said one time that Senna was the best ever... Since then, i don't remember the last time i saw F1 races... Besides that, is a great biography... with real footage, real interviews and great comments... Although, i agree with another comment that said that the little BBC documentary about Senna (i think it was in a episode of Top Gear) was also good.

		<fullReview>Unlike most of the people who will see this wonderful film My wife and I were at Imola in the Tribune Verde behind Tosa May 1st 1994. We had a commanding view of the exit of the Tamburello corner and witnessed Senna's crash. I've been a fan of F1 since 1953 and believe me it wasn't easy then. No TV, not even re-broadcasts, nothing in the news unless there was a driver killed. Then you might see something at the bottom of the sports pages. So actually seeing an F1 race was a dream. Imola was my third. I still have the ticket. Watch this film, see the in car footage,especially the footage at Monte Carlo when Ayrton takes you for the ride of a lifetime. I've been up that hill at maybe 45 mph. He did it at 170 mph+. See this film. You'll never forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gripping tale of talent, rivalry and tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I saw this last night at a cinema that had no spare seats. It was the second attempt at seeing the film...the first attempt saw us queueing for 15 minutes, only to see the film sell out before we got our tickets! Well now we've seen it, we understand the popularity. It's beautifully filmed, perfectly narrated and full of footage even ardent F1 fans like us (well, we were in the 80s and 90s hey days!) have simply never been privvy to before.On board footage, better than anything seen at the time or since, gives a feel for the edginess and ferocity of the evil, raw and animal like F1 cars of the day.Behind the scenes footage portrays the drivers as ordinary guys, moaning and joking about the day's work ahead of them.Personal and private footage of the main characters shows their humanity in a new light. Who'd have thought anyone could ever like Ron Dennis - but he comes across really well in this film!This film gives a real insight into the rivalry between Senna and Prost, how it developed, how deeply it ran (into a loathing of each other) and how they finally buried the hatchet completely. It documents the tragic and devastating events of the 1994 Imola GP in a way that has you screaming to yourself, "don't do it, Ayrton...you know everything is wrong!!". You see first hand just how sincerely Senna wanted NOT to drive at that awful event, but how his competitive spirit apparently wouldn't allow him to sit it out.No film is perfect. In our view, one slight criticism is that the film demonises Prost just a little too much for comfort. Clearly Senna is the hero and Prost the panto villain, so there's inevitable bias towards Ayrton. But Prost is really laid into, with lots of insinuation regarding his behaviour towards Senna and others, and also about his relationship with Jean Marie Ballestre. It may all be completely true, who knows, but it's not fair to imply that Prost was ENTIRELY to blame for the breakdown in his relationship with Senna, is it? Ah well, whatever. It makes gripping viewing and Prost comes out of it OK in the end!Ultimately, the film gives you a new insight into Ayrton Senna, a deeply misunderstood driving genius who was taken from this world much too early by a G-d who couldn't wait to have him! It's gripping, thrilling, moving and frankly unmissable. Go and see it, you'll be very glad you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful but biased documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his lifetime and racing, Senna divided opinion. To some he was the great hero, the brilliant talent who managed through his exceptional prowess, to reach the top of his sport. To others, he was an arrogant, aggressive, self-confident bully, who pushed everyone else aside as necessary, and who feared nothing since he believed he had God on his side. Perhaps inevitably, this documentary is made by those from the first group, and as a result it ignores much of the hatred and frustration that he caused others. Alain Prost and Jean-Marie Balestre are made out to be the bad guys, desperately trying to subvert Senna's undoubted abilities, for their own ends, but the reality is that there were many in the F1 paddock and outside, who disagreed with Senna's attitude and approach. This documentary is a tour-de-force of editing and research - I can't imagine how they managed to put together such a well crafted piece from the 1000s of hours of footage that they located. But it ignores the many other arguments that were created by Senna, focusing solely on the Prost/Balestre feud. What of the time when Senna punches Eddie Irvine after a race, for overtaking him? When he pushed Mansell off the racetrack in Belgium in 1987 and Brazil in 1986, or Schumacher in France in 1992, to mention 4 of many occasions. Senna was an absolutely ruthless driver and without any sportsmanship. The film implies that Prost was the bad guy at Maclaren, but he was not the only driver who found he could not work with Senna as a teammate. It was the same for de Angelis at Lotus, who was forced to leave in 1985, while Senna refused to have Derek Warwick in the team in 1986, because Warwick might have challenged his superiority. So an undoubted talent, but a very flawed personality who believed that winning was his right at whatever cost to anyone else - something which this film completely misses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adrenaline-charged beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I despise about action films nowadays is their unceasing quest to outdo their predecessors, not in terms of quality and emotion, but in regard to the most superficial -- yet most pleasing -- of cinematic aspects: spectacle. CGI use has reached an all-time high and is showing no sign of stagnation, each blockbuster pushing at the edge of what should be possible with wild and reckless abandon, as if they have forgotten all rules of filmmaking and are simply -- like their actors -- jumping off cliffs for money. Cheap thrills, and little else, have become expected staples in action cinema.The result? Ultimate and irredeemable desensitization. We are no longer shocked by entire planets exploding, no longer feel any sort of thrill when Tom Cruise renders eight thugs senseless, bored when Karl Urban shoots up a whole room of junkies in slow-motion, and barely even entertained when Vin Diesel drives from one building into another, with explosions illuminating the air behind him. This already false substance has become utter fluff, which filmmakers pile on when their ideas and intellect fail them.And yet, we, as an audience for these stupid filmmakers, yearn blindly for what is rarely provided. We want to see big explosions, epic fights, car chases, etc. We want to be thrilled when we partake in the blanched and boneless experience of watching modern films, and sadly, this does rarely ever happens.As such, I picked up Senna from the library hoping for fast cars. That's about it, really. I just wanted to scrunch up on a chair and watch fast cars drive around, crash, explode, and sure, win if possible. I didn't care when it came to who was driving them. Basically, I was in it for a Fast and Furious montage, except slightly more realistic and without Vin Diesel making me squirm with his quasi-religious "family" monologues."I don't got friends. I got family." "Your brother never told you to threaten a man's family? It's a pretty stupid thing to do." "You don't turn your back on your family, even when they do." (What the hell?!) "This time, it ain't about just being fast." (Okay, that one isn't about family, but it still sucks)Senna begins with grainy footage. Which makes sense, considering that it is a documentary about Ayrton Senna, a racecar driver active in the 80s and early 90s, and most, if not all of the footage is collected from that period. But it was initially rather a letdown, considering that I had hoped for something ultra-sleek and sexy, sort of in the vein of Rush (2013) with its lithe, jungle-cat(esque) stylishness, both physically and cinematically. Despite this, the film delivers, not only on the fast cars, but on sheer entertainment. The film is intense and thrilling simply because the footage is real. A sense of the drivers' mortality is evoked within the viewer as we are placed in the driver's shoes, forcing us to understand the rawness and terror of Formula 1 racing as the driver is forced to grapple with every time he enters the car.But what is most surprising about the film is Senna himself. Ayrton Senna is one of the most magnetic individuals that film has had the opportunity to depict. He is a man, complete with emotion, beauty, and anger, displayed to the audience as a full human being rather than simply a character. His initial friendship and eventual rivalry with fellow driver Alain Prost is captured just as magnificently as his delirious ecstasy at winning the World Championship in Brazil, his country of origin.The film, unlike most documentaries, tells real-life stories with an effective dramatic flair, instead of simply presenting events one after the other. Each scene has a purpose, whether to deepen our knowledge of Senna himself or to entertain. Whichever it chooses to do with each subsequent scene is consistently satisfying and emotional.I loved Senna, every single minute of it. It reminded me that we can in fact be emotionally invested in films, that we can be entertained by them, even moved to tears by them. Sure, technical prowess is admirable, but there has to be a pulse behind it all. And when that pulse is fleshed out, undiluted and inextricable from the cinematic experience, the film has undeniably succeeded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie - Controversial Star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Senna was lucky enough during his era that Brazilian TV had their own people covering Formula 1 (he wasn't the only Brazilian F1 driver) and thus a treasure trove of original broadcast material was available. So this documentary, which covers a very talented and extremely controversial star was made possible.The subject, Ayrton Senna da Silva, was one of the leading stars of F1 in his era. He drove in (and won) races with a talent many thought beyond human. Whether true or not, one thing WAS true: he also brought a mentality to F1 and motorsports which made it much more dangerous than ever before. His take on things was, "If I can't pass you and I feel I need to, I will push you off, wreck you or otherwise create a dangerous situation if needed." Some of his fans contest this, but this documentary shows it more than once. One of the best sequences is an interview with Jackie Stewart, a multiple World Champion himself, which obviously shows Stewart's disdain for what Senna is doing to the reputation of World Champions in general. Senna's sidestep of Stewart asking him why he has had more car-to- car contact in three years than any other Champion had in their whole career is priceless. One other thing that is lacking is any insight into Ayrton's "personal" life that rings true.While he is shown with women represented as "girlfriends", there is another truth there that is not shown but was evident in his era.The other major plot element here is Senna's combative relationship with sometimes-teammate Alain Prost. Prost managed to defeat all of the previous (and some future) Champions in his era and was the sole driver who took the fight to Senna directly - and beat him. The movie shows though that however that might have been,Prost rose above the petty level he could have retained off track. Excellent period F1 footage from a "real" racing era, unlike today's cars. Insightful (but sometimes ill informed) narration from a number of sources. Interesting sidelights about Senna's faith, which was not evident in his English language interviews. And family footage, some of which is heart-rending. Overall, a controversial documentary on a controversial star whose legacy is still disputed. Shows you just how charismatic and talented he really was, I think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is rare for a documentary to leave the same impact as a movie. An emphasis of reality, good acting and other factors make it more exciting, more appealing ... However when you see this fantastic work of Asif Kapadia with Ayrton Senna as the main star, where images, sounds, speeches and people are pure event, it becomes difficult to make that judgment. In this documentary we vibrate, we learn, we fall in love and even without having seen him racing or hearing about the legend only after his departure, in the same way as his first fans we miss him... the greatest driver the world has ever seen.

		<fullReview>If there is any documentary that truly captures the essence of a person, it is Senna. I have to admit Formula 1 was not on my list of interests before viewing this film however, it is next to near impossible to not be pulled into the incredible story of Ayrton Senna. A racing driver who struggles to find balance between his passion and his beliefs, Senna is the perfect athlete to focus a camera on not only for his driving skills, but also for his complex and incredible personality. A true legend on and off of the track, this film captures the emotion of the sport along with the pain of losing such a tremendous person. This film will go down in history among the greats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very well told story from start to finish ? great documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I started watching Formula 1 around the mid-90's whenever Hill, Hakkinen, Schumacher and Colutard were the big names and I think I stopped as those names started to retire from the sport, so my window of interest was pretty limited and my base of knowledge about the sport was even more so. Senna was only ever a name to me rather than someone I had followed and, although I knew he was a great driver and had tragically died, that was about the end of it and it was the critical praise for this film that brought me to it rather than a specific interest in him or his story. So it is to the film's credit that I was engaged throughout and thought that the story was very well told using only archive footage.The film is a documentary but rather than filming talking heads relating the events, the film uses archive footage to play out the story as if it had been filmed. Of course the end is known and there is a lot of talking in the past tense but the film delivers a story rather than a reflection. Technically it is very impressive and must have taken ages to go through all the old footage, but the media coverage of the period has allowed this film to pick the footage that they would have chosen to film if they had to make it from scratch. We get the good side of his character, we get the conflict, the controversy and of course a sense of how great he was ? all of it is delivered via the footage and makes for a great story. The ending being known doesn't really damage how this story plays out because, if anything, it is well used to add significance to some of the footage that comes before and indeed does give the film a tragic air that is effective and adds to how involving it is.Senna is a great documentary and it will not only work for those with an interest in the sport or the person, it is such a well-delivered story that it will also engage those with a passing interest. The selection and use of the footage is really well done to play it out and the film benefits from not visually jumping forward in time by using filmed contributions looking back. A tragic story but a really engaging and well-told one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The documentary was about Senna, made with the obvious cooperation of his family, who I am sure were able to view it before it got released. It did concentrate on Prost's bad points and Senna'a good points. To put it all into context the big incident at the chicane where Prost left the track and went to the Stewards, the rules, rightly of wrongly were in Prost's favour and he exploited them in the stewards room. How many of us given the chance of winning the F1 title would not do that. Secondly as Jackie Stewart brought up, Senna did have a reputation for pushing past people and if you did not get out the way he would shove you off the track. I also have to say if Senna had any doubts about the safety of the car at Imola he would not have driven it. It was probably clear even by then that the Williams was not going to be the winning car that year.What we really need is someone to make a documentary entitled 'Prost' so we can compare the two. I don't suppose that will happen though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most beloved boy of Formula One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard for an ardent fan of Formula One, someone who has been following the adrenalin-rush sport that decides winners in one-thousandth of a second, to withheld their tears when Senna's car crashes.A thousand minutes of archive footage is painstakingly gathered and edited and is supported by euphonious soundtracks. Asif Kapadia has brought the story of the life of Ayrton Senna, a man who attained his zenith with perseverance and constant hostility with his teammate and suffered a fatal crash when he was the poster boy for the sport. He endures pain, faces criticism from the authorities and is even penalized for his actions but that doesn't stymie his ascent to the top of the podium. A failure in design of the car leads to his death. He raises the issue of lack of safety measures during a Formula One race, something that could prove to be fatal to the drivers a couple of days before his death, only to be unheeded by the intransigent boss of the sport.Not just the nation but the whole world feels bereaved of the greatest driver of the race car. Senna's final wish to enhance the safety measures is finally implemented and there hasn't been any other fatality hitherto.A 10/10 documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me firstly say that I am not a driving fan or a fan of Mr Senna... until now. The movie is truly beautiful. It is quite unbelievable how much footage exists and it is so very much more powerful than any piece of writing on the project could be.It was fascinating to see evidence of the troubles between he and Prost and yet not really side with either one. It felt impossible to do so, as they were both competitive men on different sides of the same coin.A masterpiece of a film, congratulations to all involved. It was simply beautiful.It is of course quite difficult to watch at times with all of the footage being real but it taps into our intrigue, our desire for truth. Ayrton himself, can not help but look when a friend is very badly draped across the road, after a crash in training. This is mirrored later at his own fatal crash, when as a viewer I simply could not look away. I had to know how it happened, why it happened and what it looked like.An incredible movie of poet value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its very easy for us men, sometimes, to be obsessed about our sports heroes to a point of blind worship.And often while watching this documentary you get a sense that both Manish Pandey(writer) and Asif Kapadia(director) must surely be boyhood fans of the Brazilian.Cause in their worthy attempt to provide us an open window into the life of one of the greatest F1 drivers of all times, they err in making Senna almost look like a saint----sometimes.Having said that, it is indeed a thoroughly enjoyable peek into the life of a legend.The filmmakers must be commended for making a documentary which will appeal to most viewers,irrespective of their willingness in watching documentaries in general or the sport itself.You might know zilch about F1 or Senna, and yet appreciate this story.Bernie Ecclestone's massive archives have helped in providing the necessary footage, which are more than adequate and interesting (especially if you are a F1 fan).But in the end its down to Senna's life as a whole, which in itself is almost like a perfect novel or story(in spite of the sad ending).The mere fact that you are left with a lump in your throat when you watch his funeral speaks volumes about a man who was able to touch, impress and affect people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterclass in documentary making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to forget just how good documentaries can be, but Senna is a great reminder. It's an unsurprisingly interesting look at a man, but an unexpectedly fascinating portrait of a sport that often provokes indifference amongst the uninitiated. As a relative newcomer to Formula 1, force fed a regular diet of Sunday racing by my then housemates during the twilight years of Michael Schumacher's virtually unchallenged reign at the top of the sport, the people and events covered in Senna are largely unknown to me having formed part of F1 lore long before I pledged my allegiance to McLaren.The genius of Senna the film lies in the way the film-makers have built characters and ramped up tension far better than a film would have, using only stock footage, with nary a talking head in sight. The result is an inconspicuously gripping narrative arc that creates a genuine emotional impact despite (or more likely because of) the inevitability of the tragedy that shrouds the film.The doc focuses, rightly, on Ayrton Senna's racing prowess, capturing the sport itself through the prism of his career. Many question the exact level of talent required to drive a car round a circuit for two hours, particularly when the technology increasingly seems to be doing most of the heavy lifting. However, part of the genius of 'Senna' is its depiction of the emotional and physical stress of racing. It manages to convey this through both the subject himself, as well as through what would now be unprecedented access to the drivers and the key personalities. The rivalry between Senna and Alain Prost is rivetingly executed, with Senna the recklessly passionate D'Artagnan to Prost's carefully calculating Richelieu.'Senna' is also a picture of the advent of advanced electronics in motorsport, subtly questioning the very foundations of professional racing. What is motor racing? Could we ever have another Senna? Or are we destined to a generation of calculating Prosts in what is now effectively an engineering competition? More than that, 'Senna' also provides a fascinating insight into the impact of money and politics in F1 - questions with a wider resonance for anyone who loves sports, not to mention sporting widow(er)s. The way Senna reminisces about the 'pure racing' of his go-karting days, and the importance of excellence above all else should strike a chord with anyone who laments the effect of money and vested interests on their sport of choice.But this is also about Senna the man, whose fortunes on track were tightly bound up in Brazil's national psyche, his career mirroring the hopes of a country only just shaking off successive military regimes. Make no mistake - Senna was comfortably well off at a time when that was very much the exception in Brazil. However, he made the most of what he was given, throwing himself into charity work, particularly when it came to helping children.The fact remains however, that the dark epicentre of this film is Senna's death. In the final third of the documentary, director Asif Kapadia and writer Manish Pandey weave a tale that outdoes most works of fiction. The sight of Martin Donnelly's shockingly twisted body lying in the middle of the race track, still attached to his car seat after what turned out to be a career ending accident, is merely the most striking of series of increasingly portentous signs, which include retrospectively doom laden comments from Senna and others about what future achievements lay ahead.Footage of the final race at Imola in San Marino will most likely produce a lump in the throat or a weight on the chest of even casual observers. The events are lent immediacy by the first major accident to take place that ill-fated weekend as a rookie Rubens Barichello flies sideways off the track in an horrific looking accident. Hammering home the dangers of motor racing is the subsequent death of Roland Ratzenberger, lent additional impact by the understated cutaway from the accident itself in favour of footage of a clearly distressed Senna as medics start CPR on Ratzenberger. Another violent incident during the race itself, and the stage is set for the denouement, pulled together with fittingly scarce coverage of Senna's own fatal accident.Is it worth it? At the end of the day, it's just a race after all. The fact that there have been no deaths in Formula 1 since Senna's death is cold comfort. It takes the final, heartbroken comments from ordinary Brazilians to put Senna and his achievements in context. What is being mourned is not an empty icon or a reckless playboy. It's the loss of a peerless hero who embodied 'the best of Brazil' at a time when it was emerging from military rule and setting off on the path towards economic and cultural ascendancy: 'all Brazilians need is health, food, education and a little joy. And now that joy is gone'.A beautifully rendered tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brazilian hero still resonates on the screen today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Racecar drivers only get documentaries if they die unexpectedly while in the racecar. Subscribing to this theory, I expect the Dale Earnhardt story any day now. However, the story of Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna has nothing to do with NASCAR, but the world wide racing circuit of Formula One in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Senna won the World Championship an astounding three times, put all of his faith in God (to the annoyance of some other drivers), and saw no purpose for being happy with 3rd, 4th, or 5th place. He said if you do not race to win, then why race at all? The documentary shows Senna's early success on the go-kart circuit and believes this was Senna's favorite sort of racing. Unlike Formula One, the go-karts contained no politics or money; it was pure racing. Senna did not like politics, most likely because he was not very good at it. The most engrossing part of his story is the back and forth severely competitive race Senna had on and off the track with Frenchman and sometimes teammate Alain Prost. Prost is a four time World Champion and these two men grew to despise one another.There were accusations of intentional crashes, poor sportsmanship, and collusion on the part of Prost. Both Prost and the Formula One President at the time were French and the film makes a definite point that these two might have been conspiring against Senna in particular situations and rulings. Prost would criticize Senna in the press that his total faith in God put him and other drivers in danger on the track because he though himself immortal. Senna certainly did drive fast and pushed his car to its mechanical limits.Pushing himself and his vehicle to those limits finally earned him a win at his home country track in Brazil. The video of Senna hysterically screaming and the crowd going nuts is still resonant all these years later. Senna was a Brazilian hero and gave a lot of hope and joy to his native countrymen. He was constantly mobbed on the street and was one of his country's most famous celebrities. He may have been even more loved in Japan where near riots would break out when he would come there to race. The videos and interviews unearthed for this documentary are top notch. The filmmakers show the audience a driven, ambitious, and at times emotionally and physically exhausted Senna. At the end, you really wish there was another race for Senna to run.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having long been a devout fan of Formula One, and being one of the 300,000,000 to have been watching the 1994 San Marino GP live when Ayrton Senna had his fatal crash, I have long awaited a film that did justice to his immense presence within the sport, and his mystical approach to life. This film manages to capture just that - the essence of the man. While some important aspects of this great racing driver's life are omitted (e.g. a brief marriage early in his career, and his pubic comments concerning the 1990 incident with Prost, after winning the World Driver's Championship in 1991), SENNA is a superb tribute to the life of Formula One's most interesting participant and clearly one of the greatest talents ever to participate in motor sports.

		<fullReview>'Senna' is such a powerful documentary. The way it has all been put together grabs your complete attention and it progresses at a good pace, we learn plenty along the way. I am a relatively new fan of F1 so I really wanted to see this to broaden my knowledge of the sport as well. After watching this I can certainly see how much things have changed. It was great to see and learn about Senna, who most laud as the greatest F1 driver ever. After watching this documentary I can certainly see why that is said. Everything about this was so fascinating. There was chills and thrills, laughter and joy as well as moments that make you all emotional. It was great to see footage of things I had never seen before, and I'd imagine that even people who watched F1 back then would still get something new out of this. It's a great insight to Senna's life, he seemed like a great guy. Some of the behind the scenes talking was a laugh and to see the rivalry he had was also great. I had no idea of the amount of support he had back home as well. This documentary was so powerful and well made that I felt like I was watching something that had just happened. I knew what the outcome would be of course but when the inevitable happened, I sat there shocked and hoping for him to move. Overall, this is just brilliant. I would recommend it to anyone, whether you're an avid F1 fan, a casual sports fan or even if you don't like sports at all. It's Senna's life and I think anyone could watch this and feel the emotion. 10/10.R.I.P Ayrton Senna.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a copy of this film given to me as a gift and as and F1 fan I was thrilled. But when I looked on here (IMDb) and saw they were counting this as a documentary, I began to have reservations. First things first this is in no way a documentary. Because of mainly the world class editing by Chris King and Gregers Sall they have woven together hours of television footage in a way that showed the legend as a caring, god loving, role model who, in Brazil, was seen as a "beacon" of hope for the people who were going through hard times as a nation. What I really loved about this film was the level of emotion Senna was feeling after the incident with Alain Prost in Japan. I was shocked how much he showed this in front of cameras. It just showed how an emotional man he really was. I also have to praise the writers for how they created such emotion and a story/plot out of archive footage. Most people will already know that (spoiler alert!) Senna dies at the San Marino GP 1994. In the last 20 minutes or so there is a big build up of events that happened on that terrible weekend (ratzenburgers and Ruben's crashes) that will reduce even the hardest of souls to tears.

		<fullReview>I loved this movie, it was so nice to see Senna doing what he did best again. The film was very well put together with old film clips and archive footage, but it was very well done and didn't feel disjointed. We all knew when we went to see this film that its made up of archive footage, so if you are expecting anything else, don't be disappointed. It was clearly a pro Senna film and so maybe didn't always give a completely unbiased view of the fabulous racing driver. That said, if you are going to see this film it is because you are a Senna fan, so this homage I feel did him justice. Stupidly, even though we all know that Senna died doing what he loved best, you still wish that he didn't die. There are some upsetting scenes of racing drivers losing their life, so be prepared for that. Great film, emotional and I loved it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well received and applaudable documentary about F1's Muhammed Ali</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning I tried to get into motor racing many years ago, having never followed the family tradition of following football or indeed any other sport...if I'd allowed that passion to materialize, Asif Kapadia's highly rated expose of the late Aryton Senna might have meant even more to me than it did. All the same, Senna is one of the few names that still sticks in the mind years after his death. There seems to be a natural greatness in death. In the event of someone's passing, the old aidage that 'you don't know what you've got 'till it's gone' really kicks in and all you're left to do is stare at someone's talent in their chosen medium and really admire it for exactly how great they were, and all the potential that will now certainly go unfulfilled. With this in mind, it seems that Senna was regarded (especially in Brazil) as not merely another race car driver who became a sad statistic, but, as, it would appear, 'the Muhammed Ali of motor racing.' In life, a supreme talent, fully aware of his ability and, who, like the best of them, tore the rulebook up and took risks to thrill the audience and out class the competition, Senna lifted the spirits of the nation in Brazil, at a time when the country was suffering terrible economic turmoil and grinding poverty, and achieved an iconic status among his people long before his sad end in 1994, on a race track, the stage where he performed to his adoring audience. The film charts his rise from his humble beginnings racing go karts in the very early 80s, to winning Formula 1 for the first time in 1986, to his long running rivalry with F1 team mate and competitor Michael Prost, his run ins with the guys in charge who found his reckless style too much to handle, accusations of cheating, right up to the point where F1 banned the use of electronic equipment and forced them to use inferior cars...and then, the lights going out.The thoroughness and effort that has gone into this pain staking documentary is truly admirable, and as a result it is deservedly absorbing through out, drawing you into it's subject and the world he inhabited very well. Yet, for all this, it weirdly lacks a human centre (if there's one complaint.) The focus seems to be mostly on the racing scenes, which are admittently breath taking, whilst failing to properly get under the skin and bones of Senna as a person, drawing any attention to his reported charity commitments and political leanings, leaving something of a void in terms of a human centre. Even the contributors don't have their faces shown, which just makes it all feel even more alienating. But if you focus in on his passion and commitment to the world of motor racing, Kapadia has used archive material and commentary to astounding effect, a documentary that deserves to get more than the usual short shrift. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stitched together from television footage, in-car relay and family video, Senna documents the career and violent death of the Brazilian driver. Technically it's rather impressive, a feat of archive review and judicious editing. The end result is edifying and exciting. It also helps that Senna's career had a fantastic, clear three-act structure: the irrepressible rise of the virtuoso; the professional struggle and victory; fighting himself.For all that Asif Kapadia gives us plenty of material to shed some light on this final stretch of Senna's life, I feel that he doesn't draw any conclusions, and that left me a little unsatisfied. Senna was struggling to maintain his achievement level with a new team but I was still left in the dark as to whether he was fighting the technical limitations of a car hamstrung by new regulation or whether he has fighting himself.This is rather important. Self-struggle is the most fascinating area of elite sport, that moment in which the sportsman's assessment of their own ability rests not on beating an already conquered opponent but on surpassing their own, greater goals. Kapadia uses a lot of footage of Senna talking about his faith. This is interesting but doesn't always instruct us about the man and his relationship with that deity - his faith was absolute, blind.Naturally, with this in mind, I found the human dramas the most affecting. The most moving part of the film is when Senna, having finally won the Brazilian Grand Prix struggles visibly against injury to lift the trophy. But the fact, irrespective of medium are as powerful and I was equally touched to read that Senna's nemesis, the sneaky Frenchman Alain Prost, is a trustee of his foundation. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Documentaries are difficult things to rate, even more so if you are a fan of their subject. Rating this one, I found more difficult still, as it finally vindicated some of the behaviour for which Senna was most heavily criticised in the British motoring press.Refreshingly, we are spared a line-up of 'experts' and self-serving pontifications from the great and good. The narrative is provided largely from original source material and this contextualises the story in a way which avoids what otherwise would almost certainly have been dismissed as hagiography.The gradual disintegration of Senna's relationship with Prost is vivid and rationalised. The director does avoid some incidents for which Senna should have received criticism such as squeezing Prost against the pit-wall during the 1988 Portuguese GP, and this does paint things as rather more black and white than they perhaps were. But one has to balance that against the almost universally negative coverage Senna was receiving (in the UK at least) after he opposed Derek Warwicks move to Lotus in 1985. The motoring press should have been up in arms about Jean-Marie Balestre's actions in 1989, but they let him off the hook and motor-sport was very much the poorer for it. This film undoubtedly does redress that issue and doesn't gloss over Senna's clash with Prost in 1990, but does provide the context which has so often been absent in other coverage of this incident.My biggest criticism is that the film simply doesn't show enough of Senna's driving skill, but the attention to the major incidents in the story and the wonderful editing and handling of what must have been an overwhelming choice of material is such that this would have been icing on the cake and perhaps a distraction to those less interested in the sport. Undoubtedly, this is one film you need to see and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taken from my www.anotherf1podcast.com site...It's clear that as an ardent F1 fan and geek that delights at a 50p charity shop F1 video full of hair metal guitar music the Senna film would have to be catastrophically bad to disappoint, and it's fairly easy to come to the conclusion that it's easily on the top step of the podium of motor racing films.Certainly if like me you can remember Prost vs Senna in the days when F1 coverage was on Grandstand and the nearest equivalent of the constant stream of information of the internet and twitter was Ceefax, it's a heady mix of nostalgia coupled with what seems like the DVD extras of the era that we never got to see.The film excels over a lesser conventional documentary by not having lots of modern day interviews in front of carefully gradiented backgrounds or blurry reconstructions of a dark haired man walking into rooms accompanied by a dour voice-over. All of the footage is real, from grainy local Brazilian TV interviews with a young senna or seeing him discussing the problems with the Williams on the day before his death with Adrian Newey.Enough time has passed in F1 that aside from a clip with a young Barrichello, footage of a less feisty (but giant spectacle wearing) Eddie Jordan or the reminder that Schumacher was right on Sennas tail in Imola 1994 this film is clearly of a previous era. The cars were racy, twitchy and on the edge, the politics of Jean Marie Balestre remind easily how Max Mosley came as a welcome relief. The TV coverage, press constraints and fashions of the time can often make this feel more like the seventies than the nineties before F1 really came into its own in the immediate pre-internet era as Bernie started to shape it into the global brand we know today.Any criticism of the film is the convenience of Prost (or Prowst as the main American commentary acting as narration constantly refers to him as) is painted as absolute pantomime bad guy. This is either a shocking retelling of history or (perhaps more shockingly) telling a truth that can finally emerge now the politics of the day have faded. Did he have Balestre wrapped round his finger?My recollection of the time is him portrayed as a polite underdog to Senna's bad guy, certainly as a movie, Prost being the baddie is a perfect foil, but one can't help but wonder if the extent of it is a stretch too far.Either way it shows that politics, and more importantly, the unseen politics, is and was a big a part of F1 as aerodynamics and driver skill, and a similar film of the Schumacher era would be just as enlightening.The film reaches it's horrifically inevitable climax at Imola 1994. And such an era-defining moment for the ardent f1 geeks will be viewed in different ways. For me as a fourteen year old I remember watching it over roast dinner and actually cheering as he crashed, such was my hatred for him who at the time was in my memory regarded as a great driver but a bit of a dick (Alonso anyone?). But the culmination of the calamity of events over that weekend feel almost unbelievable and perhaps brings home more than anything else that these aren't just F1 drivers in photos and on caps, but people too.The world of F1 that this film shows us is of a lost era, before the elaborate motor homes and dull press release spewed drivers comments. The scenes of Senna in drivers briefings make F1 feel like any other job with disgruntled employees arguing over petty matters and the tensions of office politics.But will this film work for non F1 fans? I think yes, it is much more about the man than the racing, the actual racing clips are cut woefully short for my eyes, but I (like most actual fans) would happily sit in a cinema and watch all his races back to back. This film helps cement Ayrton Senna as a sporting great that transcends his sport, like a Pele or Ali. And that cannot be a bad thing.</fullReview>

The title itself already attracts fans and the general public with as sounding name, excerpts of several documentaries were bonded very well. The documentary has a good time-line. I already knew the life of Senna, and I was curious to see the movie and is very well designed, the director did a great job, even for those not seen him compete, gets an idea of the great pilot who was the rivalry with Prost, the friendships and had also accompanied by something that only he felt inside. Recommend the film to everyone, not just fans of the sport, but the entire public, and see the magnificent person he was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Senna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who know the life of Ayrton Senna, then you have probably sen this movie. This movie is based on the life, career, and death of 3 time Formula One Champion, Ayrton Senna. The story is told by family, friends, and colleagues that he worked with in his career. Back in 1984, Senna got his start in the Toleman Team, a team not known for running upfront with the likes of Ferrari, McLaren, or Lotus. At the 1984 Grand Prix of Monaco, Senna finished second behind Alain Prost when the race was shortened due to torrential rain. Had the race not been stopped, surely Senna would have caught Prost and more than likely would have won the race. Prost plays a huge roll in Senna's career.In 1985, Senna left the Toleman Team and went to race for Lotus where he won his first career race at the Portuguese Grand Prix, in the rain. Some say Senna was a god when it came to racing in the rain. In 1988 he won his first of three world championships when he drove for McLaren. In 1989, Senna would lose the championship to Prost after a controversial collision at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix where both of them went off at the final chicane. Prost was unable to continue but Senna was able to, however while reentering the track, he cut through the chicane where the two had made contact. This led to Prost complaining to the race stewards and effectively giving the Frenchman the title. Senna would later go on to win the title in 1990 and 1991.On April 30th, 1994, Austrian driver, Roland Ratzenburger, was killed in qualifying for the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix at Imola. The next day, Senna was leading the race when on the seventh lap of the race, being followed by Michael Schumacher, went off on turn one and slammed the wall head first at over 170 mph. He was killed instantly but was airlifted to a hospital where revival attempts were given but in the end he succumbed to his injuries. The car he was driving suffered a mechanical error or a tire issue, but was hit by a piece of debris that came off his car in the initial impact. The movie ends showing the funeral for Senna and home movies and memories shown.All in all it was a fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faith and Passion - A legend without Us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes is difficult to understand the Legend without a trip in his personal life, this documentary is a touching voyage of a man who fought for his legacy, F1 politics, the pride of a country in need of happiness... and the casuality of how some incidents can change a man. If you loved Rocky as a motivating movie, you can't miss this treasure, you'll see how a man with a huge love for God, never forgot his people. The fight with Prost, Jean-Marie Balestre's punishment, the leadership years and the continuous voice against some awful politics.This documentary for F1's fans, this film will appeal mandatory... for movie or non F1 fans, a really good detailed biopic and exclusive footage of his personal and professional life.You need to watch this documentary and be prepared to approach the goal of his last years, the happiness for his victories and the joy of Brazil and the 'Special" moment when his sight show us the doubt, fear and some kind of divine augury before his death. The music has been perfectly chosen, the official footage, audio, conversations and the transformation of the epic battle between he and Prost, to Alain Prost's pain and deep sadness of Senna's funeral.Is amazing how destiny can show us another heir, Schumacher appears in the huge pain of Senna's death as a sign... Destiny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A racer's dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When former F1 World champion James Hunt died at the age of 45 in 1993, Senna paid him a handsome tribute. Hunt by that time was better known as a F1 commentator for the BBC. Hunt was also one of the relatively few F1 champions to have died of a natural cause. He might have had a heart attack at the age of 45 but it was not the fate that befell Senna just a year later.Senna commonly raged against F1 politics whether it would be the organisers, administrators or F1 teams themselves. When he moved to Williams he might have hoped for a new start with a team that had maybe the best car in F1 at the time but fate was not so kindThe documentary focuses on Senna's racing career in F1, from his debut in the 1984 Brazilian Grand Prix to his death in an accident at San Marino in 1994. It relies primarily on archive race footage, home video provided by the Senna family, rather than retrospective interviews. The film has no formal commentary.This documentary directed by Asif Kapadia also deals with his battle with great rival (and sometimes team mate) Alain Prost, the wily racer known as the Professor. It was the natural racer against the more methodical, cerebral driver who might even resort to underhand tactics to get on top. But then again in F1 underhand tactics are common whilst racing or behind the scenes such as getting a drive on the best team, living on the edge of the rules regard the setting up of the car and even trumping your team mate.Still despite the great and bitter rivalry, Prost was a pall bearer in Senna's funeral.The documentary gives a good account of an era of motor racing from the mid 80s to the mid 90s and there is some great behind the scenes nuggets of information that people who watch F1 on TV might not had been aware of. If you are not fan of racing this might not be to your liking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ayerton Senna - The Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a documentary on perhaps the greatest racing driver ever lived. It captures his career from about 1984, until his untimely death in 1994. There's something about him that's irreplaceable and when watching this documentary it enforces that impression even more.The documentary shows the life of Ayerton Senna in a pretty unbiased way. It also highlights the key points in his racing career, and driving skills in a spot on way. The producers of this movie did a really good job of organizing this movie. It's obvious when looking at his driving, he was able to drive beyond the potential of the car. There is a saying in Formula 1 racing: If you drive at 98% potential of the car you will lose. !00% is impossible for a human to achieve. Drive at 101% and you're dead. Ayerton Senna seemed to be able to drive at 101% all the time.The documentary shows that even for this genius, victory didn't come automatically. It shows all the anguish he had to go through, with his team mate, his car, and racing politics. This sort of things really shouldn't be a part of racing, but it is. Perhaps he was too pure for the sports, where Alain Prost knew how to play the field, he was purely interested in driving. Prost even had the good sense to know when it's time to call quits. Perhaps he's another kind of genius in the world of racing.What was unanimous in everyone's opinion is that Senna's fatal crash was not the driver's fault. In the last part of this movie it was commented "Senna's luck simply ran out. If the rod struck him 6 inches higher or lower, he would have walked back to the pit". If his steering column indeed broke, this statement is true. It certainly seems suspicious to see that there was no steering input to avoid the wall. Driver of his his level would have certainly acted fast enough to put steering input to avoid head on collision with that wall. The video footage shows his car going straight in like a missile. Impossible if his steering was still working.Ayerton Senna was like a Super Nova that appeared in the sport of formula one racing. Not only that, he affected the change in the sport like no other has. We will miss him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is truly one of the finest documentaries, I have watched so far. There are no edits or manipulations of the real events those occurred. Everything is presented in an unbiased manner. The archive footages are engaging and you don't feel like you are watching a documentary. I have seen many movies which are based on true incidents, but most of them are manipulated/adapted to add commercial value. On the contrary this one is not one such movie. The director has done extensive research on the subject. It is worth investing your time watching. The culmination of story is bit fast. P.S: I am an admirer of Ayrton Senna. Some might find this review bit biased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Senna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many documentaries I have seen involve a main presenter and narrator taking on some sort of journey or finding out more about a focused person along the way, it is good that this one is just simply archive footage and voice overs from the people who knew the man. Basically the documentary looks at the life of Brazilian Formula One motor racing champion Ayrton Senna, who arrived on the scene in 1984, being with Toleman, Lotus and McLaren, and of course his many wins, including in 1989 and 1990 races against his friend and rival, French driver Alain Prost. Senna was successful winning the championship in four seasons, and he became famous all over the world, and obviously this film shows all the races as they happened, broadcast on television, and all narrations came from those that knew him at the time. This success continues until changes are made to the rules of what can be used in the racing cars, and the driver seemed to slip into a faze where he could not perform as well as he maybe used to, but he keeps going to do the best he can despite these low points. Of course the film culminates in the tragic day when in 1994 Senna crashed his car in the San Marino Grand Prix, one of the first fatalities to happen in Formula One in almost twelve years, and his passing came as a big shock. Since his death Senna has been praised as possibility the greatest Formula One driver of all time, because of his many fast actions and intriguing passes of other racers, so he is missed by many in the field, and with new safety procedures there have been no fatalities since his. I think it was from Top Gear that I heard about this film, and obviously being a motoring show they recommended it is a must see film, I am not going to pretend to know much about motor racing, apart from that being first counts LOL, but whether you like the sport or not this is indeed a most watchable motor racing documentary. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know absolutely nothing about Formula One motor racing but still found myself being completelyenthralled by Senna's life story and his total dedication to his sport. This film not only depicts Senna's victories (and losses) on the track but also gives insight into his stature as a Brazilian national hero, and his battles and tribulations with the sport's bigwigs. A particularly nice touch is the soundtrack which is not overwhelming and bombastic in the way a lot of athletic movies tend to be. There are a couple of graphic crash and aftermath scenes that some viewers may find upsetting so be warned. Altogether an excellent portrayal of a man in total pursuit of his obsession and how it affected his family, colleagues, and country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant documentary film about one of the Greatest F1 drivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film 'Senna' brilliantly tells the story of one of the greatest, if somewhat controversial, drivers in modern Formula One history. It starts with a young Ayrton Senna on his first trip out of his native Brazil to a go-carting event in Europe; it quickly becomes apparent that he has what it takes to get to the pinnacle of competitive driving and become a Formula One champion? to do this he will have to do more than be a great driver; he must also overcome the politics of the sport. For much of his career he is battling with his team mate Alain Prost; who it seems will do anything to ensure that he keeps the title. As the years go by it looks as if he will continue to be champion but after Williams develop a much better car his has no chance of victory and suffers defeat at the hands of his old Nemesis Prost, who promptly retires leaving a space at Williams for Senna. It looks as if he is going to be winning again but rule changes mean Williams can't use their hi-tech suspension and Senna is once again in a less than perfect car? it is in this car that he will race at Imola on that fateful day in 1994.This really is a gripping film even if you couldn't care less about motor racing; the footage is gripping and in some parts shocking. The competition between Senna and Prost is thrilling and as I couldn't recall who had won each season I was on the edge of my seat. Inevitably as the conclusion approached there was a sense of foreboding although that may have just been because I can remember the events from watching the news back then. Unlike many documentaries there are no 'talking heads' or recreations; it is all footage filmed at the time with a commentary added where there isn't a live race commentary. If you are put off watching this because it is a documentary rather than a 'proper film' then don't be; this is more exciting than a Hollywood movie about racing would be because it is the real thing; complete with passion, rivalries and very real danger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning, powerful film that everyone will enjoy, not just motorsport fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps I should begin this review by saying that, in my opinion, Ayrton Senna was the greatest driver Formula One has ever seen. Schumacher may have seven world championships, Prost may have won more races, but as a racing driver, Senna was the best.This frankly magnificent documentary tells the story of Ayrton from his first move to Europe as a young man to compete in karts, through his explosive entry into Formula One to his tragic death at Imola in 1994. It is entirely made up of archive clips, many never seen before such as intimate home video clips and back stage footage from FOM driver's briefings, with voice overs either from Ayrton himself on the clips, or from new interviews with those who worked with the man or lived with him.As such the film is a masterpiece in editing and assembly, culled from thousands of hours of footage the director, Asif Kapadia and Manish Pandey, the writer, have been able to tell Senna's story in a way that allows us to understand this complex individual, his passions and his fears, his hopes and his wishes. As the film reaches its climax at that dreadful weekend in San Marino 94 we feel like we know what is going through Ayrton's mind, and we understand his choices and decisions.Because of this tight focus on the man and his chosen profession, the film is not an intimate portrait. We understand little of Senna's personal life, for example his short lived marriage before he raced in F1 is not mentioned, nor his next girlfriend who he started dating when she was just fifteen, nor the fact that his girlfriend at his death, Adriane Galisteu, was not looked upon favourably by Senna's family and instead installed Brazilian TV star Xuxa, a previous lover, as his 'official widow'. Likewise the film doesn't dwell on the controversy that surrounds Senna's death (both sides of the argument are mentioned once each and that's it), nor the ferocious controversy that some of Senna's actions, particularly his war of words with the Benetton team or the infamous time he punched Jordan rookie Eddie Irvine in the face. Those looking for a complete portrait of the man, warts and all, should look elsewhere.But then this isn't one of those pandering F1 documentaries that cater solely for the F1 fans. This, instead, is a film that can be enjoyed by anybody, fan or not. It is a compelling story of a driven individual and his desire to be the best at his sport. Senna never, ever quit on a race track, he never stopped trying, never stopped racing even if the only person he had left to beat was himself. His rivalry with Alain Prost, another great F1 driver, is nicely told here, as are his legendary battles with the FIA, the sport's governing body. Indeed the latter delivers us some of the most electric scenes in the film - nothing whatsoever to do with fast cars, but instead the brutal clashing of egos and opinions that lie at the heart of this most political of sports. Not for nothing is F1 nicknamed "The Piranha Club".Ultimately Senna is a rare film. It is a documentary that tells a complete story with a solid beginning, middle and end, and provides tension, excitement, wonder and sadness. It is an emotional watch because it allows us to connect with the man beneath the helmet, something that is so hard to do in the closely guarded world of F1. It is an inspirational watch because it shows us what we can all achieve if we apply the talents we all have. And it is an educational watch, because it shows us a sport in transition. Senna raced through the start of the electronic period, where traction control, computerised ride height, launch control and anti-lock brakes took much of the skill required away from the drivers and encouraged them to go faster and faster. Senna's death, the last in Formula One, led to a period of introspection by the sport, the old order at the FIA was swept away, and a new era began with safety at the forefront. Old narrow tracks such as Imola were either dropped from the calendar or adapted to make them safer. Sid Watkins, Ayrton's friend, developed the HANS device, pioneered the use of high speed doctors cars and improved circuit medical facilities, the engines were made smaller and less powerful, the tyres had reduced grip all of which have helped Formula One maintain an enviable safety record in a sport that is dangerous by its very nature.At the end of the film we are aware of the man's life, his achievements, his battles and his death, as well as a greater understanding of the sport in which he competed, but not necessarily loved. Senna is a superb film that has been rightly praised and really should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything i was expecting and more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ayrton Senna came from a wealthy family in Brasil but don't ever think that was the reason he was one of the greatest ever racing drivers. Senna was a natural. He was an aggressive driver who would try to win at all cost and that upset a lot of people during his short lifetime.This film documents the battle he had with French driver Alain Prost and the F1 authorities. There is some fantastic archived clips from TV and private family footage and it really shows what a humble man he was.Obviously there is only one outcome to the film and the tension builds and builds as that fatal moment approaches. Some of the scenes are distressing but they do show what a dangerous sport F1 was ( and is) and how it takes a special type of person to clime into one of those machines.Senna is everything i was expecting more.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior doc, just a little uneven in its delivery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a fear that an F1 feature would be full of slow-mo sleek machines and rev sounds but Senna is an excellent example of how correctly presented a story can transcend it's obvious audience. Although having such a charismatic character is certainly an advantage, the film manages balance the sport and the man, appealing to those who know F1 and Senna's story well and also those that have an interest in the human elements. Emotional content is the film's motivation and it manages to use the archive footage to get you on Senna's side from the start. By allowing the viewer to feel his passion and love for the sport once he is challenging to be world champion you feel as if you have been on that journey too. Using a selection of footage - home movies, race footage, TV interviews, in car camera ? Senna avoids the stagnation documentaries suffer when on the big screen. The variation in quality makes sharp contrasts and mixing these with strong editing keeps the film at a brisk pace. I understand the thoughts of leaving out the talking heads although occasionally this left me feeling a little of the identification was lost. Strangely without the visual aids of facial expression I found some of the most insightful moments came from various F1 commentators. The film kids us into thinking we are getting to know Senna yet there is very little learnt outside racing. This in turn questions what the film is actually aiming for. It's not to revel the man due to the omission of any non-race related footage and if it was to affirm his status as the greatest then it gives scant evidence showing very little on other drivers or the sport in general. Repeatedly his faith is referred to but without any context of depth we never get any real sense of its true influence on his driving or life.This means much of the focus is left to the Senna/Prost rivalry which detracts from his other contributions to the sport. Unfortunately the reliance on this relationship means once Prost has retired the story comes across a little rushed yet this is one of the most telling times in Senna's life as he moves to Williams and seems to fall out of love with racing. The film also manages to miss this opportunity to really analyse Senna and continues to show him as the frustrated genius derailed by elements outside his control. This was sometimes the case (FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre comical in his villainy) but the film fails with it's blinkered view that Senna could do no wrong. This unevenness is shown particularly in the treatment of Prost, vilified through-out the film to be given a redeeming line at the close of the titles. Too much of their rivalry is reduced to a simple good vs. evil rather than two great drivers with different styles both trying to be the best. Also omitted of course is any negative footage of Senna racing. He was never a dirty driver but his direct style he bought from the more physical carting and his desire to win at all costs meant he certainly wasn't above utilising more forceful tactics. Leaving these out may enhance his clean image but it misses the chance to show his win-at-all-costs spirit. Although the collision that wrecks the Prost's title challenge is seen to disturb Senna it is edited in such a fashion as to be justified revenge. Critically I found this bias annoying but I have to admit that it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film. I'm sure Errol Morris or Marcel Ophuls would agree documentary does not have to be objective and impartial!I loved this film and fully enjoyed the experience, impressed it was able to influence my emotions on so many levels - exactly what a movie should do. The film manages to be exciting, funny, gripping, and incredibly moving but I just felt it a little flawed when looking at it critically and at my most ungenerous would say it comes across as unbalanced blind hero worship. The film never really draws any conclusion about any of the facts presented and for that I was a bit disappointed. Does it need to though? Maybe not, but to be so desperate to show his genius it seemed a little odd that it skimmed over the possible influences or reasons for this. For example I would have been interested to see what was the real impact of his faith on his attitude and how was it compatible with his obvious need for individual achievement. I agree with another reviewer here that some shots from the end credits could have well been in the film, particularly a great shot of Senna stopping his car and running back to aid to a crashed colleague. It is in these you realise the film is quite short and there was so much more to the story. It also makes you realise the limitations of relying on archive footage and without some contemporary reflective commentary it can seem quaint and isolated at times. If you can track it down the longer cut gives a bigger picture and creates a much more even evaluation but as a whole it is a messy affair and not as fluid as the theatrical cut. As a small note I must mention much of the extra footage are direct interviews and with this much footage (around 160 minutes) the talking heads actually make a nice insertion.It's definitely well worth a watch and I would recommend it to everybody, not just those with an interest in F1, as it manages to engage emotionally with the viewer more than anything I've seen in a long time. Just don't go expecting an in depth documentary or an impartial portrayal of the facts. 7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

Watching this movie being a complete stranger to Senna's life, I just felt that he knew long before that it was gonna be his last hurrah. For a champion of his might and authority what really struck me was his humble and positive aura. But no matter how bad we feel about him being not there at the end, its this aura of his that has kept him alive all these years in our heart. And in contrast this movie too.This movie is the closest that one can get to know him, and I can vouch for that having read a lot about him after watching this awesome movie. Its got thrills, court-room-ish drama, humor, and most of all 'The Man' himself, MR.SENNA. The movie has been assembled very well, if I can say so. Its gonna grip you like a wild fire. And one piece of quick advice before I wrap this up, please watch it with your headphones with above normal sound and who knows you might hear senna from up above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie I have seen this year....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... hard to believe but true.I love this movie (or documentary on senna) , It is done solely with old real footage which is so well put together that it makes it all the more effective.I became interested in Formula 1 in 1998 after 4 after Aryton Senna had died in Imola so I did not know a much amount about him other than his aggressive yet superb style of driving and his rivalry with Alain Prost.This movie added not only more information to what I knew about the man but also a deep sense of admiration and respect for him. Senna was human and like us all he had flaws , its a testomony to the skills of the director and crew of this documentary that they do create an honest portrayal of a man.My true admiration comes from just how far Senna pushed himself to pursue his passion in life.The onboard footage of him racing actually solidifies my respect for him , the pace and tension of these races is brought to life through on board footage of sennas mclaren . These scenes are actually very intense. Its as closs as I want to get to the real thing. Any error could result in a horrible accident. This gave me a bit more respect for formula one drivers in general, Senna showed his masterful command of a formula 1 car above the other drivers however. He was without doubt one of the best drivers in Formula 1 , if not the best, I will freely admit that.The rivalry between Alain Prost and Aryton Senna is fantastic.. I never had a chance to see these great drivers battle each other with raw determination that you can cut with a knife. They both want to be the best and they aren't going give one another a chance to take the title... You can argue that the way they acted in Japan was not sporting but this was a different time period to today and it shouldn't take away from how brave both these men where. Alain Prost was not as big a risk taker as Senna however and this is why so many people see Senna as the greatest. He was almost fearless Despite his aggressiveness Senna clearly was a good man. He cared for the drivers and was visably devasted when Roland ratzenberger dies in Imola , Roland only has a brief scene in this movie but it actually does add a lot personally to a relatively unknown driver that like all the drivers had a dream but was tragically killed).Frustration of the corruption in formula 1 is shown well and it continues to embody a part of the sport to this day.Sennas death was one of the few occasions where I was about to cry...even though I saw the crash that caused his death before I cant comprehend how much tension I felt.Everything in this is a testimony to Senna and all the other drivers who are doing a potentially very dangerous race. Above all its a testimony to Senna as it feels like we personally know the man , his frustrations at the corruption of F1 and his passion for 'pure driving' after the movie. Its more a humane story than a story about Formula 1 and its done so well that I felt I changed after feeling the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He was a very admirable human being</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Senna was the most famous Formula 1 superstar of his time and beyond his time; this documentary shows why. Not only was Senna extremely gifted in his sport, he was also a super human being with some kind of special quality that does not come to all. It was the combination of his gifts, his ability to surpass normal human endurance, his strength, his vulnerability, his search for truth and most of all his love for something greater than himself (his belief in God)that set him apart from ordinary men and women. The documentary is very masterful because it shows something more than motor car racing and the love of speed and winning. Of course this is part of the allure, but to be successful in this sport, there has to be a thin line between life and death all the time. Senna was aware of this constantly, the pursuit of his desire to win was not just egoism; it was also to push himself beyond his own boundaries and never be satisfied with staying at the same level both physically and emotionally. It seems that the sport was in some conflict when Senna had his accident and thus afterwards things improved for other drivers. But one has to feel that Senna was exhausted at the end, the fight had reached the climax and he was not willing to pursue racing in the age of technology. His time had come. A great documentary about a very special human being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, engaging documentary about a true champion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ayrton Senna was before my time, back when he was at the heights of his F1 career until his death I was a small kid that had no interests in racing-sports (and in fact I still don't). But still, even then I heard people talking about him, seemingly idolizing and having sympathies for him like he was much more than someone who was just successful at what he was doing. I didn't find out why until I saw this documentary.Senna is a intense documentary about a three times F1 World champion. But it's not really about racing, rather about how he was truly passionate about it. Regardless what you think of racing sports, Sennas remarkable story is more about being competitive at the highest level and him as a person. It practically could've been any other sport or competitive activity. It covers topics from his younger days when he was kart racing, his upcoming to the F1, his fierce rivalry with Alain Prost which at more occasions seemed to cross the lines, his rise to his championships and also his struggle with anything else beside the racing such as fame, politics and dubious, controversial changes in the technology of the F1 cars. What makes this documentary so engaging is how eventful his life was. There are many ups and downs he had, some so interesting and unpredictable they could easily make for a great movie. It keeps you curious to see what's going to happen next all the time, until the end, and even after that you might want to research more about him. Director Asif Kapadia did a good job choosing the scenes and showed a great sense for timing and appropriate music, and it didn't feel like it was "sugarcoated" at any point.The documentary paints a clear image of how much of a down to earth and likable guy he was. People successful and professional as him usually tend to be more calculating, cold, maybe even arrogant, but he still remained true to himself with only his love for racing guiding him to overcome odds. And this, I believe, is why people love him so much. He wasn't really interested in fame and money, only to race and compete which is beautifully used to close out this documentary. True passion is what brands true champions and Ayrton Senna is a shining example of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outstanding documentary whether or not you like or know anything about car racing. I am very into cars and went into this film with a decent amount of knowledge about F1 and Senna, but I watched it with three other people who didn't know anything at all about the subject matter, and all of us found this documentary to be compelling. As a matter of fact, I think the other members of my audience actually liked the film more than I did. I put off watching this for quite a while, because I wasn't sure that I wanted to spend more than an hour and a half watching a story I basically knew, but it wound up being time well spent due to the extra insights provided. I might be, however, the only person who came away from this film with a worse impression of Senna than I had going in. To me personally, he came off as a bit of a prima donna who took excessive risks with his own and other driver's lives, although, prior to watching this film, I did not realize how much of a role religion apparently played in his willingness to push the limits. He is certainly not anyone I would have liked to have raced against. Despite his denials about feeling invincible, he very much seemed to believe that God was protecting him, and this belief, combined with his ruthlessly competitive nature and his extraordinary skills, I think made him a significant danger to himself and everybody else on the track. Everybody who knows how this story plays out, knows that counting on God can get you into a lot of trouble. I recognize that my reconsidered opinion of the man is likely a minority one, and I would encourage others to watch this film and reach their own conclusions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant documentary about brilliant racer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Ayrton Senna was not a real man Hollywood would have to have invented him. Senna charged up the ranks of Formula One racers, emerging as one of the best in the world in the 1980s. This movie has amazing footage of Senna's races, with scenes of his exciting victories and also film of his crashes. Senna's rivalry and alliance with Alain Prost is also heavily detailed in the film.The documentary also weaves in Senna's personal life. It is fun to watch Senna go from young racer to a worldwide celebrity, dating models and appearing on TV shows, even if that complicates his Catholic faith.If you know Senna's story you know how it ends, with him dying in competition and possibly because of mechanical problems with his car. The film does a good job of addressing these issues too but leaves it to the viewer to make up his or her mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He is the ultimate driver's driver he had that god given talent a sense of where the grip was before he turned into a corner. ? Martin brundle (1984 - 1996) he raced with Senna for 11 years. An average formula one driver could find a tenth or two hundredths of a second during a qualifying lap, really great drivers could find nearly half a second to three quarters of a second, but Senna can do even better than that in Monaco Grand Prix 1988 Senna out qualified the great Alain Prost by Scarcely believable 1.5 Sec. Senna was a brilliant driver, well so were others that's why he was racing them in Formula 1. But when it rained it was easy to spot Senna's talents. Going back to his first race in Monaco Grand Prix where the race had to be stopped due to heavy rain when Alain Prost was in lead and Ayrton Senna in second place was closing in on him at 3 seconds a lap! In rain! In 1984 car! In Monaco! It was a touch of genius. The Brazilian grand prix in 1991 was one of the most memorable of all the races. There was so much of Passion, excitement and sentiment going into that race for Senna and the Jam Pack interlagos crowd chanting Ole Ole Ole Senna Senna. It was going to be an easy win, but, with several laps to go his gear box jammed in sixth gear and it is unbelievably impossible to drive an F1 car stuck in sixth gear. Besides this he completed the race as a winner for the first time in his home grand prix. Asif Kapadia takes you through a pure emotional rush and also the dangers of formula 1 racing from the early days of the sport, till Senna's ultimate death in San Marino Grand Prix imola in 1994. The other day I wrote a review of Rush which is also a movie based on formula 1. But to write this review I watched hours and hours footage of Senna, what I understood is James Hunt and Niki Lauda were spectacular every time they raced each other. Senna was spectacular every time he got in the car. Every era has their champions who define all the odds. But Senna may be; just may; be the best of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another case of chasing the Yankee dollar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I'm a paid up petrol head I put off buying this DVD until I saw it at a knock down price in a supermarket. The reason being I was sceptical it would be anything but an in-depth look at the character of an extraordinary sportsman. That is chiefly because I noted the UK producers were Working Title, a successful British production company, but also one with a reputation of taking non-American stories and americanising them for greater profit abroad. I'm not criticising them for that but it sort of underpins my feelings about this film.I found it a curious experience watching this film and sort of difficult to explain, but let me try by saying imagine a film about a legendary driver in the US's favourite motor sport NASCAR where say most of the narration was provided by a non NASCAR loving nation say the UK, and the presence of the host nation had been reduced to almost non-existent. Confused? Let me again try to help you out. In the opening sequences and throughout the film Senna talks or is described as moving to Europe to further his driving career. Well since all of the teams he drove for in all formulas were British couldn't they be a bit more specific and say the UK? I wouldn't visit Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and Belo Horizonte and say I visited South America, I'd try and narrow it down a bit and say I visited Brazil!Please don't get me wrong I'm not some flag waving nationalist with union jacks tattooed all over my body but as soon as I heard this I knew where exactly this film was going. In films aimed at mass appeal there is only room for two nations, two warring groups, and since Senna was Brazilian (the good guy) and the French had been chosen as the bad guys there was no need to go confusing things ? so Europe it was!That brings me onto the disgraceful way Alain Prost was treated in the film. He was never my favourite driver, but he didn't deserve this carve up. All that was missing was a black cape and a fiendish moustache! But he is French and so fair game for the majority of the American viewing public. Take the needless scene of Prost being verbally abused by race goers at the Brazilian GP (handily translated into English, just to make sure we all know he is a 'Cheese eating surrender monkey!') Formula One is historically a European and South American sport and we shouldn't treat our former champions like that not even when we are prostituting ourselves for the American audience. I suppose an audience that was assessed as having no interest in learning that by the time the average driver makes it into Formula One they have all stuck knifes into peoples' backs and lots of other dirty tricks besides.'Saint Senna's' real character was only touched on when in one of the few honest scenes in the film he considers his own mortality after Martin Donnelly's awful crash, but we hear nothing about his 'game of death' with Martin Brundle in a Formula Three season (after one encounter Senna ended up parking his car on Brundle's head!). Or the revealing episode when he vetoed Lotus hiring Derek Warwick because he didn't want the team to split their resources between two top drivers, (surely a dirty trick only those nasty French people would do?). Of course in dramas when establishing character you can't provide a 360 perspective ? you've got to have your good guys and your bad guys, but this isn't a drama, it's documentary about a racing drama ? so couldn't we have been a little more honest? My biggest surprise regarding this film is the praise it has received from the F1 insiders, but then I got it ? it's in their interest to get the US interested in F1. So all-in-all a disappointing film about my favourite racing driver of the eighties and nineties. Yes Senna was my favourite driver and I'm sure if he was still with us he would view this fawning, selective audience production as an unworthy testament to his genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tells Senna's story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very one-sided, biased take on a genius of a driver. It plays up the drama between the drivers at bit much at times when it could have focused more on Senna's struggles with the Williams mechanical team. Although it was interesting to see here where Senna came from, and his struggles through the ranks, the film was not able to capture him on an intimate level. He always remains as a distance, untouchable celebrity. Still, not bad for a film made out of decades old footage. The film did tend to drag on however, and certain parts, especially some of the stuff that had nothing to do with racing, could have easily been cut out (I skipped through some parts myself). I was left wondering how such a stunning driver could be defeated by such a seemingly trivial problem. As troubling as it is that the exact cause of the crash is not known, it is a reminder that he was human, but there is some comfort in know that he died doing not only what he love, but what he had to do.

		<fullReview>A documentary about Ayrton Senna, the legendary Brazilian F1 Motor Racing driver with no new material, instead relying on archived interviews, clips and personal home video does not sound like a riveting watch.Director Asif Kapadia has however managed to produce an interesting, gripping and ultimately poignant tribute to the much loved driver, which will be enjoyed by anyone with even a passing interest in the sport.Senna burst onto the scene at Monaco in the mid 80's, following a highly successful Karting career. Passionate, quiet in private, patriotic yet monumentally talented he effectively rocked the boat in the stable and stage manged F1 world at the time, the administration of which was held in a vice like grip by Jean-Marie Belstere - "The best decision is my decision!" The film focuses on the white hot and ultimately acrimonious rivalry between the established champion, Alain Proust and the upstart pretender. On occasion it appears that races and decisions were formulated to preserve the status quo and despite his evident talent, Senna is blocked at every turn.The sport is dangerous, drivers are considered to be highly paid "monkeys" with few rights, decisions on safety are apparently made arbitrarily without any real thought or implications for those travelling at 300kmh, round slippery wet tracks.Despite the lack of new material, the film is carefully balanced and constructed, each piece carefully laid, ultimately leading to the crash that would claim Senna's life in front of 300 million television viewers. Treated as a god in Brazil and almost a saint since his death, the film neatly adds the rider that Alain Proust remains an executor for the trust created in Senna's name to help underprivileged children in Brazil.Senna when asked what the best race he ever took part in, refers back to his Karting days when the racing was pure, man against man in the identical machines with no politics or electronic controls. As many will know, Williams dominated the sport when electronic aids were initially introduced, effectively making drivers mere passengers in their own cars whilst computers controlled many functions during cornering. This ushered in a new era in which no one could match Williams until the rules were changed.F1 has always been about politics and money, Bernie Ecclestone merely taking the premise to the next level. Senna is shown as very much the outsider, clearly held back until his talent and fan base became too big for the sport to ignore.The irony being that it took the death of perhaps the sports most enigmatic, enduring and crowd pleasing star to bring about much needed safety improvements and driver participation in decisions affecting them.As the film notes, to date no F1 driver has died since the incident.Summary Intriguing, poignant and quite gripping, this is well worth a watch for anyone even vaguely interested in motor sport.Recommended http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I missed Senna's run at the cinema, and so had to catch this on Blu Ray, upon it's release. I'd heard good things about the film, but still wasn't prepared for what I was about to watch.Never have I felt so moved and so emotional at the end of a film. So to feel this way at what is in effect a documentary, was astounding. The film flows perfectly, and credit must go to the producers for the wonderful editing. If this does not win a BAFTA for it's editing then I will be amazed.This truly is one of, if not THE, best film of 2011 and it deserves all the plaudits it has received.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Missed Opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I followed most of Ayrton Senna's career intently as he was a brilliant driver with incredible charisma which arguably made him bigger than even F1.I was though quite disappointed with this movie as I feel there were too many omissions. First of all a large part of the film is not in English, I am assuming Portuguese? I am not sure if some copies are in different languages as F1 is a global sport but one language or the other would make sense.Moving on though, any Senna documentary would surely require input from the most influential names. Fangio, Murray Walker, Jackie Stewart and Michael Schumacher are/were the most influential names in motor racing to such a degree that you can almost forget most other observers. They have all publicly spoken of Senna's genius yet not a single comment from any of these names was included.The film does not even make an attempt to set the scene properly. For those that don't know this was a unique time in Formula 1. We had Senna, probably the best driver of all time against Prost, another of the best drivers of all time.Now lets see what else was missing: Any mention of qualifying, his qualifying routine involved perfect timing and execution, which was the reason for his staggering number of pole positions throughout his career.His ability in the rain and on street circuits.His unique driving style - blipping the throttle through corners and so on. This has been analyzed by other broadcasters in depth.The very close relationship with Honda, the man and the company. Honda engines were supreme at the time and Honda stipulated that Senna be a McLaren driver due to his immense popularity in Japan. He also provided a lot of input into the NSX. The Senna line of products such as clothing, watches and bicycles.The failed early marriage.Punching Eddie Irvine and being punched by Mansell during the drivers' briefing.The film was always going to be a stitching together of archive footage yet it follows the various F1 seasons with no real purpose. 1988 is rightly shown in detail as it was his first championship yet the film completely misses the elephant in the room that the McLaren of that year was so dominant that the car won 15 out of the 16 races ? a feat still unmatched in the history of the sport. In fact it would have been all 16 if Senna had not been taken-out by a back-marker late in the race.With no narration we are left to work things out ourselves. The 1993 season was one of Senna's finest even though he did not win the title, but virtually none of it was shown. Also in that year the European GP at Donnington is, many feel Senna's best race ever but not one second of that race was in the film.There was also a complete lack of statistics which could have gone some way to summarize Senna's career. Finally the period of silence observed at the race after Senna's death was not even shown.Instead of the above there was an obsession with Prost, of course he was Senna's direct competition for some years but there was just too much of him and Balestre.I did see a lot of non-racing footage I have never seen before which was interesting however it seems to me that the makers of Senna either ran out of money or just did not have access to some of the better on-track action.At the end of 1994 Michael Schumacher said he would give his world title to Senna if he could as Senna would have won it. If ever there was a quote that needed to be in this movie it was this one.I have to say this film goes down as a missed opportunity to tell the story of the greatest driver ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't know who Ayrton Senna is, the documentary "Senna" is a riveting drama that profiles the legendary Formula 1 race-car driver and his determination to win.If you are familiar with Senna's story, the movie still offers a compelling inside look at a sport and the man who changed it forever.Ayrton Senna da Silva grew up wanting to go fast. Coming from a prosperous Brazilian family, Senna started with go-karts and advanced to Formula 1 in 1984, when he had just turned 24.Senna quickly launched a rivalry with French driver Alain Prost, who was considered a more strategic driver than Senna. The Brazilian's style was more daring and intuitive. The rivalry boiled over in 1988 and 1989, when Prost and Senna both raced for the McLaren racing team and jockeyed for first and second place at several Grand Prix races.The film pays special attention to the end of the 1989 season, when Prost and Senna crashed in a turn at the Japanese Grand Prix. Senna finished the race, but lost the politics of the sport. Prost complained to the stewards ? and Formula 1's president, Jean-Marie Balestre, a Frenchman like Prost ? and Senna was disqualified, losing the championship and earning a six-month suspension.Over the next five years, Senna overcame the backstage battles to establish himself as the greatest racer in the sport. He became a legend in Brazil, mobbed by adoring crowds wherever he went. Into the 1990s, though, he faced new challenges from technologically advanced cars and a growing sense that his luck on the track might run out.Director Asif Kapadia (whose past films range from the Bollywood actioner "The Warrior" and the Sarah Michelle Gellar scare-'em-up "The Return") had tons of racing footage at his disposal, and he makes Senna's races as exciting as if they were happening live. He also employs some amazing inside footage of pre-race drivers' meetings, where we see Senna maturing from a hotshot kid to a thoughtful elder stateman among his fellow racers.The movie also features extensive interviews with Senna's mother and sister, with fellow racers and race commentators ? but, smartly, those interviews are heard, without talking-head visuals interrupting the stunning race footage.If there's a weakness to "Senna," it's that the racer's personal story is a bit sanitized, as his romantic history ? which were highlighted by relationships with the Brazilian children's star Xuxa and model Adriane Galisteu ? is fleetingly mentioned. The movie has the support of the Instituto Ayrton Senna, the children's charity established by Senna's sister Viviane, so some burnishing of the legend should be expected.With its focus on the track and the personality one sport couldn't contain, "Senna" proves a good documentary can have as much drama, emotion and heart as a fictional narrative. Besides, you would be hard pressed to find an actor as charismatic as Senna himself.By Sean P. Means The Salt Lake Tribune</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Senna - Sensational Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the movie with no real predisposition on Ayrton Senna as I had only ever heard stories about him from friends who were much more interested in F1 than I am/was. To see someone with such a passion for winning, or maybe more appropriately stated, "improving on every win" was awe inspiring.He did amazing things with race cars that no other drivers could do. To see how his friends and family constantly rallied around him speaks volumes to the kind of man that he was.Ayrton Senna is such a great role model, using present tense as I expect his legacy will carry on much longer now that this medium provides such a great platform for others to see what a difference he made, not just in his sport, but in his country.I expected to be entertained, but in turn I was moved.Great work, and a shame if it's not available for purchase at some point once the theaters have all be reached.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot has been written, heard and seen about Ayrton Senna. Was he the best all time racing car driver? I have been a fan of motor racing for almost fifty years, I saw Senna race at Brands Hatch, Silverstone, Monaco, his two victories in Brazil and in my opinion he was the greatest. After he died I watched Formula 1 half heartedly. When this film came out I decided not to see it. I had seen it all before, I thought. But after so many positive reviews , I finally saw it. What a film! First, the emotion of living it all again, not something frozen in time, but something alive, a true work of art, to be able to without narration, only through actual facts tell this tragic and beautiful story, There are many great moments but what I enjoyed the most was the argument with Jackie Stewart, who is telling Senna he is a dangerous driver and the great answer Senna gives even though English was not his main language, and the irony of Jean Marie Balestre acting like a dictator,as usual, but not really at that moment being one and making fun of it. Thank you blokes for the wonderful gift this film is for all who lived the times of Senna and all that will get to know about him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leaving the cinema after the screening of Senna, the cinephilic documentary of the Formula One driver tragically killed in the prime of his career, I knew I had seen something special. It just took a bit of time to justify, in an articulate manner, just why I had enjoyed it so much. I was impressed that a modern- day filmmaker (Asif Kapadia) could so astutely compile a documentary in the same style as that of the Maysles brothers in Gimme Shelter. But unlike the latter 'rock-doc' (patent pending), chronicling the events of The Rolling Stones' infamously ill-fated Altamont concert, Senna focuses not on one key event, but a tumultuous life driven by a combination of pride, justice and God-given humility.Ayrton Senna took the F1 world by storm in the mid-80s, signing on as a member of the McLaren team alongside fellow hot shot Alain Prost. What started out as friendly competition turned into rivalry, and finally mutual hatred. While Prost was well aware of the politics surrounding the sport, taking care to not step on any toes, Senna was in the business only to win. As his career developed, Senna would go on switch teams, driving for Frank Williams and his technologically advanced machines. Unfortunately, Senna's concerns about the safety of his new car would prove correct, resulting in his death on a racetrack in Imola at age 34.Credit must be given to Kapadia for his extensive use of archive footage, characterising Senna as an incredibly complex, polarising figure. The man is far too humble considering all his achievements. He feels the presence of God during every race, but doesn't have any delusions about the very real possibility of death. It is this personal humility that prevents the film from falling into the trap of becoming self-serving and indulgent, focusing only on the high points of Senna's life. However, he is by no means a 'go-with-the-flow' bohemian. Ayrton is also shown as a fiercely competitive driver who wants nothing to do with insider relations, and who considers the theft of something that is rightfully his to be the greatest dishonour any man can perform. The selective, highly detailed use of archive footage (the 105 minute final product was whittled down from about 1500 hours of tape) has been edited brilliantly to the point that this, a piece of non-fiction, actually plays out with the drama and intensity of a scripted movie. Because this is Ayrton's story, and no one else's, some of the truth may have been lost in an attempt to give the film more energy, but we cannot be certain. Was Prost really so deceitful and egomaniacal that he would intentionally knock himself and his teammate out of the race to secure the World Championship? Was the reluctance of the Williams team to take Senna's concerns seriously the catalyst for his death? Only one man knows the truth, and he is in no position to divulge the answers.But speaking of energy, certain scenes have been included purely for audience engagement, not that this is a bad thing. Use of 'helmet-vision' allows us to see exactly what the driver himself faces with every exhilarating corner he turns. Vision of Senna's Grand Prix win in his home country of Brasil and later, the hearse driving him around the streets of Sao Paulo adorned by literally millions of fans carries with it heavy emotional weight. And just like Gimme Shelter, we are exposed to the shocking but incredible on-screen death of a real person. The film is given a circular theme of sorts, tying the first and last scene together in a poignant retrospective of not just one man's life, but the preciousness of life itself. It avoids every kind of genre cliché, eliminating the use of a narrator, talking heads, lame re-enactments and a slow-paced look at the subject's childhood. But the film's greatest achievement? It had me, a man who has never been an F1 fan by any length, hooked from the opening minute. This may well be the best film not to be nominated for Best Picture this season.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cloverfield of F1 Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One would have thought that the best movie ever made about F1 (this one) would b full, wall to wall, of filmic pyrotechnics shot in the way that FIFA commission world cup movies with super saturated, super slo-mo, super hi-def film set to a super hi-fi sound track.But it isn't.And there are two potential reasons for this. The first; artistic in that director, Asif Kapadia and Editor Chris King want it to eschew the flotsam of F1 and capture the essence of the man on a more personal level; the second for storytelling reasons.I think it's a bit of both because what makes this documentary so successful is it sets out to essentially tell us a right ripping yarn that's not distracted by special effects.I'm not an F1 buff. I'm about average in terms of my on-off interest in the sport. At the moment Bernie Ecclestone has successfully moved my button firmly to the off position.So I don't write this through rose tinted spectacles. I comment only as a film lover.This documentary is set in a golden era where the baddie was not Ecclestone (he barely appears) but the then F1 director. Jean Marie-Balestre, who's almost xenophobic and certainly nepotistic support of fellow Frenchman Alain Prost is a key plot device.Much of the film follows the central battle for supremacy between "the Professor" Prost and Senna and it's fascinating.Not once, but twice, were world championships decided on extremely dogy collisions between the two men.This is discussed in an interview between Jackie Stewart and Senna in which Stewart (possibly the most arrogant Scotsman ever to have set foot on planet earth) challenges the fact that Senna has had more accidents than all of the previous World Champions put together. Perhaps deliberately Senna responds modestly and calls him Stewart (in what looks like a put down that would have stuck in old big heads craw).But the reason for the question is fundamental to the nature of Senna himself. His sense of invincibility comes from his deep set belief in God, and this core motif is an important insight into the man and his motivation.God should probably have been credited as a supporting actor role in the film.What's interesting is that virtually nothing of his private life is discussed in the movie. Not even his brief relationship with, and engagement to, a 15 year old girl. Because this is a film single-mindedly about man, machine and God.The third reel which deals largely with his death and his legacy is heart rending. The footage leading up to the ill fated moment at Imola in 1994 when God deserts him is so nerve-shredding that you cannot bear to see what is coming. But when you do it is so brief and so brutal that it's gone before you know it. There are no reruns, no slo-mo, no gratuity.He just dies. And we move on. (Fighting back tears).Ironically to the sight of Prost as pall bearer as a nation grieves and then, in the credits, we see that Prost is a Trustee of the Senna Foundation.Ironic or poetic? It's hard to say.So, no big budget pomp and circumstance, no overblown hero worshiping, just a right good story, well told and gripping from first frame to last.So, fork out your hard earned cash and visit one of the limited number of cinemas where you can catch this wonderful film in what will almost certainly be a very brief run.Oh, not once do you hear either Damn Hill or Nigel Mansell utter a single word. Another good reason to go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is so f**king unfair, miss you Mr. Senna</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I accidentally began watching during the last part of the 1986 F1 season, I was immediately hooked and would set my alarm to watch the races at 5 am on those Sunday mornings... It was and still is my church! I wish I had known more about this fantastic human being and supernatural driver... I have rarely missed a race over the past 25 years. I watched this doc , so riveted, awed, and nervously scared as I knew the end of the movie was going to be horribly sad. I am not ashamed to say I cried, Senna was just an amazing human, just as much as an amazing racer ... Those years in F1, Prost vs Senna were simply surreal, I wished I had appreciated what I was watching at the time, but then again 25 years of reflection makes everything clear.I have no doubt that would have stolen a few of those 7 WDC from Mr Schumacher and would have thrilled us all the while... I can't tell you how heartbroken I am over his loss, the pain of everyone who loved him felt, his entire country's grief, and the fact that too many good people die young while some evil people can live decades beyond their welcome. :(I cannot say anything bad about this doc except, the ending sucked!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Senna the best documentary I have ever watched!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to preface this by saying, I don't know anything about Formula One racing... not a thing. This documentary was so much more than about a race car driver, it was about a man, that didn't believe in politics, he believed in himself and God and was a great human being who has to this day helped millions and millions on under privileged kids.The pain and suffering this guy went through to do what he loved puts life and it's struggles into perspective... "get busy living or get busy dying... damn right." Most of the other drivers disliked him, because he was the best that ever lived; even the bonehead Jackie Stewart... what a lame guy to pile on when everyone was against, Senna. The people; by the millions loved this man, because he went full speed all of the time and never held back or slowed down.I don't ever have to watch another driver in Formula One, because I know this guy was the best and will always be the best. He went out at the top of his game, in a God-awful engineered race care. This guy raced peddle to the metal above and beyond anyone who has ever raced or will race again.For not knowing a thing about Formula One or the man, "Senna" this is a break-through documentary and the best I have ever seen. I have never watched a documentary that made me cry and this one did. Hats off to everyone involved in this film, I feel lucky to have been a part of watching it. Thank you, sincerely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a F1 fanatic or even fond of cars, I however, am very passionate about high-quality documentaries and this one is the best I have seen so far. It is quite impressive how the narrative flows ever so subtle, and the viewers become completely mesmerized by the incredibly life that this magnificent character led. The documentary not only intimately introduces us to the backstage of the F1 environment, but to his family life. We observe how Ayrton was not only an extraordinary race car driver, but had impeccable moral and ethical values. His story is so heartfelt that you are left thinking about his life long after you've finished watching the documentary. I would personally like to thank all the people who made this movie possible, for it has been a wonderful experience and a memorable one. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched this film a couple of hours ago and I enjoyed it immensely. I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed every second of it. I was due to watch this with my father but he passed away before we got the chance to do so. I took his ashes with me though. He would have wanted to be there. He would have loved this film.Ayrton Senna wasn't only a fantastic driver but he was a fantastic person as well. He did so much for charity and his foundation still continues to raise money.I would recommend this film to everyone. You definitely don't have to be a motor sport fan to enjoy this film.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based purely on the subject matter, being an avid amateur Formula One historian, especially with regards to Senna, I guess I know too much about the subject matter to not overlook the flaws, omissions, and half truths.So I started to judge it as a pure documentary film, and I was not sure what the aim and purpose of the film actually was. It wasn't to tell of the life story of Ayrton Senna, as the narrative rarely ventured outside the world of Formula One. Despite the marketing media, it wasn't about why Ayrton Senna is regarded by many as the greatest driver that ever lived, as there was not discussion about his relative merits compared against other greats. It certainly wasn't an impartial account of Ayrton's time in F1, as there were only one moment of criticism (other than those from the villains of the piece, Prost (unfairly portrayed here) and Balestre) which came from Sir Jackie Stewart, which was never explored once Ayrton's gave his weak rebuttal. Furthermore, I felt the film lost its way after the rivalry with Alain Prost lost its intensity and it couldn't get to the end fast enough.A good evening's entertainment, but one that I don't think would have been diminished had I seen it on TV as an hour special on the 3 year rivalry between Senna and Prost, which is when the film was at it's strongest, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Senna" (2010) is an amazing documentary about a legend of F1 Ayrton Senna. This is truly remarkable and fascinating documentary that plays more like a great movie. The great director Asif Kapadia paced this movie superbly - at running time 1 h 40 min i was glued to my screen during a whole time, and that is more powerful because i'm not a fan of F1, don't ever watched it, but this is the power of "Senna" - you don't have to be a fan of sport to appreciate this truly remarkable movie.Overall, whether you like F1 or not, "Senna" is simply one of the best documentary movies i have ever seen. It is very informative, superbly paced, intriguingly and superbly crafted recreation of life Ayrton Senna and by the end it is impossible to not to be moved. Great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't Expect This Movie To Be A Real Tearjerker by Vicente E. Garcia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the life of a three-time World Formula One Champion Ayrton Senna ? who died in a car crash in 1994. Directed by Asif Kapadia, this documentary film will literally bring you to tears.I - Vicente E. Garcia thought to rent one out even though I am not a race car fan due to its amazing review and heartwarming critics. So I told myself to give it a shot. I came home late and tired because of my work (but no need to tell more stories about that) and I just want to have some relaxation because it's Friday Night. I thought maybe watching this documentary film can inspire me. I was totally wrong! I thought it was a feel-good film about the life of the most beloved Formula One driver full of inspirations but it is more than that. I literally cried all throughout the film. I cannot help to think that Ayrton Senna just died in that way after he was leading for his fourth World Championship! Asif Kapadia's film is not your usual documentary. I just expected Senna's friends and loved ones being interviewed in the living room and just reminiscing their good old days with him, but it =was never like that. It doesn't even have the traditional formula of different interviews with a narrator telling the whole thing. How the film was shown is so honest. Made out of purely Senna's archive footage, it created a subtle yet powerful intimacy with Senna as a subject. The way they used only archive materials and old interviews makes the film more natural and shows the human side of the most loved man in this sport.He is just a good looking boy in a wealthy family that can afford to enter him in a European Championship. He was just spectacular even at a young age: a phenomenal breakout athlete from Brazil with just an amazing style of racing. He clearly didn't show any sign that he is going down anytime soon until he made it to Formula One. His journey garnered him so many fans and top rivals too in the track. He has been voted as the best and most iconic Formula One driver of all time by different motor-sport, clearly he hasn't been away from the spotlight even though he is gone.My heart was truly devastated when I saw Williams (Senna's car) crashed at the Tamburello corner on lap 7. As he was being extracted after two minutes of crashing, I feel like I am in the San Marino Grand Prix too. As the red flag was being waved (which means there's an accident), I can't help to feel sorry for everyone.This film is not only the best documentary when it was released but also it is one of the most legendary sports films of all time. Even if you aren't a racing fan or even a sports enthusiast, this movie will still linger deep within you. It is engrossing and so beautifully crafted, I am sure that you'll salute Senna too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the car racing video games very much, but I find it boring to watch them on TV (not to mention that I hate driving in the real life), so I was not interested in the Formula 1 races during the '80s, when they were at the pinnacle of the popularity. However, some friends of mine LOVED the most important figures from that sport, such as Alain Prost, Michael Schumacher...and specially Ayrton Senna (1960-1994). That's where my knowledge about that famous pilot begins and ends, so I started watching the documentary Senna with low expectations. And even though it will undoubtedly be more appreciated by the fans of the car racing sport, I have to admit that the film managed to keep me interested.On the technical aspect, I found Senna to be a well made and investigated documentary. As I said, my knowledge about Formula 1 is very limited, so I could not say whether director Asif Kapadia was genuinely impartial, or if he took dramatic licenses to make his film more interesting. Anyway, I liked this documentary, even though I have to admit I found it a bit dull when it puts the focus on Senna's personal life. I think that the reason of that is because the narrative thread, which is the pilot's obsession to triumph in the tracks, gets lost on those moments.As I previously said, Senna is a documentary which will be mostly appreciated by the fans of the car races. I was left with the impression that Kapadia did not want to make more people fan of the Formula 1, so he does not spend any time describing the organization of the sport (What's the difference between Grand Prix and Championship?), nor explaining its rules (for example, there is a debate about "cones against wheels" I did not understand at all). However, I have to admit that despite my apathy for the sport, I had good time watching Senna, and it left me moderately satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He mentions death and God a lot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A worthy documentary style montage of Senna's F1 career with just few things strangely left out, 'Little Senna', and definitely not enough Murray Walker or crashes that the medium of cinema deserves! The atmospheric element of high speed racing is captured wonderfully by the on board video from the drivers cockpits edge. When this is edited with the external broadcast images it makes for compelling viewing, especially as we build up to the known climatic ending. The Prost / Senna rivalry was an essential part of Senna's career story line and its neatly spliced together with the racing action, action that is not the main part of the imagery. Surprisingly this doesn't detract the film from being a story of a racing drivers tragically short career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone blessed to have witnessed the Senna Era, I found the film extremely disappointing the family footage was very grainy and in many instances didn't add much to the storyline. Very little footage was actually shown of his races, his pure genius as a driver seemed to become lost in the story line of politics and double dealing and while all of that was true and Ayrton was cheated out of several world titles I don't feel that the film did justice to his driving and the younger generations have missed out on something very special.Ayrton was the greatest driver formula has/will ever see and the film failed to to fully bring home the brilliance of the man and his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attention to detail is what made Senna and fails this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the film, but the attention to detail that made Senna such a force in F1 was, ironically, lacking in the documentary. For instance, given that people who see this film will probably quite like cars and motorsport and know a little about them, didn't the director think that the overlaid soundtrack of engine noises should synchronise with the images? I can't think of anything more irritating that being on-board with the greatest driver of all time, only to see that his acceleration and braking and gear changing are not in-synch with the engine sound. Someone has pinched random snippets of sound (from the wrong type of car) and overlaid them onto Senna's car.Worth seeing, but not a work worthy of 9/10 as others have voted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Senna as a top-notch competitor and his own worst enemy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen this film twice now, I see conflicting information, conflicted people, and feel the same about this documentary.Senna was a brilliant driver and was extremely competitive. He also had an ego the size of Alaska. He was also his own worst enemy on the race track and off.Was he right about the F1 bureaucrats working against him? I see paranoia there, and his feeling that everyone was against him. Not so despite knowing how F1 politics works. Senna wanted it all to work the way HE wanted the system to function, The competition between him and Prost is somewhat startling. Twice they tangled at the end of a race season to claim a world championship. Who was "zoomin'" who? Did Prost get in the way of Senna each time and cause the crashes? I see Senna causing them in an attempt to get his way on the track , just like he did off the track fighting the F1 suits.Playing by the rules in such a dangerous sport, whether you think they're fair or not, is the point here. Senna got in his own way and it cost him dearly on and off the track.What's also interesting is how the McLaren Prost/Senna competition is similar to today's Red Bull F1 team rivalry between Weber and Vettel. The latter driver is very much like Senna, even in a recent race when the RB team told him back off from overtaking Weber, and Vettel ignored them and took the lead and the race away from Weber.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Documentary Film Making But Little Else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a well done documentary even if you are just a student of film and not an F1 fan. I am an F1 fan and so was excited to see all the old race footage. The editing was well done and I am amazed they had all that old footage almost as if this was a film waiting to eventually be. Senna seemed obviously a fanatic of racing and this is the first impression you get. He basically had no other desires in life if you take what was portrayed in this documentary. He apparently had a great desire to help children as well with his riches, which is always a good thing. But I got the impression the film makers were trying to impress us more than we could be impressed with the "man" Senna. I personally got the feeling he was a spoiled rich kid who insisted stubbornly on his way and not some kind bighearted individual who was in any way humble. We often epitomize these sports figures as great people. They are good athletes for sure but I think we can see from this film that is all they really are in most cases. Watch this documentary to see good documentary film making, but see if you don't feel that Senna was not as impressive of a human as he was a driver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>promotional documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is almost a "promotional documentary" of Ayrton Senna. In fact, when it is made by one of his fans, it is far away from a normal bias. Some of the 'politics' they talk in the movie where generated by Senna and his supporters to take his rivals out of the way. Senna was one of the best drivers ever, but his desire of being the best ever, make him use all means to achieve his purpose. To the crowds he was the best, at least of his time, but for those who follows Formula 1, and read a lot of specialized magazines about it, the opinions are quiet different. There is a big imbroglio around his disqualification in the Japanese GP of 1989, when he uses the escape road to rejoin the circuit, but in fact regulations say that the commissionaire's can't help to start the car when it was shut off. And that happens, but his supporters only focus on the chicane problem, which is ridiculous. There are 200 million Brazilians supporting his hero, claiming that he is the best of the world, no matter what the true might be. They even made one comics magazine, Senninha, in which the bad guy was Prost, always cheating, and call M. Schumacher, horse face, and blame him, making the German responsible for his death. The documentary is quiet good, only the exaggerated bias points of view, that make people who don't know Formula 1 in a more professional way, believe in some aspects that are very far away from the truth. That's why I call it a "promotional documentary". People use to like good Hollywood stories better than real stories, and that can make good movies or documentaries, but they are not very reliable.</fullReview>

Poor editing, awful interviews, hardly any attempt at fact finding and ballance was made. Senna's portrait so randomly done, he was hardly there, some shallow fairy tale figure instead. Commentators and interviewees were mostly insignificant, or had an undisputed agenda, or were just pompous. It looks like the director and producer not only ran out of talent, but weren't very motivated to begin with - lazy. Even the BBC piece on Senna was more complete and more professionally made, and that one is a bore .</fullReview>
