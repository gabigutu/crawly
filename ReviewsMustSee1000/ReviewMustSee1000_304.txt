		<shortDescription>Why does everyone hate this so much?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be first to admit that I hate teen comedies in general and typically frown upon most of them - I didn't even like "There's Something About Mary" too much, although I'm not sure it's really a "teen" film.I own all three "American Pie" films on DVD because they are one of the few teen series whose characters seem real and you actually feel empathy for. They're not awkward characterizations of real people without emotions - the movie takes time setting up their personalities, quirks, etc., and then places them in embarrassing situations. For example, the movie "Swingers." That telephone call Favreau makes is a painful experience for the viewer. Would it have been so painful if we hadn't gotten to know him throughout the movie? "American Pie" is kinda like that. It works well because of the characters. It's crude, yes. It's crass, very. It's sexist, maybe. But that's how guys are. It doesn't exploit these elements as many teen sex comedies do - some are moderately entertaining (like the Johnny Depp film "Private Resort") but unbelievable and basically just lots of skin. "American Pie" is better, one of the best of its genre.Everyone seems to hate the first sequel, which was released in 2001, a couple years after the original. Jim (Biggs) returns from college and hangs out for the summer at a beach house with his best pals. But with Stiffler (Seann William Scott) there, it's not too easy because they soon end up in more embarrassing situations.This movie is very similar to the original and normally I have a problem with this. Basically all the scenes are "updates" on scenes that existed in the original. E.g. the lesbian strip over the walkie-talkies, the incident with the glue, the whole thing with Stiffler's mom and Finch.Nevertheless it is effective, entertaining and funny. The characters are given more room to develop and believe it or not, I think I like this better than the first film. (The third is probably my favorite, if only for the focus on Stiffler and the introduction of Fred Willard, one of the great character actors of our time.) "American Pie 2" is somewhat recycled and some people may find it one of those "pointless" sequels, but I liked it, and this is coming from a guy who typically loathes these films - so considering I'm giving this seven stars, that says quite a lot. Either I'm out of my mind or there's something about these films that's just more accessible and likable than others in their genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To make things blunt, I laughed my butt off. I went and saw the movie downtown Seattle the night it opened at the Cineplex Odean at midnight...that was the best crowd I've ever seen a movie with. I could usually tell what was coming, but I was still shocked when it actually happened. I'm usually pretty conservative when it comes to movies, but the American Pie movies have been two of my favorite movies ever. The second movie takes over at the end of the first year of college. The first scene can be figured out by seeing the previews, but there were still a lot of surprises in the movies.There are a lot of great scenes at Stifler's party, and I was surprised to see that not only were the main characters back, but most of the supporting characters were back as well (remember the two guys from the M.I.L.F. scene?....they were in the second movie as well). Even Stifler's brother is in the movie.The movie is pretty shocking, but still very funny, I think my favorite part involved Petey. I think everyone needs to see this movie, from junior high aged and older...its destined to be a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie in theaters and laughed out loud. Now, I rented the DVD. I can't say I got as many laughs as the first time, though, and I started to notice more flaws. At first I thought this movie was better than the original. Now I'm not sure. They both have great redeeming qualities that pretty much balance the scale.The two films movie at a similar rhythm. In the original, we opened with Jim's Dad walking in on him while masturbating. In the sequel, he walks in on him while he's having sex, only it's taken to the next level with the girlfriend's parents walking in as well. And we have the keg party, with a Steadicam shot following Stiffler around, who yet again gets into a mishap with bodily fluids. And of course, in homage of the famous Nadia scene from the original, we have the guys walking in on two lesbians.The laughs are still there, and there are some genuinely funny moments. I don't want to give them away, though the previews and some of the other reviewers probably already did.The cast still got it. Eugene Levy steals the show yet again as Jim's Dad. I do have to say, Stiffler's character got a little too obnoxious at times. It's often funny to hear his foul-mouthed insults, but by the hundredth time you hear him use the word "f**kface" it gets kinda old.I'm always going to hold the "American Pie" movies several notches above the standard gross-out teen comedies, because they have zest and originality. Not to mention they're done in a professional manner. The gags are as intelligent as they are crude, and delivered with exquisite timing. And to top it off, it's a heartfelt film that is not literally all about getting laid. I thought the original had more heart to it, but the sequel also has its heart in the right place.The music is great. The soundtrack is full of really cool songs, including "Smooth Criminal" by Alien Ant Farm. And be sure to check out the unrated DVD special edition. The commentary is cool and--unlike with the first "American Pie" unrated edition--there is some bonus footage worth checking out. The lesbian scene is extended significantly. In the theatrical version, there was only a brief nudity, but you get to see much more in this version.I'm still not sure if I would consider this movie better than the first, but it is one sequel that lives up to the original--and that's saying a lot!My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Brilliant Slice of Pie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think this movie would work, if you haven't seen the first. It relies too much on characters and story from the first encounter set one year earlier. This said it is a great sequel that simply picks up where the last film left off, it retains all the characters from the first film and places them in equally embarrassing and hilarious situations.Slick, funny and entertainingIf you've missed it, then check it out, but see American Pie firstIf you like it then see 'Road Trip' and 'Old School' as well8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A satisfying second slice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well here we are, back for more of the same antics we got in American Pie. There may be a sense we've seen this all before but somehow American Pie 2 really works. All the characters we know and love (or hate) from the original are back and they're constantly being placed into outrageous situations which will inspire gut-busting laughs. Even though we're going back over much of the same territory, the sequel is more consistently and explosively funny than the original. What could have easily been a pointless, unnecessary sequel actually manages to be something fresh, funny and appealing.As with the original the Jason Biggs character of Jim is the glue holding the film together. Everything revolves around him in one way or another. Where in the original film each of the main male characters came with his own romantic storyline this time around Jim takes center stage. Most of the female characters have been shunted to the sidelines here with Shannon Elizabeth, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Natasha Lyonne being mere bit players. Their absence doesn't hurt at all and may actually help by making the story more focused. This one's all about the boys with Jim and friends renting a summer home following their first year of college. Back for more hilarity are Chris Klein as Oz, Eddie Kaye Thomas as the increasingly bizarre Finch and Thomas Ian Nicholas as the comparatively dull Kevin. And even though none of the others like him the script finds a way to contrive to get Seann William Scott's juvenile, vulgar, obnoxious Stifler tossed into the mix. Where the other guys might go to the edge of what is appropriate Stifler is always willing to go careening over the edge and his antics are a hoot.If you thought nothing could be more embarrassing than what happened to Jim in the original film, just wait. And along to heighten the embarrassment is Jim's father, played wonderfully by Eugene Levy, who in trying to help inevitably just makes things worse. And the one female from the original who actually has a major role here, Alysson Hannigan as Michelle, also does a great job. Oh, the wacky things that go on at band camp. With a slew of familiar characters moving from one hilarious situation to the next, all backed by a winning soundtrack, American Pie 2 succeeds in equaling and even surpassing the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much plot, but who cares, it's funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie and got a lot of laughs out of it. It wasn't as good as the original, but then again, most sequels aren't. This movie is basically several funny skits all thrown together. And some of the jokes are just repeats from the original, but others are new. So, that's why this comedy works.But, why did they even bring the girls back from the original except for Michelle. Vicky, Nadia, Heather, Jessica added nothing to this movie. Each one of them only had a couple of lines. The guys are what makes it work. Jim and Stifler are the funniest of them all. And Jim's dad is great too.FINAL VERDICT: It's funny. It's raunchy. Its got lesbian and porn scenes. What more could you ask for from a comedy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as flat as some may think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this is (of course) a film for people who want to laugh (mainly at others screwing up). Especially Jim (Jason Biggs) seems to get himself in the most embarrassing situations over and over again. But there are other funny moments too, with the Stifmeister (Sean William Scott), Ozzy (Chris Klein), Kev (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finchy (Eddie Kaye Thomas). Mainly the film is about what moves people my age and any other age most, the opposite sex. All that obsessing and wondering about the other (does he / she like me, do I love him / her?) is really greatly portrayed and realistic. Of course the people in the film are all not too shabby looking and there are some sick and perverted moments in the film, but you really have to look at the bigger picture. You have to look past the babes, the booze and the parties. You have to look past that ?every guy's perfect summer' and see that this film is not about sex, it is not about being sexy and cool. This film is about being whoever you are, being true to yourself and your friends, but most of all it is about love. I mean the latter thing may not be true for all characters in the film (e.g. Steve Stifler), but it sure concerns the ?main characters' life (Jimbo's life). The rest of the film is however pure fun and freedom, that any college student hopes to get. I sure hope my first summer of being in college will rock like that. Can't wait to see the sequel. And again, I do not think I have to force someone to make a sequel.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually found the first movie in the series to be an okay coming-of-age comedy that was mischaracterized by many viewers and reviewers as solely a gross-out piece. The first one wasn't; this one is.While the first movie featured a set of interacting story lines that complemented each other, this one has no story line at all. What plot there is exists solely for the purpose of stringing together a few random skits. "I'll just pop over to band camp for a few minutes a do some funny business with a trumpet!"In fairness, some of the skits are amusing. Others remind me of those awful mid-period SNL skits where you could see the actors waiting desperately for the commercial. The twist with the "band camp girl" in the first movie was funny. But somebody on the screenwriting team here doesn't understand the concept of a "joke." You've got your set up, then your punch line. Then you move on to another joke. It's really not that funny to stand around and repeat variations on the punch line (unless your sense of humor is in the "Ha ha! she said f---!" vein).More fairness: the actors and the director here are capable. For the most part, it's a craftsmanlike piece of work, but an uninspired one.A year of college hasn't matured any of the characters. One wonders what future sequels will be like. I suspect "American Pie 9" will wind up as something similar to the slide show Jack Nicholson presents near the end of "Carnal Knowledge."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A base, but moral, tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caution: spoilers.Before I begin, a few points about taste and suitability. Firstly, this film is crude, childish, and by many people's standards obscene: it features bare breasts, swearing and numerous attempts at pre-marital sex. Secondly, if you were expecting Citizen Kane, they you have bought the wrong video. Direction and cinematography are not the main aims of this work of art. Humour, however, is.And it is funny. Puerile, base, vulgar and unkind, but funny. Characters get things jammed up their bottoms, glue hands to genitals, and more. It is like a Donald McGill seaside postcard, enlarged and moved to America.The plot is simple: five friends sit in a beach-house planning a party, each with his own girl problems to solve come party time. Next door are two pretty, tactile ladies who might be lesbians. Comedy ensues.The film divides itself between our hero, Jim, preparing for the arrival of a Russian girl who he believes to be a "sure thing", and the others in the house. There are two serious subplots: one of the friends has a girlfriend who lives far away, and another is trying to get back with his ex.Much of the comedy relies on whether you can stand the characters and stomach what happens to them. The odious Stifler, for instance, seems too much a bully to be likable, and the scenes where he is humiliated gain something from this. Jim, on the other hand, is basically decent, and whilst laughable, we want him to succeed.I found the two serious subplots of little interest: I am older than the ideal age-group, and they don't really seem very applicable to me now. Were I 18, they might well do, although they do weigh the comedy down. Also, perhaps deliberately, the character chasing his ex appears simply wretched rather than likable. Still, viewers may learn something.Which brings me onto the fact that this film is, basically, moral. Forget the sex and farting jokes: at base, the film is broadly correct about the way men and women behave, and falls on the side of decency. The central relationship between Jim and Michelle (an excellent turn from Alyson Hannigan, at once weird, funny and sympathetic) is sweetness with a thin veneer of crudity, and shows the real heart of the film. Excellent also is Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad, embarrassing and hilarious, but protective and sincere. For silly, throwaway entertainment, this scores highly. If you are a vicar or Pauline Kael, don't bother, but if you are looking for a film that is simple fun, this does well. The characters and subplots make it uneven - I often ended up waiting for the action to switch to better characters - but there are moments of real hilarity so long as you can tolerate the rudeness that comes with them. This film will inevitably offend and disgust more prudish viewers, but for someone willing to watch silly vulgarity without throwing all moral sense to the wind, it is one of the classics of its type. Besides, morality is what you make it. To my mind, compared to the gross, gloating, sado-masochistic excess of The Passion of The Christ, it seems wholesome indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely a Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If a movie does well enough to get a sequel, you would think that means the writers are good enough to come up with more material, no problem. With this movie, though, they didn't.American Pie 2 was probably the weakest of sequels in a summer full of sequels. The jokes are the same, maybe changed just a little. The characters have nothing no new motivations- they are all just battling the same things as in the first movie. From Stifler's mom to parents catching Jim in personal moments, the sequel steals, er, "borrows" from American Pie 1 without a second thought.The result? One dumb movie. First of all, Jason Biggs (Jim) is horrible to watch. You just want to punch him for being so stupid. The scene where he plays the trombone? Not the least bit funny. People laughed- WHY? Finch is annoying as ever, constantly speaking like he is 50- not in a funny way- but in a really bothersome way that sees him featured for a good part of the movie when he is better as a supporting character- a very small supporting character. Kevin is a pointless character, he doesn't do anything except talk to his old girlfriend Vicki the whole time, constantly asking her to "Catch up and hang out." This also means Vicky is a waste of time, as is Oz, who somehow became a complete neutered male from the beginning of the first film. He is an entirely different person even from the end of that one- does anyone care? Jessica and Heather- great to see people from the first one, but do they add anything? No.The only thing this movie does is play Stifler well. He essentially has to strap the movie on his back and carry it because everyone else is boring. How does he do this? He says the F-word- a lot. This even loses humor after 50 times, so by the end you wish you never spent the 6.50 to watch this junk. The worst part is when the opening scene runs and people have seen the previews and still laugh very hard- why, people? It doesn't make sense. Out of all of the scenes in the movie the audience has definitely seen that before.AND YET, between the predictable script, the rerun jokes, the low brow bail out humor (guys kissing, football down low, little kid swearing, monkey drinking alcohol), and the painful acting of Jason Biggs, American pie 2 will somehow make a lot of money. It makes you wonder....IF they make a third one, I hope they invest a little time in writing characters that we care about and get rid of characters we don't (Shermanator, Jessica, etc.). Be new and inventive, just don't insult us by showing us the first movie with a different title. 1.5 STARS</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Pie 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first film was a big box office hit and a highly successful teen movie, and many of the fans must have been thrilled that every member of the cast of the original were coming back for a sequel, from director J.B. Rogers (Say It Isn't So). Basically Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have all returned to their hometown in East Great Falls, Michigan after finishing their first year of college, and naturally they attend the party hosted by still oversexed Steve 'Stifmeister' Stifler (Seann William Scott), but this is cut short by the police. With nowhere to party because of the police Kevin finds out that there is a beach house in Grand Harbor, Michigan, so the four friends, plus Stifler for rent, pack their bags and make themselves comfortable, finding work as painters and decorators to pay the rent and prepare for the big party. Kevin is feeling awkward with ex-girlfriend Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum (Tara Reid) back in town and he feels may want to get back with her. Oz is missing girlfriend Heather (Mena Suvari) who is away in Spain and they keep their relationship going with attempted phone sex. Finch have discovered the sexual art of Tantra to keep in his desires as he waits patiently for the opportunity to possibly get with his goddess, Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge). Jim is worried because Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) will be returning, and he feels his lack of sexual experience will put her off, so he seeks sex tips and advice from his prom date Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan). Stifler is fascinated to see that the painted house owners Danielle (Denise Faye) and Amber (Lisa Arturo) may be lesbians, and with Jim and Finch he breaks in to find his proof, and they return and catch them they decide to mess with the boys, giving them homosexual acts in exchange for them doing it, e.g. the girls kiss if the boys kiss, and for a while they go with it. Jim's confidence problems only get worse when Stifler provides him lubricant, and distracted by pornography he unintentionally grabs super glue he used earlier to masturbate, and he ends up with his hand glued to his penis, the other to the porn video, at hospital, supported by his Dad (Eugene Levy) he is told there will be swelling for a while, and he is shocked to see Nadia arriving early. While preparations for the big party get underway, Jim has Michelle pretend to be his girlfriend until everything is ready and he has all the tips he needs, and with his penis back to normal they fake breaking up on the day of the party. So the party gets underway, Kevin is crushed Vicky has a boyfriend, Finch disappointed earlier that his goddess was not coming spends his time talking philosophically to various women, Oz has Heather surprise him having taken an early flight, and Jim lets Nadia down saying that he realises he has feelings for Michelle. The party is a big success, all the guests drinking and dancing with joy, with Jim and Michelle becoming boyfriend-girlfriend, Kevin and Vicky happy as friends, Oz and Heather still happy together, and Stifler ecstatic in bed with Danielle and Amber who turned out to be bisexual, even Chuck 'The Shermanator' Sherman (Chris Owen) scoring with Nadia. The end sees the boys packed and ready to go home, promising that if they can they will do the same again every summer, and Finch is happy to say Stifler's Mom, real name Janine, pop by and pick him up to go and have sex again. Also starring Natasha Lyonne as Jessica, Molly Cheek as Jim's Mom, Justin Isfeld as Justin - 'MILF' Guy #1, John Cho as John - 'MILF' Guy #2, Eli Marienthal as Stifler's Brother, Casey Affleck as Tom Myers, Joelle Carter as Natalie, Bean's Larry Drake as Natalie's Dad, Lee Garlington as Natalie's Mom and Austin Powers' Kevin Cooney as Doctor. The cast are still as likable as ever, Biggs more foolish than before, Thomas weirder with his holding in of an orgasm, Scott much more foul-mouthed and sex-obsessed, and Levy in his moments still amusing and embarrassing. The story is simple, just teens getting back together to drink a lot, have sex and party hard, but the slapstick and dialogue jokes still work when they need to, the highlights are Stifler being peed on, the terrible trumpet playing, the phone sex scene, the lesbian fun and the super gluing, it is a fun comedy. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horny pie served up smashingly well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Raunch used to be so simple! You'd go see Porky's, you knew you were gonna see some T&amp;A. Oh, and maybe a small heartfelt lesson about how people are generally good, even those who are different from us, as long as we have the same goal of getting laid in mind. Those were such wonderful days! Now, everyone's more jaded, even (especially) the kids. You show a kid the shower scene from Porky's, and he'll love it, but I bet after the first few viewings it won't be as much fun. Kids need something new all the time. Now, American Pie is an R-rated film, so at least the intended audience isn't the teen crowd, exactly, but then neither was Porky's (or any of its knock offs). The cast from the original American Pie is reunited. The time is now one year later, and the gang's home from college for the summer. Jim (Jason Biggs) still has his sexual hang-ups. Remember Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), the band-camp girl? Jim went to the prom with her, and she didn't talk to him after that. But don't worry, she's at band camp again and figures prominently in this movie. It seems Nadia, the exchange student whose escapades with Jim made the Internet, is back in the country and is ready to hook up with our hapless lead character. What to do! Jim still has no experience. The guys try to help him out by renting a lakeside cottage for the summer. Meanwhile, Stifler's (Seann William Scott) still trying to hump everything in sight; Oz (Chris Klein) is remaining celibate while his girlfriend Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) is in France; Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is still lusting after the legendary mother of Stifler, after their much-talked-about union at the party in the first movie; and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is aching after his breakup with Vicky (Tara Reid). There have been no drastic character changes, either; everyone's as you'd expect after a year of college. Which means, of course, that all the guys are hornier than a sex addict in a penny whorehouse. But that's what drives raunch comedies - the testosterone of single-minded males. As in real life, although the males in the movie have grown up, they still think like high school kids. (And someday this nubile cast will learn that that particular characteristic never really leaves the male of the species!) But while the theme of the movie is sex, sex, and sex, hidden under the layer of bombast and teenage oversexdrive is a theme of tenderness and fallibility. When kids graduate high school, they think they know it all. "Bring life on!" they chortle with glee. "We know it all!" But there's a certain vulnerability that everyone feels at some point, and that's the issue of sexual conduct for the first time. And here's where American Pie 2 deviates from other raunch films. In those yesteryear movies, there was always tremendous pressure for one schlub to get lucky once and for all. I'm talking huge peer pressure! But in this movie, while all of Jim's friends want him to get laid, they never, ever make him feel like he's below average or beneath them because he's not experienced what they have. And that, to me, makes this a very special movie - although, rest assured, it's still as raunchy as the first one. In addition, the ending is so unlike those earlier raunchfests that you actually sit there and admire the screenwriters for not, for once, pandering to the least common denominator. But hold on! Don't look at me like that! You're thinking that if it has good intentions and good messages, how much fun could it really be? Trust me, if you enjoyed the pastry coitus in the first movie, you'll get a kick out of Jim's misadventures in this one, too. The writing is way above par for movies in this genre, and the cast is both lovely to look at more than capable in their deliveries and actions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it's a sequel and yes, it does feel like many of the gags are just reheated and thrown into the mix, but that doesn't mean that the 2001 sequel to the brilliant "American Pie" is not any good... on the contrary, it's an excellent sequel picking up on a year after the events of prom night in the first film, as Jim, Oz, Kev, Stifler, Finch and the rest of the gang return home after their first year in college. Jim comes home after failing to have gotten laid all year, and is as awkward with women as ever before. Oz is still madly in love with Heather - the only two out of the original film with any real stable relationship, while Stifler is still the loud, obnoxious but lovable asshole that he always was. Kev is still not over Vicky, while Finch can never get over that night he spent with the 'goddess', also known as Stifler's mom. The gang find themselves back home at house parties full of high school kids, and they can't help but feel like they don't belong. Jim discovers that a certain 'video' is still making it's rounds on the internet, and as they become increasingly disillusioned with home, Kev comes up with a brilliant plan - following in his brothers and his friends footsteps, they will go on summer vacation to a lakehouse where they'll party all summer... and try and get laid. Many of the gags are recycled or under the guise as something else, but the importance of friendship, the crude jokes and the embarrassing situations are still all there and as sequels go, "American Pie 2" is pretty damn good. But that being said, I still think that the next sequel, "American Wedding" is the best sequel in the entire franchise. I'm really looking forward to "The Reunion" which is to be released in the spring of next year, bringing back all the original characters of the series before it went crap with the arrival of "Band Camp" in 2005. The cast reprise their roles with Jason Biggs as Jim, Sean William Scott as the brilliant Stifler and Alyson Hannigan is back as the band geek, Michelle, who Jim tracks down to get advice and pointers from when he hears that Nadia is coming back to see him. Many people dislike this sequel, and although I can see why, I still always find this to be as enjoyable and on matching terms with the original in every way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>they always say sequels are worse than there originals and i will definitely agree with this one. i think because they had made a blockbuster out of the first one that they quickly put together a second without really thinking about itthe film is still very funny but just doesn't have the vibe of what the first one had. plus the whole band camp part was boring. the cast are still pretty good, seann william scotts character "stifler" still makes me laugh. he's the saviour of this film i think.everyone still should watch this because it is still an OK film............. 5/10.........j.d seaton</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slight Decrease In Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie 2 (2001, Dir. James B. Rogers) The whole gang are back and shows that they are as close as ever. They decide to get even closer, by spending the summer together at a beach house. They decide to hold the biggest party ever to be seen, even if the preparation doesn't always go to plan. Especially when Stifler, Finch and Jim become more close to each other than they ever want to be and when Jim mistakes super glue for lubricant.When the 'American Pie' gang returns, everyone knows that they will be expecting gross out humour and wild characters, and this movie doesn't disappoint. All the wonderful characters are back, including Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad, who steals every scene he is in. Stifler is his usual self and Finch is more entertaining this time. A lot of the female side of cast have a reduced role in this movie. Alyson Hannigan's role is expanded, whilst the others only appear in a few scenes. The jokes again are well written, but like the first film, are not the most cleanest of jokes. If you saw the first movie, then you would know what kind of adult material is found in this film. Although, the film holds up well alongside it's predecessor, it had a slight decrease in the comedy. Still, it's a fun and entertaining movie to watch."The force is strong with that one." - Stifler (Seann William Scott)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather dull......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie 2 is a clear anchor for the concept of mediocre movie sequels. The stars of the first film are present, but in many cases, it is hard to see why. Number three (American Wedding) loses most of the actors with strong outside careers, but frankly, is a better film.On the positive side, while this movie is lackluster, it is not a painful sort of flop. We all have seen films where the directer and writers attempted something that failed, and failed in a way annoying to the audience. In this case, one mainly gets the impression that the writers didn't try very hard. The funny scenarios that a movie like this is built around are actually fairly well done, although they are a bit contrived.The real problem with this movie is that it is built around such a simple, nay primitive plot, that the movie becomes dull. Watch this if you absolutely must see all of the characters in the first film, but otherwise, number three (American Wedding) and distant relative "Band Camp" are superior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to make a successful failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How to explain what went wrong with, say, American Pie 2, The Mexican, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Captain Corelli's Mandolin? And more, and more. More or less recent American movies which each cost more than 20 independent productions. Incredible casts lead by seasoned directors and producers, working from sometimes sophisticated scripts. The sad fact is that these movies couldn't even survive their original first week end hype, deservingly with that.It is hard to pinpoint a common ailment for those creations, but a listing of their respective shortcomings could at least point in a general direction.Of course they were vehicles of some sort. Whether they were sequels attempting to cash in the success of their illustrious predecessors, a visual version of a recent literary triumph, or, simply, an established star medium (or a combination of two of the above), most of the recent dismal failures were rarely an example of an original conception. Not to say, naively, that all copies are doomed to trash and any new ideas should garner laurels; after all, as all newcomers know, most first movies look and feel clumsy and rarely see the light of day in a theater if they're ever filmed in the first place. There are probably more Ed Woods out there than you have Tim Burtons, but at least these productions don't cost $50 millions and don't attract (inter)national attention.American Pie 2, for example, followed on the steps of the hugely successful #1, which was funny although predictable, pleasant and charming despite (or because of being) conservative in tone and idea. AP2 was absolutely none of the above: rarely triggering a laugh (unless smearing your privates with Crazy Glue is an idea that never ever even crossed your mind: what kind of individual are you?), the comic rhythm was so off and the jokes given so much more time than needed that it was like watching Sharon doing stand up with Arafat: embarrassing and you wish you skip to the next sketch. The radio communication/2 lesbians joke (wrong word) reminds you of a joke told by a 5 year-old: lumbering towards some kind of a punch line which will never come. The cast and the production are just going through the motion, knowing perfectly well that the movie will make money whether the stupid lines they utter hit the funny bone or not: a following is there, waiting to disburse their hard-earned $10.00 (plus soda, popcorn, parking, babysitter, and the internet connection to make their opinion known to an awaiting public). I'm not anymore prude than the guy next door, but when will Hollywood understand that the simple fact of saying the `F' word does not, repeat not, provoke general laughter.Then comes the VHS/DVD street date where the good citizen rents (or, God forbids, purchases) the small black box (plus soda, popcorn?) and then turns the viewing into a religious experience, thanking the powers that be they he or she didn't pay the $10.00 at the plex.Of course, for all the existing sequels/prequels/remakes, you have exceptions: it is my understanding that Spider-Man is both a critical and popular success. But with movies like AP2, Hollywood is turning itself into its worst enemy, sabotaging its own efforts at luring future audience into the big house.</fullReview>

I really can't understand what kind of a movie is it...just a flip, or does it have an ambition to become a cult film for teenagers all over the world? The script is terrible, cast, not so bad for this type of movie, but all dialogues and jokes are so boringly predictable. I can't say that I expected something of this movie, but it really gives a sad picture (and of what I seen, untrue) of the American youth. If you're 20, then everything has to be about sex, right?

		<shortDescription>Gone is the social commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What made American Pie work as much as it did was the commentary on teenage sexual activity. "Don't rush in", was the message, "it's not worth it. Fall in love instead, and things will come naturally". Peppered with some suggestion about how to be a better lover, it had a point in there somewhere."2" does not. At all. Ever. It is gratuitous, stupid, juvenile, and crude. The jokes (the ones that aren't blatant repeats of the first movie - e.g., trumpet in butt vs. flute in female genitalia -or- penis in pie vs. hand glued to penis) are more toilet humor than guilty chuckle. The worst moment was the "Petey" scene, during which I was mildly amused until Jason Biggs proclaimed "and I have gigantic balls!". It was as if the record stopped. It made no sense, and was ridiculous.Also note that the women are conspicuously seldom in this film. Could it be that they saw the script, and gave little time to it? Could it have been that they thought a sequel was lame enough? For whatever reason they all but passed on this film (I assume they must've had obligations to appear, and so made the least of it), they were right in doing so. Let's see who gets better scripts in the coming years, Tara Reid and Mena Suvari - or Jason Biggs and Sean William Scott (of "Dude, Where's My Car" shame).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie 2 is not only a hilarious sex comedy but it is also an example of creative film making and great writing. However "AP2" does not come close to exceeding the accomplishments of the first film. The first installment was a landmark in the comedy genre. It was an attempt at the great American sex comedy. The second installment is not even close to being a self-contained sequel, as most of its raunchy jokes are dependent on the audience seeing the first film. Even the "new" jokes are recycled in a way, i.e. Stifler and urine, and Jim's dad walking in on him. Don't get me wrong this film is very very funny and is well worth the trip to the theater but as far as out doing the first one I have to say that it does not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, "American Pie 2" ranks in the circle of the pointless sequels that merely aim at exploiting the success of the first movies. I didn't watch the first "American Pie" (1999) film but I know the story: 4 students who are eager to lose their virginity before leaving high school. I've heard that they succeed in it. And then? Was it really useful to shot one sequel to a movie which topic didn't precisely require one?Well what I can say about this movie is that it contains a mediocre directing but also and nearly as usual in American teen-movies a humor that lacks sharpness. There are sinister gags that don't encourage laughter too. Must you add that the movie exudes a deep boredom and consequently leaves indifferent?To finish, I've got only three adjectives to qualify "American Pie 2": boring, uninspired and quite unfunny. I'd better not watch "American Pie: the wedding" (2003).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A really lousy sequel to the original dud. The first film is essentially reprised here, with similar jokes (bodily fluids disguised as other liquids, intercourse being interrupted by parents) and with the same unusually bogus characters, a bunch of rich white frat boys. Everything seems so contrived and convoluted that it's impossible to sympathize with actors like dweeby Jason Biggs, who can't get laid properly but still has the most gorgeous woman trying to bed him. And the other principals are either so outsized (like Seann William Scott as the obnoxiously unfunny Stifler) or lame (the impossibly good Oz, played by Chris Klein) that there's no possibility to connect and no reason to try. Only Eugene Levy, as Biggs' father, has some mildly humorous moments, but they're in his appearance and not in his lines. Teens will like the gross-out humor--this is who it's designed for--but it's a case of `been there, done that' and even they probably won't be clamoring for a trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second instalment in the American Pie series, American Pie 2 may lack the freshness of its predecessor and its story may be even more uninspired &amp; inferior in content than before but it's still an unabashedly funny, rip-roaringly hilarious &amp; downright amusing ride that has all the crude elements that made the previous one click.Picking up one year after the events that transpired in the first film, American Pie 2 follows Jim, Kevin, Oz, Finch &amp; Stifler as they regroup after their first year of college to spend the summer together at a beach house, where they are looking forward to hosting the greatest summer party ever. But once again, things don't go according to plan.Directed by James B. Rogers, American Pie 2 features a superficial plot with nearly same set of characters that inhabited the previous chapter and while it still doesn't add anything to their respective arcs, that part doesn't become much of an issue. There are a couple of truly memorable moments, the pacing is fine, and the performances from its reprising cast is fairly good.On an overall scale, American Pie 2 was probably crafted just to cash in on the success of the original and its inferiority in nearly every filmmaking department suggests the same but it also retains the raunchy humour, gives the Stifler character an added screen time which is a welcome move, and manages to be an enjoyable, entertaining &amp; satisfying sequel for the most part, if not all the way through.</fullReview>

Jason Biggs is preparing to meet Internet woman Nadia and taking lessons in love from that airhead from band camp. Seann William Scott returns as Stifler who sleeps with two women he originally perceived as lesbians. Directed by J. B. Rodgers who handles the material confidently but lacks the original touches given his other gross humour comedy the same year, Say It Isn't So. His cast pretty much get lost in the vulgarity losing the ideas that worked in American Pie. Biggs returns as Jim and crazy glues his hand to his crotch. Alyson Hannigan is amusing as the band camp girl but it is obvious that she and Jim will hook up. Scott as Stifler steals scenes but he is more or less the subject to much vulgar payoff particularly in a scene where he gets drenched in urine. Eugene Levy returns as Jim's dad but this time the role seems more like a prop for one-liners. Jennifer Coolidge plays Stifler's sexually permissive mother. American Pie is gross comedy but its adolescent sexual curiosity is relating to its target audience. American Pie 2 is complete with drab locations and probably should be drenched in urine.

Looking for a good idea, Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) turns to his brother (Casey Afleck) for advice. His brother suggest spending the entire summer in a beach house (paying for it by getting summer jobs painting houses) and throw a bunch of parties with the last one being the biggest. Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicolas, Eddie Kaye Thomas are all once great as the four best friends, however Sean William Scott totally dominates the male cast as the foul mouthed Stiffler. Tara Reid (whose weight fluctuates massively throughout the movie) is fine, Shannon Elizabeth is OK in a smaller role than the first room, but Mena Suvari isn't given as much to do this time around, which is a shame, but, overall, the girls are all good, however once again Alyson Hannigan steals the show from the other girls as the band camp geek Michelle.

		<fullReview>American Pie 2 is without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and my personal favorite from the series. Not only does it deliver great comedy, but also showcases the evolution of the characters and how they face their first summer back from college. This is something that I think resonates with a lot of people and it was one of the reasons why I loved it. So 1 year later, we see Jim, Kevin, Oz, Finch &amp; Stifler get back to hanging out and looking to spend the perfect summer by partying their asses off. For this they will have to move to the lakeside and rent a beach house in order to end their holidays with a memorable farewell party. Friendships will be tested, realizations will arise, as well as love, and in the end we get to find out if these group's bond was made stronger from the experience. For starters, this movie once again delivers in its trademark raunchiness with hilarious moments mainly involving Jim, but also Stifler. Storywise, we see the maturity most of these characters have garnered. I think the one that truly sees this in the best way is Kevin, as he is still clinging on to his old life, trying to be with Vicki and hanging out with his group. But Vicki only wants to be friends, and so Kevin learns that he must not live in the past, while also accepting the promising future he has. For me American Pie 2 is a great sequel to an already great movie. In fact, for me, it eclipses the original and makes for an even better experience. It's funny, disgusting and most of all entertaining in every aspect. Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The character you love are back together after one year of college. After realizing that Stifler's house is not the best party location, Jim, Kevin, Oz, Finch and Stifler move to a huge beach house for the summer, hoping to have summer to remember. As chaotic hilarity erupts, old flames and confusion about the future arise for the men too, in very feeling manners. Oz deals with a long distance relationship with Heather, Kevin is jealous at Vicki moving on and uncomfortable with the feelings he still has for her, Finch, really wants a future with Stifler's mom and Stifler himself learns about sex after high school. But the central story is Jim preparing himself for Nadia's return. Michelle teaches him how to be a ladies man and fall in love in the process. This is somewhat different from the first. This is one to take seriously, but there is more comedy that is more funny and the general story isn't as strong. But character development is taken one step further and you fall in love with the characters that much more. With character development this strong, stories this nice, and comedy this funny, there is no way one could resist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even better than the first American Pie. American Pie 2 is the freshest, funniest and dirtiest slice out of them all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! I honestly think American Pie 2 is better than its predecessor, and i really mean that in the most honest and strongest way possible. It's significantly better; and it's even funnier with dirtier moments and more laughable or 'laugh-out-loud' scenes. The guys return, only this time they're older and they're now in college, not high school. Basically, it's the next step forward. They're totally the same though; except they're not virgins and they're in college, of course. Jim gets caught having sexual intercourse with a girl in his college room - his mother and father walk in, and then her mother and father walk in. Haha. It's pretty hilarious, guys. Jim arrives home, to find it a bit "weird" and doesn't take much of a liking to it, all so quickly....it's slowly hitting him, more or less. His dad sees him looking at a picture he has of Nadia - and then says "Ah, the one that got away, huh, son?" .... he heard about the video at a PTA meeting (the internet situation from the first one. Haha!)From there onwards, and such, everything gets even funnier. Why? Uh, because they go on a trip to Grand Harbor - to stay there, and have a huge summer party with loads of people. It gets even funnier when they arrive, and some misleading, funny things happen - for Finch, of course. American Pie 2 sees the recurring roles of Christ "Oz" Ostreicher, Steve Stifler, Kevin Myers, Heather, Jessica, Vicky Lathum, Chuck Sherman, Michelle Flaherty, the milf guys and more. Top-notch, outrageous comedy that will have you dying with uncontrollable laughter. It's damn hilarious!10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Pie 2" is the second movie of the American Pie series and in this one we have the same cast and our story continues where the first one ended. And now we watch all the friends return to their homes after their first year in college.I believe that the first one was a little bit better than the second but these two movies are equally hilarious. I liked this movie because of the storyline and because of the cast who was the same with the previous movie. I also liked for one more time the interpretations of Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott who were fantastic and from girls I liked the interpretations of Alyson Hannigan and Shannon Elizabeth.Lastly I have to say that "American Pie 2" is a great comedy movie which shows us many true things about life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Friendships and Lesbians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The guys reunite after a year of college for their summer vacation. What makes this a good franchise is the friendships. It is more than the average sex romp.Jim (Jason Biggs) is pinning for Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) and get sex help from Michelle (Alyson Hannigan). Oz (Chris Klein) dutifully waits for Heather (Mena Suvari) who's away in Spain. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) can't get over Vicky (Tara Reid) who just wants to be friends. Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is still obsessed with Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge). The guys hang out at the beach house and Stifler (Seann William Scott) muscles his way in on the guys.The friendships are paramount in this, but the sex romp makes it memorable. It is impossible to forget the lesbians and the radios. It is funny every time I watch it. Less so is the glue incident. Like the pie incident in the first movie, it doesn't maintain its comedy after the shock value is gone.The production value is improved over the first movie. The parties seem a little bit overblown. I guess when they got a bit more money, they got a few more babes to walk around. The movie is as funny as ever. The shock of some of the pranks isn't as original. However, it's great to see the friendships continue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As A Sequel- Great! Stand Alone-Good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I love the first American Pie, and I stand by what I said in my review of the first that that these are not sex comedies, and that they have a lot of heart, but i felt that this was a little overly sentimental. I love that these movies have heart, and a good plots but i feel like this one tried a little too hard to remove itself from that culture. That being said this movie was hilarious and as a sequel, it's just about the best we could have expected. It has numerous good laughs, good writing, good acting, and it's another great bromantic comedy. I have to say that Jason Biggs delivery of the---well, let's just say "I glued myself to uh....myself" scene(in the trailer too, not a spoiler.) was terrific. If you're looking for a good laugh that is not at the expense of somebody, or just constantly going for the easy laugh this is your movie. It has a lot of gross out humor, but it also has a lot of more situation humor and complex humor. Is it as good, or influential as the first? Not a chance. But it is hilarious, true to the first, and it is a great movie to watch for a party night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best one out of the series no question.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to sugar coat it. This is some really really funny stuff. I mean scene after scene of non-stop laugh riot material. I enjoyed the first film, and I have seen, in some cases even suffered through the other films in the series. They are all pretty funny but nothing really compares to this one in my opinion.There are just so many hilarious parts to this movie, it's one of the few films I find myself coming back to again and again. Why? Laughter is good for the soul, so if you care about your soul on any level you owe it to yourself to watch this if you haven't already.As a side note this is probably the best date movie of all time as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do the ends justify the means?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels tend to be weaker than the originals. Even if they are still good movies, they can never recapture the magic that was seen the first time around. That is with a few exceptions. American Pie 2 is one of them. Not only is it funnier than the original but it allows for much more characters development and drama. Kevin's story about not wanting things to change from the way they were is incredibly relatable and and touching, the love story is much sweeter than most of the awful romantic comedies these days and you end up feeling emotionally satisfied by the end. Is it a powerful film? Not at all but the light drama in American Pie 2 really does make it shine. As for the comedy itself, I think what makes it funnier is that we are more familiar with the characters and seeing new things happen to them is very entertaining. Jim's Dad especially has more charisma than he ever has. Overall American Pie 2 is the perfect way to make a gross- out comedy. It almost gets a 10/10 but it's not exactly anything clever or profound so that's why I brought the rating down a notch. If you enjoyed the first than you have to see this movie. If not than it's probably best to stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always loved the first American Pie and this was a very good addition to the series. It stars all the original cast who are back for some partying and fun. This movie will always be one of my favorites it is truly hilarious.This movie is about Jim and his friends who go away for a summer to a beach house. The plan for the summer is to party as much as they can and have as much sex as they can( I know what else is new) funny misadventures happen along the way and it really is a fun ride.This movie is really good it had me laughing all the time. The cast does a great job and the writing is hilarious if you are a fan of the first one give this one a watch or even if you a big fan of comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie 2 (2001) ** (out of 4) The four buddies (and Stifler) from the first film are a year into college and decide to have fun during the summer so they go to a beach house where they plan on throwing a major party. American PIE 2 is your typical "Hollywood does something right and then screws it up." The original film was a very funny, smart and rather vulgar comedy that became a huge hit so of course another film was rushed into production and like so many sequels this film is just a watered down version of the first. What's so frustrating about this movie is that there's not a single thing here that's anywhere close to the original. I'd say the film even lost some of the guts of the original when it came time for the gross out humor. The big "joke" here is a scene clearly trying to imitate the web cam from the first. In this film three of the guys end up in the home of who they think are lesbians and the encounter goes out via some walkie talkies. This entire sequence might leave a small smile on your face but it's really not funny. Another wasted sequence that tries to be "shocking" but just comes off as lame is when Jim ends up grabbing some super glue and I'll let you use your imagination on what happens. For the most part the cast members are in fine form and they fit back into their roles without trouble. Alyson Hannigan comes off the best but the screenplay doesn't do enough with her. The rest of the players are fine but again the screenplay just makes them copies of the first film. What's even more annoying is the fact that the entire set-up is just lame and predictable. When the events finally play out in the end I'm not sure who is going to be shocked by the twists. There's certainly some funny moments scattered throughout the film but considering how good the first movie was there's simply no way to view this thing as nothing more than a failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tastes as if it were fresh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a film is an unexpected hit, it is not uncommon to see a sequel trying to rehash the formula. Unfortunately, while sounding like a clever idea, utilizing the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" motto, only a handful of films can get away with. With comedy films, it's especially rare and difficult, since many thing that existed in the first film are now close to obsolete. Most recently, we can say what an utter disappointment The Hangover Part II was, and for animation, I can see a look of sorrow and woe on all our faces when we paid to see The Jungle Book 2. Also, how many parents felt just a tiny bit cheated when they ventured out with their kid to Home Alone 2: Lost in New York? I bring this up because, being an avid moviegoer and watcher, I experience it a lot, and probably tend to notice it more than other people. I expected American Pie 2 to be nothing but a mediocre rehash of a formula I believed would only form a successful film once. The element of surprise is gone, the characters have grown up a bit, and there just doesn't seem to be a conceivable way to freshen the idea without taking an obviously lucrative turn. Thankfully, screenwriter Adam Herz, who also wrote the first Pie film, has made me eat those words along with his second helping of pie. American Pie 2 is one of the few comedy sequels I've seen that efficiently redoes what the original paved out, yet still includes that new movie smell.The plot revolves around the same bunch of characters we loved in the first film, only this time they're not naive high school Seniors days away from graduating, but less naive College kids on summer break. Jim (Biggs), Kevin (Nicholas), Oz (Klein), and Finch (Thomas) all return and plan to throw an unforgettable bash at a Grand Harbor lakehouse in Michigan. Not a whole ton has changed with the guys, Jim hasn't gotten over foreign exchange hottie Nadia (Elizabeth), Kevin is still desperately seeking Vicky (Reid), after cutting their relationship short to attend separate colleges, Oz is still dating the adorable choir girl Heather (Suvari), and Finch still has not gotten over his fling with Stifler's mom (Coolidge).When Jim learns that Nadia will be returning from Chicago to see him during the summer, he seeks the advice of quirky but lovable Michelle (Hannigan), whom he took to Senior Prom. The chemistry between the two is electric, and you almost crave to hear Hannigan recite the famous six words I doubt you need repeated. Also, some of the funniest work comes from Eugene Levy, reprising his role as Jim's father who continues to be supportive and understanding of his son's bizarre sex accidents. It seems Levy exists as the satirical character in a world where the kids are in a comedy movie. The unexpected mix works perfectly with the overall feel. The only character I feel is still painfully underused is Natasha Lyonne's Jessica, who seems like she could deliver more if the screenplay let her. Maybe she is supposed to be mysterious and subtle in her presence.There is a bit more of a focus on gross-out gags here than in the first film. One scene involving potential lesbian neighbors is stretched out a bit too long, and loses some of its humor over time. There is also a scene involving urine which isn't very funny, but we're thrilled to see these characters back again, cherishing and embracing each of their sitcom personas.Like in the original film, there is a nice blend of sweetness and wit to compliment a lot of the gross antics, making for a nice hybrid. We've only spent two movies with these characters, but somehow feel we've personally connected with them in a way that makes us crave more events involving them. It's so rare we get characters like this, and everyone here seems to be determined to make a great, fun movie. So many people just look at the original Pie trilogy and see it as nothing but a reviled sex romp and nothing more. Many don't pay attention to the intelligence and spirit that makes these films so delightfully enigmatic and cheery. That's what the Pie is all about.I just have one tiny question for the gang this time around. We are informed of the "rule of three" where if you ask a girl how many guys she has slept with, you take that number and multiply it by three. Okay. Fair enough. We then learn from the girls that when you ask a guy how many girls he has slept with, you take the number and divide it by three. So what if a guy says he has slept with five girls. He has slept with 1.7 girls?

		<shortDescription>Another Slice of Pie Before it Went Stale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised when I finally saw American PIE 2 and found it to be as funny as the first. I'd assumed it would be a sub-par sequel that needlessly rehashed the original in an attempt to milk it for more profit; in the end, I was only partially right. The film does rehash some material from the original but it adds enough to keep it funny. The film begins at the end of the freshman year of college and the crew from the first film decide to rent a house on Lake Michigan in hopes of having the most memorable summer ever, while each dealing with their own issues. Jim seeks bedroom advice from Michelle in anticipation of Nadia's impending visit. Oz and Heather are made to spend the summer apart while she studies overseas and must overcome the distance to keep their relationship strong. Kevin is forced to cope with Vicky's desire to be "just friends", and Finch spends all summer preparing for his moment with the one that got away...Stifler's mom.This film is directed by the original's first assistant director J. B. Rogers, and I have to give him credit for a decent job. Granted, there are more difficult movies for one to jump into directing with but I've seen so many film sequels picked up by non-directors fail that I commend Rogers for a decent job here. Writer Adam Herz returned to pen the sequel, which allowed for the same sense of humor and understanding of the characters. The film does a great job of bringing back that same raunchy yet occasionally heart-warming humor of the first; at points I almost felt as if the filmmakers were reaching a bit with the gags, but I still found myself laughing.The entire original cast returned for American PIE 2 (which is good because I doubt if it ever would have worked otherwise). Jason Biggs is back in the role that jump-started his career and retains that awkward presence that keeps finding Jim in the worst situations. The rest of the cast don't have as much of a presence, as this film definitely feels like Jim's story, but the supporting characters have some great moments. I loved Eddie Kay Thomas in the film; Finch has taken up Eastern philosophy and tantric studies and he had some of the funniest moments in the film. The absolute best, once again, is Eugene Levy as Jim's dad. He isn't given as much to do this time and pretty much disappears after the first act but Levy is comedy gold. Both of the first American PIE films were some of the best teen raunch comedies in recent years and, as long as you were a fan of the first, you shouldn't have a problem finding something to laugh at this time around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie 2 was good but it wasn't better than the first one. This was funny but not as funny as the first one, the plot in this was kinda lame. In American Pie 2 they decide to get even closer, by spending the summer together at a beach house. They decide to hold the biggest party ever to be seen, even if the preparation doesn't always go to plan. Especially when Stifler, Finch and Jim become more close to each other than they ever want to be and when Jim mistakes super glue for lubricant.When the 'American Pie' gang returns, everyone knows that they will be expecting gross out humour and wild characters, and this movie doesn't disappoint. All the wonderful characters are back, including Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad, who steals every scene he is in. Stifler is his usual self and Finch is more entertaining this time. A lot of the female side of cast have a reduced role in this movie. Alyson Hannigan's (Michelle) role is expanded, whilst the others only appear in a few scenes. The jokes again are well written, but like the first film, are not the most cleanest of jokes. Funniest scenes include lesbians that make Jim, Stifler, Finch do what they say, Jim gluing his dick with glue then being rushed to the hospital "You guys are not team players" - Stifler (Seann William Scott)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They're back! The people we fell in love with in the first movie are back for more outrageousness, and while it's not as good as the first, it's still funny, and at times VERY funny.Jim, Kevin, Oz and Finch have finished their first year at college, and are getting ready to spend the summer together. They decide to rent a house on the beach and host a wild party at the end where they will be reunited with the girls.Everyone has returned, although the film focuses on the boys, while the girls mainly stay on the backburner (girls are not the target audience for movies like this). There are no new additions, surprisingly, but the movie still culls a lot of humor from the characters we all know and love.The problem with this sequel is that the first film told a complete story. The first film got its best laughs from the awkwardness from exploring sexuality. Now that everyone has taken the plunge, what's left? Surprisingly a lot. The filmmakers come up with some great ideas for hijinks, and while the laughs aren't as fresh as the ones in the first film, there's still plenty of humor in this sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This time around there's probably less plot in there, and it loses some charm because I've seen it all before. There's isn't really a coming-to-age theme anymore, and pretty much all the characters seem way more distant than they used to be. But it's still funny as hell. The first one was so well-written this sequel just works by following in the slipstream. All they really did was change the location, and it's so damn simple it actually does the trick. The new sitcom-like embarrassing situations are really top notch, the jokes are probably as good as they were in the original. That scene with the super-glue is just awesome on so many levels. The only problem is just that it doesn't really go anywhere. They do bring in a party to have a point to work up to, but really, they've already lost their virginity, they can't do that again. So, what happens? Their vacation is over and they head home, which is a bit less exciting. It's still among the best (teen) comedies around though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the movie opens it is the last day of classes and Jason Biggs back as Jim Levenstein is moving out but has some time before his parents arrive. So he and a classmate get together for some "meaningless sex" as a goodbye for the summer. Of course his mom and dad arrive early, get the dorm monitor to open Jim's door, and they surprise him during sex. To top it off, her parents arrive right after. This is the type of sophomoric humor the American Pie movies thrive on, and it is throughout this second movie.Part of the story has Shannon Elizabeth back as Nadia, and Jim prepares to seduce her, something he failed to do in the first movie. But when he is at the critical point he can't go through with it. He realizes that he really cares instead for Michelle, the funny girl from band camp. This of course sets up the final movie of the three, "American Wedding" for Jim and Michelle.Alyson Hannigan is back as Michelle Flaherty and perhaps gives the best performance of all. Lots of other young actors return, including Chris Klein,Natasha Lyonne, Tara Reid, Seann William Scott, Mena Suvari.I didn't really enjoy any of this movie, except Hannigan, but seeing it is essential to the 3rd in the series.</fullReview>

The original cast is back(Jim, Stifler, Oz, Jessica, Vicky, Kevin, Michelle, Finch, Sherman, Heather, Jim's dad, and even Stifler's mom and Stifler's brother) and funnier than ever. It starts off right where American Pie left off. The gang has just finished there freshman year of college and they have " Twelve weeks of imortality". Stifler gets peed on at his own party,then Kevin's brother suggests renting a summer lake house and they do. They reluctantly bring Stifler along to help out with there summer painting job. They end up painting two girls house that say there lesbians. Jim and Stifler kiss, Finch gets his but slapped in the most outragesly hilarious scene of the movie. Later Jim was trying to use a lubricant while watching a porn and accidentally picks up some super glue and uses it instead. He also got his hand super glued to the porn tape. Near the end of the movie Jim realizes he is in love with Michelle instead of Nadia (Following an eventful trip to band camp). To sum it all up it's an excellent movie with great acting and great comedy. Much better than your average teen sex comedy. Don't miss it!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

Jim's Dad continues to walk in on his son at the most inopportune times, providing the best jokes in the movie. Though not really original, the film entertains, which is all a comedy needs to do.Fans of the first should see this one, and everybody else should probably pass.

		<shortDescription>This is the best slice of pie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite American Pie movie. Even though I've seen this when I was in high school, I relate to it more now. My favorite theme of this movie is that things will change no matter what, but it's all in how you handle it that matters. Now that I'm done being deep I'll tell you the other thing that makes this the best slice of pie. The juvenile hilarious comedy. I was laughing all the way through this. Like when Jim super glues his hand to his junk. Classic. Or the scene when the boys are trying to get the girls to kiss each other. Eugene Levy was great as well. I mean any scene with him and Jason Biggs was funny. Another thing that I really like was that Stifler got a bigger role. I don't care what others say, the dude's funny. The one con to me was Tera Reid. I just don't think she can act and I really didn't like her character. I didn't like her character in the other one either, but you know. It was great to see all the cast back including the small, side, and bit roles (The MILF dudes, Shermanator, Stifler's Mom). And I'm not one for romance but it was nice to see Jim and Michelle end up together. This one had a lot of heart as well and was never mean spirited. I've read this once before and totally agree with it; that, no matter how bad on of the characters mess up or embarrass themselves, their buddies are always supportive. Sure they'll bust your stones a little, but they never make you feel bad or unwelcome in the group. Which is kind of nice to see in a "teen movie". Well I'm running out of things to say, so watch this if your a fan of comedy or the Pie series. Trust me, it's just good stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first three American Pie films aren't absolutely fantastic, groundbreaking masterpieces. But they are good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most critics dismiss these films, thinking they're nothing more than typical teen-sex comedies. Which is true. They basically are. But the first three AP films - this one and "American Wedding" in particular, are surprisingly well-made, well-acted films. They aren't constantly and consistently hilarious masterpieces like "Airplane!" or "The Naked Gun", but they are occasionally quite hilarious.I won't give out any plot details; not because the plot is so brilliant that I might spoil it (it isn't, I'm afraid), but because you probably already know it and/or have read it before. If not, wikipedia is your friend. Don't waste your time with "Band Camp", "The Naked Mile", "Beta House", etc. (the list goes on), which are quite honestly trash, watch the first three. You know, the ones that are actually worth watching.While "American Wedding" will always be my favourite of the three, American Pie 2 really is a thoroughly enjoyable film. I rate it higher than American Pie, and I recommend it to anyone looking to try and get into the AP franchise, although naturally they should probably start with the first film.6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"American Pie 2" delivers only half as many laughs as "American Pie." The best thing this uninspired sequel about the sexual shenanigans of college freshmen does is reunite the entire original cast. Sadly, "AP2" doesn't make adequate use of its ensemble cast. Jason Biggs returns as Jim the sexual lummox who suffers the worst humiliations imaginable. No, he doesn't defile an apple pie as he did in "American Pie." Seann William Scott runs a close second as the cretinous but comical Steve Stifler. Happily, Eugene Levy turns up in more scenes as Jim's Dad. The biggest surprise is band camper Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) joins the group! Unfortunately, director J.B. Rogers of "Say It Isn't So" and scenarist Adam Herz neither devote enough time to Oz, Finch, Heather, Jessica, Kevin, and Vicky nor do they put them in farcical predicaments. Not only did "American Pie" consistently ripple with fresh comedy, but also it let the girls behave as lecherously as the guys. "AP2" confines females to second-string roles. Half of the fun in the original concerned how the gals manipulated the hormone-addled guys."American Pie 2" starts well, but it concocts less comedy than its predecessor. The Michigan teenagers from East Grand Rapids High are finishing their second semester in college. Jim is having goodbye sex with a blonde in his dorm room when his well-meaning but clueless father shows up with a six-pack of beer. No sooner has Jim's Dad interrupted them than his mom prances in, screams at the sight of her son naked with a coed, and drops an apple pie on the floor. After Jim gets home, Swedish exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth of "Tomcats"), the hottie that he tried to seduce on the Internet, gives him a call. She wants to hook up with him at summer's end. Anxiety grips Jim. He fears his lack of sexual experience will repulse Nadia. Oz (Chris Klein of "Election") bids goodbye to Heather (Mena Suvari of "American Beauty") as she heads off for summer classes in Europe. So much for their romance. They experiment with phone sex, only to find Stifler eavesdropping on them. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Vicky (Tara Reid) spend the entire movie proving to each other they can be friends after sex in "American Pie." In "American Pie," a group of sympathetic guys vowed to find girlfriends and lose their virginity on prom night. In "AP2," the guys share a beach house on Lake Michigan and throw an end of summer, "Can't Hardly Wait" type, blow-out bash. Our heroes earn money painting houses. Jim sneaks over to band camp to persuade Michelle to tutor him about what women really want. Homophobic Stifler suspects that lesbians live in one of the houses that they are painting. The lesbians catch Jim and Finch in their room trying to rescue Stifler. This amusing scene and Jim's Crazy Glue episode provide the funniest moments in "AP2." You'll laugh at "American Pie 2," but you won't laugh as often as you did at "American Pie."</fullReview>

Sean William Scott is very funny as the horny college student named Stifler.The American Pie series is today what movies like Porky's were back in the 1980's.This film is about a bunch of college students who decide to rent a house near the beach and throw a big party while coping with dates and friendships.American Pie 2 is a very funny film and I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I want to say that I was disgusted by "American Pie", that it was low brow potty humor only appealing to the lower life forms, of which I am far above. That's what I want to say.But, the reality is that I was cracking up at this movie. Man, I thought only the Farrely brothers did this type of comedy and succeeded.I never saw the first American Pie, but part two definitely reminded me of Porky's Revenge with the sex craving teens. This was definitely a teen movie, but as I've said so many times before: teens are great for comedies and slasher/horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfairly bashed by moralists and AP fans alike.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beloved cast of American Pie returns for a sequel. But unlike the original movie involving the attempt to lose one's virginity before leaving high school, this one takes advantage of the strong personality traits of the characters we loved from the first movie. In fact, the only thing AP2 inherits from the original blockbuster, besides the cast &amp; characters, is the raunchiness of the original movie that uptight moralists hate so much. Among these uptight people are neo-confederate columnist Charley Reese who thinks that Hollywood didn't produce movies like this 20 years earlier. What planet was he living on when ANIMAL HOUSE, MEATBALLS, and PORKY'S came out? Better yet, where was he when AP1 came out?To tell you the truth, it's a good thing that the sequel has these cast &amp; characters, because the idea of their goal being the ultimate party, seems a little thin for a plot. But it's the events that take place before the party that make this movie so good. Stifler is still a jerk, Kevin still longs for Vicky, Oz and Heather are trying to stay faithful to each other, Vicky is getting more advice on men from Jessica, Sherman still thinks calling himself "The Sherminator" impresses the ladies, Finch still longs for Stifler's Mom(despite his own sexual escapades), Jim is being embarrassed by his dad, getting a visit from Nadia, and decides to get sex tips from none other than that lovable nerdy flutist horn-dog Michelle. As I stated earlier, the events leading up to the party are what makes this sequel so good. When one of Stifler's parties finally gets raided by the cops(something which happens more often at other parties according to two guests), Kevin calls up his big brother for advice and he suggests holding another one at a rental house on Lake Michigan. Once this party goes down, Kevin is supposed to be able to "see the big picture" whatever that is. Prior to the Lake Michigan blowout, Finch learns the secret of Stifler's Mom's skills in the bedroom, and tries them out himself, which makes him an easy target for "The Stiff-meister." And when he's not insulting Finch(or Jessica), Stifler does everything he can to get Oz to be unfaithful to Heather while she's on a trip to Spain. But no, he just won't budge! To pay for this future party, the kids decide to get a job painting houses, including one owned by two young ladies who live together, and are assumed by Stifler to be lesbians. Of course I'd be lying if I said that Adam Herz tried to make EVERYTHING about AP2 different from AP1, because the mutual bi-sexual foreplay being broadcast all over every CB &amp; two-way radio in AP2, is identical to the internet/video-cam scene from AP1. And while Kevin still wants both the body and heart of Vicky again, Michelle gladly offers to provide lover's tips to Jim so he can score with Nadia. Of course, her REAL motive for helping Jim becomes clearer as the movie progresses. A lot of people were upset about the fact that Jim dumped that Central European brunette bombshell Nadia for that nerdy, naughty flute-playing Michelle, but I was upset about the fact that Kevin and Vicky didn't become lovers again. Kevin truly loved this girl, and we're supposed to believe that unless he stops feeling this way he's too immature to be a high school graduate? I say that's more disgusting than any jokes about bodily functions and masturbation mishaps. Other than that, it's still an adequate sequel, which is something you don't always find coming out of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Good as the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a sequel is made usually the writers try to pick out what worked in the original and reuse it again in a different way. The problem with American Pie 2 is that it seemed like the writers tried too hard to follow the original American Pie instead of letting the sequel be its own story. This results in a choppy film. For example at the beginning of the movie the boys are in college and there is a sex scene involving the Jason Biggs character and his parents (as well as the parents of the girl he has sex with) walk in. Then there is a major location shift from college to the boys' home town. Just when you're getting comfortable with one location the movie moves to another location. And this is how the whole movie is. Just when you're getting comfortable with one character all of a sudden the character changes to suit a pre-made scene written because it worked in the original. The writers of American Pie 2 most likely wrote all the funny bits beforehand, using the original as inspiration, and then wrote a plot connecting all these funny bits together. As a result there is no coherence or unity in the movie, just bits and pieces of the original all stuck together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked American Pie for what it was, but thought the story was a little weak. The gags made up for it and made it a funny movie. Here, we have a stronger story, but some of the gags seem a little "been there, done that" quality to it, so I suppose I like American Pie 2 a little less than the first film. The idea of 4 friends coming back from their freshman year of college, trying to reignite that bond that brought them through high school is a real idea, one that most people who go to college have to deal with. While some of the friends live in the past, others live for the future, and others, just happy to be back together again. The four friends, Jim, Paul, Kevin, and Oz go along with Stifler to a lake house for what is supposed to be a summer of fun and overall debauchery. While there is some fun, the guys tend to find solace things other than their friends, even if it is lesbian neighbors of a painting job they picked up. By the end of the movie, everyone comes to grips with who they are, and who they are supposed to be with, and it is a very profound and satisfying ending. I was surprised how much people have learned by the end of this sequel. The gags are a little repetitive, so the film loses points there, but the overall story is much stronger. A good film about coming of age, but not as funny as the original American Pie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few friends of mine (not really known for their excellent taste of movies, but that's another problem. Hahaha) said that I definitely had to watch this movie, because I was missing something if I didn't watch it. They made me quite curious about it, so what else can you do but watch it? Indeed, nothing much.Well, I saw it and it wasn't bad, but that's about the best I can say about it. Perhaps I'm getting a bit old to fully appreciate this teenage humor, I don't know, but it certainly didn't blow my mind. That doesn't mean that I didn't have a good time watching it, it just wasn't as good as I expected it.In fact there is only one moment in this entire movie that I really loved: the moment where one of the main characters takes super glue instead of lube. With one hand glued to his penis and in his other hand a porn movie that he can't get rid of, he climbs on the roof where the police sees him. That was really hilarious, but I'm afraid also the only really funny part of this movie. All the rest was just about a bunch of youngsters trying to get laid, teenage fantasies,...The acting isn't too bad, even a lot better than I expected, but the story hasn't much new to offer. I give it a 6/10, I expected more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie 2 is that rare sequel that actually improves on the original. With all the main characters reuniting, it's a lot like getting together with old friends you haven't seen in a while (this happens to also be the basic plot of the movie). It's exactly what you want it to be--more of the same, with the guys continuing on their quest for emotional and sexual maturity. What sets the American Pie films apart from the rest of the teen sex genre is that is has a heart and Pie 2 wears it on it's sleeve. This film is not only funny but it's also sweet, with the final scenes capturing genuinely touching moments without becoming sticky with sentimentality. All in all, a worthy follow up to the original. If you liked the first one, you should enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The gang might be back for a second helping of the 'pie', but I am sorry, it was not too my liking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been and will continue to be criticised for not liking this movie, and although I understand almost all young people around the world loved the 2001 sequel 'American Pie 2', I was one person who was not that impressed by it. The major fans of this film will be sex-crazed teenagers, who love this sort of rude crude stuff. Unfortunately this sort of sex comedy has started to lose its appeal on a movie watcher such as me.A year has passed and the gang is back home after their first year of college. They are now ready to party hard all the way through summer. But the group is also taking `the next step' into the fringes of adulthood. The guys (Kevin, Jim, Oz, Finch and Stifler) rent a beach house, vowing to celebrate their friendship and make this the best summer ever. But as always, whether their dreams come true or not is ultimately up to the girls (Vicky, Michelle, Nadia, Heather and Jessica). Through one boisterous summer of ear-splitting parties, side-splitting mishaps - and yes a trip to band camp - the gang discover that times change and people change, but friendship last a lifetime.The script for American Pie 2 for me personally was good and bad. On the good side, I like how the gang sticks together through thick and thin, helping each other when they feel down. The other good elements include the introduction of 'band camp' which was fun to see at times. Then the storyline showing how hard it is for people from past relationships to remain just friends would be one of the biggest highlights of the film for me, as I totally get what the movie is trying to show. Yet the script goes too far at times, which bought the film down a fair bit for me. The script for the movie was written by Adam Herz (also an executive producer).These sorts of films will never win awards for great acting, but it is these performers who make the fans so happy. Jim (Jason Biggs) is back doing more crazy stupid antics, which make Jim look like an even bigger idiot. While Jim's Dad (Eugene Levy), is a total embarrassment to his son. Levy is terrific in his role here, as he is truly funny how he handles his varying predicaments. Stifler (Sean William Scott) is still as sleazy as he was in high school, college if you would believe has made him worse. While Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is now into Tantra, in the hopes of scoring again with 'MILF', aka Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge). Oz (Chris Klein) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols) bring a serious side to the story, as they are the mature guys in the group.The girls are also back in a big way in American Pie 2. 'Band Camp geek' Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) was fun to see in this film, as she is trying to help Jim become a better lover. However some of her techniques are in my opinion a little over the top. Jim was questioning them at times as well. While Vicky (Tara Reid) looks stunning in this film, which I believe is a deliberate move by the film to show difficult it will be for Kevin to see Vicky again, and control his emotions towards her. Yet the other girls like Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) and Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) are not as good the second time around, as they have 'bits and pieces' type roles, which add nothing to the film.American Pie 2 had some disgusting scenes attached to it. Firstly, we get to see Stifler have a rather 'p*** weak' drink, secondly Jim gets his hands stuck to embarrassing parts of the body and to some rather crude audio visual material. While the film's most degrading scene includes the boys trying to see their homosexual fantasies come to life, which were not funny in the slightest for me. Also the jokes this film had were not funny, and are a bad influence on the young people of today, who use them to bad effect in real life.Director of American Pie 2, J.B. Rogers certainly goes all out to make this film even stupidier than the first film, and at times he succeeds. But even he goes too far, which is something I cannot excuse. The soundtrack to this film is made of songs that were popular with the teen at the time of release, which suit the film'. I really like the song 'Everywhere' by Michelle Branch from it.I was told that I was not watching this film in the right frame of mind, which is to relax and not take it to seriously, but I am afraid I could not get that way to like what it was showing as a whole. Obviously fans of the film can and that is why they are obsessed by it. American Pie 2's theme is that `this summer is about sticking together', which is nothing that bad on the surface. However, I found that theme only comes through in certain sections of the film. This movie was basically another sick look at a theme which has been overdone - sex. Really sex is overrated in today's society if you ask me and needs to start having a lot less attention placed upon it. If you have not got the gist, I was not the biggest fan of American Pie 2 and believe younger people should demand more from a movie than what this delivers.CMRS gives American Pie 2: 2 (Ok Film)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like pastry, the sequel to "American Pie" is light and goes down easy. It doesn't pretend to be anything other than it is: a popcorn movie that one sees, has a few laughs over, and promptly forgets about. The gross-out quotient, as expected from an 'American Pie' sequel, is fairly high. The best scene is one where the boys have the tables turned on them by two women they suspect are lesbians. The guys have every libidinous "straight boy" cliche turned against them with a vengeance, and the results are riotous. I give it five stars out of ten just because it made me laugh out loud, and there aren't too many films that have that effect on me. Look, this isn't, "Citizen Kane," and anyone familiar with the "American Pie" series is aware of that. This film does not pretend to be anything other than a superficial, "night at the movies". On that level, it succeeds, and makes a badly needed point about homophobia in the process. How many films can boast that kind of pedigree?</fullReview>

Thesepeople have nice cars, friends, girls, huge houses, go to nice schools, a summer beach house, no job, and plenty of money, no problems, and so on. Movies like this completely contradict my Christian upbringing.

The characters are consistent, the general motivations never lose their appeal, and the mishaps of poor Jim really make the movie. I felt the big difference here was the lack of emphasis on Kevin and Vicky. In the first we saw a blossoming relationship encountering the typical speedbumps of romance. Now it was an awkward, jealousy driven issue that didn't really appeal to me. But, of course, Kudos for the lesbian scene, respectably played out. While appealing in an immature sort of way, the humor level is lower than the first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where shall I begin? This movie was boring, bad and written with a lazy hand. I don't know how anyone can sit here and say it was as good as the original. No way! For starters, Stifler said "f*ck" too many times, was annoying and unfunny, and had too many undeserved moments on film. The gags were too contrived, the set-ups not believable. If there was no American Pie 1, no one would give a crap about this picture. Rundown:1. The storyline between Tara Reid and the skinny dude. Oh, ma bad: what storyline? 2.The phone sex stuff between Mena Survari and the Oz was a throwaway. There was no entertainment value to this bit. 3. Tantra stuff with Stifler's mom - kind of corny. Is this all they could come up with? 4. Two lesbians for Stickler - I should have known that was coming.And the "love" story between Michelle and Jim was underdone, with a lousy set-up. And very unoriginal! Michelle trains Jim to be with Nadia, then falls in love with him in the process. VERY DUMB. And as for Shannon Elizabeth, could they not afford a Russian dialect coach for her?I feel as if the writer of this script just didn't put in his all when he came up with scene ideas. The pacing and directing wasn't too impressive, either. And now Jim and Michelle are getting married? I didn't even know they fell in love. I am not seeing American Wedding.Goes to show, sequels still never match up to the originals. I give this a 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

The clumsy but oh so charming Jim, the two "normal" ones, Kevin and Chris, the oriental-influenced Finch and the "casanova" Stifler all go to a summer camp after their first year in college, but thats just an excuse for more crazy stuff like in the original. Once again it should amuse most people, if they can appreciate the strong humour (the trombone scene and the meeting with the half-naked girls in the bedroom stand out). There is no new idea added to the story here. When you think about it, there is no idea to the film at all. But it squeezes everything out of its original concept and goes for pure entertainment, which is just what you get: its even funnier this time. Plus, the romance between Jim and Michelle is surprisingly sweet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel with nothing more to offer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie 2 / * 1/2 stars.I was not at all impressed with how this movie actually turned out. After seeing the previews for this I was expecting that maybe it would have some more jokes throughout the movie, but I found them no where. Seeing the first movie and how they acted and then seeing the sequel and finding out that they didn't change at all was extremely disappointing. I was expecting the characters to at at least get a little more mature, maybe offer a little more than sex jokes to the movie, but my hopes did not come true apparently, not for most of the characters. American Pie 2 is about the same group of guys who you were introduced to in the first movie, but this time they are all in college. It's summer time now though, and they all decided to rent a house by the beach. Meanwhile, Kevin is trying to patch things up with his ex, and Jim gets sex tips from his one night stand and the end has some surprising results.I guess I would say that the only good thing about this movie was again, Hannigan, who proves once more to be a remarkable actress. I was verty impressed with how well she played her character, in fact, she might have been one character that matured a little bit, which is upsetting considering how many other characters there are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Step Back For A Moment, And View This Movie Within Its Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sometimes get the feeling that a lot of IMDB reviewers go into a movie really prejudging it. I've never felt strong enoughly about the movies I've rated so much differently than the average to comment until now.As a pure cinematic experience, "American Pie" may be lacking in the finer points of film making. And, the story may not be moving in a traditionally high rated sense. But, if you step back and watch this movie for what it is, a comedy with a heart, it delivers a powerful punch.Unlike so many "better" movies, this is a movie where you can really feel for the characters. They are all better developed than in the first movie, and the two combined makes the cast almost feel like a family to me. I want to know everything that happens to them. And, not even in a hokey, "wait for the third movie and we'll answer your questions," (ahem Matrix 2) but in a real way.Knock the directing or the cinematography if you want, but the writing in this movie is amazing. Especially for its genre. And, in that genre there are some absolutely hilarious moments along with the heart string tugging moments. I now can't wait for "American Wedding" to complete the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A much better pie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American Pie movies are so far the best comedies your going to find in movies. Though American Pie was very "fresh out of the oven" and a great movie, American Pie 2 was just like that, but had more flavor. i laughed so much more and it's not a mindless comedy either. it's a good story itself and is positively HILARIOUS! The whole gang is back with new "i cant believe they did that's!!"(the good funny ones) and LMFAO's. I just hope American Wedding can satisfy what all pie fans have been craving, from the trailers I've seen of it will though. Another thing is these movies have awesome sound tracks!  -PKP</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More gags and laughs than the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Pie" was the sleeper hit in 1999 where it was the young version of "Porky's" but without having too much dilemma of making it either a drama or a comedy. Unlike Porky's where people in their mid-thirties portrayed high school kids, American Pie had young people portraying teenagers in awkward situations that any teen would be in.The gang is back in "American Pie 2" where after graduating high school as non-virgins, Jim (Jason Biggs), Stifler (Sean William Scott), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Oz (Chris Klein) finish their first year of college where everything is more or less the same. Jim is still having bad luck with girls despite being used by Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) in his first time; Oz is more mellow and doesn't have much to say; Stifler is still a party animal who loves parties and seducing babes; Finch wants Stifler's mother in the sack while Kevin realizes that after a year of college everything is changing as he fears that after breaking up with Vicki (Tara Reid) and the party raid at Stifler's house, he gets advice from his brother (Casey Affleck) where a vacation at a beach house would make things better at least.Everybody has plans during the vacations in which Jim wants to prepare himself after getting a call from Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) to get wild in the sack but not before getting help from Michelle, Oz and Heather (Mena Suvari) try to talk in long distance, Stifler wants all the babes, Kevin still wants to be Vicki while Fitch is part of the gang's plans."American Pie 2" is funnier than the original where there are even more gags to make you laugh hard on the floor while at the same time doesn't try to be a pushover. A lot of things help the film from Eugene Levy reprising his role as Jim's father who is not like most fathers to embarrass the daylights out of their sons while at the same time none of the leading females shed their clothes.</fullReview>

Stiffler is a classic character, I only hope that Jessica (natasha lyonne) gets hooked up with someone on this next one, I wish she would get nude, I am dissappointed by her character.

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not too good as well !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having seen the first part of the American Pie series in '99 I could not wait to see the first trailer of the second part. Well, I finally watched the movie, like I wished to do for month, the first day it came out in my hometown and I have to say that I was kind of disappointed. Although there were quite a few new jokes in it, the film was about 50 per cent worse than the first one, seriously. It was especially the fact that the '' new plot '' did not seem to be that new at all ( I felt like having seen everything happening in the movie long before in other low budget productions )that lead to bore people after less than 45 minutes. However... I really hope that American Pie 3 ( aka American Wedding )will be much better again! But, especially because of Tim Allens part as Stiflers dad, I do not have too many doubts about that at all. cu</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted, you know before you even watch the movie, you know what to expect. Silly male bathroom humor and impossible farcical pranks and it delivers. In fact, I'd say that this movie is funnier than the original American Pie.All of the characters return from the first movie, but this time their performance are greatly improved. The entire cast feels more at ease and more at home in playing farce. This movie is a younger generation's Porky's and there are some classic scenes that make it worth the price of admission. The "lesbian" scene for one comes to mind. I laugh now just thinking about it.Not really much to review. If you enjoy a good fart joke, then you'll enjoy the hell out of this movie. It will make you want to see the 3rd installment in the series, American Wedding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who doesn't like comedy. Probably does not like this movie. This movie is drop dead funny. Seann William Scott might be one of the funniest people in the world. Stiffler truly cracks me up. My friends and I have been quoting his lines for the last two years. The fact that he was a bigger character in the second one was outstanding. The first one was funny but only really the physical humor. In the second one all of Stiffler's dialogue had me rolling and Jim was way more funny in this one also. I hope the third one includes Stiffer a lot i'm glad they dumped the rest of the crappy actors especially Klein who did nothing funny at all in the first two. American Pie 3 or American Wedding should be promising.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why would they bother? Seriously? American Pie burst on to the film scene in 1999 and shocked everyone. Not just because of its gross out humour, but also because it's frankness, realism, and outstanding direction, and acting. The characters in American Pie were not merely a bunch of kids trying to get laid, like in the Porkies movies. The main idea behind the characters was that they were REALISTIC stereotypes. Kevin was struggling to know if he was in love and what would happen with his girlfriend. Oz was falling in love and trying to be nice. Finch was dealing with being a social reject. And Jim was that awkward geek that most guys are. The characters were real, they were depictions of everyone we knew at High School, played in human sense, rather than a film character sense. But where did American Pie 2 go wrong??? Suddenly the characters lost all their punch. Due to bad direction, and poor script writing we see Oz and Heather in the film for about five minutes, delivering deadpan, and emotionless dialogue. Their storyline of long distance love is something so many people can relate to and its uniqueness had the potential to go far - however it was merely shoved aside so that the audience could have an over abundance of Stifler. The characters in American Pie 2 are tacky, and stereotyped beyond comprehension. While yes they were stereotypes in the original, they had their human aspects which made them differ, and made them unique. Finch, for example, was a geek who scored with an older woman - every teenage boy's dream. He was always an outcast, but seemed real. In AP2, all of a sudden hes become this guy obsessed with Chinese Scripture, and other sorts of art. And he uses this to ultimately score again with 'Stifler's Mom'. Stupid. Plain stupid. Stifler is another example. While his chauvanism, and light hearted view of life was a much needed break from some of the serious rigors of AP, in AP2 he is suddenly the star, and the over abundance of him becomes infuriating, as he spouts second rate pick up lines, and inserts f**k into every second word of his sentence. Once again, its just stupid and makes an unrealistic stereotype. And what about Jim's dad. His awkwardness, and fumbling attempts at guiding Jim through his hormone charged adolesence, were hilarious, and touching in the first. Now hes just some lame guy, who is more desperate for his son to get laid, than his son is. Rogers has taken some of the minor aspects of American Pie, and made them into Major aspects of the film in American Pie 2. The Weitz brothers knew such aspects in large doses would not work, and their smaller dosage, secondary nature to story, and characters that actually mean something, is what makes American Pie gold. Roger's direction is childish because it merely takes the trendiest, which is not neccesarily the best, and makes it predominant. The sequel should never have been made. It takes away from the bittersweetness of the original's ending. And if it had to be made, Rogers shouldn't have been allowed anywhere near the set, and the Weitz brothers should've been given whatever they wanted, so this could be a half decent film, and not merely an insult to the brilliant, and much underrated original. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who saw American Pie, knew what to expect from the sequel, but I dont think many would've guessed that the ante would be upped by such a large percentage. All the original actors return, and look much more mature and comfortable with the camera. Jason Biggs lives up to expectations and delivers like a true comedian. Tara Reid looks absolutely stunning, and that's pretty much enough for me. Shannon Elizabeth turns in a nice short performance, and is extremely fun to watch. The others turn in good performances, all except for Thomas Ian Nicholas who dissapoints and is definately the weak link in the entire movie. For whatever shortcomings Thomas Ian Nicholas puts up, they are more than made up for by stellar performances by Sean William Scott [Stifler]and Alyson Hannigan [Michelle] who in my opinion steal the show.Eugene Levy turns in another brilliant performace as Jim's Dad and touches everyone at just the exact needed time. Overall the movie is a lot of fun to watch and has tremendous replay value. It combines laugh out loud rip roaring humor with splashes of emotional touches which are definately a nice touch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, I was a little nervous about seeing the sequel of a movie so well done in such a flat genre, that I almost didn't see it. I mean, could they really top the first pie? No, but they came pretty damn close! This movie is packed with laughs from the minute Jim's dad opens the door to Jim's dorm room and gets an unexpected surprise. Later Stifler gets a shower, and meets two lesbians (this is probably the funniest scene in either movie, and it shows why you should never use CB radio frequencies). The entire movie focuses on our five anti-heroes: The pie-loving Jim, The Vicki-desperate Kevin, the sweetheart-who-never-gets-some Oz, the Mom-boner Finch, and the horny-as-hell Stifler. In the movie, Jim sees Michelle again at...oh you know (wink wink) where he gets sex advice. Jim, and the audience all learn the importance of musical instruments here. And boy is it important! So see this one time in the theater, we all saw two lesbians and saw Jason and Seann do some stuff, and it was really cool, and we laughed, and we thought it was the funniest movie ever. Skip band camp this summer, the pie's where it's at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They try to make the same movie again - they succeed - All riiight!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the same movie again, same actors, same characters, except the boys have come home from college for vacation this time, and the climactic party is at a beach-house. They do a pretty good job of it too. Downsides are that some of the characters - crucial to the balance of the first one - are "demoted" and given little (or little useful) to do. Klein's character and Mena Suvari have already resolved their story, and they're still happy, are given little screen-time, and hardly needed to be there. The character who was the most anonymous of them in the first movie (who didn't have sex with his long-term girlfriend)is outstandingly boring in this movie, not that the actor concerned was given anything to work with. Similarly the chap who had the non-billiards-related pool-table experience with Stifler's Mom - a kind of off-centre intriguing change-of-pace character in the first movie, is a bore here too. As with the above characters he's trapped in a go-nowhere subplot, and his character (undeveloped here) is more irritating than anything else this time.On the upside they give Stifler a more prominent role, and most of the energy that's not from Jason Biggs' performance and character comes from him. I thought Stifler would get irritating in larger doses but you're grateful for the energy. (On the downside Stifler's forgotten younger brother turns up prominently towards the end, and does a singularly charmless variant on Scott Baio as Chachi in "Happy Days", which wastes some more time.) Basically the movie is built around Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan, and Biggs is really handy at character-comedy. As they say about young sports guys, he "could turn out to be anything". He seems to have talent to burn, and he's very funny in this. Alyson Hannigan is about the only woman in the movie who has to do much acting - and has some comedy burden placed on her character too - and she's really good. The other acting highlight is Eugene Levy as the dad of Biggs' character. Used to enjoy Levy a lot in "Second City TV". Different sort of approach here - more realistic, more restrained - but the net effect is at least as good. He's funny every time he's on.The basic good-heartedness, tone, and main elements (romance counts/fleeting "best days of our lives" setting/young guys are sex crazy and it's OK) easily carry the rest. It's a fun movie, though it lacks the focus the first one had, because it doesn't have anything resembling the "We've all got to score this summer" gimmick which drove the original. It's all very well put together, with the exception of some minor mistiming in the direction and editing of some of the comedy set-piece stuff. If you liked the first one, you're almost certain to like this, and that's really why the movie was made, at a guess.</fullReview>

Some........This flick was stupid but it was meant to be camp so I understand. I'm giving it an eight because when Stifler got peed on I laughed my %$# off! That kid (Sean William Scott) can act way above his years. Trust me, there's a reason he's been in six flicks since. I truly believe he could be one of the best new actors over the next few years.

		<fullReview>From the very beginning of this movie I was in stitches! This whole movie was full of its perverted jokes and lives up to the first installment. Actually, though, I believe this was better than the first. It was funnier, and it had a great moral to it about time changing. So even though it was mostly a hilarious comedy, it also squeezed in some serious points making you sit back and think about life. I was definitely not disappointed by this movie. I thought it was really clever, and I wouldn't be surprised if they came in with a third movie. They really mixed both aspects of life really well. I hope everyone who saw it got as much out of it as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie 2 is just as good as the first and better.I found it seriuosly funny and totally brilliant. I read some of the other reviews and i must say it isn't gross or disgusting, but good humour.I don't recomend it to old people cause they wont undrerstand the sort of humour, but i think that the age group it is aimed for will definetly like it.The characters are just as good as they were in the first. Jim is still struggling with his sex life and Nadia. Stifler is just as imuture and has only sex in his mind. Finch has now become obcesed with Stifler's Mom and Tantra. There's also a good laugh when Finch mistakes Stifler's little brothers arrival. Oz has to deal with a long distance relationship and trys 2 have phone sex. Kevin is still in love with Vicky, but she has moved on and just wants to be friends so they have lots of awkward moments. And the girls just do watever.I give American Pie 2 a rating of 10/10 cause its an excelant film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this one was really good, but a lot of people keep saying it's better than the first. I don't think so, I think the first was better because it had more jokes and a better story line to it. The only really good thing about this film is Stifler. He was once again the funniest character in the film. The beginning of the film was really funny, but when it got near the end, it got a bit boring. I wouldn't want to see an American Pie 3 because I think all the jokes have already been done. Either than that, it was a sequel to the first American Pie with teens doing crazy things.

		<fullReview>Stifler and Jim were the only funny males in the group; the others were either just too weird (Finch) or just too bland (Oz and the other guy). Michelle the Band Camp girl was hilarious and perhaps should have been given a more significant role to allow the relationship between her and Jim to develop. Vicky needs a bra.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>second slice not as tasty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie 2American Pie 2 has more of the same from the producers who brought you the world's most popular teen movie since Porky's.Unlike the original American Pie, which was just hot, hot, hot, the response to the second slice of US pastry has been lukewarm.The entire cast returns and this time it's their first summer break after a year at college.While they left their virginity behind in the first movie, the cast is now looking to move on with their lives - now they generally just want sex more regularly.Jim still has his sexual hang-ups, not helped by his dad's embarrassing but well meant pieces of advice, Stifler has lust permanently on the brain, Finch is hung-up by his favourite conquest, Stifler's Mum, ?Oz' has found true love but is alone for the summer while Heather is in Europe, and Kevin continues to pine for the one that got away.Each of the lads have to overcome their challenges whilst embarking on enjoying the first summer of the rest of their life. Kevin's obsessive nature comes to the fore again; aiming to host the most talked about party of the summer.Without exception director James Rogers has changed none of the formula from the first successful movie, virtually cutting and pasting scenarios and changing the script to suit.Prime examples of this are the broadcast ?sex' scene (trade the internet for a walkie talkie), Jim's experiment with super glue and his relationship with lovely exchange student Nadia, again played by the lovely (but recently married) Shannon Elizabeth.Elizabeth, along with fellow female cast members Alyson Hannigan and Mena Suvari, doesn't have much to do here, but that's to be expected in a story where the boys are the focus.The second taste of American Pie is not as funny as the first, but that's probably because we know what to expect. There are few surprises.With the storyline spread across such a big cast, the ending is far more concerned with tying up loose ends than actually giving us a satisfying finish. Enjoy this film and hope they don't make a third, as is rumoured to be on the agenda, otherwise it could become as tragic as Beverly Hills, 90210 where the characters grew up, but didn't progress with their lives.Weekly recommended rental: Porky's (1981) starring Dan Monahan and Sex In The City's Kim Cattrall. The most popular teen film ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed the first American Pie movie, it was funny, crass and didn't pretend to be anything it wasn't. The follow-up, American Pie 2 seems hell-bent on destroying the good work of its predecessor.The first 15 minutes are particularly painful and it is almost as if the director has rounded everybody up again and just felt laughs would somehow 'shine through'. Unfortunately it doesn't quite work.In a smart move American Pie 1 superstar, Stifler is given much more to do here and with the help of Jason Biggs they bring to the screens nearly every laugh. The scenes involving all the other characters are particularly painful and hardly a chuckle do they conjure up. I really do not know what American Pie 2 was trying to be, whatever it was it failed dismally.Yes I had a few laughs, but I think I was trying way too hard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd sooner see American Pie XXX</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did write a thoughtful, considered review of `American Pie' 1, but this sequel isn't worth it. I'm ashamed I spent 90 minutes watching it, especially as Chris Klein and Mena Suvari, the most attractive couple in Pie1, take a back seat here. The awful Stifler is worse than ever and his kid brother a positive danger to public morals ? the foulest 15 year old ever seen in American cinema. The central character Jim (Jason Biggs) is as painful as before though his amateur love therapist Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) is quite fun, and I have to admit Ms Czech Republic (Shannon Elizabeth) is quite attractive, but she is not used to advantage ? she is a kind of book-end to the story (what there is of it), along with Stifler's mum.The sequel plunders several of its comic turns from the original (eg broadcast sex, coitus interrupted by parents), while others are completely tasteless, Jim's turn as a mentally retarded trombone player for instance. The language seems far worse than Pie1 (Stifler is particularly foul) and the dialogue pretty dire. The whole thing suffers from terminal blokeyness ? I can't think why any self-respecting female would want to watch it despited the presence of some capable women actors in the cast.The trouble is they won't stop making stuff like this while it pays. As that indefatigable contributor to this database, Spleen of Canberra, has pointed out, this film cost US$30 million and grossed US$145 million in the US alone. (Not quite as good a rate of return as Pie1, which cost US$11 million and drew over US$100 million.) My only consolation is I didn't pay for the video. My son, squarely in the target audience, parted with $6 to see it, and is truly sorry. Don't get fooled again, son.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seann William Scott as Han Solo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> Date Posted: 8:04am Subject: Seann William Scott as Han Solo  A.C. Crispin has a trilogy books, Brian Daley had a trilogy. Plenty of material for six TV mini-series. Seann William Scott (Road Trip, American Pie) would make a great young Han.  As a secondary idea, I'd like to see The Emperor's Hand as a Myra Jade series. Has anyone seen The Dark Redemption online? It's a good chapter-film.  What is the best way for us to campaign to Lucas? All he has to do is sit back and collect royalties. There are plenty of people who would adapt and direct this stuff, especially the Han Solo shows. I am quite sure Seann William Scott would love to play this character. My one extra hope is that it not be kiddie-proofed. As in Han Solo at Star's End, this would be a Han willing to send someone a gift-box with a face-clawing monster inside, and willing to send another villain through an air-lock.  Please get behind me on this.  George:  Maybe show Han saving Chewie's family, maybe show the Sabbacc game where Han wins the Falcon from Lando Calrissian (which would also be fun to cast - who might be a good young Lando?) Re-build a bloody Millennium Falcon, shoot everything in digital if you like, and be stingy as you like with special effects -- but get it on TV!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Pie Is As Sweet As The First!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American pie 2 was a film i had been longing to see. I did get to see it in theatres, and i have bought it on DVD. That can only tell you that i thouroughly enjoyed this movie. I owe both part 1 and 2 on DVD. Many say that American Pie 2 basically had no plot, but did the first?? The whole group is back in this funny sequel. The 5 boys go to a camp at a lake and rent a property there to party in, the ENTIRE cast of the original is back, this time the boys make a pact to make this the best summer they would have together...That's a plot..I guess..Sorta!Is it as good as the first? Maybe not. Yet the films are very similar, leaving Jim in his typical embaressing situations, you've got to love it.Of course there is the gross humour, this film isnt exactly titled for kids,just like the original. Yet that i was a little disappointed about was the fact that the cast was a little out of touch in this film.I mean this time the film is basically set upon the boys, the rest of the cast is "here and there", but their screen time is nowhere near as much as the first.Some say the script sux. I beg to differ, remember this is a teen movie,it brain-feeds TEENS, it only works for TEENS.The script wasn't a masterpiece,yet it did match with a teens thoughts, i wasnt expecting anything more of the script. There are many funny moments, like Jim getting glued to himself,the embaresing Bandcamp situation, OZ &amp; his Girlfriend having phone sex and being interrupted by Stifler, the lesbian situation, jims dad OF COURSE, the introduction and much more. I must add that Stifler is still really funny, i did not like his little brother one bit. I really reccomend the DVD, it has so many extra features, the OUT-TAKES are hilarious.ACTING: It was good, Jim really knows how to react with his situations. The whole cast did a good job, not flawless but still they were totally intact with their characters, they did a good job remembering who they were in part one, Alyson Halligon was GREAT.ACTORS: Everyone is back, so thats gotta be good. I loved all the actors in this movie.The selection was good, though the characters are beginning to show age, they dont really look 19 anymore, so they better hurry with that trilogy.SCRIPT: The script was adequate not much more i can say. No-one can expect a top of the pop script, the screen-writer did a good job keeping the characters in line, and giving them slight changes so they weren't so boring. Even though the plot was thin, some things were really funny in the film, the screenwriter should be applauded for that.Yet the cast (besides the boys) needed more screen time.CINEMA: Quiet good, the scenes- especially by the lake were great to look at,there was nothing really special with the camera work or technique, but theydid get the right effect, it was enjoying to watch, the film looked really colourful, sometimes the characters glowed with their fake tans.COMEDY: Very good, i would say that it was on par with its original. They are very similar in the comedic kind of sense. Many scenes delivered alot of laughs, thats a good sign. If you are in a bad mood, and really needto brighten your day with some sillyness, you would love this! Or the original.MUSIC/SOUND: The Soundtrack to American Pie 2 was FANTASTIC. One of the best things about the movie. Part one had a great soundtrack, but this was BETTER,the music really sets the mood, The music is college/grunge great choice in music.OVERALL: American Pie 2 is definantley worth the buy, especially on DVD. I think that those that think this or the original sucked are a little too "old" for this. If you are a teen, or are young at heart, the laughs will come flowing to you, if you are old and grumpy, expect to finish the film with a BIGGER frown. I loved this film, although the original maybe a touch better with plot,i still think they did a great job with this film,and i would LOVE the whole cast to come back one more time, I cant get enough of them.****/ ***** (4 out of 5 stars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit flat out that I liked this slice of comedy very much, and laughed frequently. As a person I would give this a thumbs up, which I would give it since I'm not a critic but a person. However, if I was a take-it-serious critic I'd have to say this film was on the wrong side of the tracks. I mean, compared to 'Scary Movie' and 'There's Something About Mary', this just isn't with them. Compared to 'Scary Movie 2' and 'National Lampoon's Animal House', it is better than those films combined. The bottom line is that you'll enjoy this movie if you've liked the first one, maybe not as much, but you will.Grade: BParental Note: 15 and up.15 year-olds should be able to handle this, and those boys will like it to. There are some explicit sexual acts that occur maybe four times throughout the film. That and the heavy, hard-on language is what gives this film a strong R-rating. Having said that, it's not like they haven't seen more innapropriate junk before. At least this film has good morals, and has a sincerely sweet ending. Still, parts of it, as much above, are too sexual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`This one time' like 3 yrs ago i saw a very funny movie called `American Pie', and then,,,, ( Ok! I will not do the band camp girl thing). However, I will ask you if you are hungry for more american pie. Well, lick up those taste buds again, cause `American Pie 2' is just as hilarious as its predecessor. The movie is set in the summer after our crazy kids' first year of college. They come back home and more of the insaneness starts all over again. This time in the itinerary include: 1) a lesbian `you do that, we do this' scene that is no `les' hilarious than any other scene in the movie 2) Stiffler's sexual cracks that have grown more stiffer with time 3) More of the band camp's girl irritating but yet zany band stories 4) a trumpet that definitely needed more `Preparation H' before blowing, and last but not least 6) Jim's `so-called' lubricant that will definitely make you be glued to the screen with belly `master' laughs. All the same actors from the first one are back, and were just as good except Tara Reid &amp; Mena Suvari. Their characters were very non-existent throughout the film, and maybe these actresses should have `reided' other parts that were more `menangful'. Anyhow, I am sure there will be a few more `American Pies' for us to digest throughout the following years; and as the Sherminator would say- `They'll be back!' **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is relatively simple and straightforward. The four boys from the first have all ended their first year at college and returned home for the summer. They find, while much has changed, much does still remain the same. Out of desperation they rent a beach house for the remainder of the summer and decide to live it up to the extreme. The guys all do well in reprising their roles and obviously haven't moved forward too far in their lives. The women do all return from the first but for very little screen time. Probably the most goes to Allyson Hannigan's character, who is enlisted by Jim in his attempts to "better" himself before the impending arrival of Nadia, played again by Shannon Elizabeth. There are some extremely funny moments in this one but overall the first one was much funnier. Possibly because of the age of the characters it seemed as if the writers were shooting for more serious moments at times. This didn't detract from the movie and it is still well worth seeing (if you liked the humor of the first one) but I do stand by it not being as funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A second helping of Pie still tastes good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think you can divide humour into three different kinds: wit, absurdity and stupidity. Wit makes you laugh because it's clever and often satirical (think most of what was funny in the dialogue of 'Shakespeare in Love' or 'Pulp Fiction'), absurdity because it turns our rules about how life, society and the universe works upside down (e.g Monty Python and the 'Wayne's World' films), stupidity because, well, stupid and/or gross things happening are often funny (prime examples are 'There's Something About Mary' and 'Scary Movie'). American Pie and it's sequel fit firmly into the third category of humour. They're not smart, they're not subversive (unless you're prudish about sexual morality), but who cares: they're good, dumb fun.American Pie 2 is a sequel, so we get the same group of characters doing roughly the same thing: four young men, and arch-jerk Stiffler this time, having mainly very embarrasing experiences in their quest for sexual glory. The lads are at the lake for the summer, preparing for a massive party before they go back to university, and they've all got women troubles. It's more predictable than the original, and the subplots involving the characters Oz and Kevin are rather lame, but the outrageous situations the guys get themselves into still make you roar with laughter and that's the main thing. I'll never be casual with superglue again.It's unusual for a sequel to measure up to the original, particularly if it's a comedy, but this one does. RATING: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I totally enjoyed this one a bit more than I enjoyed the first one. It could be that there were more sight gags than in the first one...It could be that everyone was back, it just wouldn't have worked with everyone from the first movie!Well what ever the reason, I thought it was funny. The dialouge, the storyline, everything. There's just too many to say...I was lucky enough to rent the DVD. It has a gag real, it has deleted scenes a couple I thought they could've added in, and the screen tests for the FIRST AP movie. So if it's possible for ya, go rent the DVD! LoL I was just a little disapointed that Jim's dad didn't have a bigger part in the movie this time around...oh well...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, A Sequel Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing American Pie I knew I would have to rush out and see American Pie 2 as soon as it came out. Well, I waited 2 weeks after American Pie 2 hit theaters and the theater was still packed. My 4 friends and I were thrilled to see this movie. Well 3 of them were thrilled just because they weren't 17, but I mean this movie was great. We were laughing from the beginning. Jim (Jason Biggs) was a great main character, as always. I loved seeing him more confused about sex and love than ever before. Stifler (Seann William Scott), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) return as the best friends of Jim, trying to guide him through his sex life while still working on theirs. Mena Suvari, Natasha Lyonne, Shannon Elizabeth, Alyson Hannigan, Tara Reid, Eugene Levy, and Chris Owen also return. The story of a summer vacation has never been told this well. And I enjoyed the soundtrack too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My initial response is that, though everyone else does their jobs,Levy and Hanagan steal the show as the protagonist's dad andgirl friend (not unlike the way they did in the original).There was a fair amount of complaining about the lack of depth (orsomething similar) about this movie. Hey, people it ain'tShakespeare. Lighten up. It is a puerile, sophomoric comedy thatdoes not pretend to be anything else - most of the time. Enjoy if forwhat it is. As for why there are so many bared breasts, well, thatwas what the producers could get away with and still not have anNC17 rating. What's the mystery?It is worth watching once, but not twice - no, it is NOT a copy of thefirst one. It is like it, but not the exact same thing...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't laughed that hard since 'Meet the parents'. It was FUNNY from very first scene to the last scene. All characters kind of matured except Stiffler's. He just became even more FUNNIER!!! To me the movie was quiet realistic and all of the things that transpired were more than possible. The biggest guffaw was when Stiffler breaks into the room of 'Potential Lesbians' and finds 'Steve'(wink wink) and is ecstatic and comes out swinging with 'Steve' in his hand. I have already bought the movie. This is definitely kind of movie that can be watched over and over.My advise to all who like fun-movies to ignore the comments and analysis of those who were expecting to see a movie where the problems of teenagers are seriously analyzed and solutions are proposed. There are even people complaining about kids not shown solving 'Math' problems. For people like those, there are many movies like 'Schindler's List' and 'American X' etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not enough math</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that this film is a comedy. But why do the characters not spend more time solving math problems? I find it very hard to believe that a group of American undergraduates in a mediocre college somewhere would be spending so much time worrying about sex rather than solving math problems of various degrees of complexity. I sat around for a full hour until I realized that this film would not involve the resolution of a single math problem. Even worse, there was no geometry! All in all, a disappointment. For a much better depiction of American youth solving math problems, I recommend "Fight Club" by David Fincher.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved American Pie, but this sequel just sucked. There was absolutely no need for it. Ok, so basically everyone's back. I know this was a teen movie, but Stifler just the f-word way too much. It bugged me. All the funny scenes that were in the movie were in the trailer, so it just wasn't funny when I saw the whole thing, because I'd already seen it. I don't know what happened at the end, because I fell asleep. Chris Klein and Mena suvari were just not needed in the movie. At all! Finch's little sex-meditation thing was just stupid. His character needs a life. Nadia was also not needed in the movie. Actually, this whole movie was not needed. After I saw it, the first American Pie didn't seem so cool anymore. I recommend this to no one. 1/10..only because the characters looked half way decent.</fullReview>

The jokes in American Pie 2 seemed forced. The great thing about the 1st one was that the jokes were fresh and hilarious. Number 2 they seemed so forced that they tried to hard to make this movie as good as or better than 1. But all is not lost. The thing I liked the best was when Jim realizes his True self and falls for Michele. And of course Stiflers Mom. I do not think they need to another one.

		<shortDescription>If I had three thumbs, they'd all be down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie with low expectations. I thought I'd be getting some mindless comedy. Sadly, I didn't even get that...The credits for American Pie 2 list Adam Herz as the writer. I have to believe that Herz must have gotten most of ideas from his 5th-grade snotty little brother. Every joke in this movie is so far-fetched it's hard to appreciate the humor. Did Herz write this script on the bus on his way to work? Take, for instance, the scene where Stifler thinks he's having champagne poured on him but in actuality it is urine. This scene takes so long to set up, that anyone in the theater that didn't figure out what was going to happen was already sleeping. I guess the producers were proud of the fact that virtually the entire cast returned for this sequel. But many of the characters have no purpose in this movie. It's as if they were written in simply to put everyone's picture on the movie poster or to make a good movie trailer. This film followed the EXACT formula as the first. Therefore I'll spare everyone the agony of sitting through American Pie 3. Here's how the plot will go... 1) Stifler will eat poop (thinking it's chocolate). 2) Jim will give himself a hicky with a vacuum. 3) The one-time-at-band-camp girl will perform a lesbian gang-bang while it's broadcast to the world via cable tv.Anyone who enjoyed this movie does not appreciate good screenwriting and/or original material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A healthy second serving of screwball pie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Be wary of a sequel,' says the wise moviegoer. Even if you liked the original, even if it was a surprising laugh riot reliving the baser humor of mid-80s teen sex romps, even if it had a classic scene involving a pie, even if it had memorable lines ("This one time, in band camp...") and memorable characters (Stifler's mom) - even if it had all that, be wary of a sequel.That said, American Pie 2 does a fine job of following up the immense success of the original while living up to somewhat lowered expectations the second time around. Here, we have the same gang of horny teens from the first movie, fresh off a year at college and hoping to rekindle some of the wild and crazy times of their youth. Yeah, their youth. All last year of it.Anyway, the four lads (Kevin, Oz, Jim and Finch), rent a summer house on the beach with Stifler (still as hopelessly vulgar - and hilarious - as ever), and the shenanigans begin. This time, the set pieces kick it up a notch, beginning with Jim being interrupted in flagrante dilecto by his parents (and the girl's parents) before the credits even start; adding in a laugh-out-loud funny sequence involving the lengths some men will go to in order to fulfill their lesbian fetish; and of course, hapless Jim having a major malfunction with some superglue and a porn tape. Throw in the band camp scene and the 'Stifler's experience with bodily fluids' scene, and you've got a good collection of very funny bits to wind the movie around.The use of the cast is also very much uneven, but gives more emphasis to the funnier (and more talented) cast members. Given big chunks of screen time are Jason Biggs (hopeless Jim), Seann William Scott (ever-sophomoric Stifler), Alyson Hannigan (band camper Michelle), Eddie Kaye Thomas (refined before his time Finch), and Eugene Levy (ever-understanding and patient as Jim's Dad). Everybody else melts into the background, and is more or less swept under the rug, which is just as well. The five mentioned above are more than capable of carrying the movie whenever they have to.It's no masterstroke of comic genius, and not nearly as surprisingly funny as the original, but American Pie 2 is a worthy sequel; a title that is all too fleetingly earned. Give it a shot, you'll likely laugh out loud more than once - and isn't that what a comedy is supposed to make you do?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solid follow-up to the memorable predecessor as those four boys - Jim (Jason Biggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Oz (Chris Klein), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) return after their first year of college, spend the summer in a beach house, and search for more bizarre adventures. Also, Stifler (Seann W. Scott) is tagging along with the bunch and he hasn't lost his sense of being off-the-wall. I'll be wise here and not even dare to throw away any of the hilarious moments that the movie provides. Unlike the first one, this film deals with rekindling or keeping the relationship from becoming bitter and unpleasant. The performances here are acceptable at best and the movie doesn't skip a beat.

		<fullReview>I didn't really enjoy the first film, but at least it had some signature moments you tell your friends about. This...uh, no. Totally telegraphed jokes, coming a mile away, that go on too long, or that just make you go "they thought that was gonna be funny?" Biggs is forced to play a trombone even though he doesn't know how. Yawn. Stifler gets his head peed on. Yawn. Finch is now practicing ancient Chinese spiritual stuff. Yawn. Nothing works in this. I laughed hard maybe twice and was just waiting for it to end. It was as if a bunch of 14-year-olds were given a big budget movie to make and packed it full of swear words, LOTS of sex talk and a cheap, porn movie quality scene featuring a couple of flat chested lesbians. The most unbearable element is the character of Stifler, a trash-mouthed, mean-spirited jerk who I don't understand would have any friends at all like he does in this film. I enjoyed Scott's performance of him the first time around, here you just wanna kick his ass. The final line of "Wait, who was in that car?" in reference to Stifler's mom put a exclamation point on how dead the script was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as charming, but still good fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As sequels go, this isn't too bad. Most sequels underperform the original by a good margin, but this one falls off only slightly. In many places the comedy in APII is better than the first. However, it is mostly just raunchier. What is missing here is any attempt at creating a plot. The first film had a clear and consistent plot that revolved around `The Pact'. It also had a candor about it that was very representative of high school life with all its braggadocio, bravado and hidden insecurities. With the exception of Jim (Jason Biggs) who retains his performance anxiety from the last film, all the innocence is gone from this film and with it much of the charm. Most of the cast members are back, but the cohesiveness is missing and with it some of the synergy.That doesn't mean it is without laughs because outrageous sex skits will always be funny (as long as they don't get too gross, like Scary Movie) and this film has them in abundance. Some miss but most hit. You could see the super glue bit coming a mile away, but it is still hilarious. The phone sex scene isn't. The best scenes in the film are not the raunchy ones, but the sex lessons given to Jim by his friendly band geek Michelle (Alyson Hannigan).Jason Biggs leads the ensemble with another terrific performance of a guy obsessed with performance. Biggs is the actor with the most nuance in the cast, capable of both outrageous and subtle humor. Shannon Elizabeth is sidelined as the Nadia, being more of an object than an active participant in this film. Chris Klein is also marginalized with very few scenes worth mentioning. Seann William Scott is back as Stifler, more outrageous than ever. This time he goes too far making the character's crudeness and untamed libido so obnoxious that it stops being funny. Eddie Kaye Thomas isn't given much to work with the way Finch was written this time, being more bizarre than comical. Once again, Alyson Hannigan steals the show as Michelle, the queen of band camp. Her wide eyed facial expressions are priceless and her comic timing is impeccable. Hannigan and Biggs have fantastic chemistry and play off one another so well that they could have been a vaudeville act. Eugene Levy is marvelous as Jim's well meaning but hopelessly square dad.This film meanders a great deal and misses the freshness of the first film, but is still packed with plenty of fun. I rated it a 7/10. For those not offended by crass language and sexually explicit humor, it will probably be a great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Slice of the Same Old Pie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Pie 2" is an example of everything the professional critics say a sequel shouldn't do. Rather than providing us with a new, original narrative or daring changes of character direction, it is content to merely serve up variations of the same raunchy gags that made the original a surprise hit in 1999. Some of these gags are admittedly successful, but the phrase "Been there, done that" hangs heavy over the entire film.It's the summer after freshman year at college, everyone's back home and hornier than ever. Our five male heroes rent a lake house in Grand Harbor, Michigan and spend the summer doing just what they spent the previous film doing: trying to get in girls' pants. A few subplots emerge: Jim (Jason Biggs) enlists the help of his spunky, slyly perverted prom-night one-night-stand Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) in getting him ready for a return visit from Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), the hot exchange student Jim humiliated himself with in the first "Pie". Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Vicky (Tara Reid), having split up after losing their virginity together, struggle with their feelings for each other, while Oz (Chris Klein) and Heather (Mena Suvari) try their best to carry on a long-distance relationship (complete with ill-conceived phone sex). Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) turns to tantra to harness sexual energy for HIS big return visit from Stifler's mom. And Stifler (Seann William Scott)...well, he's Stifler. It all comes together at a big party at the beach house, but not before some expectedly crude gags involving champagne, Super Glue, and a strategically placed trumpet.Since a film like "American Pie 2" does not require ground-breaking new film techniques (the tech work and J.B. Rogers' direction are competent and unobtrusive, as they should be), the picture basically hinges on the actors and the writing. The entire cast is back from the first film, but they are not as well-balanced as in the first picture. "Pie 1" was an ensemble piece; this is really Jason Biggs' film. Fortunately, he brings a lot to the table. Jim is the latest variation of an always amusing teen-film stereotype, the cool nerd (a type that reached its apex, I believe, with Jon Cryer's Ducky in "Pretty in Pink"), and Biggs attacks the role with charisma and a breathtaking lack of guile. Whether battling Super Glue attached to his, um, yeah, or pretending to be a "special" trumpet player at Michelle' s band camp, Biggs is utterly unafraid to look bad, to embarrass himself, to be the clown. In a film like this, that is invaluable, and most of the film's laughs belong to him.The other actors have varying degrees of success. Thomas still amuses with his sleepy-eyed style (though I liked Finch better with his golf and mochachinos), and Eugene Levy, back as Jim's dad, has some obliviously inspired moments. Hannigan is perky and weirdly charming; she makes Michelle the kind of girl you realize, after you've struck out with the ice-witch goddess, is the REAL perfect woman. Sadly, Klein (one of the best actors in this group) and Suvari are hung out to dry, and Nicholas and Reid spend most of their screen time just looking uncomfortable being around each other. Natasha Lyonne is wasted, her sex-guru character seemingly here just because she was in the first film. And Scott...well, it's interesting about him. I have not seen him play any other role but Stifler, and he inhabits it so truthfully, with such raw bravado and blithe nastiness, that I have no way of saying if it's a great performance or if Scott is a jerk and just being himself. But I can say this for sure: Stifler's still a piece of work.Sadly, screenwriter Adam Herz, back from the first film, largely lets his cast down. The subplots are doled out in perfunctory fashion, with so much emphasis placed on Jim's predicaments that the others sometimes barely seem to be in the film at all. There's no great unifying idea like the first film's "sex pact" pulling the story together. Basically Herz is happy to play variations on the first film's jokes; he's like a jazz musician who knows a thousand different ways to play the only song he knows. Liked Jim and the pie in the first film? Here he is with himself glued to...himself. Liked the Internet humiliation with Nadia? Here all the guys are eavesdropped on (via walkie-talkie) with two possible lesbians. Even the revolting beer gag from the first film is reprised, this time with urine standing in for champagne. My feeling is that if you're not going to come up with an original story, at least try to give us new jokes.Admittedly, there's a few moments where Herz nails the young-adult mind right on the button (like when Jim sees Vicky, who hasn't changed a bit in the year since they've last seen each other, and exclaims, "Wow! Vicky got hot!"), and the film has a lot of heart mixed in with its raunch. Still, as I watched the film, I realized that I wasn't going to see anything new. I might just as well have watched the first film again; that one had heart, gags, a story, AND the element of surprise on its side. Funny though parts of this film may be, it's really just more of the same. They should have called it "American Pie Too".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think it is necessary to have been born after 1976 to fully enjoy this movie, but it helps immensely. The comedy is obviously geared toward the younger crowd. Being a member of that crowd myself, I found this sequel to the original film from 2000 to be very entertaining. This is a comedy, plain and simple. Don't go looking for moralistic messages or any inspiration from this film - just enjoy it for what it is. The creators of this film and films like it have two goals - the first being obviously to make absolutely as much profit as possible and the second being to make people laugh as much as possible.The film does have some pseudo-dramatic moments, but the actors and writers did a good job in keeping them to a minimum. Few things detract from a film of this type more than an attempt by the creators to fuse drama with mindless comedy; you don't want to have mixed feelings about the film's message and intent - either make me laugh a little and cry a little (Sleepless in Seattle), make me cry a lot and laugh very little (Saving Private Ryan), or make me laugh a lot and not cry at all!That's what makes this film great, whatever dramatic elements may exist are quickly swept away in the very next scene by something ridiculous. Good, not very clean, fun is what this movie is all about. Comedies of this type have always been ridiculed as exploitive in one way or another. In this film, I suppose some would argue that it exploits women. Well, watch closely - what may appear to be an exploitation of women simply for the pleasure of men is actually a demonstration of the absolute power women have over men in most aspects of life.The majority, if not all of the scenes in this film portray young men in their quest for young (and in some cases, older) women, and how the girls have the power to make or break their often helpless and hapless pursuits. The film shows, as so many in this category have before, how the apparent dominators of society are actually dominated; what drives a young man more than a woman? TWO women!My advice: watch this movie, but first, rent American Pie. Watch them back to back and just enjoy yourself. Critics generally scoff at movies like this because they don't require much work on the part of the creators (including the actors in most cases). Intellectuals will turn their noses up to it and say `mindless garbage, too bad so much of the contemporary culture follows such rubbish!' To them all I say: go rent an independent film you don't truly understand and pretend to completely relate to a painter from 1809 who commits suicide; meanwhile, the mindless lower layers of society will be laughing themselves silly and feeling pretty darn good about just being alive!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can you see this franchise going the way of Police Academy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has to be one of the all-time worst sequels since the dark days of "Caddyshack II", which, like "American Pie II" had no reason to be made, aside from gaining box office receipts from a formerly great movie.Likewise, one can see this series meeting the same fate as the "Police Academy" movies. Lets face it--the original "Police Academy" (like the original "American Pie") was moderately amusing when it first came out. Now, thanks to the numerous horrible sequels "PA" has spawned, it is known as a virtual laughing stock today. The main force that killed the sequels was that they were all just formulaic ripoffs of the original--remember how the cadets would all play a practical joke on Lt. Harris? Hoo boy, that was funny! Remember how the guy who could make the funny noises would get the cadets out of some type of jam? Ha ha! Priceless! So too can you see "American Pie" heading down the same "repetitive sequel" road. Examples that must be included in every "AP" sequel from here on out are: 1.) Stifler will have some disgusting act perpetrated on his person, usually in the form of bodily fluid. 2.) Jim will perform an unnatural act with an inanimate object, and get humiliated when he literally gets caught with his pants down. 3.) An act that would otherwise be a semi private affair will be broadcast for half of the free country to see or hear. 4.) Somebody will stick a musical instrument in a bodily orifice for no apparent reason. 5.) And that bloody "One time, in band camp..." joke must be beaten into the ground until it is nothing more than a seeping, decaying corpse. It's no surprise then that the genius who brought you "Say It Isn't So" brought you this mess. James B. Rogers should seriously consider just giving it up. He's trying to be the Farrelly Bros., but is coming across more like the guy who did "Porky's".Furthermore, in one fell swoop, Adam Herz has managed to take his once lovable characters and turn them into the cast of "90210" or "The Real World". Always complaining and whining about non existent problems, and wondering if they should get past their former glory days experienced in high school. Well, I've got news for you guys--you should get over your high school days! We had a name for guys like you after I graduated high school--"has beens". And we only called them that because it was funnier than "losers". And speaking of the characters, this flick didn't really have anything of merit for Oz and Kevin to do. Really , would anyone have missed them if they weren't there? Would the movie really have suffered if these two were written out all together? Perhaps they could've met their untimely demise in a fiery car crash or something?From me, this film ranks a 3 or 4 out of 10. The only reason it is not a 1 or a 2 is due to one moderately funny sequence when Jim tries to play the trombone at band camp.Rent this movie if you must, but don't expect the same magic that was found in the original "American Pie".</fullReview>

		<fullReview> Okay, just to start off, I loved this movie. When I first heard they were coming out with an American Pie 2, I HAD to see it, after being a fan of the original. This movie does introduce you with mostly the same cast, but does punch in a couple of new characters including Stifler's little brother. This movie was entertaining, and the "super glue" scene was really funny. Jason Biggs was great as Jim, as well as Shannon Elizabeth as Nadia, Alyson Hanngian as the band camp girl Michelle, Chris Klein as Chris "Oz", Natasha Lyonne as Jessica, Thomas Ian Nicholas as Kevin, Tara Reid as Vicky, Seann William Scott as Stifler, Mena Suvari as Heather, Eddie Kaye Thomas as Finch, and Eugene Levy as Jim's dad. Also, the opening sequence was hilarious. This movie was really fun and entertaining. For fans of the original, American Pie 2 serves a whole new piece of humor and fun. I give American Pie 2 a 10 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie 2 is one of the best comedies I have seen a long time. The humor is original and it feeds well off of the first movie. The interaction between Stifler and Paul Finch are some of the best scenes in the movie. The band camp scenes are also very good. This is a comedy that is breath of fresh air. It is ten times better than some other comedies that have come our recently. Scary Movie and Dude Where's My Car are two that American Pie 2 just blows out of the water. My only word of caution, leave the kids at a friends house or send them to bed early. This one is not for kids. It also only have a few weaknesses. There are a few scenes which don't flow two well but they are minor. Over all, a good comedy for a change (8 out of 10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There isn't much I can say about the movie, except that it suffered from a definite lack of plot (it was mostly the guys at a summer house near the beach) trying to get laid.I don't think it hurts the movie, though, since it is intended from the start to be a light comedy. So don't expect any deep meanings from it, and you'll be fine.It plays pretty much like a Monty Python movie: it has a couple of definite sketches (the party, the lesbians, the glue, etc.) interwoven with some weak connectors. Then again, I enjoyed it. I wasn't looking for anything more.Also, watch out for Alyson Hannigan. If you hadn't noticed, she is one beautiful girl. Way prettier than practically all of the other girls.7/10. It made me laugh. A lot. And that was its original intention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well the team behind American Pie have delivered the sequel, and I've gotta say they've done quite an alright job.I don't know what it is and some may disagree with me, but American Pie manages to be crude and brash with a certain air of sophistication, it doesn't leave a bad taste in your mouth. Where so many movies these days bombard the audience with tasteless gags that reek of desperation, American Pie sits above the rest with what, I just don't know. The first one really pushed the line, but the sequel totally crosses it, but manages to retain that air.There are so many laughs in this movie, you'll most likely be laughing from start to finish. I thoroughly enjoyed it, it was worth the price of admission and certainly worth a rent when it comes to video. That said though, the formula is growing old, and it's beginning to show signs of tiredness now. For this reason I hope they don't decide to go with an American Pie 3, it would be like whipping a dead horse. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilty fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday, I was completely opposed paying money to see this film at the cinema, but after being dragged along to it I'm well and truly impressed at how amusing a comedy sequel can actually be.Admittedly, I'm 17, and yes, admittedly, you probably shouldnt find these jokes funny if you're over 15, but no matter how guilty you feel about laughing at this, you will anyway. Cleverly, this sequel relies heavily on the running gags associated with each character from the earlier film, and uses the pre-built history to introduce even funnier, more embarrassing situations.The great thing about American Pie 2 is that it's laughing at itself. If you don't find yourself laughing with the movie's jokes, then you can be assured that you'll be laughing at some of the sheer corniness or stupidity of the scenes, so either way, you're enjoying yourself.Basically, don't put this on your movie blacklist. It's as good, if not better than the original, and you'll walk out smiling to yourself. Sure to be a regular in anyone's collection in time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another serving of American pie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do you even start to create a sequel to a movie like "American Pie" without making it suck? Well you got me, but the writers and producers of the movie have gone and done it!A year after the guys from the first movie went off to college, they come together and rent a house near the lake for the summer, hoping to throw parties and gain sexual experience.Nadia is coming to visit Jim, and he goes to see Michelle at Band Camp to see if he sucked in bed so that he can please Nadia; Kevin and Vicky feel awkward about seeing eachother again; Oz and Heather try long-distance phone sex and Finch still pines for Stifler's Mom.The best scenes come in the form of the 2 "lesbians", the glue scene and Jim's Band Camp debut. Unfortunately, the film mainly focuses on Jim, Michelle and Stifler, while the remaining cast take a back seat. Never mind though - these three dish out the best lines.The whole cast returns: Jason Biggs (Jim), Shannon Elizabeth (Nadia), Alyson Hannigan (Michelle), Seann W. Scott (Stifler), Eddie Kay Thomas (Finch), Thomas Ian Nicholas (Kev), Tara Reid (Vic), Chris Klein (Oz), Natasha Lyonne (Jess), Mena Suvari (Heather), The Sherminator and even Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge)Too bad the crew didn't make good use of two of the funniest actors in the movie - Eugene Levy (Jim's Dad) and Nastasha Lyonne - that's the one thing that prevents this film from being total side-splitting-hilarity.Fans of the first "American Pie" will love this. This one's just as good (but not quite better) than the first.</fullReview>

Good to see similar humor to the first also. All the jokes just fitted perfectly, I do think that you really have to see the original to get all the jokes. Jim's Dad at the start was just hilarious, you could just see what was going to happen. And the long wait to see Michelle at Band Camp too.. "Man, there's a lot of flutes.." hahaI can't stop talking about this film now.. I'm off to see it again soon. Stifler's little brother is a legend too. Also, good to see that homework (Tantra book) does actually pay off.. Stiflers Mom just had to be in the film also.One last thing, read labels on small bottles, there is a wee difference between super glue and lubrication...I give American Pie 2 a rating of '12' out of 10..

		<fullReview>American Pie 2 is a dating movie, and a tender one at that, dressed up as a gross out sex comedy.The boys are back a year later and still trying to figure out how to get women, just about any woman, into bed.Off Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Jim (Jason Biggs) and Stifler (Seann William Scott) go to a swank beach house during their summer holidays planning to throw a monster party where they'll "definitely get laid".The girls from the first film are largely missing except for the nerdy but nice Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) who fortuitously is on a band camp near the beach house. The sexy exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), Heather and Vicky make fairly token appearances.Jim, the Pie Porker in American Pie 1 is the main focus again of the film, his adventures again keenly accentuated by Jim's Dad (Eugene Levy). American Pie 2 is much of the same again, the same formula, but most will find it at least as entertaining as the original.There are some awkward scenes. The trombone concert still works though because Jason Biggs as Jim is a genuinely funny character actor. That big jump in those very little blue shorts was a hoot.There's an extended lesbian scene that the film could have been done better because of its homophobic nature and I didn't appreciate the typically down your nose attitude to the elderly that we unfortunately must expect in a teen movie, but hey I'm just being stuffy.Stifler remained obnoxious and he'll never change. And the girls aren't stupid, knowing just what's going on in the heads of these testosterone driven fools.In its last third American Pie 2 consolidates and we find that these boys have hearts as well as balls, except the Stifmeister. That's a relief.American Pie 2 will speak to both males and females under a certain age. Neither are belittled.3 Super Glued Flys Out Of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same old schtick; college/summer through the eyes of Ralph Lauren</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was in high school, an usher friend of mine let me into the local mall-plex to see the banal putrescence that was "American Pie." I came home for a weekend to see the sequel at the $1.50 multiplex (that's an evening show, mind you. Matinees are $.50.) Fortunately, I didn't pay any more to see this cinema detritous.After a very high-school-like college moving out sequence, the boys decide to rent a summer house, a poorly-disguised hotel lodge on 'the lake' in an attempt to relive one of the characters brother's glory days. See if you can spot the exit sign and regulations poster the crew forgot to disguise. Amidst the chromakeyed ocean backdrops, excessive product placement (but it's only soda, because actually showing labels on liquor bottles would send the wrong message) collapsable scenery and lghting as one-dimensional as the characters/caricatures, the kids find fun in painting a house (which never gets finished, I assume), botching sexual trysts and dancing around homoerotica.Eventually, the repetitive facial expressions and cyclical soundtrack-enhanced scene transitions get old, but the viewer should fear not, as he is apt to enjoy another sight gag before the next reel. The boys wind up getting laid and all loose ends are tied up in the stereotypical summer-end party.The film plays as if Kodak's moments and Muzak's stimulus progression got together to attempt a soft-touch filter (not unlike the one used on the single shot of bando girl in the car) escapade of what college life would be for slacker-hip, daddy-buys-son's-degree-in-four-ecstatic-years creightons. Like Spring Break, Losin' It and other forgettable efforts, American Pie 2 is sure to leave an indelible mark in the annals of cinema. Or not. I just wished that the directors would have used the 'snapshot/still-frame' technique for the credits so the audience would have some crackers with its cheese.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had great hopes for this movie. Unfortunately some of the character developed into some stupid one-dimensional jokes. On the other hand there are some nice twists and turns and definitely some nice jokes which made the whole theatre laugh. To be honest I have always had some caveats about Stiffler (played by Seann William Scott). In this movie he uses the f-word as a way to convey all kinds of meanings - much like the smurfs do with their smurfastic expressions. But this starts to be obnoxious to say the least. Some of the geekiness is just way of the chart (Sherminator), some of the acting is very original (once again Alyson Hannigan is brilliant as Michele). Overall it's a nice get-together with some nice actors in a nice set-up. If you enjoyed the first movie immensely (e.g: I did) then you'll like this one.The story is not that original either. It's summer, holidays are comming, what to do? Once again Kevin's brother comes to the rescue with one of his "secrets" (like the secret "How to give your girlfriend a good time" book in the first movie). This time they go to this wonderful beach house.If you don't know what the first movie was about, save yourself from seeing this one. This is just for the fans.

This is truly the 'Porky's' of it's generation. Infantile, childish, gratuitous, but very funny in parts. If you want to sit in front of a movie screen, staring at it like a gibbon and not have to worry about thinking, then this is the picture for you.

		<fullReview>American Pie 2 is one of the greatest sequels to hit cinemas in a long time. However, you can't say it beats the first because without the original it would be next to nothing. Despite the many more laughs, American Pie 2 relies on knowledge of its predecessor on a few occasions, and this is what makes this sequel fantastic. Please, if you plan on seeing it, rent the first... well, first. It's a hell of a lot more than just teen gross-out comedy... it's spectacularly bundled on such a thin story-line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first American Pie was great.And fans like me wanted an American pie 2 obviously.But this sequel is terribly boring.The crude humor is less good and director James B.Rogers uses sex too easily.He doesn't have the talent of Paul Weitz.American Pie 2 isn't a good comedy because of the ineffective use of the sex in the movie.Although Jason Biggs is not so bad,the other characters miss consistency.In short,although you love American Pie,absolutely do not see this movie !There is too much sex and no good humor like in the first one...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't live up to expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not seen the much loved first American Pie - I wasn't 100% sure what to expect, so I went into the Cinema with an open mind about the film, but realising sequels are often disappointing and expecting something along the same lines as 'Road Trip'.This film has its moments, and its not ever boring - but it is filled with cliched storylines, and toilet humour. The 'watching video in bed scene' is funny - but still toilet humour, although the Mum humour has to be the best in the film. The characters have some depth (although obviously exaggerated), and are quite likeable. But the storyline is dire. Every twist and turn is blatantly obvious, and subsquently frustrating and the typical Hollywood style ending (along with 'the best party ever attitude' -like that ever happens in real life) just take the biscuit.In summary, I hope they don't make any more, so my friends will avoid quoting them - and talking about them as 'classics'. But nevertheless this is ok film, altough theres nothing new here, just formulated comedy - But thats all the general public seem to want.....and it brings in loads of money - so who can blame them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This really was dire.I love the recent slapstick Jim Carrey films like 'Something about Mary' and I love the Coen brothers films like 'The Man Who Wasn't There' but this was something else altogether, or rather it was nothing at all.I admit I did not intend to see it, The Score and Enigma were sold out, but I went in to the movie theater with an open mind.It really was a one-gag movie with a one-hour build-up to the watching-the-video in bed scene, and then tailing off faster than a comet immediately after. It had absolutely no story to it at all, and very little humour.This movie was just awful. I never saw a movie that bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See the British version NOW!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I'd seen American Pie 2, myself and the people I was with concluded it was just as good if not better than the first one. About a week later I saw the version of the film that was released in the United States - to put it mildly its awful! That version has no rhythm, its disjointed and some scenes simply make no sense. Is the US really so strict on nudity and crude humour when violent films are a plenty?!Look forward to the Unrated version on DVD due out in January - it is so much better. It may have just 6 minutes more - but those 6 minutes change the whole flow of the movie.I'd give the UK version a 9/10 but the US version just 6/10...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE teenage movie ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really hated the original American Pie, but its sequel American Pie 2 is just excellent, genial, unbelievable !Why ? Because the people in the first movie where not at all believable, realistic, or in any way sympathetic, while in the second part everyone suddenly has his own personality. In part one, the boys just want sex, and had no ideals or dreams beside that. They where just anonymous stereotypes. How realistic is that ? I'm a little bit older, but I know exactly that I never had more dreams and ideals than at that age !But now, here, in part two, everyone suddenly really has a personality with dreams, ideals, strange projects, and so on. And these personalities are all very original ! The jokes are as tasteless as in the first part, but suddenly I can laugh about them ! I've seen it now three times, and every time I could laugh about them again. If it stays in cinema, I guess I'll watch it another time.I don't know if I can recommend this movie to any non-teenager, even if I myself are far older. I fear one would need to have the corresponding humor. However, I think this is a great movie, and it is the best teenage movie I know of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pie is getting better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This piece of pie is getting sweeter but unfortunatelly although it's a great movie, it's still a teen movie and it can't be understood by the general public as it should. The movie is in very aspects equal to the first (why changing??) and most important than having the same kind of jokes, it has the same cast and for a cast with this size its very hard! They re-hired a lot of actors and some of them had created a career (Shannon Elizabeth, Sean William Scott, Chris Klein, Mena Suvari and Tara Reid) but this is a thankfulness for the boost that AP has given to their career, almost all nowadays' teen stars were on that movie.Let's hope that someone will have a great ideia for keeping doing pies for some more years, if they don't mess a lot because this story can be easily spoiled if they try to force the sequel. This second pie is very tasty and the ending, like in the first, makes the sequel possible but not predictable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first American Pie was a good film, it was funny in places, weird at the right moments and a generally diverting film. But it was far too sentimental. American Pie 2 is just BETTER! The whole cast is reunited for this film and it is pulled off with a humour that Road Trip and DWMC? both failed to hit. From the return of The Sherminator to Stifler(Sean W Scott) wanting to 'take one for the team' (you'll see what I mean when you see it!) this film is the shining example of what a teen comedy should be.The start of this film is superb, I was laughing almost immediately at Jim's Dad's attempts to play it cool when he finds his son in a 'compromising situation'. I thought that this film had something which the first one lacked in some respects and that was spontanaity and timing. Don't get me wrong, American Pie had these two qualities, but they weren't use to the perfection that Pie 2 does. A superb example is Stifler's final words of the entire film, used just when the audience thinks its all over. But far be it from me to ruin the fun...watch it yourself and see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite starting awkwardly, with too many heavy-handed references to events in the first film (presumably for the benefit of viewers who haven't seen the original), this sequel succeeds in raising a good many laughs.The set pieces work well, from the champagne-balcony episode to the incident with the "lesbians". What's more, each male actor brings an easy charm to his role that encourages you to identify with the boys' travails. Might have been an idea to have developed the Tara Reid and Natasha Lyonne characters further, but on the other hand the film didn't need to be any longer.Two-and-a-half stars out of five.</fullReview>

The second successful comedy sequel of the year (after the great Scary Movie 2) - things are definately looking up.While it does rely on a couple of jokes from the first film, most of the humour is fresh, if sometimes sick... Sadly a couple of the main funny moments were spoilt because they'd been in the trailer - will the producers one day PLEASE learn to stop putting major spoilers in the trailors; the same thing also ruined Evolution for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots of OTT fun and games in this follow up to the 1999 film. All the major and minor characters reappear (including Sherman the Sherminator) somewhat new and improved but my enjoyment of the film was significantly affected by the number of spoilers in the trailers. This stopped me having the kind of belly laugh I really enjoyed in the original "Pie". Nevertheless Jim was great as was Jim's Dad (the rounding of their queer relationship is one of the improvements on the first film) as is Stifler who sorta steals the spotlight a little from Jim. Anyway I hope they stop here and don't go for another instalment in the franchise as I think we'd definitely see some tiresome repetition in that one. Enjoy it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think that the original would possibly be topped, but here is a sequel that is genuinely on a par with its predecessor. The four protagonists from the original are back home after the first year at college to party for the summer. The first 20 minutes feels like a re-write of the original, embarrassing situation, followed by a party at Stiffler's. However, when the police drop by, they need a new place to party. So, with Stiffler in tow, the four rent a beach-house, painting by day, and partying hard at night. Or so their plan goes. Jim is still hopeless with girls. So when Nadia calls to say she will see him, he seeks out Michelle to help him out. Cue band camp sequences of total hillarity! Meanwhile, the others still pine after their loves from the previous film. In truth, there is not a universal plot, just a series of intertwining stories. This is by no means a bad thing, as it gives the film a good flow. Aside from that, it is incredibly funny. There are less 'memorable' scenes than in the first movie, but there are lots of gags inbetween these to keep you interested. The characters are as lovable as ever, the soundtrack is incredible, and there is plenty of scope for a third film. Some of the scenes wear a little thin, but this is a nit picking quibble. Go see this now unless you are easily offended, in which case go see it anyway!!! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A guy puts his dick in a pie and that's a movie?"That, or something very much like it, was Spike Lee's reaction two years ago to a certain pastry-penetrating $11 million teen comedy that stole the summer box office and went on to gross $150 million worldwide. If you shared Spike's cynicism of the original, lord only knows what you'll make of the sequel, in which not only the penis - but also the mouth and anus - are unpleasantly violated for our viewing pleasure. But the chances are, you'll find yourself laughing.The first film may well have ended with the four central characters toasting "the next step" after having lost their virginity. However, any fears that that next step might have involved the resolution of their neuroses, a less demeaning attitude to women, or indeed any kind of growing up at all, happily prove unfounded. Every member of the original cast is back, so that means more Jim (Jason Biggs) and his desperate quest for experience with the curiously-accented, amply-endowed Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), more Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) lusting over a woman twice his age, and - joyfully - more of Jim's Dad (Eugene Levy) walking in at awkward moments and livening up the proceedings with sublimely awkward pep talks.What's changed is the location: one year has now passed since the guys departed East Great Falls High for college, and, aiming for the best summer of their lives, they hire out a lakeside cabin and wait for the girls to roll on in. When this doesn't quite happen as planned, the boys seek out other ways to widen their sexual experience. Oz (Chris Klien) opts for phone sex in an attempt to maintain his long distance relationship with Heather (Mena Suvari). Stifler (Carrey-alike Seann William Scott, who should be given his own movie, right now, and possibly also a crown) breaks into the house next door and discovers a vibrator. And, in the most welcome plot development, Jim gets to visit band camp and reconvene with his prom partner Michelle (Alyson Hannigan). And then gets a trumpet up his a***.Has any film ever made been quite so acutely aware of its target audience? Writers Adam Herz and David H. Steinberg have clearly been doing their research: close your eyes and, as each set-piece looms nearer, you can almost hear the sound of innumerable focus groups behind the scenes, all consisting entirely of adolescent boys, all being asked exactly the same question - "And what's the worst thing that could happen now?" The humiliations they dream up as a result only moderately compete with that initial dick-in-a-pie shock of yore; yet, like its predecessor, this movie succeeds magnificently in tuning into today's teenage moviegoers, their popcorn attention spans, and their appetite for embarrassment. Why simply get caught wanking by your parents when you can get caught by the whole town? Why simply be using your hands when you can be using lubricant? Why simply use lubricant when you could be using... ah, but that would be telling.And yet things are never allowed to get out of hand (pun intended): under all the gross-out humour runs a pulse of carefully calculated conservatism. Family values are mocked, but never undermined. Halfway into the film, and according to tradition, director James B. Rogers rewards his audience with a hard-earned glimpse of tit (lesbian tit at that). But whenever it all seems to be getting a bit too "Porky's", the sentimental music intervenes and we're reminded that, hey kids - sometimes it's all about respect. This smoothness of production threatens the rawness of the franchise somewhat, but it's to the filmmakers' credit that so many sketchy loose ends are tied together for a happy ending that (just) avoids substituting comedy with corniness. It may not be a movie, Spike, but it is funny. Let's just hope they call it a day before number three.</fullReview>

And I also cannot believe that two girls who apparently were supposed to be lesbians were exposing themselves to each other. I mean that was really sick. I don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings about it, but it was just plain bad. That movie should have been rated NC-17 never mind just R. Heck knows what the first one was about. I was just shocked when I saw that movie, just shocked. All they talked about was sex. I mean, who's going to want to watch a movie about sex? I sure don't. And I hate the fact that they are making movies about sex (like this one). I mean what is so good about that? People really overdo the talk about sex. There's no need, no need to just talk about sex all time or about not being virgins. It's really stupid. This movie was just awful. I never saw a movie that bad. That may be the last sex movie I ever see for as long as I live. And the thing was they had showed Jim's girlfriend from the first American Pie and they only showed her in one part which was kind of stupid. And then when the end came, Jim was kissing another girl. How stupid can you get. The movie was just plain sick. Plain, Plain Sick</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought American Pie 2 was good. I didn't think it was better than the first American Pie, but then again I didn't think it was worse. American Pie 2 is *definitely* ruder than the first one though. It's good to see it's still doing well though, as all the 'gross out' comedies coming out at the moment are flopping. I guess, everyone wanted to see the gang back here again. This time the gang are all in college and a year later the guys reunite for yet another summer of fun. Everyone from the first American Pie are back here. Even the ones who had minor roles in the first movie.American Pie 2 centers around Jim and him trying to be better "at the sex", as Nadia the foreign exchange student from the first American Pie is coming to visit him. He gets a little help from band geek and old prom date, Michelle. Then you have Kevin and Vicky, who after breaking up a year ago are faced in an awkward situation after seeing each-other again and just being 'friends'. Oz has to deal with being away, from girlfriend Heather, who's studying abroad in France. Of course Stifler is here being his usual stupid self and who dislikes Finch (Who's practising Japanese art now.) even more after Finch slept with his mother Janine. And, of course there's the brilliant Natasha Lyonne here, who has another cool role in the movie too. The guys are in movie most of the time, with most of the girls only getting small roles. Jim probably has the best bits here and Jim's dad too, who is really funny as always.Well, we all know the cast here, with the likes of Jason Biggs, Natasha Lyonne, Mena Suvari and Eugene Levy who are all great.Anyway, if you enjoyed the first American Pie, than you're bound to like this sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SURPRISE! A sequel that's better than the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"American Pie 2" is a sequel that surprised me. It surprised me because I found it to be funnier and better than the original 1999 hit comedy. That's a rarity to find in movies these days. Sequels usually don't surpass their predecessors, but this one did (in my opinion). I laughed out loud quite often while watching "American Pie 2". Plus, that sweetness that I liked so much in the first film is here as well. This time out, the entire cast from the original reunites for a second helping of crude jokes, embarrassing situations, and sex scenarios. Only the setting is new. Instead of the high school where most of the first film took place, the setting here is at a house on Lake Michigan. It's a year later, and those kids, who are now in college, set off to have a summer to remember. And it'll be a summer they'll never forget. The one thing that I liked best in the first "American Pie" was that relationship between the characters played by Chris Klein and Mena Suvari (who play Oz and Heather). That relationship is reunited here, but ends up taking a back seat to focus on another relationship that I thought was just as funny and touching. Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan have great chemistry as Jim and Michelle. If you will recall, Michelle was the girl who deflowered Jim in the first movie, and Jim comes to Michelle for advice as he prepares for a big reunion with foreign exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). Once again, the inept Jim finds himself in plenty of odd situations, and Biggs plays this character to perfection. Hannigan is very funny too giving Jim some pointers on how to handle situations with girls. But once again the big scene stealer in "American Pie 2" is Seann William Scott, who reprises his role of sex machine Stifler. This character has got to be the most obnoxiously hilarious movie creation that I've ever seen. Most obnoxious characters tend to get on my nerves, but not Stifler. He's a guy that I could be good friends with. Scott is just hysterically funny everytime he's on screen, and he provides the biggest laughs in the film. A few of the characters here aren't given much to do here like in the original, but for me that was a minor quarrel. Everybody seems to have had a great time making this. "American Pie 2" was the funniest comedy of summer 2001. ***1/2 (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a string of crappy gross-out movies like Tomcats and Freddy Got Fingered, this was it's only hope of a lifeline. And dammit, it's a good one. The entire cast return (even those "Milf" dudes) and prove the original wasn't a one-off. Some get bigger roles like Seann William Scott as Stifler, the sexist goofball of the group and some get smaller ones like Natasha Lyonne as Jessica, the sassy chick. However the jokes are so funny, you won't care too much. Jim (Jason Biggs) superglues his hand to his genitals, Scott gets peed on and Biggs is caught at it by his father (the hilarious Eugene Levy). The movie doesn't possess as much charm as the original, but it's still quite heartwarming despite the gross antics, as will still leave you happy long after you've left the cinema. And isn't that what comedies are supposed to do? Oh, and there are lesbians in it. Ummm...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I saw this film anticipating only a laugh riot from Stifler. I was wrong. Finch was hilarious as the tuntra boy who wanted his jerk friends mother to have sex with him. Kevin was funnier than the second time around but was not in the film long enough. Oz was funny in this one. He made me laugh with the phone sex scene. Jim was really funny always learning about sex from the band geek. Sherman was so funny saying what the terminator said in the film the terminator except he said it sex wise. All the girls were hot except for Natasha Lyonne. they had small parts. Ok the best part of the film belonged to Stifler. I was right he would be the funniest but not that funny. Here is a quote "holy s**t dude I found a dildo" enough said. He is the funniest character I have ever seen. This film was funny almost because of him. If you have seen the film you know what I am talking about when I say "oooohhhh I can taste the bubbles".............9.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have waited until Video</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my town there is one movie theatre, that show one movie a week. This movie came earlier this summer and I didn't get to see it. Last week, it came back again and I finally got to view a movie that I was looking forward to seeing. Now that I have all I can think is that I should have waited for the video. I hate it when you look forward to a movie so much and when you finally get to see it, you're disapointed. I really liked the first one because it was new and fun... but this one evidently tried to hard to be good. I liked the fact that Sean William Scott (Stifler) had a bigger role in this one though, and in fact if it weren't for him, this movie would have just sucked. They really should have waited a couple of more years to put this movie out. Give people time to forget the original so that when they did come out with the sequal, eveyrone could remember how good the first one was. That's just my two cents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I can't say that I hate American Pie 2, but I'd rather see Jay and Silent Bob again. At least that was funny.I saw AP2 twice in the theatres and both times, I only laughed once, and that was at the commercial before the movie (it was funny).American Pie 2 is basically the antics of our five favourite horn-dogs:Jim, Kev, Oz, Finch, and the ever so annoying Stifler (personally I'd like to hit him with my car because he would get on my nerves after a minute), with a different backdrop and a year older. So what now? What else do teenagers want to do? Get down to the nitty-gritty and get some, of course (what did you expect).My favourite teen character pair was Jim and Michelle. Michelle, because she is the "band geek" in all of us. As Jim said, "I was always a band geek, but I never joined the band." There are dozens and more of us teenagers who feel that everyday. My favourite character in all is Jim's Dad, Eugene Levy (a Canadian). He was great on SCTV, and he's great here in AP2.Also, would it hurt Stifler to complete at least one sentence without making references to his body parts or using coarse language. I don't want to sound like a freak or anything, but I don't think that there is a teenager that talks like that. Right, teens?Anywho, without spoiling the plot (i.e. the ending), but this is a semi-okay movie. Keep your eyes open for some T&amp;A, well... just A, but it's better then nothing, right? And also an oddly-placed trumpet. (if you've seen it, you know what I mean).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good as the first? (Potential Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the whole gang is back in American Pie 2. Is it as good as the first? No, but I would say it's worth the price of admission. The big difference of AP2 is the increase of a few of the characters' "softer" sides (note that I say few). Of course the plot is a clothesline for the constant string of sophomoric humor (super glue, CB radios, sex toys, the drawback of phone sex with the invent of call waiting, to name a few). Standouts in the cast are Eugene Levy as Jim's dad, and Seann William Scott, as Stifler, who had some of the best scenes and lines. Even though he's type-casting himself into that role, he's good at it. Fans of the original shouldn't be disappointed. 3 stars/DE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok. Jim and his crew rent a vaction house for the summer and all the original cast returns, but the relationships between the guys and the girls from the first film have changed for the most part the guys rediscover true love and new friendships.A sequel that is actually better then the first one. Sure it pretty much sticks to the formula that made the first one so successful, but it is much sweeter and funnier then the original film. The opening gag is very memorable and a scene involing Jim and Michelle and a musical instrument is a laugh riot. Also some very noteworthy gags are, the first gag with Stifler that I won't dare give away, and a scene with all the guys sneaking into a pair of supposed lesibans house. Also the relationship that builds between Jim and Michelle is very charming and endearing. The cast still has plenty of appeal and work very well together. Hope they release a part three soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since they retained the cast of the first one, I expected another teen-comedy milestone. However, after the scene where Stifler tries (once again) to make out with a girl at his party, I feared that there would be too many repeated jokes. But that was avoided, mainly by giving Stifler/S. W. Scott a much bigger role. So I still laughed hard throughout the whole film until the happy end. But I hope that there won't be a third American Pie, because I don't believe that it would be more than a copy of itself, like so many other movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the fresh Am Pie 1 comes a lame rebirth that had some of the niceness of the first film but sagging in ideas or characters. The only fresh awkwardness was Stifler. He kept the film floating with his hilarious shameless "go-n-get-it" attitude. Jason Biggs character was the other half of the movie but again "gluing it" and the typical "getting sex lessons" is a total wash out. The other characters were mostly a bore. Sorry but this "get together again" all-smiles flick was hardly worth while doing (except for the big buck, of course).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is yet another sequel, and the basic formula is to rely on punchlines from the first movie when it comes to comedies. Except, for this one, It was STILL funny! It was so great so see the whole cast, even the supporting ones (Stifler's Mom, the MILF kids, Stifler's brother)....and they didn't abandon the storylines that were going on when the first one ended.There are lots of ORIGINAL, funny laughs in this one also, such as when the gang run into two suspected lesbians. Does the sequel surpass the original? No. But it's as close as I've ever seen, and it's a definite photo finish....all in all, it's the best sequel I've ever seen, and that counts for a lot. It's a tie in my book. And that's VERY good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was pretty good. I was entertained, as I was the first one. I agree that it was great that most (if not all) characters returned to this movie from the original. However, this had not plot to go on. It places the kids coming home from freshman year of college and the guys decide to get a summer house to party at. There were some great individual scenes and sub-plots, my favorite being Jim's whole deal... very cool, and very funny!The only thing that I can complain about is that this one lacked the "big" plot. I guess the idea was that they were supposed to remain friends forever and have one of those "eternal" summers, but it never seemed to come together. It was kind of like a few funny scenes in between an attempt to work on the main plot, and then at the end it was sloppily thrown together by having a heart-to-heart guy talk... but that's just it... there was no support for them having the eternal summer because they all seemed so separate from each other (minus the painting job they got). It gets a 5 out of ten for it's hilarious moments, but as most sequels are, this doesn't live up to the spontenaity, plotline, or freshness of the first one!</fullReview>

That book is by me, Kenneth Ray Stubbs, Ph.D. I never saw the title clearly, and it does not seem to be referenced anywhere.I thought others might be interested in knowing that that truly is an instructional book about tantric techniques and philosophy, written especially for people living in the modern world. The book was published last year and is available at Amazon.com.In tantric philosophy, there are no sacred cows. AP2 truly pokes fun at many sacred cows. I laughed so hard I had tears.Also, one scene shows the book lying open. That is at the tantric massage section. I have produced a video on this topic, entitled TANTRIC MASSAGE VIDEO and available at Amazon.com.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am one of the many fans of American Pie, so you could imagine my excitement when I heard a sequel was coming out. I had bought and seen the first one so many times that I couldn't wait to see what happened in these characters lives. This was an exception to the rule that sequels are not as good as the original. Not saying this was better, but it was just as good in my opinion. I think this movie could have stood on its own. If there was never an American pie, this still would have been a truly funny movie. Although there were allot of connections so it made allot more sense that you saw the first one, but was not mandatory to enjoy it. Just like the first one you had 2 big parties, stupid things happen to Stifler, the advice from Kevin's brother, Jim being in outrageous scenes, The embarrassing advice from Jim's dad, and so on and so on. I bet anyone who saw this would understand what I am saying. With that said this movie Rocks! I can't wait to see it again and put it in my DVD collection. Even though I enjoy seeing what these characters are up to, I hope they quite while they are ahead. They made great accomplishments with 2 great American Pie movies, but just like the Godfather, quit while you're ahead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AP2 is worth paying a matinee price to go see, it's not quite as fresh as the first one, but it has enough laughs that it holds its own.An unsettling note through: I'm not a prude or anything but there were lots of elementary-aged and middle school-aged kids in the theater I was in. What's up with that? Parents, this is an ADULT comendy that is raunchy in every sense of the word. Have we gotten to the point where we want 4th graders on the playground cracking the kinds of jokes and swearing profusly like the actors do in AP2? If that's the state of things in America, then we can pretty much hang it up. Anyway, for God's sake hire a babysitter to watch your kids the next time you decide you want to come to such adult-oriented fare. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninspired....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's the best word I can come up with to describe this sequel to 1999's hugely successful, and largely superior, American Pie.Alas, this is another case of a sequel that made it to the big screen not because of a raw, edgy script or a unique, intelligent plot, but simply because the first installment made the money counters at Universal Pictures extremely happy. From the first frame through to the last, this film appeared to be desperate to match the outrageous hilarity and vulgarity of its forerunner. American Pie was fresh and raw with a definate edge that left the audience in stitches even though the subject matter was more than a little crude. Pie 2 relies heavily on overused gross-out sight gags, incidents involving some main characters heavily testing the boundaries of heterosexuality and a ridiculous scene with a band instrument and likely some petroleum jelly. The humour is almost entirely forced with the majority of the scenes included in an obvious desperate effort to generate laughs based on the shocking raunchiness of the material. While the shock value worked extremely well in the first picture, it falls flat here, due largely in part to the skeletal plot which serves only as a device to present the aforementioned raunchy sketches. And as if the second rate humour wasn't enough, the script writers decided to throw in some good ole fashioned Hollywood Cheese to really make us cringe. If the jokes in this movie don't quite work, the attempt at a sappy cheesy romantic moment fails miserably. While all of the actors from the first film have returned for the sequel, most of them have been relegated to smaller roles with the majority of the screen time focusing on the wooden Jason Biggs, the sometimes cute sometimes annoying Alyson Hannigan and the admittedly funny Sean William Scott. They all do as well as can be expected, given the material they had to work with, with the standout being Scott's Stifler, whose infectious smile and outrageous personality generate laughs all on their own. Even Mr. Levy, who was fantastic in Pie 1, doesn't come close to recreating the laughs from the first film. I will admit, I laughed. This certainly was NOT a terrible movie - it had funny moments. Simply not to the same degree nor with the same edge as American Pie. Save your $12 and see this one when released on video. Not even seeing this movie in a room full of laughing movie goers can save it from its fate of being just another poorly planned inferior sequel. But I bet the money counters at Universal Pictures are laughing........ all the way to the bank. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>After various friends constantly telling me "Oh it's better than the first" I had high expectations of AP2. My friend and I were the first into the theater and I could barely watch the previews because I was so psyched. I was mainly anticipating the Stifler character because he's my favorite and he always has something very jackass-like to say which amuses me. I thought it was good that everyone returned because I despise movies with different characters or different actors playing the character in sequels, it was like we already knew everyone, which was good. There could have been more laughs, maybe that's only me because everyone seems to say it was funnier. I didn't really laugh outloud as much, besides some of Stifler's one liners, Jim acting like Petey, the opening scene where Jim's dad walks in on him and his "friend", and where Stfiler had to touch Finch's ass and kiss Jim, it was majorly gross but I couldn't help but laugh at the awkwardness. All in all, this wasn't bad, but in my opinion it wasn't as good as the first. It did pass the time and I came out smiling, it was entertaining, just not as good. Stifler rules and if not for him I might not have enjoyed it as much. 6.5/10</fullReview>

This is obvious in the cases of Shannon Elizabeth and Mena Suvari who seemed to have appeared for two days of shooting and look like they wanted to be somewhere else even in their limited scenes. But it was refreshing to see Alyson Hannigan reprise her role as the band geek and once again providing the most memorable laughs in the film.

For the rest of it, well, one might have hoped that Hollywood could finally stop doing what they have already done to far too many successful films- just throw in more of the same in the sequel.This movie does exactly what Police Academy, Scream, Godfather etc. etc. sequels did and this is really sad as they surely had a chance to follow up the last film better than this.Don't see it if you have seen the first installment, you will get bored to death by the endless references to every single funny scene from it and by the lame attempts to repeat it. However, this time without a clear plot or any feel-good morals ("it's not just about sex").It goes without saying that the soundtrack is a pale comparison to the first film too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...I'm trying to understand why AP2 is still #1 at the box office but...Let me begin by mentioning that I was one of the multitude of viewers who enjoyed the original American Pie. As such, I was very much looking forward to seeing the sequel, American Pie 2. I can't begin to tell you how incredibly disappointed I was upon exiting the theatre today.In my humble opinion, the thing that set American Pie apart from the seemingly never-ending parade of gross-out films was the ability of the writers to establish character development within the context of a film of said genre. In watching AP1, one couldn't help but get a little caught up in the voyage these four young men were embarking on -- the slow realization that sex is not the be all and end all of existence. I will grant my detractors the fact that neither of these films was meant to stimulate the intellectual parts of the brain, however, it seems to me that in order to truly love a film, the audience must be able to identify with the characters. There is very little opportunity in AP2 for the audience to do that, unfortunately. The storyline involving Jim and his belle is interesting, if not predictable, but the all the rest is simply filler -- more opportunities to throw in more gross-out humour ad nauseum.As for the gross-out jokes, they are humourous, to be sure. Eugene Levy is brilliant, as usual. As for the rest of the cast, can any of them actually act (other than Alyson Hannigan)? Granted, in a movie such as this great skill is not necessary, but I don't think it would be too much to ask for.All-in-all, AP2 has its funny moments and is worth seeing, but don't make the mistake I made and see it in the theatre -- wait for the DVD!4/10</fullReview>

This movie is no different in that department, but also appears to be a more serious movie than the first.Instead of focusing completely on sex, like the first movie, love becomes a more important issue to the main characters. This isn't the only serious issue dealt with in the film and this does not detract from the humour of the film. The serious issues create a more well-rounded film than the first, not only making the audience laugh, but creating a stronger connection with the characters in it, and who knows, maybe the viewers will learn something from it....aside from not keeping super glue on the night stand.By the end of the film, it is easy to develop a connection with the main characters (aside from Stiffler), which makes the ending so much better than the first.The writing was well done in this movie, however like most movies of this sort, there is nothing overly spectacular about the other film areas. It really isn't necessary to have amazing cinematography or sound effects in a movie of this type, but the cinematography was well rounded and the sound effects sometimes had you squirming in your seat (because they were so effective).Most sequals are never as good as the original, but this one is just as good or better, in my own opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie 2 was funny like I expected but not the way I would've liked it. American Pie 2 is the follow up to the box office hit American Pie (which I have not seen yet). The movie is about Jim (Jason Biggs) and basically his whole summer life with his best friends. The movie was funny. Personally I thought Jim's father was the funniest in the film. This film is 100% aimed at a teen audience. I'm 14 but did not find it to be one of the funniest movies this year. The jokes are mostly consisted of sexual humor. Not my type though. But this was certainly funnier than Bubble Boy.8/10</fullReview>

Usually sequels dont hold up as good as the first movie,but this is different,if you saw the original you have to see this ! The movie takes place one year after college and summer is just up ahead...fun,parties,booze and sex. This summer it's about sticking together !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I LOVED AP2!!!...Same as the first if not better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw American Pie 2 I laughed so hard. I thought it was better than the first one and they brought back some of the old characters from the first and some new ones. They still had the MILF guys and Stifler's bro. They also had Kevin's bro and the Sherman. The sequal is different from the first. A lot of the relatonships in the first one aren't the same as it is in the second. I was suprised of all the changes that was happening. I recommend you see the first one and then the second because there are some jokes you won't get if you haven't seen the first. In the second one, Jim actually goes to band camp and ses Michelle and of course they have a new "This one time, at band camp..." quote, but not as good as the first. Michelle helps Jim with some sex advice while there at band camp and Jim has a little incicdent concernig a trumpet...which was very funny. My favorite part would probably be when Stifler, Jim, and Finch are confronted by the "lesbians!" All in all it was a really funny movie...I suggest you see and if you already have seen it, see it again. AP and AP2 RULEZ!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I saw the first American Pie film, pretty much all I remembered was an hour and a half long dirty joke. What I didn't recall was that the film actually had some rather mature and wonderful sentiments about sexuality, youth, and romantic relationships. In my mind, though, the raunchy jokes kind of pushed the more pleasant elements aside.I was similarly surprised with the sequel. I didn't go into the theatre expecting very much, and what I got was a funny yet sentimental comedy that was well done and extremely enjoyable. I did think that the gross-out humour of this particular installment was toned down a bit from the first (superglue scene aside- and that one just hurt me rather than make me laugh). Still, it was a little grosser than it had to be, but my guess is that's why this film was so successful.The performances were also above par for this sort of film. Jason Biggs did what he does best: play the awkward guy. Sean William Scott really steals the show; he reminds everyone of that one obnoxious person in their lives and does it scarily well.I was really pleased with the character development in this film, particularly with "band camp girl" (whose name escapes me just now). Not to sound condescending, but to me her character in particular showed a level of emotional understanding that I really wouldn't have thought this film capable of.Anyway, I'd recommend seeing this one. You'll laugh (even if you don't really want to) and you get the bonus of a well-done comedy that doesn't just rely on sick humour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that I love this movie. I also was a big fan of the first movie. This one is as funny if not funnier than the first. The only thing that I wander, was that the same girl that played Nadia in the first one? It sure didn't look or sound like her. Other than that, I laughed my ass off. I am 27 years old and had the time of my life in a theatre seeing a movie that would be considered a teen flick. It is just Jim's luck for his dad to walk in while he is having sex! Finch still gets my vote for the luckiest guy in the movie. Damn, how is it that a dork like Finch still can get laid by a woman like Stifler's mom? Than of course there is Michelle that we run into again at a dare we mention a band camp? Her one line in the first made me laugh harder than anything else "And this one time at band camp I stuck a flute in my *****" There are some great lines in this film. So, my rating for American Pie 2 is a 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey I loved the first one and it was a riot but the second one was better. Not by much though. I thought this was gonna be a sequel made to capitalize on the success of the first one in which they'll make a horrible movie that tried too hard o be the first one but it really wasn't. I was quite surprised. The parts that I'll remember the most are the scene where the two hot women are playing games with Stifler, Jim and Finch. My favourite character is of course the Stifmeister(the older one). There are also a tonne of other hilarious characters which are back from the first. I liked how they developed Alyson Hannigan's character more. All in all this movie is a complete riot and everything you want in a comedy.10/10 good stuff!!</fullReview>

In a way they are very much clones of each other with the first one having a tighter story and the 2nd one having a few more laughs. My biggest complaint about American Pie 2 is that the funniest scene was in the trailer, and there were too many very dull moments in between the funny ones.

		<fullReview>If you watched the first American Pie it's unlikely that you've forgotten it; after all there's not many films where you get to see a sex-starved teenager enjoying liaisons with a pie, is there? On the back of its word of mouth notoriety and resulting box office thrust, it was inevitable that a second AP would be made.We begin with Jim's dad picking accidentally walking in on him in bed with a young blonde. If that wasn't bad enough for poor Jim, his mum and then the blonde girl's parents follow his father in too. `I didn't catch her name, but I'm sure Jim here did', his father stammers as Jim hastily pulls the blanket over them. From here the scene is set as we return to familiar ground as the first movie with plenty of sexually orientated japes.After their first year of college has ended, Jim, Stifler, Kevin, Oz and Finch are back home and bored. So after a tip from Kevin's brother the five set out to the beach where they rent themselves a party house and get summer jobs as painters. With a big end of summer party being planned, the lads have plenty more on their mind with Jim nervously awaiting Nadia's return, Stifler desperately seeking some lesbians, Kevin pining for Victoria, Oz missing the absent Heather and Finch craving for more of Stifler's mum.AP2 is no Shakespearean work and offers little more than the first, but if you liked the first then that's no problem. As with 1999's pie scene, Jim's altercation with a tube of glue is the main gross out moment, though Stifler's seduction through (what he thinks) is champagne is equally foul.The show stealer however, as with the first movie is Jim's dad- excellently played by Eugene Levy. His deadpan, straight-faced humour is simply terrific with many of the funniest moments centred on him. The main cast too though prove that they've moved on from the first, though there is more than a distinct danger that Seann William Scott has been typecast having starred in Road Trip and Dude, Where's My Car since the first AP.The character development is still strong though, building on what helped make the first so successful. Although we can laugh at Jim, his character is such that we also empathise with him and the others. The girls however are also merely bi-products to the lad-led movie. Mena Suvari barely features as Heather, Oz's absent girlfriend, with Tara Reid as Vicky and Alyson Hannigan as Michelle getting little more time either.If you enjoyed the first, then this you will like this too. The writers and directors have taken the sensible approach of (as my teacher used to say) `if it ain't broke, don't poke', using the same ideas that gave them success before. The belly laughs are still there, the ?ughs' are still there and so, of course, is the Sherminator.8/10 (if you liked the first) 1/10 (if you didn't)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Return to teen classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a year shy of being able to officially be called a "thirty-something" I feel that original American Pie, and the sequel have managed to tap into a beloved movie market that has otherwise been dead and buried since the mid to late 1980's: the teen classic.As a teen in the mid-80's my generation (does that term now classify my as "old"?) was treated to the best of the best in teen films with the fabled John Hughes trilogy - Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, and Pretty in Pink (not to mention Weird Science and Ferris Bueller's Day Off). These movies have not only become classics, but integral parts of the overall 80's lexicon. I feel that American Pie and American Pie 2 have signaled a triumphant return to this market.What I consider the true brilliance of these movies is the almost undetectable blend of silliness and quick wit. Unlike what I would call "idiot humour" (see Scary Movie, any Saturday Night Live spinoff), the American Pie movies keep the movie goers entertained with amazing dialogue, excellent character development (kudos to the casting crew for getting the entire original cast back), and the element of teen fantasy.This is the kind of movie that anyone from 15-35+ can identify with and ultimately adore. This is what we've been missing in the comedy genre for about 15 years now. Hopefully someone is listening...</fullReview>

The sex was still there, but it was a backburner rather than a frontrunner in the movie. There were characters that weren't needed in the movie, although they were originals; these people just didn't show up enough.It's about the boys in this one. Hanging out, summer jobs, old flames.

		<fullReview>I just went to see this movie yesterday, and I must say I was very impressed. I figured this would fall into the trenches as a comedy sequel that just relied on the jokes from the 1st movie to keep this one afloat. WRONG! This movie was, in ways, a much more "intelligent" comedy. It didn't have to just focus on the raunchy or disgusting to get laughs.Here we find Jim, Oz, Stifler, Finch and Kevin all finishing their first semester at college, and wanting to keep up with the fun-loving, good time the first on did, they decide to rent a small house on the beach, and at the end of summer have a big party. Jim is still on his quest to fulfill his dream of being with Nadia. I was impressed with the turn they took on this. Shannon Elizabeth was, as always, gorgeous reprising her role as the foregin exchange student. Kevin finds out Vicky is with another guy, and she wants them to just be "friends". Finch is also on his quest, and with the help of Tantra, will again win the "heart" of Stifler's Mom. Oz and Heather are just as cute as they were in the first one. I must say, one of the biggest highlights, and one of the funniest parts of the movie was with Jim, Stifler, and Finch trying to watch 2 "lesbians" get it on. Hilarious!This movie defintely did not need to ride the coat tails of the first. I think this will be just as big as the first. It was fresh, funny and keep up the laughs. Yeah, there is still a little raunch, but nothing like the 1st Scary Movie. This is just a good time.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie on Friday with my boyfriend, and, in my opinion, AMERICAN PIE 2 is much better, funnier, and less crass and vulgar than the first AMERICAN PIE. There is one crass part I can remember, though. That part is when Stifler (Seann William Scott) got urinated on while he was laying on a patio chair in his backyard on the night he had a party at his house -- With a girl behind him! When Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) performed her flute solo at band camp, I thought she did a good job. If you ask me, the setting was perfect for a film released at this time of year -- Especially the beach house. That was a nice place. That makes me wish I had taken a summer vacation like that when I was younger. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I thought the ending was sweet and funny. Now, in conclusion, if you liked AMERICAN PIE, you should see AMERICAN PIE 2, that is, if you haven't seen it. You're in for a real treat, a good time, and lots of laughs, so, go out to the theater with some friends and see it today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone is back for round two! More laughs, more gags, more jokes, more gross out antics and more touchy feely topics are abound in AMERICAN PIE 2. All this does not make it all the more better though. Everything is just an extension or further suggestion to anyone who laughed at the first but did not know why.College freshman year is done and our four main friends from the first movie are slowly starting to pull away from each other. To seize the moment, Kevin takes his older brother's advice and has our buddies go to a beach house and enjoy the rest of the summer. To help pay the bills, they add the annoying but humorous Stifler to the mix.The lesbian/radio act was excellent though probably very damaging to the actors involved. Also Finch was more annoying by taking his THE GRADUATE-like character further. AMERICAN PIE 2 does have its moments but gradually it becomes the same tired idea that we will always remember. Granted, young Hollywood does look promising in many ways and it will be interesting to see where in the future all the actors of AMERICAN PIE end up. If you liked the first, you'll pretty much enjoy the second.</fullReview>

I'd see it again, though it was lacking a true story to go off of and there was one problem we already know the characters. That means no exposition, no original character traits, and pretty much you know how it ends. I know some people are dying to see it, so I wont divulge that info here. Though the plot line was as creative as asking what was the first music video on MTV. And we know the characters, thats if you saw the first American Pie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sequels tend to only work when the first movie was the first act of a bigger conceptual story. Stories constructed in this fashion are then free to break new ground while improving on the original themes of the first movie.American Pie II is an exception to that rule. They basically use the same formula to create a fun experience. And while I do not generally like films whose main reason for creation is simply to make more money out of a proven success story, AP2 still delivers enough laughs to merit a trip to the theatre, even if they are the same basic gags in different clothing. So if you liked the first film, put your money down and have a good time for about two hours.A better movie would have gone further in to the future to really explore the themes the movie tries to deal with, but that would have been too risky for the studio. But who cares...it is still fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Pie was a surprise with quite a few unexpected jokes and characters' relationships as well as silliness over the border that made it fun to watch. Just an idea of bringing ALL characters together again without any development or changes in them at all is a stink. Pie-2 was becoming more and more boring and distanced with each next scene. The director and writers were too scared this time to offend anyone and get into any issue: family, sex, maturity, american culture. It became all about happy campers and "dead" characters dragged from the first movie to the second one. If they make Pie-3, which is probably already in making, it will be an embarassment to anyone who still respects moviemaking.</fullReview>

I enjoyed the hell out of this movie, it was so much fun, never laughed so hard, it seems this is the summer of sequels and they seem to be working very well I think...all the reprised characters in this were absolutely great!! the jokes were 10 X as funny and Stifler is still the king in this movie. Only dissapointment was the original girls from the first one are majorly under used and Tara Reid looked so pretty in this, I wish I coulda saw more of her in this...The only girl that was majorly used and yet was the last to appear was Alison Hannigan (sp?) they used more of her in this, and it was actually a really nice change for once...and every part that Mena Suvari was in was absolutely great.This movie definately finished it off for me of good summer movies I saw, I hope they make one more cause this one was tons of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than The First, But Still "Just OK"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that American Pie 2 is better than the original, but that's not saying much. Amongst my peers, I am the only one who didn't love American Pie. There's nothing wrong with the film, I just didn't enjoy it during repeat viewings, after the initial sensationalism was gone. Of course, the same problem might occur with this movie, since I've only seen it once as of this review, but thats not the point.Set a year after the first film, everyone's favorite teenage male stereotypes are returning home after their freshman year of college. The 5 friends decide to have a summer blow-out by renting a beach house, but, being unable to afford it, they bring along Stifler, who was little more than a footnote in the first film. Stifler is given a much greater role, and this is a good thing; Sean William Scott is just so good at playing the chauvinistic jerk that I really hated him (up until now I considered this a bad thing - but now I realize I should be applauding such fine acting!). Another character with a huge role increase from the first is Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), whom Jim visits for advice (at the legendary "band camp" no less!) and shares several "mishap scenes" with. Michelle is, just like in the first film, the only memorable female character, and it's great to see that she was given a bigger part.The promotion of these two minor characters to major is such a good thing because, aside from Jim, the other main characters became incredibly boring. Just like in the first film, the funniest sexual mishaps always happen to Jim, which makes him the only character worth caring about. Oz' girlfriend is in Europe for most of the film, and he's too sweet of a guy to try anything behind her back; this makes him a likable character, but a dull one nonetheless. Finch's character is totally killed, as he is left wanting nothing but Stifler's mom; he appears every now and then, but seems for the most part to be written out, appearing every so often in a scene with his new tantra gimmick, which really goes nowhere. Finally, there's the other guy, who, though being the most realistic character and suffering from the most realistic problem of not being able to be "just friends" with his ex, is so unsensational compared to the others that I can't even remember his name (this film, like the first, relies on sensationalism - realism in a character is actually a bad thing).The same gross-out sexual mishaps that defined the first film are back, and so over the top that even a self-proclaimed "mature" viewer like myself can't help but laugh. As unbelievable as some are (at least those from the first film could conceivably happen to someone), its hard not to laugh at them, even though most of them can be easily foreseen by any viewer remotely familiar with the first film. As enjoyable as these scenes are, they present the major problem with this film: there is really no substance to the film besides these scenes; the rest of the film is just filler. The overall flow of the film is much too inhibited by how weak the filler is compared to how great Jim's screw-ups are. If any of the other characters from the original were developed further, instead of being sacrificed for Stifler and Allison (great as these 2 characters are now, they can't save all the filler), no doubt the between time would've dragged less. But really, the only reason I paid my $8 was to see what happens to Jim anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a sequel. What a sequel.I personally thought that I would NOT laugh as hard as I did for this movie, but DAMN did I ever! STIFLER WAS THE KING IN THIS FLICK! He was the one who made me laugh the hardest. A complete moron, and he stills gets the lesbians in the end. What a b*****d!The movie generally revolved around the main guys, whom went up to a summer beach house to try and discover themselves, or "see the big picture."It was interesting to see that the guys were looking in another direction for this story rather than try to get laid and say goodbye.Everything worked out very well, especially for Jim, whom I'd say did the right thing. I know what you're probably thinking...Jim should've taken Nadia all night long, yea. Of course. Well, Jim was wise in doing what he did, and I probably would make the same choice.Overall, great laughs, great story, great acting, and Stifler is the king.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Further proof that sequels are usually a bad idea.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. Not since 'The Cable Guy' have I ever wanted to walk out of a movie theater so badly. I was actually happy that I drank a large soda and had to go to the bathroom twice. This film was terrible. Apparantly, everyone involved with making the original movie spent too much time thinking of gross sex scenes involving muscular women and how funny it would be to see an awkward guy glue his hand to his penis to come up with an actual plot for the sequel. Five guys go to a beach house for the summer. Yeah, that's it. This movie cheapened the original by using the exact type of jokes and scenes and maybe adding a dildo or a shot of urine to it. Tara Reid is a gross bimbo and the leathery-faced kid who played Kevin needed a paper bag over his head. Chris Klein is easy on the eyes, but I felt like burying my head in the ground when he attempted to have phone sex with his newborn-looking girlfriend Mena Whats-her-name..Subaru? Finch was cool in the original, but he was such a creepy guru in this movie that he was downright irritating. A very few good points: Jim's emergency scene was pretty darn funny, and he was at his best as special ed kid Petey. The guy who plays Stifler is a genuinely funny guy, and he pretty much made the movie watchable. I do not reccomend spending full price on this movie--wait until it hits the cheapies or is on video. I'm pretty sure you won't have to wait long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>aka "Jim's Story"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the first movie focused on all 4 guys (Jim, Kevin, Oz, Finch) trying to get laid, this one sends everyone to the background except Jim and brings Stifler to the front. It's all about Jim wanting to be cool with girls and Stifler doing what he does best, i.e. making a complete fool of himself but all in good fun. Too bad we don't see much of Heather, I guess Mena Suvari wanted a break from this franchise, though her absence did highlight how mature her relationship with Oz is. The plot between Kevin and Vicki was so lame, you can ignore it without missing anything. The gags pretty much followed the same order as the first movie, i.e. Jim and his dad, then Stifler's party, then the broadcast goof (Internet in the first movie, CB radio in the second), then the guys deciding to throw a party to get girls, and finally everyone ends up happy in the arms of his (naked) girl. And in the end, it's all about Jim becoming a really believable and likeable character, not that he isn't already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The essence of a sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only saw this movie after seeing enough comments on how great this movie was, especially compared to the first. Now I have to say, it still uses the same formula as American Pie (otherwise it wouldn't be called American Pie) but it manages to do something more sequels should do.It extends the characters. That is, it takes the first movie and goes forward, showing how the kids lives continue. I'll admit it doesn't change their character drastically, and they're still the same people in similar situations even after the movie ends. But it remains a true continuation nonetheless.Too many sequels try to be more "extreme" and than the original and put all their eggs (or jokes) in one basket. Examples of this are Wayne's World 2, Ace Ventura 2, and Austin Powers 2. All of these tried to outdo the original so much, to the point of nearly raping the original's character, and leave little room for continuation once "everything has been done already."AP2 does try to go further with its moments, but it still leaves the original intact, and in fact complements the original. The above mentioned movies don't. The only real negatives are that many scenes are spent trying to be cool or teeny, and seem to take up time simply for the sake of showing young people dance around and act cool. There are times when the main characters hover just over the underdog status they maintained in the first movie, but in a way this could be seen as a good change. Still, the characters remain true to themselves, which leaves it with the fact that this is still American Pie. If you didn't like the first, you probably won't like this one. Many scenes refer to or parallel the original movie, which may tire some viewers, but the basic point of the movie is to show the same characters as they were before, only continuing their lives. This is what a sequel should be- no replacing cast members or dropping others with no explanation. We get to see what happens to all the important players in the first movie. It also feels complete as a second movie. Questions unanswered after the first American Pie are answered and expanded on here, and there's still enough to continue on to another movie. It didn't have any real lose ends or unresolved conflicts that made it beg for a sequel, but a sequel would still work without harming this film (assuming it was done right).So as a study on how to do a sequel correctly, AP2 would be a good choice. Its only downfall is that its still similar to the first movie, and doesn't try anything drastically different. But like I said, it wouldn't be American Pie if its was a completely different movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original, is this possible?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very easy for a sequel to be better than the original, if the original is only mediocre comedy filled with lots of gross-out gags. Even so, I went into AP2 expecting an even more mediocre version of the first. And I was very pleasantly surprised.Granted, it's not high art. It's still a movie about 5 guys trying to get laid. But it's a much funnier version than the first, and even though the trailers seemed to be planting tongue firmly in cheek by referring to AP2 as a film about friendship, the movie actually did provide a sense of deeper meaning that was completely absent in the first.Obviously, this film doesn't run very deep, but American Pie 2 even throws in a potentially tear-jerking scene and the director actually strives to make the audience feel for the characters. Most summer movies don't even go that far.Although it didn't have to do much to surpass American Pie, AP2 is not only one of the surprisingly better movies of the summer, it is also one of the few sequels to blow the original away.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a good sequel this summer!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie has often been refered to as the Porky's of the 90's, the comparison is justified, but having grown up with Porky's I think that American Pie is better, and certainly, the new film is infinitely better to the almost unwatchable Porky's 2. American Pie is a good sequel, it repeats with good success the feel of the first film. Yes the first film and this one get their laughs from raunchy humor, but it is done well and the actors fit well into their characters. AP2 basicly has the same structure as the first film, the five friends Jim,Oz,Kevin,Finch and Stifler find new and very hilarious ways to humiliate themselves in the quest for sex. Especially Jim, as in the first film he is very insecure about his abilities,and the results are hilarious!!! Also the first film had a sweetness to it that balanced out some of the raunchy stuff. Jim looks to his bandgeek friend Michele for help with his problem, a cute relationship develops between them develop. But the movie really belongs to Stifler(Sean W. Scott), in the first film he stole almost every scene he is in, this time he is in the movie more and gets the most laughs. Most critics hate sequels because they argue that they only exist to cash in on the original, of course that is why sequels are made! But this sequel does what a good sequel should do, it entertains as much as the original, yes it repeats the formula to a tee, but it goes for big laughs and gets them.Grade: B</fullReview>

Tara Ried, Mena Suvari, Chris Klien, Natasha ?, and Shannon Elizabeth had minimal roles and were just there for show. It was all Jim, Stiffler, and the band geek with too much reflection on the past.

		<shortDescription>The best summer movie, thus far, of 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** There are two genres that have had a healthy recrudescence in the last two or three years. One being the horror genre due in large part to Scream and the other is the teen comedy and that is due in large part to the overwhelming success of American Pie in the summer of 99. This revival has inspired mostly inferior films like Tomcats and Whatever It Takes but it has also given us some gut-busters like Road Trip. But nothing has come close to understanding the sheer audacity and gutsy bravado that American Pie demonstrated. I can think back to another time in the early 80's when films were trying desperately to imitate Porky's and Fasttimes at Ridgemont High. There were a few good ones like Wild Life and Mischief but more often than not you got a sad film like Hot Dog and we had to wait until Porky's 2 was launched before we laughed hoarsely again. Well here we are some 20 years later and this comedic revival of the teen genre is now in full bloom. American Pie was damn funny, American Pie 2 is damn funnier and it pushes the envelope in the area of raunchiness. There are films that don't know what to do with their raunchy scenes and they are played strictly to gross you out. But not American Pie 2. Every scene that disgusts you, every scene that makes you cringe in guilt is done so with a punch line waiting for you at the end. The creators of American Pie 2 have outdone themselves and they have created one of the funniest films I have seen in quite a long time.Spoilers ahead!!AP2 begins on the last day of classes for our four friends in college. Kevin, Stifler and Oz are all at Michigan State ( I think) and Jim is somewhere else. Finch has travelled abroad so we don't get to see him until they meat up at Dog Years about ten minutes into the film. Jim is still trying to learn to relax when it comes to sex, Finch is now a master at sex, Oz is still with Heather and Kevin is not with anybody. After Stifler's party gets busted, the boys, after Kevin calls his brother, decide to rent a cottage on Lake Michigan. Stifler is invited because they would not be able to afford the place on their own. The rest of the movie is basically about the boys trying to get laid and the difficulties and hilarity that ensues.One of the things that makes AP2 so successful is that almost every character that had a speaking role in the first movie is back for more in the second. And not only are they nice to see for familiarity sake, each one has a funny line or a few funny scenes to keep us laughing. We all know the major ones that return but also back for more laughs is Sherman, or as he likes to call himself, the Sherminator. Then there is also the two guys that were drunk in the first one and kissed Stifler's mom's picture, and then called her a MILF. Stifler's little brother makes his return and utters his famous line "F*****s, F*****s, F*****s!", which got a good laugh from the audience. Also the monkey and the Internet boys make a brief cameo. This was smart bringing back these minor characters because when I told some of my cronies at work that most of the major characters were back, they asked me if that included Sherman and the MILF guys. People remember AP1 really well and it is the smaller roles as well as the starring ones that made it so funny.But besides these smaller more quaint details, what makes AP2 so good is the story and the progression or regression of characters. Stifler stays the same but the others have differed in some ways.Finch is still obsessed with Stifler's mom and he is now learning the art of Tantra so he can channel his sexual being even more than he did at the conclusion of first one. Of course him and Stifler have some memorable bantering about his mother and this is just another areas that plays out well for laughs.Oz and Heather have to communicate through the phone for the summer as she is spending it abroad in Paris so they try risque things like phone sex, to no avail. Everything from Stifler to call waiting interrupt their time together.Kevin is still hooked on Vicky and Jim is still trying to get laid. Michelle and Nadia, Jim's girls from the first also make some memorable appearances with Michelle stealing most of her scenes, regardless of who she shares them with. Jessica and of course Mr. Levinstein (Jim's dad) round out the cast of AP1 veterans.Adam Herz has written one of the funniest films I have seen. Not only does he build off AP1's humour, but he creates new situations and some you seewill probably shock you. We have seen a few of these in the trailer, but believe me when I say that you are only seeing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the payoff. Stifler is by far the funniest character and he delivers some of the best one liners. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Stifler reminds me of a cross between Jeff Spicolli and Walter Gibson ( John Cusack's character from The Sure Thing). As crude as he is, and he is, there is also a vulnerable side to him that just peaks it's head out. And finally, not only does he get the girl in this one, he ends up scoring what is considered to be the Holy Grail amongst guys and their campfire and beer stories.There is enough humour and story to go around in here easily for another AP. I would like to see that but at the same time, they have laid it on pretty thick for this film and to try to out do this one may result in a situation similar to Porky's 3. Maybe they can churn out another but if they left it at this, then I would be more than happy. It's always good to go out on a winning note. And there are an abundance of franchises that went one step too far and blew it, that should be fair warning to the makers of AP. Jaws, Rocky, Porky's, Superman and Friday the 13th, all had winning franchises on their hands before they went out and insulted us with insipid and dull efforts like Jaws 4, Friday 7-9, Rocky 5 and Superman 3 and 4. Let's just hope that if there is an AP3, they take their time and write another film with this much panache and humour. As it stands, this is the best film I have seen so far this summer and probably this year. I could continue this review for a few more paragraphs and mention some of the funnier parts of the film, but that should be left to your imagination. Hearing too much about the film would ruin many of the surprises the film has to offer.9.5 out of 10- If you liked this first, you'll love this one. Watch out for cascading champagne scene, the lesbian scene and anything involving Michelle or Finch. The accolades are endless so I'll stop here. Just see this movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disgusting, yet hilarious, and better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As if the first one was not crude enough, American Pie 2 takes it one step further. It's also much funnier. Really hot women, tons of sexual misendeavors, and *gasp* AN ACTUAL PLOT fill this movie, as opposed to the first one, which was hilarious, but, kind've random. I couldn't stop laughing during American Pie 2, and at some parts, I wasn't sure why. This is a classic comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often you can say that the sequel was better than the original. But in the case of "American Pie 2" it's true. The first thing that really charmed me is every single main character is back. Everyone who had some relevance to the plot line is back for the sequel. I don't think this has ever happened. They didn't try to over do the jokes in the film. They were funny and not at all stupid. I also enjoyed the tie-ins from the original. Such as Stiffler's now hatred for Finch and Jim still getting himself into "sticky" situations. The best parts were Jim's choice in the end and Stiffler's now stupid side.</fullReview>

The first one was much better because everyone had a common goal, to get laid. They didn't have any motivation in this one. Get laid again? how boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you mix teenagers with sex, it has to be funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it was mostly panned by the critics, American Pie 2 proved to be an entertaining teen sex comedy. Fueled by the same dynamite cast that made the first film the hit that it was, the film in turn used many or similar jokes that were lauded in it's original. Somehow, the humor never runs dry. Basically, sex is always entertaining, and in the case of Jim and several others (Sherman especially) the pursuit of sex can be embarrassing but it all pays off in spades when you score with Nadia or the one that Jim loves (Michelle). The most exuberant performance definitely came from the energetic Seann William Scott. Stifler never gets old, and lucky for Finch, neither does his Mom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked the first one, this one isn't worth your $5-10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- characters hanging on by mere threads (Nadia, Oz, etc.), as if most of the original cast had just phoned in an embarrassed cameo performance- a plot lame enough to make you squeam, barely holding the joke scenes together, which makes for an unbearable lack of flow, where the first one undoubtably had great flow- most of the jokes are genuinely unfunny or too forced, only Stifler saves the day somewhat (BTW, he was also very good in the luke-warm "Evolution"), but even his lines are half as good as the original, otherwise this has got to be some of the worst dialogue ever; you sort of want to leave, despite some of the tasty ladies being paraded aroundAll in all, wait for the video, rent with a bunch of friends to save $, and have plenty of alcoholic beverage and snacks on hand to get you through the lame portions between the few good scenes;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this flick over the weekend, and I must say I was mighty impressed. As is often the case, sequels tend to suck the big time in comparison to the originals. Fortunately, this one does not fall into that category. In fact, I think I enjoyed this one even more than the original.To me, the entire movie just felt smoother than the original, with less lulls. The other comments I've read note that some felt it was a little long and that the plot just kind of clunked along, but I disagree. Of course, I didn't really have too much time to mull over the intricacies of the film since I was laughing so hard the entire time. At any rate, I found myself laughing more often, for longer periods of time than I have in quite some time, and any movie that can do that is "A-Okay" in my book.Go see it. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Favorite Comedy of the summer of 2001 is Shrek, American Pie 2 is a close 2nd. I thought American Pie was outstanding this was just plain funny and very good writingMainly focuses on Jim(Jason Biggs) adventures, touches on other characters but mainly Jim, he is definatly a breakthrough comedy actor, and shows signs of greatness.I thought the first American Pie had a better story, but this was a little funnier, Stifler had great lines, but if this was the first I would have no problem at all, now if you havent seen the first then you wont know whats going onbut definatly one of the best this summer, and 9/10 go see it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many apples in the orchard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A complaint often heard about movie sequels is the abandonment of certain characters from the original picture. Often times in the interest of plot, certain characters are not deemed necessary, or certain actors are not with the financial constraints to recast in minor roles. "American Pie 2" suffers from the exact opposite of this phenomenon. Unfortunately they kept everybody.There is only so much characterization that can possibly be handled in two hours of screen time. If you focus on one or two characters you can exquisitely probe their personalities for comedy or drama. When you try to give equal screen time to a cast of eight or ten there are certain compromises that are made. What invariably happen is that some of the characters actually become the setting, they are not moving within the tableau, they are the tableau.This becomes a problem when you try to create a new plot and include all these characters. Because what you are effectively doing is recreating the same basic picture. The cheap trick to avoid this is to radically alter certain characters for no apparent reason other than to create new plot vehicles. To its credit "American Pie 2" does not do this. What this means however, is that we are necessarily going to be treading across a lot of the same ground.The character Jim is the center of this story as he was the last. His development is strong in this picture as are the characters he is directly involved with. However much of the rest of the cast are simply holding space. Some of them provide bright moments of humor and are gladly welcome. Stifler is a perfect example of this. He does not develop in the slightest but he is the fulcrum for much of the humor in the film. He is more a plot device than a character but he truly makes the film work. Without him or with a toned down version we would have large gaps of nothing.However some performances are completely superfluous. I challenge anyone to tell me how the movie would have been changed in the least if Kevin or Vicky had been removed. Kevin's key action was to come up with the idea of the beach house; this could easily have been given to any other character. Vicky on the other hand did essentially nothing at all. I guess she could be insulted for not being allowed to act, but hey, it not too bad to get paid for playing pool.In and of itself it is not a problem to assemble a large cast, the problem is the script tries to divide it's time equally between them- but all the subplots are not of equal interest. There are stretches in the movie where the comedic cadence is definitely broken in order to develop a minor character to no real effect. The scene between Jessica and Sherman at the party stands out in my mind. It is not funny or interesting and really should have been left on the editing room floor. This moment seems included purely for the purpose of giving Natasha Lyonne more screen time. This is a shame because the scene is not good but the actress is. Her performance in the first movie was delightful yet here she is wasted.The picture is solid in it's own right as a comedy but one wonders what great craftsmanship could have been engendered if some of the fat had been cut away. If you have ever tried to organize one of these get-togethers with all your old buddies from high school or college, you know that it never all works out. For some reason or another you're never going to get everyone back together again in one place at one time. Perhaps the experience is better for it, to miss someone and hope to get it all together next time. Well, the "American Pie" folks can at least hope for the second part...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first, but still had its moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few movie sequels can equal the greatness of The Godfather or Indiana Jones. Most sequels have unoriginal story lines and rehash the same plot, jokes, and/or characters from the first movie. American Pie 2, unfortunately, is the norm and not a gem. Although American Pie 2 is not a bad movie and I still enjoyed it very much, I share the sentiment that many viewers of the first have: This movie is not original by any means. The problem with AP2 is that it fails to live up to the hype created by the first one. AP2 lacks the spontaneity and shocking humorous lines and scenes that we were so accustomed to in the original. After seeing the first one, its not so shocking to see Jim's dad walk in on his son while he's in bed with another girl, or when Jim superglues his hand to his private parts, or hearing most of Stifler's one-liners. Although these scenes did make me and most of the audience laugh, it was not the same "fall out of my chair" humor that American Pie was able to bring. What made this movie better than mediocre in the end, is the larger presence of the flute-toting band geek, Michelle, played wonderfully once again by Alyson Hannigan. Although she doesn't produce the memorable lines we will all remember from the first one: - the repetitive "And this one time, at Band Camp..." - the unexpected "Say my name BI*&amp;H!!" she still delivers some of the best lines: - "I get violent when I'm horny" - "One time at Band, oh wait, here..." (when she is talking to Jim during Band Camp) Michelle's character is also developed more in-depth, which gives her more screen time. Definitely a plus for all Michelle or Alyson Hannigan fans, like myself. My rating for American Pie 2 is a 7/10, (I gave American Pie a 9/10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first one was funny. This one was just boring. Sure it tried to out-shock the original, but the jokes were far too contrived and the characters were just treading water between the jokes. What the hell was the Oz character even doing in the movie? He spent the entire time just standing around and watching everyone else (and even his phone-sex stuff with his girlfriend was brief and dull). Finch? The tantric thing was funny the first time, but grew tiresome real fast. Stiffler? I found him funny-rude the first time, but just annoying-rude this time around. Only Jason Biggs was funny, and that's because they gave him all the best lines/scenes. Oh, there was another guy in the movie, right? Jeez...I guess he was completely forgettable. Don't waste your time/money on this one. Save it for the video release. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"American Pie 2" is tasteless, over the edge, totally funny, and somehow manages to be a sweet romance. Amazing. Amazing too, that "Pie 2" is better than the original "Pie". Director J.B. Rogers along with writer Adam Herz, generated an accomplishment in movies-- a crisp sequel. "Pie 2" delivers the goods: hot babes, phone sex, ridiculous sexual predicaments, and more hot babes like returning Czech student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). Rogers and Herz never disappoint, and they also surprise us. The dudes, Jim (Jason Briggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Smith), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Stifler (Seann William Scott), have returned from their freshman year at college. After losing their stated party address, Stifler's parent's house, the dudes decide to rent a beach house for the summer. Life is good. Beach. Beer. Babes. Though there is tension abound. Nadia informs Jim that she wants to hook up with him at summer's end after traveling abroad. Jim panics, because he sucks at sex... and he has proof. Oz's girlfriend, Heather (Mena Suvari) is spending the summer in Europe, and he promised fidelity.Seann William Scott as Stifler has the standout role. Stifler is horny, offensive, and completely funny. There is a show stopping scene when he believes that the two great looking women at the beach house are "really" lesbians. Chris Klein does well as the responsible, good-looking stud, who has a girl friend abroad, keeping in mind that his buds only want to get laid. Jason Biggs' Jim has got to be the most sympathetic guy on the planet. Biggs' charm actually keeps Jim from being the most pathetic guy on the planet. He has a scene that out does the "pie" from the first movie. Better than "Something About Mary..." Alyson Hannigan returns at "band camp" girl Michelle. Given Jim's sucking sexual prowess, he turns to Michelle as his sex mentor/ coach. Their relationship is ridiculous and graphic, though it never loses a sense of sweetness. Eugene Levy as Jim's understanding Dad is warm, humane, clueless, and funny. Forget Ward Cleaver. Much the same can be said about "American Pie 2". It is an over the top gross out raunchy R-rated comedy that delivers everything you want , and still cares about it's characters... like the audience does. "Pie 2" is a pleasant surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Summer Sequel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a summer plagued with sequels and remakes (every 100+ million dollar movie has been one), this is just a drop in the bucket. From the beginning to the end, it seems like the same characters are reading from the same script and performing the same actions. Even many of the sets are the same. At one point the characters were even commenting on being back at the same place as before, "just like the first movie". Maybe it was more like, "just like before" but I was kind of falling asleep at that point so they could have said either.Sure, there were some funny scenes. If you've seen a preview you've pretty much seen them all though. The rest of it was basically who's hooking up with who, and who's still with who, and who's with who again.The saving grace for this show was the fact that all of the original characters were in it, if even only for a few scenes. While it was neat to see the whole gang back to their goofy actions, it could have been a lot better if it didn't parallel the original so closely.This is a movie worth seeing only if you have seen and really liked the first. You'll laugh.</fullReview>

A sequel perhaps?Naturally, I had high expectations for the second one. I had no doubt in my mind that it was going to be a great movie. Then I went to go see it.Was it funny? Of course. Was it good? Definitely. Did it match up to the first? In my opinion, no. Now this was a very tough call. Being a huge fan of the first, I was willing to watch anything and call it good so long as it had Jim, Jim's Dad, Nadia, Finch, Vicky, Stifler, et al in it. I trusted the movie to deliver... and for the most part, it did... but something was missing.... Sort of like ordering Chinese food, and they forget the fortune cookies. The meal isn't ruined without the cookies, but when you're done, you expect that special dessert (no pun intended) only to be left with a little pang of 'something's missing.'Overall, I did enjoy it. *(Now for you loyal readers, this does contain a few MINOR SPOILS, so if you are all picky about this sort of thing, don't read on.)*First, I really loved having the whole cast back. The way everyone plays off of each other makes American Pie 1 &amp; 2. No one could play Jim's dad like Eugene Levy. His comic timing is impeccable No one can utter the words 'masturbation' and 'penis' like he can. He honestly makes being uncool cool. From the phone sex romp to the 'Let's give it up for Petey!', the comedy was original and humorous. (Even though nothing could compare to Finch and Stifler's Mom's first meeting) However, I felt that it was a bit forced. The fluidity of the first movie made it flow in such a way that the 'funny moments' seemed to blur together. In this one, you can clearly see where someone sat down with a marker and wrote "Serious, Serious, Funny, Heartwarming, Funny...etc." And even though the storyline is original, you can still tell the formula that was used. The opening begins with an embarrassing moment. Gross-out party scene. Cut to the middle which results in another very embarrassing scene that involves Jim's Dad. Conflict, Conflict. Realization, Promise to the Future, Kiss and Make up, Sleep with the Loser from the Pizza Hut commercial, Smile Smile, Moral Message, The End. Of course this formula works, don't get me wrong... but the simple fact that the first one had was fresh made me enjoy it more.That's all I can legitimately complain about, believe it or not. However, I did have a beef with a the ending. Jessica and Jim. Nadia and Sherminator. Kev and Vicky. The first one was funny because Jessica up and left with that whole surprise factor. Now they're together? I'll take the 'Flute' line and "Say my name bitch!" over that. What about Nadia?! You blew your load TWICE, and now you completely blow it with her so much that she must go through what a grapefruit experienced? I understand Nadia's lover was supposed to be comedy, but it just made me want to smack Jim. Finally, Vicky and Kev. Get together for crying out loud!!!!!!!!! I was hoping throughout the entire movie that they'd realize how perfect they are for each other. Nope. Sorry, buh-bye. I understand times change, and people do, and that friends are forever, but come on - movie's are NOT SUPPOSED to be real... just appease me! They were so perfect together.... oh well.... I guess times DO change....now who would think that a movie about sex would end up having a message? *tear*</fullReview>

All I have to say for those critics is "you need to get laid" and "your fired!"This movie is funny as anything out there, and I enjoy a lot of comedies. Much of its humor is sophmoric, but even sophmoric humor has it's place. One thing I did like very much is that I did not get the feeling that this movie was "corny" like the naked gun or airplane series.American Pie 2 makes it into my top 10 movies of all time, displacing Spaceballs out of the comedy slot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I was skeptical about this movie for two reasons. The first being that it is a sequel, and by that I thought the directors were going to make too many retarded references to the first American Pie. But James Rogers did a great job on staying focused on making us laugh a new better joke than AP 1. Second, I though the press was going to blow this movie. Too many punch lines being revealed in the commercials is my number one pet-peeve, but once again there were many more opportunities to laugh my ass off in AP 2. Plus Seann Scott is the shit once again. S***ing out the eight bucks just to stifler for an hour is worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie on the first day it was released. I really liked the first one, and so I decided to go ahead and give the dreaded sequel a chance. Boy am I glad I did! Great movie! It is so much better than the second. Anyway, if your debating on whether to go or not than don't. You don't want to miss this. Warning! if you have any health problems than you better skip this one, because you will be laughing so hard you won't be able to breathe!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a way to make these movies great and the people working on American Pie know how to make a crazy funny movie. If you thought the first movie was a riot you're not even prepared for the crazy twists and turns of the second one. SO many shocks, so many laughs. It was almost too much, but that's why I loved it.

		<fullReview>American Pie 2 is worth your while; it is the most entertaining two hours I've had at the movies for a while. However, there are so many problems with it that I consider it insulting to the first movie to compare this one to it. First of all: plot. Or, more accurately, lack of one. The beauty of the first movie was that everything in it realted to the overarching goal of the four guys to get laid by prom. Through this goal character development was achieved and jokes were made. The movie had a coherent feel and every character had a unique purpose to contribute to that coherence. However, the sequel had no such coherence. It had very little plot whatsoever. It was essentially just stuff happening at a beach house. This made for plenty of good jokes, but they were mostly completely random and in no way drove the story. The end of the movie did not have the monumental feel that prom night had in the first; indeed, instead of having a wonderful climax in which all of the characters get laid, find love, etc., this movie just sort of fizzles out, with no real climax and no real driving goal. The plot of the movie can be summarized as "stuff happens." This brings me to the second major problem: no character development to speak of. Most of the characters were only in the movie because they were in the first one; they contributed absolutely nothing to this one, and, indeed, in most cases detracted from the movie because they provided serious moments that took away time that could have been used for more of Stifler's one-liners. Jessica, Vicky, Kevin, Oz, Nadia, and that girl from American Beauty contributed nothing to the movie. The movie focused entirely on the antics of Jim, Stifler, band camp girl, and Finch (to a smaller extent). It's a shame that Stifler isn't listed higher in the credits; without him there wouldn't be much to laugh at. He makes the movie. The movie would've been better without all the random characters dragging it down and making it more serious than it should've been. Those are the big problems, but they create lots of littler problems. The movie just doesn't have the coherence, the all-consuming drive, of the first one; it's just there for the sake of being there. I'm glad it is there because it was a fun two hours, but it does not come close to achieving what the first one does. The first one was an anthem for the class of 99. This is just a run-of-the-mill summer movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie 2 is all about going home after the first year of school, and seeing friends again. It shows how friendships and relationships change after a year. Kevin notices things are not the same. He calls his brother up and he is informed to rent a beach house and have the party of the summer. so he gets his friends together and rent that house. The movie was really funny. It was set up a lot like the first one, but hey if it is funny who cares. i did not. I would tell all to go see it who liked the first one. but if you are under 17 be careful. i work at a movie theator and will be looking for you. enjoy the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Follow-Up But.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Expectations for this sequel were very high. American Pie 1 took me completely by surprise - not only was it a throwback to the old teen-sex comedies of the seventies/eighties but it had a certain charm about it, characters who were fun and who you wanted to see again. Well we have all the characters back and after viewing the sequel I am a fan again, this is a fun summer picture with all of the raunch and fun of the 1st edition back. Some great moments (not all appeared in the previews). My only problem with the movie is that besides Jim (Jason Biggs - this is your movie all the way), the core group of friends with maybe the exception of Stifler don't really do anything... For example... Oz's story was one of the best parts of AP1 but in this one he has nothing going for him except a girlfriend (Mena Suvari) who is in Europe for most of the summer. What could have been an opportunity to put Oz in a tight situation (being tempted by women) is lost, Oz does nothing except a few phone bits. What a waste of Chris Klein (you kinda have a feeling he was busy wrapping up Rollerball while making this movie - same thing with Mena). And Oz isn't the only wasted character. I guess what I'm saying is that while there are a ton of laughs (really Jim and Stiflers movie) the story didn't do the other likeable characters justice. Plus it would have been acceptable to add a couple of new characters (besides the "lesbians"). All in all though, a fun movie with a couple of scenes that top the first AP. After seeing AP2's high box office numbers perhaps AP 3 is on the horizon - an American Pie bachelor party before a big character wedding, would be a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw AP2 today (8-12-01) and you know what...I liked it. I kept reading that critics were saying it's predictable and doesn't stack up to the original. I think those people are fools, to quote Jason Lee, "critics schmitics". There's always going to be predictable parts to a teen sex comedy. I think American Pie 2 stands alone from American Pie and stands out against all the other teen genre movies. I'm in my mid 20's now and I relate to what the story was about. I knew guys like that, hell, I am a few of them. I spent 6 bucks today to see it and next weekend I'll spend another six with my girlfriend to see it.</fullReview>

I can't wait to see it again, and get the DVD. Soon I'm getting the Ultimate Edtion of the 1st movie. The funniest sex jokes and believe it or not some non-sex jokes, but American Pie is about sex. Of course they is nudity of 2 sexy ladies, breast only. This is the best damn sequal ever along with Jurassic Park, Leathal Weapon, Die Hard, Scream. I demand anyone 14 years and older, who want to laught their ass off should see this movie, but only if you have seen the first one, if you haven't go and see, then go see American Pie 2, or you will miss the best movie of summer 2001!</fullReview>

But out of no where, her parents walk in.Anyway, this movie was like all the situations from the first movie, just moved to a new location.

		<fullReview>When I first saw AMERICAN PIE, I was shocked. I completely thought it'd be another goofy teen flick with everything spoiled in the trailers. I was wrong. Just like with the first, I was wrong about AMERICAN PIE 2.Nowadays, trailers usually spoil everything funny about the movie, and most sequels are falling apart. This movie definately held strong. It didn't have quite the same feeling as the first, but the characters reminded you of everything Pie.The strongpoint of this movie is definately SEANN WILLIAM SCOTT. He pulled this movie with his halarious antics, and made me enjoy the movie ALOT more than I would before.Bottom Line: If you liked the first, you'll love this one. Memories will take over your mind. Halarious movie.4 of 5 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So funny and gross (a spoiler).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the first American Pie at a theatre with fellow workers Tommy and Ron. Tommy and Ron are big fans of the first, so much that Tommy and Ron have created a shrine to the first one in our walk-in cooler. They know all the lines and they like all the original girls, especially the naked Nadia. Ron even tried to see her where she lived. We made a vow that we would see the second one together at the same theatre when the sequel was released. Well, Aug.10 was that day and I can't remember when I laughed so hard in all my life. American Pie 2 is a champion among films, so much better than the previous because it's not afraid to be raunchy and it doesn't have a goofy sensitive ending like first one, although it tries. There's nudity but not the females you want (like Nadia). I didn't like the scene where the guy gets urinated on. Not funny. The naked lesbians were excellent and should've featured them more. Tommy liked the scene where the guys were kissing as to touch naked lesbians. This is funny. Go see American Pie 2 and laugh! I'm Todd M. and this gets 4 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid follow-up to the teen movie of the current generation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To myself and many other Americans, the original American Pie was the first movie about teenagers to hold nothing back. Being the same age as the characters in the first film, I really connected with them. I did not expect that much from the sequel because the first one seemed to wrap everything up, but surprisingly, it turned out to be very solid and true to the characters.Notorious of American Pie was the mixture of unrealistic bad luck and humor with real life teen relationship problems. This movie stays true to the original in this way. Jim is still his unlucky, nervous self while Finch becomes even more unique than in the first. Stifler is given a much more prominent role, and his humor never gets old. While he furthers the plot very little, he continuously provides the comedic relief to keep people watching this film.One huge strength in this film is the focus on Jim and Michelle. While Jim really only provided humor in the first, his character develops in the second one, and he becomes much more likable. Michelle, as well, is given a bigger role, and it ties in beautifully with the plot. Jim's dad also has a slightly larger role, and he successfully fills it. Definitely, however, the drawing point of this movie is crude humor. Stifler and his random girls help make this movie even more crude and funny than the first. While the plot is not as good, the humor definitely is as good as the original American Pie.I felt this film had a few glaring weaknesses as well. First, the beginning was scattered. It had no plot and was just quick, funny blurbs of various characters. It made the movie slow to start and difficult to follow. Luckily, it fleshed out later on. Another weakness was the build up to the beach party. In the first one, the four guys focused on prom because of what they were supposed to achieve on that night. The build up there was realistic. In this one, the beach party had no point. Every character had their own subplots, and none of them directly revolved around the beach party or one common goal. Lastly, more attention needed to be given to Kevin and Vicky. They represented the only senior year relationship, and then breakup before college. The awkwardness of seeing each other should have been focused on more.This movie exceeded my expectations. While I expected to laugh at the crude humor, the plot was surprisingly more detailed than I expected. Any fan of the first one should see this movie as well as anyone just finishing their first year in college.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie: 2 is a lot like the first film in that it is very juvenile humor (nudity, sex jokes, dildos)and yet not all of the film is one big joke. The movie has it's serious moments involving Jason Biggs, and his decision on what constitutes the girl he desires, and also Thomas Ian Nicholas'(kevin) trying to cope with letting go of his first love. The movie has some seriously funny moments as well, including a trombone playing simpleton named petey, and others that were spoiled by the previews, but hey, it's always that way. Overall, this is a movie to be taken lightly, and laughed at heartily, so go see it and try to enjoy it without disecting everything because, afterall, it IS only a summer comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sequel definitely doesn't have the pacing and the zany hilarity of the first film, but it does have its moments.Stifler really steals the movie this time. He was a funny character in the first movie, but his scenes are really the best ones this time. The pattern of the first film is followed again, with some scenes being intentional mimics of scenes in the original. However, there is a labored feeling to the plot.The things that are supposed to make this film work are also what make it sluggish -- first, invoking the close bonds of friendship between the guys and, second, depicting the sweet relationship between Jim and his father. While these moments may give some depth to the movie, they seem thrown in as something to hold the set pieces of adolescent humor together.I wasn't disappointed, but I can't say that it has the pizzazz of the original. If a third film is made, I'd recommend picking up the pace and remembering the silly, raunchy spirit that, oddly enough, made the original so appealing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My piece on this 'Pie'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A week after seeing Rush Hour 2, I embarked on a journey to the multiplex to see yet another sequel, to yet another comedy. This one was American Pie 2, the sequel to the 1999 teen-sex-comedy. And like Rush Hour 2, it is one of the better sequels out there. Personally I did not feel that it was as good as the original, of course one reason for that is because American Pie is a neo-classic. AP is one of the movies that is used when comparing other movies. American Pie is to today's teens and twenty-somethings, what Porky's was to our predecessors. I will say that American Pie 2, is no Porky's 2: the Next Day. American Pie 2 is as funny as the original, and is true to the characters. No one has "turned over a new leaf" at college, and yet they do show some growth since the original. I will also note that despite the return of all the original main characters, American Pie 2 seems to focus more on Jason Bigg's Jim. Though he was also the main character in the first movie, it is often viewed more as an ensemble comedy. In American Pie 2, everyone else's storylines seem to be reduced to B-plots. The movie really focuses on Jim's lack of confidence in his sexual performance more than anything else, as he awaits the end of the summer, when he will be reuinited with Nadia, "the one that got away."Screenwriter Adam Herz really had a task ahead of him in attempting to outdo his own outrageous scenes from the original movie. From the infamous pie scene, to the tainted beer, the original really made audiences stomachs turn and their mouths erupt with laughter. Herz came through quite well with the sequel, with some champagne that may have gone bad, and Jim's encounter with super-glue. I have to add that this is a sequel that really needs the original to florish, unless you've already become familiar with the characters from the first American Pie, you won't really know them in this one. The American Pie movies seem to hit the chord missed by so many other Gross-Out movies, as while yes, many of the jokes are crude and without taste, they are jokes first, and not just an attempt to make you wretch. The trend has been, with movies like Scary Movie... to just stick something gross on frame and shock the audience. "look! a penis." The American Pie movies seem to be better at just infering something has happened, but not sticking the entire thing (so to speak) in your face. My comment is, if you liked the original American Pie, you'll like this one. If you didn't like it, or haven't seen it, go see something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the fourth sequel i have seen in four weeks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSIN four consecutive weeks this summer, I have seen four consecutive sequels (if "planet of the apes" can count as a sequel, it's more of a remake). "American Pie 2" is definately the worst one, but it was still really great.The film is certainly bent on gruesome sight gags for humor, but let's not forget that what makes them far more enjoyable is that we know the characters, and we sympathize with them. For instance, the now famous "crazy glue" sequence (made famous through some inventive advertising) would not have been half as funny if we had not already seen Jim making sweet love to his mother's apple pie two years ago.This film falls just 10 percent short of the first one, and for one blatant reason: the first one was much subtler, as the gang had tons to learn about sex, and how to keep a girl. In this one, there is just the typical male curiosity with sexuality. Nevertheless, the film's message is not lost. Okay, it may be a little melodramatic toward the end, but that is all fortuanately broken up when Simon and Garfunkle's classic tune carries over the background and lets us remember the whole groove of the film. J.B. Rodgers is definately progressing as a director. Just think, earlier this year he gave us the absoloutely DREADFUL "Say it isn't So", and now he gives us this film that is almost impossible to not enjoy. I think that he's a director who is getting better at finding the theme of the story.Anyway, go see this one, even if you are tired of sequels.</fullReview>

This doesn't seem to be a new movie at all, but simply a run-on extension of the first movie. The potential of the new setting is overcome by too many inside references that are hit again and again. It seems as if the writers (who looked so promising before) just played off of the popularity hot spots in the first film, as previously minor characters such as Stifler's brother and Michelle from band camp return to beat their roles to death. This movie had its moments, but for the most part it was predictable and a little too sentimental for a raunchy teen flick. I guess sequels are never really as good.</fullReview>

The only people in the theater that were laughing at the recycled humor were the under 17 year olds who managed to get by the theater staff and into the "R" movie. There were a few new and funny relationships that develop among the characters but besides that, nothing special. It's too bad they couldn't replace the Jason Biggs character with another actor because he just isn't funny. Wait for the DVD!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"American Pie 2" proves that the brain trust behind this minifranchise ? the Weitz Brothers and Adam Herz ? should be put in charge of every teen sex comedy for the next five years, for they have found the mysterious elixir necessary to make these films not only raunchy and funny, but also sweet. Like the original, it's the heart within that pushes this film above the same old stuff. That's not to say that this is a perfect movie: It does run a little long, and a pivotal part of the original "Pie," the notion that the sexuality of teen girls was as important as that of the boys, is mostly missing here. (Indeed, with the notable exception of Alyson "Band Camp" Hannigan, most of the actresses from the first "Pie" are reduced to glorified cameos.) But the set pieces work for the most possible, notably scenes involving (but not at the same time) champagne, crazy glue and lesbians. And prepare to be moved to near-tears by a wonderful sequence between Jason Biggs as the always-awkward Jim and Eugene Levy as his understanding dad. Ever remember "Porky's 2" making you cry?P.S. "AP2" also contains the best cover of a Michael Jackson on ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heck of a lot better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a rule, and with few exceptions, sequels generally suck (i.e. most except for Toy Story 2, Godfather 2, Superman 2, etc.). It's something that most of us have naturally come to expect- live in the pre-release ideal rather then the reality of a flick's worth. Well, after getting out of a theater screening a half-hour ago, I'm glad to report that AP2 puts itself in the higher reaches of the sequel pit (in other words, it kicks a**).It's everything that a comedy sequel should be- bigger, funnier, riskier (Most people will be surprised at who some of the original cast end up with by the end), and more importantly, it ties up nearly every loose end of the first movie while leaving just one or two doors open for another flick. From lesbians to crazy glue to a hilarious bit on people who pop in at the wrong times in conversations, this will doubtlessly leave those of us who are able to relate even slightly laughing constantly.Downpoints? A few- for one, the flick references the first quite constantly, so those who haven't seen it will have a lot of jokes fly over their head. Secondly, it loses the first movie's sense of "you know, all of this could really happen" with some stuff that could only happen, well, in the movies, so it loses quite a bit of the realism.Other then that, though, this is the only movie sans Shrek that has met or exceeded my expectations this summer. A definite recommendation to anyone that likes to laugh. MY GRADE: A-</fullReview>

This time though the situations were more cohesive and the story seemed a lot smoother. American Pie 2 was much more a movie than a series of vignettes like the first movie.

		<shortDescription>The original American Pie was much better...but there were a few great laughs here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I waited until until just this past weekend to see the first American Pie. Yes, call me crazy, I was one of those who thought it was going to be a rehash of Porky's, a great coming of age movie from years ago. I was pleasantly surprised by the first one and found myself trying hard NOT to laugh.Just tonight, I caught a sneak preview screening of American Pie 2 in Washington, DC. As a critic in the Washingtonpost once said "It's a summer sequel ok!" Truly this one had some laughs and once again I found myself in certain parts laughing hysterically. BUT, there were an equal number of parts that I found myself trying TO laugh but instead feeling myself wishing the movie were over.So as not to spoil anyone elses fun about this plot, let me just say that I felt there was nothing new and refreshing about the sequel except for a few jokes. The story takes place in the first summer after college and the characters learn to deal with life as they grow older. While I enjoyed the movie nonetheless, this movie was really a continuation of the laughs we all enjoyed in the first American Pie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same as the first one, but more daring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to understand American Pie 2, you will need to see the first movie. There are many references to the first one, and all the characters are consistent. Each character brings its own saying from the first one (ie: The Sherminator, and Stifler's nick name for Finch), yet they don't seem to fit as well as their more innocent days of the first. AP2 has most of the same scenes as the first movie: some masturbation gone wrong, drinks "prepared" for Stifler, topless women, a sexual scene overheard by patrons of a nearby restaurant, a party, and another party. Except this time, the scenes push the limits just that much further. Still, AP2 has tons of new laughs, and it was enjoyed immensely by the moviegoers at our screening.The scenes involving Eugene Levy are genuinely funny, and welcome comic relief from the toilet/sick humour we have seen so much of in recent years. But, without this AP style humour, there would be no movie.Unfortunately, this is Jim's movie only, with virtually everyone else being filler characters: Stifler for the one liners, Oz for..well, not much, Kevin still as lost as the first movie, and "cameos" by Vicky, Jessica, Nadia and Heather. I also found the movie losing its sense of direction at times, and wondering if the writers were simply going for the "gross-out" comedy only.All in all, the movie is true to the original, and you know what to expect after you've seen the first one. Therefore, if you liked American Pie, you will indeed thoroughly enjoy AP2. I see a sequel coming, but I doubt you will see all the same characters in AP3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie 2 is a very funny movie. They clearly pushed the envelope further with some of the lines they threw out there, especially with the increased presence of Stifler's character, who is absolutely hilarious. If you loved the first one, this will by no means disappoint you. However, there are several cheesy parts, mainly involving former Rookie of the Year Kevin, and Chris Klein's character. As far as sequels go, this was very good, but not fresh and not markedly different from the first. Definitely worth seeing in the theater regardless.</fullReview>

There so many funny scenes in the movie it's not funny but the best is between the two lesbian chicks and Jim,Stifler,and Finch totally original. Of course Sean William Scott(Stifler) Takes most of the laughs and Jason Biggs(Jim)get's the punishments of using super glue instead of lubrication to well you know what. I will leave the rest to you to laugh as hard as you ever have laughed before. Beware this movie is not for the weak hearted so be cautioned ,but other wise enjoy the film it's better than the original.9/10 GRADE P.S. The whole cast is back including Stiflers mom +</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie showed lots of promise, but sadly the end made the rest of the film terrible. If you plan on watching a movie similar to the first one, you're out of luck. THe theater that I saw it in was full of rowdy teenagers fresh out of high school who wouldn't stop laughing at the stupidiest parts of the film. Most of the characters in the first film show their faces in this one. The same old group of friends come back home from their first year of collage and decide to spend their summer vacation in a beach house. Stifler's dad shows up through somewhere in the middle of the movie and from there, this movie turns into one of those old cheesy eighties loving romance movies about proving your manhood by getting laid, but falling in/out of love doing so. It also shows the affects of a long distance relationship between two people in two countries and the trust factor involved.It seems as though the script writer ran out of ideas a little more than halfway through and let a feminist finish it off; it seemed this like the ideas were running out once a trumpet was shoved in an anus. The high school is what ruined the movie. I walked out of the theater at the point when that issue gets resolved.The acters look older and more uglier and the actresses look hotter and tastier. I do have to say though that stiffler really buffed up for this role though (his arms are so huge now) and looks good. I don't want to spoil this movie, so I'll leave the comments to just what I've written.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Appealing...in a matinee sort of way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie 2 has no shortage of gross-out jokes. Golden showers, musical instruments in orifices, and the horrors of super glue provide plenty of squeamish laughter. The true comedic centerpiece, however, is a game of tit-for-tat that Stiffler (Seann William Scott), Jim (Jason Biggs) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) play with two `lesbians'. I found myself covering my face while peeking at the screen between my nearly closed fingers and laughing hysterically. It is an inspired scene, which the rest of AP2, unfortunately, does not live up to. In the glut of sexed-up teen comedies that followed the brilliant original, AP2 is sort of a dinosaur. Inane copycats like Road Trip, Dude, Where's My Car? and Say it Isn't So have managed to dilute the water. Thematically, writers Herz and Steinberg have nothing new to offer except for some snappy one-liners. Just like the first, the randy teens find out what they want isn't always what they need. Some characters seem lost in the shuffle. For example, Oz (in yet another `aw, shucks' performance by Chris Klein) is almost totally forgotten. A potential subplot concerning issues of separation and jealously over his traveling abroad girlfriend (Mena Suvari) is hinted at but not explored. Both characters could have been left out and AP2 would not have suffered. Perhaps they were brought back merely because they were in the first. (On a tangent, I would like to see Klein play a vicious, calculating killer in his next role. He desperately needs to stretch and lose his boy-next-door persona.) James B. Rogers' direction and editing is nothing short of sloppy. He has characters zipping around like Captain Kirk using the Transporter. One minute Biggs is at the beach house and in the blink of an eye he is visiting Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) at Band Camp. This happens with distracting frequency. Despite its problems and shortcoming, AP2, like the original, has an endearing way of mixing John Hughes sentimentality and Animal House antics that can make for good matinee movie going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good as the First One, If Not Better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught an advance screening Wednesday night in Washington D.C. and the question that will be on everyone's mind is, can this live up to the first one. The audience at the beginning started the clap when the lights went off, so needless to say, this audience was hyped up for this one as I was. The odd part was it was an 8:30 P.M. (EST) screening, usually they are at 7:30.Nonetheless, on to the movie. It starts out with a scene from the preview in which Jim and a blonde in bed when the scene shifts to Jim's dad and his wife coming to the college to pick Jim up. It is the last day of the spring semester of Jim's freshman year at college. Jim's dad goes as far as bringing beer, and after getting past the R.A., he walks into the room. Then Jim's mom walks in, then the girls parents walk in.Once Jim is picked up and goes back home, he sees a picture of Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). Jim is still a bit interested in her. All of a sudden, Nadia calls from NY, and Jim's dad gives her advice, don't ride the subway after midnight for example. Nadia states she will be home at the end of the summer. Jim has no idea how to handle this. None of the gang wants to stay home, so the guys pack their things and get a beach house. Oz (Chris Klein) has to say goodbye to Heather (Mena Suvari) because she goes overseas for a summer program. Jim catches up with Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) at a band camp, go figure, and then gets embarrassed in front of a lot of people because he gets suckered into getting involved in a concert. Finch is still obsessed with Sifler's mom, and Vicky (Tara Reid) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) agree to remain friends after seeing each other for the first time since high school prom.The guys get a painting job at a house in which two women live in. They are determined to find out if they are involved romantically or not. They go as far as using CB radios and eventually that goes to the entire town, even the police get to hear it. All of this leads to some embarrassing moments with the guys.There weren't too many surprises, most of it I could see coming, but the laughs kept coming and coming. The superglue scene that was in the preview ends up being funnier than I thought it would be. Universal did not put all the funny parts in the preview, and that was a good thing, because this movie is loaded with laughs. It is very close if not better than the 1st one, and that is hard to do in a sequel. A lot of loose ends gets tied up, and you would have to remember the 1st movie for some of it to make sense. It is 100 minutes, and the print I saw had no ending credits, so I don't know if this was a final print or not. There were not many credits in the beginning either. I give this movie 9 out of 10, for the laughs alone, it is worth full price.</fullReview>

The storyline can't be repeated so there's no dramatic armature for new gags to grow on. Consequently what new ones there are are either borrowed from Jackass or amount to shameless softcore pornography.The exuberance of the players and ability to riff on the head-shakingly perverse situations they find themselves in are admirable at least. But it's all over when Stiffler's underage younger brother turns up touting the same potty-mouth as the others. An empty film. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The American pie gang treats us to a sequel having more of a heads up this time around, I was able to see this one in the theater, followed by many DVD views. Again as the first American pie, we are treated to an all star cast, and a fun movie, full of laughs. This is exactly what you would expect from writer Adam Herz, as a follow up to the original American pie. If you saw the first movie than of course you must see this one, move along to "the next step" and get caught up. And if you haven't seen the first movie, definitely go ses it before this one..... rent them both and watch them back to back another classic addition to the first10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really think this movie sucks! I watched it at home with 6 friends. One of them worked in a movie store and had borrowed it along with some other films. By the end of the movie our living room was empty, every single one of us had left, since we all found it so bad that I do not have words for it.It is really predictable (not surprised but still) The story in the movie isn't there and I honestly don't think this 2nd American Pie was made for any other reason than to make money of Amercian Pie's good reputation.A free tip!: Do the dishes, take a walk, wash the car - all things which are more fun to than watching this upsetting poor movie! Sorry but it can only be a few teenagers in the US of A who finds this movie interesting...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was pretty good. Its a lot of the jokes from the first one used over. I agree with the others in saying, WATHC THE FIRST ONE FIRST! Otherwise you'll be asking questions the entire movie. Plus, so many things are ruined if you haven't seen the first one.This movie is about the Four dudes, (Jims, Oz, Kevin, and Finch)...(and Stifler) and they have all changed since going to college, but re-unite to party in Michigan for the summer. Basically, even though it says they have changed, they really haven't. Jims is still the geeky dude who tried desperately to get laid, but has all sorts of mis-adventures. Oz is still the sensitive jock, who talks all softly to his girlfriend. Kevin is still the "not-so-heterosexual" friend who wants to do everything together. Finch is still weird and obsessed with Stiflers mom. Stifler is still very annoying, says the "F" word every other word, and gets lots of chicks.We also see some, and meet new, minor characters. Such as Jims Dad, who is there for all his misadventures, Stiflers brother, who like this little 8 year old and extremely annoying, and Oz's girlfriend, who has become a little more kinky since the first Pie.Well, this movie has its funny parts, its corny parts, and its clich parts, but overall, its pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much worse than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a dumbed-down sequel that is definitely worse than the original. The first American Pie was very funny, introducing new characters in humorous situations. The second was a feeble attempt to recreate the fun from the first. It fails miserably! The social situations seemed very awkward, like the actors were struggling with dialog. It's almost like they were handed a blank script. The lowlight was Jim's talk with Nadia as they "struggled" for something to say in the lighthouse. The writing was terrible! Another bad scene was Jim trying to play in Michelle's band. The video tape getting stuck on Jim's hand was funny, but the rest of the movie reeks of bad conversation from the actors. There was too much of attempts to tie things up from the original. No, we didn't need Jim to ask Michelle why she was suddenly gone in the morning. It's funnier unexplained and they ruined it by having him question her on it. Jim's dad even looked lost, like he was trying to overdo his own character. Even American Wedding was funnier than this. Now there are horrible sequels like Band Camp and others as the producers try to whore out the American Pie name, desperately hoping they can attract viewers to bad films. Stick with the original and skip the lame sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American pie 2 succeeds because all the soppy, sentimental slop from the first is absent. But one of the main problems with this film is that all the ridiculous, poorly developed character who serve as nothing but filler are still very much in place,. I mean, what on earth is Nadia doing in this film? She was a one dimensional character to begin with, and the ringed every possible gag from her already, so why bother to include her in the movie? A lot of the film is filled with problems like that, but at the end of the day it has enough funny bits still included to actually be very funny! The scene where the two girls make the guys kiss is the best in this average film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie 2 reunites the main characters from the first film into another funny go at the "pie". While the first film was plain original, this one is a bit of a rehash, which is to be expected considering the main characters are doing almost exactly what they did in the first film. The only difference is that they are returning from their first year at college instead of graduating high school. Regardless, it's nice to see Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Chris Klein, and especially Seann William Scott as Stifler and of course Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad! If are going to watch this film, watch the original first and then American Wedding immediately after this one. A funny 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American Pie can't shake a stick at at the original, the original was one of my favorite films of all time, and this one is just funny, and kinda sweet. The story is very good, but also very similar to the original. The screenplay is good, the dialogue is great, as are the jokes, but the story is still very similar to the original and that could have been changed. The acting is great, just as good as the original. This is one of the best acted stupid comedies ever. The direction is good, but I really wish the directors from the original had come back. This director is still pretty good. The visual effects are good, some of the effects look very good, some very fake, but that could be on a way to get more jokes, I laughed at them. Not as good as the first, but still worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I couldn't stop laughing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have to say that "American Pie 2" was one of the funniest movies of 2001.When this movie came out I was between finishing high school and starting college. In that respect, it relates to me. I just could not stop laughing through the movie. There were so many funny scenes. Of course the opening was funny when dim's dad caught dim in bed with another girl but now that's funny enough and it is so surprisingly funny when the parents of the other young lady walk in. Other scenes I found hilarious were when the two girls tried to get the guys to make sexual advances towards each other and when dim glued himself to himself and I also liked the hospital scene that resulted from dim's little glue problem. I was also impressed to see Eugene Levy in this movie because he is from Hamilton Ontario Canada as so am I. It is rare that I see famous people from my home town.I conclusion, I would recommend this movie to anyone who wanted to have a good laugh.</fullReview>

It's hilarious in places. I haven't watched the first film or the third, so I didn't no any history or story from the first film, but it didn't matter it was pretty easy to pick up what had gone on.The acting isn't great and neither was the story, it's predictable, but that doesn't matter. This is one of those films you can just watch, for the jokes. It's aimed at teenagers and if you like the humor in the scary movie series I would defiantly recommend this. I don't know if I'll be rushing out to rent the other films, but it was worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid sequel that surprisingly develops the characters further.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the amazing success of the (basically) low-budget original it was obvious another slice of the pie would be on the way. With gross-out comedies dying out quicker than Afghans civilians (the first Pie started the trend again) this film was under pressure. However it's safe to say, while nothing new, AP2 is absolutely hilarious.The gang of four are re-united after their first year at college. To add sparkle to their summer, the boys become five with the addition of Stifler (Seann W. Scott) and rent a beach house for the summer. Ensuing gross-out set pieces occur climaxing in an end-of-summer party. AP2 raises the sick bar set by the original, involving scenes with urine, glue, lesbians, and a trumpet!After the introduction of a massive cast in the original it was obvious some characters would be shoved to the background. Vicky, Nadia, and most notably Oz and Heather have extended cameos, and rightly so as these are the weaker characters. Band camp geek Michelle's role is much more involved, and grateful too as Alyson Hannigan who plays her is one of the top rising stars of today. Also Jason Biggs' Jim is brought forward and is in almost every scene, and when he and Hannigan are together it's wonderful to watch.AP2 would probably have been average hokum without the amazing Seann W Scott, as Stifler he steals every scene he's in (he has a helluva lot more than the first) and his frank language will have you in stitches. It's just a shame he is so annoying in the third film.The jewel in the AP films crown however is screenwriter Adam Herz. He has created some excellent characters that we actually care for, and unlike most cash-in sequels he develops the lead characters even further.4 Beers out of 5 (shame about AP3, a terrible film).</fullReview>

The sequel which followed this, 'American Wedding' was the perfect icing on the cake of this great trilogy but this and the first set the standard for raunchy comedies for many years to come. I also look forward to seeing more of the likes of Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott in the future, they really proved their worth in these films. This trilogy is a classic.

HAHAHA, i would set some quotes straight from the stifmiester on you but this review wouldn't be put up =( This is a comedy movie through and through, forget about stereotypes exploiting young teenage minds giving wrong ideas blahblah, go watch a drama or something because this movie isn't for everybody, but if it is you'll be in for a treat :PSo anyway, this movie ruled. Its my favorite from the american pie series by far, its just endless fun from start to finish, if you dig highschool flicks this is the movie for you. i recommend watching the first AP before this one though as you'll enjoy it a lot more since loads of the jokes refer to the stuff from the first. no oscar winning performances, mouth watering cgi or heart breaking scripts, AP2 is a great movie with a good cast, an ok storyline and some of the funniest stuff you'll ever see, have fun. 9/10PS.

		<fullReview>For me American Pie was one of the best teenage comedies I had seen since 'Porkys' so I when I heard that a sequel was being made I was quite pleased. I did not see it in the cinema but saw it at a mates house when we rented it out from the local video store, in all honesty we were not expecting a lot, there are only so many times you can use the same ideas, jokes and cliches however we were all very pleased with what we saw.The jokes could have been better and the idea of the film was unbelievable - how could you earn enough for that house on painting jobs alone? But for us that didn't matter to a great extent, we still laughed at what we saw on screen and how the charecters had developed, but especially Finch, he is now a confident man who is not afraid to go out and do something if he wants it enough.I think the other thing that struck us was something that Jim spoke of in the film but did not strike us until a good 2 months later. It was the scene where Jim, Finch, Kev and Oz were sitting around at the table of Stifflers party, they discuss, 'so are we the cool guys who come from uni and come to parties? or are we the sad uni guys who have come to crash a party because there is nothing else to do' - I don't know if these are the exact words but if you have seen it you know what I mean. When me and my mate were out in a pub a few months later that is how we felt, that somehow we had been replaced by underage drinkers in less than a year.I think that despite its outside impressions the film does say a lot, I think that to a certain extent most teenagers of the age of the charecters can relate to this and recognise parts of it in there own lives.8/10 - but only cos the jokes were tired and it was somewhat unbeliveable - it was well scripted and well directed.</fullReview>

From the 1st scene where Jims dad walks in on him having sex I was laughing. 3 reasons why this movie works so much better that the 1st one is that Jason Biggs (Jim) is allowed to do more physical slapstick humour which he pulls off perfectly in the glue scene which was almost completely improvised. The other 2 major reasons for this film appealing to me are 1) more stiffler.......ahhhhhh stiffler the funniest character ever is giving a leading role and has some of the best lines those of u who have seen it will know "yes the force is strong in that one" had me almost crying with laughter. The second reason is Michelle (the absolutely stunning Alyson Hannigan) is also given a much more substantial roll in this flick than in the 1st pie.All in all there is no finer film of its type that I know about.There is not a moment that I failed to like in this move....9.5 out of 10....Brilliant</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a fan of American Pie. I believe that it abused the Farelli humor just for the sake of going to extremes. This time around I expected even less, taken that this is a sequel.Fortunately for the movie, there was (and still is) room for improvement as far as the actors' performances are concerned due to young of their age. So, everyone is now more experienced and even funnier, especially Seann William Scott who is the new Jim Carrey.The movie starts slow and without rhythm, like a soap opera episode. Events of the past are told for about 20 minutes and everything looks like that the sequel tries to explain its existence by using the first movie. But when the guys move to the beach house, it's all crazy from there!American Pie 2 is a lot more confident in every way, compared to first movie. Everyone in front and behind of the camera seem to know what they're doing. No more Farreli influences, just laid back, yet strong humor.Anyway, a much better movie than I expected, American Pie 2 is a great way to spend a couple of hours.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't buy this American pie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked at the figures for "American Pie 2" because I knew they would appall me. To save you the trouble, the box office gross was $145 million in the United States alone (the rule of thumb is, assuming this isn't one of those films that does disproportionately well in North America, as I suspect it is, that you double this figure to get the worldwide grosses; then you double it AGAIN if you're an Australian and want to convert the figure into local dollars), and it cost $US 30 million to make. Although the latter figure is unusually LOW as Hollywood budgets go, you have to wonder where the money went. (Well, we know that most of the budget always finds its way into the pockets of disgustingly overpaid actors - but even so.) Neither of these figures makes any sense. This is THE most perfunctorily made sequel I have ever seen.Made solely for people who know and love the original (which had some spirit, even if it too was mediocre) - we're expected to titter at the very sight of a flute - it wastes more time than it can afford telling us what has already happened. Since there's no story and the characters have been boiled down to their skeletons, the "zany antics" this time around have no point other than as ballast. Ninety per cent of the proceedings are flat and joyless and lifeless. None of those involved, not even the actors, who wouldn't be here if they didn't have at least this much skill, can bring themselves pretend that they care. (A possible exception is Eugene Levy, but he's cast adrift. I love his schtick - at once cool and dorky and matter-of-fact - but he needs energy around him to make it work, and there's none to be found.)Are these guys attractive? For the sake of the female half of the audience I hope so. But we males have been given a raw deal. Those of us who hoped to ogle gorgeous, daringly dressed babes (a sequel this poor should have the grace to offer us at least this much) came to the wrong movie. The wrong century, in fact.</fullReview>

The scenes that stick out are just like the first movie in terms of structure and characters but I wont spoil it for you. Just watch it. Of course, you can't really watch this if you haven't seen the first. Best performance by far - Seann W. Scott. He steals the show just like the original but this time the writers give him a much bigger role on the strength of the first film. Great fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the first American Pie, laughed at all the right places and enjoyed myself. From my history of disappointing sequels I never expected American Pie 2 to be so delightful.We find Jim, still horny, still desperate to shag his darling Nadia. We find Oz, still with Heather, though under0going lots of phone sex due to their distance apart. We find Kevin, the same loveable boy he was in the first American Pie. We find Stifler who, thank God, hasn't changed a bit. I love Seann William Scott. He cracks me up. Jessica, Finch and (YAY!) Stifler's mum returned to us.My favourite part of American Pie 2, apart from the very funny scenes, the loveable characters and the great improvement from the first one, was the fact that Alyson Hannigan (Michelle) had a much larger part in it. I adore Alyson, I've watched her mature and evolve in 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' and think she is incredible. As Michelle she was funny and sweet and I can't think of anyone better suited for Jim.A wonderfully funny, cute film for all to enjoy!</fullReview>

Determined to build on their experiences from the first time around, the guys rent a beach house and try to use their 'expertise' to have the most memorable summer of their lives. More importantly Jim, struggling to find himself and gain confidence in his love life, goes to band camp to seek help from Michelle and prepare for a visit from the one that got away in Nadia. Not as fresh or original as its predecessor, but the returning cast is so infectiously likable and some of their antics so downright funny that it's hard not to enjoy this laid-back sequel.

		<shortDescription>A true letdown; same jokes only this time: not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe this sequel is rated nearly as high as the original by imdb.com users (and well respected critics). Where the original was fresh and often hilarious, this unfunny movie breaks no new ground and beats the "been done" jokes from the first into the ground. Sure, you may THINK it's a funny movie because you'll be remembering the funny scenes from the first one, but in reality this movie just retreads the EXACT SAME JOKES in a stale and much less funny way (Finch and Stifler's mom; Jim's dad and dealing with Jim's embarrassing masturbatory fiasco; Stifler's obnoxiousness; the band camp geek). All very funny characters and situations from the first movie but not funny this time around -- just stupid. And, when the first one had an interesting point to it: the boys' pact to lose their virginity; this has no point other than to come up with a forced situation where the hijinx can continue. Please see the first one again rather than waste your time with this pointless garbage. I gave the first one 7 out of 10; this gets 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>C'mon folks this is just a huge cover-up for four guys attempting to deal with their homosexuality, or bi-sexuality. One of the most impressionable scenes in the film has two of the college boys french kissing and then very willing to fondle each other supposedly because two girls demand such in exchange for normal sex. Pleeeassseeee!!!! All of the main characters are baby-faced, bright-eyed studs. They are sure to bring in the teeny-bopers who croon to such boyish, photogenic charm. I managed to catch the first American Pie and found it mildly amusing - enough to rent part two. And, part two is very interesting, but it is a plain old screenwriters cover-up for his homosexual instincts and so be it. The producers should have been bold enough to explore the very real drama that lies underneath American Pie II and then we would have had a truly interesting experience. Allison Hannigan as Michelle the "sex-master" hands in about the only interesting and thought provoking performance as the girl who teaches the star (Jason Biggs) Jim Levinson about sex and then, of course, falls in love with him. Moments of real comedy do exist in the film and yes, I know it is a farce. But, farce or not it remains a curious exploration of human need repressed. Some may think that I'm making a mountain out of an ant farm or that this is how college guys deal with their summer. Or, perhaps my college summers - working the night shift prohibited me from experiencing what these fellows - who have a magnificent house on the lake - did with their time away from the ivy. I can not believe they were in constant need of sexual pleasure and NEVER getting it. All they can do is talk about it and fantasize about the babes on the beach. One of the dudes wants his friend's mother and spends the entire summer waiting for her - sorry, another dead giveaway of the screenwriter's actual intent. Jason Biggs manages to smile through every scene and his character pretty much carries the entire film. He is a reasonable actor and I look forward to his future work. The other fellows are good given the material, which they never rise above. If American Pie III is in the works maybe the screenwriter can push the envelope and have these guys pursue what they really want, which is each other, now that would be interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seen the trailer? Funny, huh? Enjoy it, because the actual scene in the movie is edited so as to drain ninety percent of the humor out of it. The jokes in this scene, and pretty much the rest of the movie, are telegraphed so excruciatingly that the anticipation of the joke becomes the joke. And anticipation isn't funny enough to sustain an entire movie. American Pie 2 certainly could have been stupider and more offensive than it actually was, and I appreciate the fact that it wasn't, but it still doesn't make it worth the experience. Once in a while, there is a truly surprising, actually laughable moment, but not nearly enough to fill a movie. And most of the funny moments are killed by dragging them on endlessly, long after everyone's got the gag. I could go on with the problematic aspects of this movie, from the grossly uneven character use to the red light that a number of cars roll blithely through, but the bottom line is that this movie failed to hold itself together, which is really quite sad, considering how little it would have had to do to fulfill its somewhat limited promise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I noted in my review of the first movie, this movie is hilarious by itself but better in the movie series.The first movie helps to set up the characters, brings us a lot of humor, and can truly be watched by itself without seeing any of the sequels.But, to truly get the most out of the three movies (I don't count the direct to DVD movies that came out later), it's best to see each of them in order.The first movie has our characters as young and still fairly stupid as far as life is concerned. They learn a bit at the end, grow a bit, and we all get to go along for the funny ride.This movie has at least one of the group (no spoilers, just see it) already maturing from his role in the first movie and the rest of the characters either resisting the call to adulthood or working their way through their own twisty hilarious paths to maturity.Again, if you are going to see them, I strongly recommend watching them in the order that they came out in so that you can not only enjoy the humor in each, but so that you can notice that the characters are growing into adults throughout the series, ending in the American Wedding movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"American Pie" was a dopey movie but did surprisingly well at the box office as it had a few good laughs milked from the antics of hormonally beset teens. The success of the original prompted what appears to have been a twenty minute writing of a sequel script, and the rapid reassembling of the cast to crank out another version while the memory of the first was still reasonably fresh.AP1 dealt with a group of (male) high school seniors in an affluent community in Michigan who have made a pact to address their as yet untried sexual yearnings. AP2 now finds these young men at the end of their freshman year at college, and seeking to expand on this body of knowledge. Off to a summer house rental on Lake Michigan to spend the summer earning money by painting houses and pursuing sexual conquests away from the confines of their hometown and possible identification as college losers hanging out at high school parties (a true enough concern). With some thought and wit the movie would have had some promise (or what passes for such in this genre anyway), but the film was just carelessly thrown together, apparently based primarily on which of the original cast members had the two days to spare for filming; (Mena Suvari, who went on to stardom through "American Beauty" seems to have had only an hour or so to read some lines and might as well not have been there at all- the same goes for her "boyfriend who served essentially as a prop in this movie).What the "pie scene" was to AP1, the "super glue" scene is for AP2. As slapstick it is quite funny, but after seeing the trailers and commercials on television, everyone knows what is going to happen anyway. The obnoxious character, Stifler, is still obnoxious, the fellow with the steady girlfriend (Tara Reid) must accept the fact that she has a new college boyfriend, and the erudite fellow who had experienced the assignation with "Stifler's Mom" in AP1 seeks to prepare himself through Eastern philosophy for another meeting (it's even less funny than it sounds).The main plot deals with the geeky Jason Biggs character (the only type he seems to play) trying to ready himself for the pretty exchange student with whom his first unsuccessful experiences were disastrously broadcast over the internet to the delight of his schoolmates. She is conveniently back in the USA and will come to visit at the end of the summer. For advice on technique he reaches out to his old prom date (she of the "Band Camp") who is conveniently band camping nearby. The resolution of this plot is surprisingly sentimental, though not wholly unexpected. The other plots meander uselessly to no particular end, with the other characters generally as window dressing. There is no need to really examine any of this in any detail (how did the band camp geek get to be such an expert on sex anyway?) because it is meant as nothing more than a mildly humorous diversion. If you liked the first one, it's worth a look, but just barely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The five "lovable" morons from "American Pie" are back. This movie is about their first summer after freshman year in college. They all get together and rent a beautiful cottage to throw parties and have sex. Naturally supposedly hilarious sexual hijinks occur. I'm no fan of the first film (I thought it was pretty sick and I don't find sexual humiliation funny), but this is actually better. The humor is toned down (although Jason Biggs' character gets in some pretty sick situations) and I admit I laughed out loud a few times. It looks better than the first film and the performances are slightly (only slightly) better. Unfortunately the film is incredibly sexist (no shock there) and there's an ugly homophobic sequence. Still, I'd lie if I said I didn't enjoy myself. It's also kind of admirable for a sequel to actually tone down its raunchiness instead of trying to outdo the original. And Alyson Hannigan is absolutely wonderful (again) in this film. She was one of the sole saving graces in the first and is again. As for the guys--Jason Biggs still can't act and seems destined to make a career out of being humiliated; Seann William Scott is absolutely appalling and unfunny; Chris Klein is given the thankless good guy role but pulls it off; Thomas Ian Nicholas hardly registers and Eddie Kaye Thomas actually is a worse actor than Biggs and very annoying. So, if you like the first one you'll probably love this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unoriginal, rude, weak plot, weak acting - but very funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sees us pick up with the gang after a year away a college. We join them as they all return to their home town and plan a huge summer together again. This time there is no agreement to have sex etc but the consensus is that the summer will involve lots of girls. Consequently all the jokes are sex based.This starts really slowly - the first 20 minutes of so is all setting the scene, re-introducing the characters to us and one another and filling in background it almost feels like they didn't know what to do with the film and that it took 20 min for them to think up something. However, what they think up is just to rerun the basics from the first film.After this is all done and we get up to the "lake" then that's when the film gets down into the business of being funny and putting the people into funny situations. When I watched it I was really bored at the start and thought I was going to hate it as it fumbled blinding looking for a plot, but then the funny situations start coming and I was laughing so hard that I forgot the problems I had with it. Yes - it's basically a lame rerun of the first but then if it's still funny and people watch it - who cares!In terms of plot - it's pretty thin. It's obvious that the writers thought up 6 or 7 funny situations for the group to get into and then built the story around these to make them happen. But again - the situations are funny enough to carry the whole film.The acting is terrible - Chris Klein is the worst, like a low-rent Keanu Reeves (but even more wooden!!). Overall the acting is not great - but then this is not important in this type of film. Some of the characters are good but the majority are one dimensional jokers that occasionally have to "look sad" or "look hurt" or "look rejected" when the director shouts "now".The jokes save it. I think this is funnier that the first one - the situations are crazy, funny and rude! For all my problems with this - it is what it is and it is funny. Go see it and laugh like a drain!.....but please lets leave well enough alone now and not do a number 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering how great the first one was, I'm a little disappointed over this movie. It just seemed like they pretty much remade the first, just taking it a little further, making it more gross and more extreme, which may work for some fans of the first, but I honestly enjoyed the realness and laid-back feeling of the first far more than the gross scenes and stereotypes. Now, the stereotypes and the gross scenes are multiplied, to a point where it just gets a little tiresome. The apparent lack of any real original ideas, rather than just rehashes of the first, was a bit annoying too. But, all in all, it's an OK sequel, and a reasonably good teen comedy. The plot is OK, but it just seems too much like it was made up just in order to make a sequel to the first. The characters are a little too stereotypical, and not as well-written and real as they were the in first one. The humor is more or less the same, too much the same, in fact, as many of the jokes are just reused from the same formula as the first, like several of the scenes. Overall, the movie is not as good as the first, but it's OK. It's worth watching, if you want to see the characters again. I recommend this to fans of the first, and fans of teen comedies in general. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequel supersedes original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first "Pie" movie was good, and a sequel seemed inevitable. Evidently the writer of Pie 1 (Adam Herz) wasn't overly excited about doing another but it's fortunate that he did, because he surpassed what was done in Pie 1 on many levels. Herz and the supporting story editors gave the characters and giving their lives more dimension. We see them all again here one year later (although produced two years after Pie 1), having all gone through the pivotal first year of college. In some ways, we're seeing a re-vamp of the events of Pie 1...but now we go a few steps further. For instance, the character of Michelle Flaherty was seen ever so briefly in Pie 1 and Pie 2 and now we get to know her almost completely. Steve Stifler is his usual obnoxious self, and he's become even more-so in a year's time. Then of course, there's the principal character, Jim Levenstein - no longer a virgin but still quite innocent - and by the end of the movie, he's pretty much come full circle. The acting is pretty superb all around, and the director got the best out of the actors. Jason Biggs is not a big talent, but he has many small-but-bright moments throughout, and his adeptness at physical comedy is given a good display here. Seann William Scott's comedic range over the two flicks is huge, and it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the part of Stifler. The supporting actors (who all returned from Pie 1) are at their best as well, with splendid newcomers George Wyner playing the Senior Counselor at band camp, and Denise Faye &amp; Lisa Arturo playing the house owners. The subplots in Pie 2 (Band Camp, the guys' summer job of painting houses owned by beautiful women, and so forth) bring hilarious results. Adam Herz has a unique ear for dialog and characterization - I hope we see more of his work in the future. Personally, I think Pie 2 would've been a good place to stop. Pie 3 was a bomb and Pie 4 bears only a tiny resemblance to Pies 1, 2, and 3. The greatest aspect of Pie 1 and 2, but especially 2, is that they appeal to a surprisingly large audience, like "Animal House", "American Graffiti", and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" preceding them by 20 years and longer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the first American Pie movie beyond expectations, so I of course was very interested in watching part 2 as well. It's like most sequels; it's more of the same old stuff that was already shown in the first movie. In this case that isn't really a complaint because it's good stuff to watch. It's perfectly entertaining and has some great memorable moments in it to also distinct itself from the first movie.Once more the power of the movie lies in its characters. They are all a perfect bunch of characters and I was happy to see that almost every single actor from the first movie once more returned for this one. All of the actors still look good and comfortable in their roles. The characters are truly the reason why this movie is better than the average teenage comedy.Even though there of course is very little story in this movie it still is a entertaining movie to watch that never gets boring. Once again the story has also a morale in it, which is a good but not an entirely necessary thing for this movie.More hilarious and odd moments in this typical teenage comedy. Basically its more of the same but that's not a bad thing to say in this case.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better, funnier, and less crass and vulgar than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, this movie is much better, funnier, and less crass and vulgar than the first one. There is one crass part I can remember, though. That part is when Stifler (Seann William Scott) got urinated on while he was laying on a patio chair in his backyard on the night he had a party at his house while a girl was standing behind him! When Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) performed her flute solo at band camp, I thought she did a good job. If you ask me, the setting was perfect for a film released at this time of year, especially the beach house. That was a nice place. That makes me wish I had taken a summer vacation like that when I was younger. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I thought the ending was sweet and funny. This was because Jim arrived at the band camp and ran up on stage and kissed Michelle while the 3 Doors Down song was playing. In case you're wondering, it's called "Be Like That." Now, in conclusion, if you liked its predecessor, you should see this movie, that is, if you haven't seen it. You're in for a real treat, a good time, and lots of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with some friends, and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm so glad I saw this after it had been cleaned up for Fox. Even then, I was very surprised at what made it to network TV, though a stern warning came at the start and followed every commercial break until the kids were probably in bed. There were some good jokes here, if I was willing to be offended for a change. I mean really offended. Some were not of a sexual nature, such as when the one guy went to band camp to see a girl but had to find a way to keep from getting thrown out. But, yes, I admit, seeing girls in skimpy outfits was a big attraction. And most of the gags here had a sexual meaning. One of the best, to me, involved a father taking a walkie-talkie away from his child.I didn't care much for the music, but there were a few scenes that had good music. Such as when the boys were painting a house and they did something they shouldn't have and had to hide. And toward the end also. Anytime the action would have fit a campy 60s action series, that's what the music sounded like. I need to spend a lot of time watching family shows after this.</fullReview>

The girls from their high school (Tara Reid, Shannon Elizabeth, Mena Suvari, Alyson Hannigan and Natasha Lyonne) are also along for the ride though in this typical teen-based mess. Once again the only real momentum in the film is supplied by Biggs' father (Eugene Levy). The formula for films like this has been out-dated for nearly 25 years now. However, productions of the type just keep coming due to the base they have in the adolescent age groups and with those movie-goers who refuse to grow up. In short, if you have seen one film like this you have seen them all so do not waste your time with this one. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

Scott's and "The Rules of Attraction" was Thomas Ian Nicholas's. Not this drivel. Are we supossed to care that these characters haven't had sex since the first movie? And the way they handled the females' characters was horrible. Combined they were only on the screen for 10 minutes tops! Teens I know loved this movie. I don't know why. Thats why Universal is making AP3 called "American Wedding". And only one of the female characters is returning. I hope the movie flops.

		<fullReview>American Pie 2 is a film that was made simply because of the success of the first film. The problem with this is that they forgot to write a script that was either funny or interesting. In fact this film is a total bore that copies jokes from 100 other teen comedies. It is predictable and pointless. I remember looking at the clock on the DVD player and it said 61 minutes before anything remotely funny happened (The lesbian scene) and this could have been done much better. I am completely sick of films that involve American teenagers calling themselves dudes and leering over siliconed boobed teenage girls. i suspect neither really exist in the states. If you liked the first film the best way i can describe this is that it is just the same with the funny bits taken out. 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, at least it wasn't WORSE than the first one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie 2 starts off its rehash of the first film with the ever-present trailer gag. The trailer gag, of course, is one of the many gags that was played and played and replayed in the film's trailer(s) and is therefore completely without effect when seen in the theaters. The barrage of teen sex films/thrillers of the last decade or so are plagued with trailer gags, and some of those movies (Sorority Boys) contain little else. Here, we see Jim's (the unbearable Jason Biggs) father walk in as he and his girlfriend (if she could be called that, since they evidently have not even had `friendly hello sex') are having sex. This intrusion is followed by that of Jim's mother, who has the obligatory fit, and then, mysteriously, both of Natalie's (Jim's `girlfriend') parents. So within the first minutes of the film, we are given a stolidly unamusing scene involving the exact same sexual awkwardness that was present in every scene that Eugene Levy (Jim's father) and Jim shared in the first movie, and we're left wondering why Natalie's parents walked into the room at all.The rest of the movie is more of the same. In the movie's defense, however, I must say that Seann William Scott was just as hilarious in every scene that he was in as he was in the first movie. The characters in both movies are hugely stereotypical caricatures of what, according to Hollywood producers, the typical college kid looks and acts like, and Stifler is the only one in either film that turns out even slightly amusing. It's no secret that films of this type tend to feed relentlessly off their original films in order to provide most of the laughs (Austin Powers 2), or lack thereof (Scary Movie 2), but it can at least be said that that was done at a minimum in the case of American Pie 2. There is, thankfully, no `pie,' for example. On the other hand, the film does manage to feed off of other successful comedies. We see, for example, the introduction of Stifler's Mini-Me, as Stifler's younger brother enters the film, and is literally a miniature version of Stifler.For the entire film that doesn't contain Stifler, however, just about every single comedic scene falls completely flat, as was also the case with several of the scenes that Stifler WAS in (anything involving urine or, theoretically, lesbians, for example). Jim is once again cruelly thrown into every kind of awkward and embarrassing situation imaginable, leaving the audience not laughing, but also feeling awkward and embarrassed. There is, for example, the completely tasteless scene in which he is mistaken for a retarded trombone player - did NOBODY at that damn band camp know what this Petey looked like?! And the statement that Jim utters at the abrupt end of his performance (branding him by far the most moronic character in the film for the rest of the movie), will have your jaw on the floor in disgusted shock before you can say, `Oh my good God, you're KIDDING.'And all of the characters are back, too. Oz is back with his sickeningly sweet relationship with his insufferable girlfriend Heather, Finch is back in one of the more amusing roles in the film, having become so obsessed with his reunion with Stifler's mom that he meditates almost constantly, and Kevin is back again, having long since broken up with Vicky (Tara Reid). There is a curious interaction between Kevin and Vicky throughout the film. It's obvious that there's a lot of sexual tension and weirdness between them, but it's impossible to care whether they get back together or not. There's a scene early in the film in which they almost kiss, and Vicky is put off, reminding him that they're just friends in what I hope to no end is the worst scene that Tara Reid has ever acted. If it gets worse that THAT.There is an interesting paradox that comes with movies like the American Pies and the Scary Movies and Road Trip and Sorority Boys that, logically, should reduce the films to complete failure almost immediately upon release. They are clearly jam-packed with the kind of humor that amuses 4th grade children (and even THEM for no other reason than because they know their parents would hate it), yet they appear to be aimed at a late high school or (gulp) early college age audience. I was going to say that films like this can be watched just for a little fun, but then I wondered how much fun it is to watch a film in which a girl like Nadia falls completely in love with idiot after idiot, and I began to wonder what it is that made the film's producers and writers develop such an abysmally low opinion of their audience. Is it because we made their first film such a huge success? Could it be that they are sending a message with this movie? If they are, it's probably something like this, `You LIKED that garbage?! Well, take THIS!!'There is a clear lesson to be learned here, people, and I hope that everyone has been taking note of it. If we all keep paying to see this trash that is constantly cranked out by Hollywood, then we are only asking for more trash to be put on the menu. I think I said in my review of Scary Movie 2 that it's a lot of fun even to watch films that are so bad that they are virtually un-enjoyable, if only to tear them down later in my review. I won't say that American Pie delves to the unspeakably awful level that the Scary Movies both sunk to, but even writing reviews of the best bad movies gets old. A second sequel in this series is something that I would be more than happy to never see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I laughed out loudly!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie 2, to me, was better than the first one!! Stiffler has more of a role in this than he did in the first one. Everybody knows a stiffler. He is extremely typecast as the party animal. He is great. The entire movie was one laugh after another. The trumpet scent with Jim was really great. That red head girl really showed some acting talent in this movie. The fact that she and Jim dug eachother as time passed was rather cool!! Ozzy does not have much of a role. His character and the American Beauty chick's characters could have been left out. They didn't add much at all. The highlights were Stiffler, Jim and Jim's Dad. There were so many funny scenes in this movie that I can't list them all. It's a great movie and it made my Saturday Night much more enjoyable!!! I give this 8 stars for humor!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like it or hate it, American Pie was a thought out movie that succeeded at what it set out to do. This sequel had little thought to it other to rake in some more money by riding of the success of American Pie. It's basically a rehash of things that happened in American Pie. Anybody who loved the first one probably now has a tarnished view of it thanks to this flick. There are some overtly unfunny things going on, like the anti-sex mediation Karate Kid thing. Jason Biggs (Jim) tracks down Willow (Band Camp Girl) and asks her about the night they had sex. Hello, wouldn't he have seen her in class the Monday after the prom? Anyway, he goes to her at Band Camp (which luckily is a close drive from the beach house they're hanging out at). What's up with the gay undertones of this film? The male characters doing stuff to each other just to watch two lesbians doing stuff to each other. If you're just going to watch and not doing anything, why not just watch two women in a porno? All the characters are back in this one, but not all of them are needed. The only people who come out ahead in this are Shannon Elizabeth, who has more lines and doesn't have to take off her top. And Willow (I know that's not her real name, but if I saw her, I'd call her Willow), who has a much bigger part than the first one. Will there be an American Pie 3? Can we say, rounding out the box set. One more thing. Am I the only one who's annoyed by Universal's promo before a Universal movie? They show clips from 3 or 4 Universal movies cut to overtly sentimental music. Duh nuh nuh nuh. Duh....nuh nuh. Duh nuh nuh. Duh....nuh nuh. Duh.....Duh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History Repeats Itself (With A Cheesy Ending Tacked On)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After American Pie, what's left in it for the sequel? As is often demonstrated by these films, they don't reckon with what happens when there's nothing left to build an actual sequel on. Still, didn't stop them with Carrie 2, Speed 2: Cruise Control, or Home Alone 3. The basis of American Pie 2 was much the same as the first. Only, this time, it was one year later, and they were 'college guys'. Did this make much of a difference? Not really. They were still trying to satisfy their sexual urges throughout the entire film. Why anyone thought this would be an interesting enough subject to make a film about in the first place is quite beyond me. Still, it's a year later - the boys and girls are coming home from college to have a reunion. Jim is still bad in bed, Kev is still lusting after Vicky, Oz is still with Heather, Stifler still believes himself to be God's gift, and Finch has taken an interest Japanese cultures in a vain attempt to impress Stifler's Mom. Nothing new here then.For me, the opening sequence says a lot about a film's content, and this one certainly said a lot. We have Jim in bed with some random blonde, coaxing him into some "friendly goodbye sex". It also happens to be the day that college is over for the summer. So commences the crosscutting between Jim's room and his parents. Already you can guess what's going to happen. Seeing as though it's so blatantly obvious, we may as well litter it with strikingly transparent clues as to what is going to happen in the rest of the film. Here we have Eugene Levy commenting on how he's prepared to give his 'son' the big "you're a man" speech. Oh, does this mean he's gonna do various things to embarrass his son throughout the entire movie? Probably. Does this also mean that he's going to catch him in further more compromising positions? Just like the last? I expect so. Anyway, let's cut to the chase. In steps Levy with a crate of beer, ready to give that "big man" speech he'd been talking about. Oh yeah, did I mention this is supposed to be a surprise too? No? Well, it is. But - oh no - disaster! "Can't bring alcohol in the dorms." That's okay - he's no match for Levy, "I'm just here to surprise my son Jim. Maybe you could help me out?" Wink. So, remarkably, Levy finds his way to Jim's room, and bursts in yelling, "Where's my big guy?" Groan. You'd have thought these media types would've realised that surprising people just never works. Probably why real people don't do it, then. Still, he dropped the beer for effect upon the site of his son naked, in bed with that aforementioned random blonde. Of course Jim's instant reaction is to jump out of bed and scream at his father to get out. Right. So in steps Mom shouting "I made your favourite!" She too then drops the pie she'd been cradling on the floor in horror. The pie. The apple pie. Nudge. Could it get much worse? Oh yes. In step the parents of the random blonde ready to surprise (this technique must be catching) their darling daughter. Although how they gathered she'd be in some random bloke's room is quite perplexing. Then Blondie sums it up for us all: "Thanks Jim. What, do you not believe in locks?" Yes Jim, don't you believe in locks? Is it not customary to lock the door where you come from? Or is it just not customary in cheap, tacky comedies where the old gags are, obviously, the best?As for the rest of the film, it didn't get much better. The opening sequence had already been littered with references to the previous. That didn't change throughout, either. In the next scene, in Jim's bedroom, the second shot was focussed on that infamous webcam from the first film. Then it changes to focus on a picture of Nadia. "Who's Nadia?" I hear you cry. That's okay, I wouldn't have known who she was either if I hadn't seen the first. Actually, I do think that was a major weakness of this film - it relied too much on people having seen the first. Although I think you could've guessed what went on, a great deal of it probably wouldn't have made a lot of sense. At least, if you hadn't seen the first film, you wouldn't have noticed all the boring recycled jokes.Although the film was largely based around Jim and his sexual problems, one thing baffled me about this film: why was Mena Suvari even in it? For the duration of the film I was waiting for her to do something; a twist in the tale - nothing happened. We saw a few brief scenes of her missing her beau, but that was about it. She deserved about as much credit for this film as Drew Barrymore did for Scream. Her appearance in the film couldn't have totalled more than about 10 minutes. A shame really, as her character, Heather, was one of the more bearable ones.I found a majority of the scenes in this film ridiculous, predictable, and wholly unfunny. The more memorable of these being mistaking urine for champagne, mistaking glue for a lubricant, and mistaking two heterosexual women for lesbians. Although you can hardly blame them for the latter - as it goes in all these films, women always undress together and do it in front of a window.I'll admit, one or two things did make me laugh in this film. But one or two just isn't enough.In short, I thought it was marginally better than the first (only marginally, mind). As with the first, I couldn't even begin to understand how anyone liked it. The storyline was awful, the characters were rubbish, and the jokes just weren't funny. I suppose the acting couldn't be faulted. However, none of the characters seemed all that intriguing or challenging roles for the actors.To conclude, I'll give it a four out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and sex filled movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American Pie, the first one, was one of the best comedies of 1999, it was one of the very few teen movies, comedies especially, to show teens as they are: cursing, horny, animals. That alone made it a really good movie, but the comedy was a big plus for it as well. Now comes the sequel to the low budget comedy, American Pie 2. Does this movie come close to the original, well, sort of. It has gags galore and it gives good laughs for the money spent. While it can't match up quite to the audacity, and originality to the original, it still had very good scenes mixed with very good characters. The funniest characters here are Jim's dad (Eugene Levy has one of his funniest characters with these 2 movies) and Steve Stiffler (cool dude). Only one more note here: try to wait after seeing this movie if you want to see it again or else the jokes might get stale. B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first, but not by much!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I will admit that American PIE 2 was better than the first American PIE movie, but not by much. I mean they are both equally as gross and vulgar, but American PIE 2 has this a bit of sweetness that wasn't in the first American PIE movie. Even though it has a bit of sweetness in it, this movie is still complete garbage like the first one was. Once again we have a movie all about bad comic set pieces that are poorly written and acted.The acting is even worse in this one then it was in the first movie. Now I know a lot of people will probably disagree with me here, but I really don't see why these kinds of movies are so popular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first, though..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>that's not saying much on my part since I didn't really care for the first "American Pie" either. In the sequel, there are fewer gross out moments, but that doesn't make those moments any less disgusting, the plot is pretty non-existent, whereas the first one seemed to be about something at the very least. But to it's credit, the sequel is funnier than the first, but not by much. Some of the characters are good, in fact the main guys in the film all have an unmistakable chemistry on screen, they all work really well together. Then there are some bad ones, Mena Suvari is rarely seen during the film, except in about 5-6 scenes and Shannon Elizabeth (sporting one of the worst hairstyles I've seen in a long time) is just plain annoying, plus she doesn't look that great in my opinion (which will likely get many bad comments sent to me, just for saying that). But anyway, the sequel is okay, it's nothing bad, and like I said before better than the first, just not all that good. I give it ** out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a big fan of it, but it was better than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only met one person who didn't like this film. So, I decided to give it a shot, even though I disliked the first "American Pie". I have to admit, I had a couple laughs. But there were still a lot of jokes that were too close to the first one. The plot was also the same. I don't mind that too much. But if you didn't enjoy the first one, you won't get a big kick out of this one. I did enjoy some of the jokes. And the story was a point above the first one. So, if you loved the 1st, be my guest. If you didn't enjoy the 1st one, still give the 2nd a shot. You don't know what you may get. Some may actually just enjoy the 2nd one alone. Who knows? Maybe I'll even watch "American Wedding". 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following the success of the first film, it was inevitable that a sequel would follow. And surprise, surprise, it isn't even as good as the not exactly brilliant original. More of the same but the forced desperation shows. If you can spell sophistication or can use a dictionary to look it up, you're too intelligent for this mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the first american pie, and i love the third american pie, but WHAT IS SO FUNNY ABOUT THIS MOVIE? the second one is just gross, lacks creativity, and just... isn't funny! its as simple as that. Im sorry but watching 'hot lesbian chicks' get on eachother for half the movie just isn't funny. If you're going to make a teen sex movie at least make it interesting. If you want to watch something gross and funny, watch the first AP or the third. Please.. save your money.. this is something to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.A very interesting film given some realities: this is successfully engineered to tap some cultural acupuncture point -- and it does so after the first film provided valuable information about what audiences thought funny. The first film was uncentered by design: the idea with such things is to cheaply provide a model for everyone and let them find their own focus. But not this one. Clearly the masses spoke, and what we have here is a film which nominally has everyone back from the first, but which is about the Levenstein boy and laughing at his ineptness.Another film about the clumsy Jew? I think Woody Allen has a lot to answer for, or to take credit for depending on your point of view. Until Woody, it was okay for Jews to be funny, but not ridiculous. Check out how the Marx brothers disguised their characters as Italians. Now Ben Stiller has created a cottage industry of goofy Jews.As a background story, we have the attempts by another dope to master Tantric sex (with a big laugh when he says its a `Buddhist' thing). Last time we had the stupid Jew outwitted by the Irish Catholic girl as one episode. This time, most of the story concerns him getting advice about sex (because Catholics are better lovers?), and impressing the girl by doing in the movie what he is doing by the movie: going onstage and acting like a retard. There's a circumcision joke, too.When this much money is on the line, things are done deliberately, though I doubt the cast had the slightest idea. But that bit about the guy in the audience standing and cheering on Petey, is a fine self-referential touch about how to find touchstones in the public. Very smart signature to show the writers know what's what. Just look at the comments here on IMDB to see "that guy" cheering on the mentally challenged.</fullReview>
