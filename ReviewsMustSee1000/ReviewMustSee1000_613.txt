		<shortDescription>Tragic and beautiful masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sweet Hereafter is as tragic, sad and matter-of-fact as movies get, but it's still so very beautiful that it becomes a film that's virtually impossible to forget.The story makes no secret of the fact what terrible tragedy will happen, right from the outset. A lesser filmmaker than Atom Egoyan would've jumped at the chance to shock the audience with the freak accident that robs the town of Sam Dent of nearly all their children, by telling the story in a linear fashion. Not Egoyan. The story is fragmented, thus enhancing the true point: This is not about the overwhelming power of loss, it is about the overwhelming power of survivor's guilt (nicely represented in Browning's poem The Pied Piper Of Hamelin, which is referred to in the movie). It's all about people who grieve not only for the ones they've lost, but also for themselves, how empty their lives have become because of their tragedies. In focussing on that point, the film refrains from manipulative sentiment (which so many others don't), and presents true and unintrusive emotion, that, in the end, despite all the terror, shines a light of hope, for the sweet hereafter is not only the peaceful afterlife, it's also the peaceful future, the continuation of life...The performances speak for themselves. Ian Holm and Sarah Polley shine in particular, through nicely subdued and subtle acting. Polley also excels as a fantastic singer-songwriter. The songs in the movie were written and performed all by herself.Egoyan's direction is simply masterful in its beauty, elegance and evocation.One of the best films of the 1990s.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to drama, The Sweet Hereafter represents the finest cinema of the decade. The film lifts the director Atom Egoyan to the highest place of Canadian directors -right next to David Cronenberg. With extraordinary intelligence, Egoyan -the maker of "Exotica"- creates labyrinths of relationships. Brilliantly using flashbacks the director reveals the emotions of the characters to the viewers -a powerful way to make the audience feel anxiety.The Sweet Hereafter is based on a novel by Russell Banks. This doesn't mean that Egoyan hasn't created a film that looks like his own creation. Very beautifully, even with a sense of poetry, the camera moves in a canadian small-town, a scenery full of snow. The nicely unusual music of Mychael Danna creates the mood when a lawyer played by Ian Holm arrives to the town. A School bus lies under ice, and the lawyer is invited to sue someone for the loss of several children.A very important slice of the scenario belongs to a school girl (Sarah Polley), who realizes that the grief of loss can't be eased by judging the cause of it. Also the other people of the town play a remarkable role in the script.Egoyan speaks clearly, but with a sound of personality, about the need of love, the pain of loneliness and the crossing of emotional obstacles. Fortunately someone knows how to direct interesting movies with elements of drama in them. The Sweet Hereafter possesses a brilliant structure where the visual telling breaths in the spirit of symbolism. I'm a very demanding viewer, a true cynic who always tries to find the worst sides of the film, but in this case I can't say anything negative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Sweet Hereafter" was arguably the best film of the 1990s and is one of my twenty favorite movies of all time. Everything comes together perfectly: fine characterization and acting (especially by Ian Holm), beautiful photography, and a hypnotic musical score featuring Armenian folk instruments. The mood is deeply elegiac but never maudlin or weepy. There's not a false note in the movie.But don't worry; I'm not going to start screaming, "If you don't like this movie, you just don't understand it! Go back to your Hollywood pablum, you cretinous moron!" That's a stupid argument in any case, and especially so here. There are going to be some people -- including a few art-house fans -- who will find this movie slow and tedious. For me and many others, however, the film is a masterpiece.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter is a drama of loss and internal conflict within and among the people of small town which has lost its children to a winter bus crash. The central figure is Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm), a lawyer who comes to the town in the hope of putting together a lawsuit on behalf of the surviving families.Egoyan drags bitter and emotional performances out of his excellent cast, and managed to make me fall in love with a group of characters who, on the surface, are less than appealing. Every major character in his adaptation of Russel Banks' novel is morally bifurcated and riven with doubt. Particularly interesting from a social perspective is the treatment of Stephens' mission. I thought the lawyer's efforts to put together his suit were played even-handedly, somewhere between the greed of an ambulance-chaser cynically exploiting a local tragedy and the difficult but necessary effort to use a flawed legal system to achieve a kind of justice. But the friends who saw it with me saw Stephens strictly as a "slimeball," placed there to test and tempt the struggling townspeople. If that's the impression that most viewers get, then I'm disappointed.Whatever your perspective on that social question, there's no denying the slow power of this film. It moves with the measured fascination of inevitability, and leaves you with a bitterness you can savor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for everyone, but this melancholy film stays with you long after its over...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I re-watched The Sweet Hereafter on video last night, and am still haunted by it today. It is structured so that you know some of the basic tragic plot near the beginning. This caused my eyes to water at some of the beautiful lyrical overhead tracking shots of the school bus winding through the snow covered roads of the Pacific northwest.The film switches between the time that the lawyer arrives in town to "help" the families receive compensation, and to days just prior to the accident. We witness a loving "hippie" couple who has adopted a beautiful Native American boy, a loving mother of a school phobic learning disabled boy, and a widower who loves his two children a great deal and sees them off to school by following them in his truck. This same widower is having an affair with the mother of the school phobic--she is unhappily married to a "pig" of a husband. Complicating matters is the father who obviously loves his teenage daughter in Lolita-like fashion.Part of the theme of The Sweet Hereafter is similar to Magnolia--accidents do happen--perhaps no one at fault... or perhaps all the adults had some part in it without anyone being at fault, as only the innocent children were killed.The town had changed... tragedy has taken away the town's joy and innocence. The parents are no longer open with each other, but guarded, suspicious... in deep grief.The lawyer is little more than an ambulance chaser, attempting to profit off their tragedy. Yet, he, too is a tragic figure who has already "lost" his daughter--He had saved her when she was a baby, yet she has now turned away from him... and his feelings are now ambivalent towards her--he is a grief-stricken, defeated father, who vascillates between wanting to talk with his daughter on his cell phone and deciding to cut her off.The story of the Pied Piper is interweaved between various events in the movie to give greater depth to the story. There's also a great scene in the movie between the lawyer and the garage mechanic, who has lost his two children, that shows that the theme is much broader than the literal story:"I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel. They're dead to us. They kill each other in the streets. They wander comatose in shopping malls. They're paralyzed in front of televisions. Something terrible has happened that's taken our children away. It's too late. They're gone."This movie isn't for everyone. It's a serious, layered piece with a lot of melancholy. The kind of fare that film critics can love, but Academy voters will avoid. But what it strives to accomplish is done very well. And it will stay with you long after the final scenes have appeared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the saddest films I have ever seen. I do not mean that in bad way though. I have seen sad films that made me depressed and I usually disliked them because of this. The Sweet Hereafter is different though. It is a sad film without being manipulative and fake. The film brilliantly shows how people need to have revenge. After a bus accident where all but two are killed the people of the town, after a lawyer pushes them on, become obsessed with suing those responsible. Egoyan looks at how people can not accept that things happen by accident. The people of the town feel that someone has to pay for the pain they are feeling and in the end they are the ones to pay for it. The acting is excellent, especially Ian Holm. Once you become accustomed to the time shifts this is an incredibly rewarding film that you will always remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of the 1990's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brutally honest, haunting, cold, austere and elliptical in the unfolding of plot and story, Atom Egoyan's restrained but powerful look at a small Canadian town ripped apart by tragedy and now invaded by a troubled lawyer (played expertly by Ian Holm) looking to make a killing off their grief is one of the most artistic portraits of the sorrow of everyday people ever conceived. The scene where Bruce Greenwood's character witnesses the school bus carrying his two children and all the hopes and dreams of a small town skid nonchalantly off an icy road and onto a frozen body of water that can't possibly hold the vehicle's weight is among the most chilling, heart-wrenching and gut-dropping scenes ever put on film. The revelations unearthed during the lawyer's investigation are both quietly disturbing and all too true to life. The intertwining tales of the townsfolk and the ultimately heartbroken lawyer are exquisitely handled by Egoyan and leave the viewer feeling the same loss as the characters. Tragedy befalls us all. Luckily, every once in awhile, so does great art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvelous acting, excellent photography, cinematic brilliance. Those are just a few of the words, that describe this movie. It's a shame that it did not receive the attention it should have. Not even at the Academy Awards where only Egoyan received a nomination. Titanic is not half as great as The Sweet Hereafter. So go and get it... and watch it and watch it and watch it. It'll be an unforgettable experience. Because of its subtle atmosphere it seems as silent as a silent film, but its so rich in character and story development - with great actors in the lead. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting tale about how nothing is ever as it seems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, this is simply the story of a small Canadian town traumatized by a school bus crash. Personal injury lawyer Ian Holm arrives on the scene in his expensive car, cellular phone at hand, ready to sign up victims for a lawsuit because, "I believe there is no such thing as an accident." But that summary really tells nothing, because this haunting tale is not about a grasping lawyer or greedy victims, but about how nothing is ever as it seems on the surface.Director Atom Egoyan does a remarkable job with the narrative. Though at times the movie is difficult to follow because of some sequences which it is not immediately clear are flashbacks, it's worth sticking with it. The story works precisely because the chronology is chopped up to reveal the secrets each character, including the lawyer, keeps hidden, until the tragedy finally rips open the lives of everyone it touches.Repeat viewings are definitely in order, if only because of the multiple, interwoven layers and images which are not always apparent on first viewing, and to ponder the interplay among the three strands of narrative in the movie. The movie is worthwhile, too, for Holm's portrayal of his grim, relentless character (possibly the best of his career), and Sarah Polley's remarkable performance as a kind of modern-day Greek chorus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Study in Tenses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.What a wonderful study in structuring a film! I am not familiar with Egoyan's other work, but I plan to be. What he has done here is transcend the Banks material. This I DO know, and it is mawkishly sentimental, aggressively raw, substituting voyeuristic pain for art.And from this Egoyan has carved an object so complex and nuanced, so softly woven into our minds, the effect itself shocks.The whole thing revolves around two deft tricks: one is the mystery of why the girl lies, which is not wholly because of fraternal sexual abuse, but you don't get that until the very end when what we know about Billy Ansell comes into focus. Then every element of the narrative is brought into question, as surely as "Usual Suspects" or "Cabinet of Dr Caligari" but without drawing attention to itself.The real innovation, the real mastery, is the folding of narrative: different times, different perspectives, different truths (some reporters are lying), mirrored multiple realities, conflicting tenses all brought into apparent harmony or at least stasis. In fact the mirroring and folding and shifting is profound, but it all seems so natural one doesn't notice that the underlying physics of the world has shifted.The fundamental problem filmmakers face is how to manage narrative. It is a far more difficult problem than is the case with novels. Experiments abound, usually with obvious mechanics and it is now an accepted genre to focus on those mechanics. Not so here: everything is in service to the direct link with our soul. There's lots of smart stuff going on, but we never notice it.Oh yes, the acting and score are superb. Ian Holm is appropriately Shakespearean. Sarah Polley is becoming someone to watch if only because of the immensely intelligent choices she has been making. The score is particularly apt. But it is all because of the saturated consciousness Egoyan brings to the project.Key line: `What do you mean outgrown them?'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There aren't many films that unfold with a true grace, like a bird spreading it's wings in a beautifully restrained manner. "The Sweet Hereafter" is one of them, it is an engrossing film that doesn't rely on emotional manipulation to effect it's viewer, it tells a tale like it is, and in the end, that is exactly what makes it so good. The film studies a small Canadian town in the face of tragedy, and carefully layers a series of intertwining stories involving a handful of locals who have all been impacted by the occurence. Every character seems to have a normal life at first, but as the film progresses, it becomes clear that they do not. They are emotionally void people who all harbour secrets and lies, and as much as they want to believe what they're doing is right, deep down they know it's not. Intense emotions of guilt and grief run through them, but for unusual reasons. "The Sweet Hereafter" examines the things that surface after the wake of a tragedy, after the eminent shock and sorrow, how people's lives become so deteriorated and barren. The film skillfully uses different perspectives, places and time to explore the span of everything involved, asking why some things in the universe are out of our control, and if they happen for a reason. I was impressed with the film's meticulous structure, every frame is measured delicately to maximise it's power, and it works 100 percent of the time. From stark to striking, it's visuals work just as well as it's intellect. Ok, so Russell Bank's novel is a bit clearer, but Atom Egoyan's take on it is just as effective, if not more. Another thing that makes this film shine are it's performances, Sarah Polley and Ian Holme are both superb, both exude with a gentle sadness that genuinely convinces. In all, "The Sweet Hereafter" is a film that needs to be seen, it is a beautifully realised and haunting film that's virtually impossible to forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the movie, not the director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I watched the entire film, I can't say that I would sit through it again. It wasn't painful to watch, but it was slow and I was unimpressed with the character portrayal. Each character has a couple of elements each, but they remained flat. The acting seemed strained and over-dramatic (not "subtle and subdued"). I simply wasn't convinced.Sarah Polley maintained a very cool, bitter, "serious" teen, but it was too much. There was only so much of her scowl that I could take before wondering if there was anything else to her. There are some parental issues she contends with, but they are never addressed. How do they affect her? What does that mean to their relationship? Ian Holm didn't do it for me either. His words betrayed his demeanor. The moments when he was riling up clients didn't sync with his manner in general. There was no smooth transition or feeling that he was truly that character. He spoke his lines well but I didn't feel that he acted them. He looked almost zombie-like throughout the movie (granted, it's a somber movie, but still?).If I were to name the most convincing actor in the movie, it would be Alberta Watson. Her character, Risa, was the most heartfelt and believable.I am judging this movie based solely on the movie. I knew only the plot summary before watching. I do not recognize any of the actors' names. I know nothing of Atom Egoyan, which makes me more confident with my reaction to the film. I'm not writing to the notoriety of the people who made up this movie, I am writing about the movie itself. I feel this distinction becomes obscured when commenters feel they have to prove their film knowledge.</fullReview>

The movie ends with (the only?) child survivor of the accident, Sarah Polley, lying to the opposing teams lawyer by telling him that the bus was going 72 miles an hour. That's it, end of movie, everyone picks up their marbles and goes home. The movie doesn't even follow it's own logic, the parent's class-action lawsuit lawyer, who would supposedly go to the ends of the earth to look for any remote/ far reaching possibility for the accident (a faulty part, weak guardrail, etc.) is felled instantly by a lie that could be refuted immediately by all other witness testimony and the police report's brake/skid mark tests that are automatically performed at any accident of this magnitude.

		<shortDescription>Wiggle your noses and have fun ? The Sweet Hereafter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How much money is your child worth? Is that a question you could ever fathom yourself asking? Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter broaches the subject with devastating results, showing the many ways in which one could lose their offspring and the pain and suffering it causes. But can that pain be tempered by a monetary settlement or a name being punished with a slap on the wrist? No, of course not. Vengeance will only feed your lust for blood; it will only make you go deeper and deeper into a descent towards hell. There comes a time where you must look at your life and feel rewarded for the time you've had and be able to move on, no matter how slow and painful that transition may be. This film is pretty much perfect on all counts?story, acting, pacing, directing, you name it. As it went on, I couldn't help but think of David Gordon Green's film Snow Angels and the comparisons of loss and renewal as thematic backbones. Interestingly enough, both of these films were my first foray into the two director's oeuvres, both possibly their most sorrowful and heartfelt, making me want to visit the rest of their works. What the similarity also does, over ten years later, is prove Egoyan himself correct. My screening of The Sweet Hereafter was followed by a Q&amp;A with editor Susan Shipman who spoke of how just that morning Atom told her, upon revisiting the film, that "I think it holds up". He couldn't be more right; its relevance has stood the test of time.At its core, the film is about the loss of innocence, the disintegration of the parent/child dynamic. Values had started to fall by the wayside as people began living their lives with a drive for money and power, allowing drugs and greed to destroy any semblance of compassion and morals. "We've all lost our children," says Ian Holm's Mitchell Stevens, a cutthroat lawyer looking for blood by suing a manufacturing firm for a horrible accident that really had no one's fault to blame, but also a loving father who lost his hope and dream of the idyllic family. Each and every character has lost someone dear to them, whether that be the parents of the children who perished in the school bus accident at the center of it all; the driver Dolores, (wonderfully played by Gabrielle Rose), upon losing all the children of her town and surviving; or Holm with an estranged child who has been in and out of drug abuse clinics for over a decade, possibly dying or just scamming him for money any chance she gets. Love is shown in all its many forms, from a father's incestuous relationship with his daughter, to the unencumbered joy in an adopted Indigenous son, to the worrisome mother for her learning disabled child, to the father who knows he enables his daughter's drug habit, but can't stop because there may be one time when she actually isn't lying to him. Love is a gamble that you take with your heart, and through the good and bad, it can never be a mistake.What I will never forget, besides the heartbreaking instances and lingering close-ups of actors' faces mirroring the hurt they feel, (I loved the extreme framing in parts of just mouths, or even abstract compositions of a ferris wheel in the bottom left hand corner and sweeping aerial shots from a winding road to the wispy clouds in the sky), are the amazing performances. An early role for Canadian beauty Sarah Polley shows the burgeoning success she has found since, Ian Holm relays how good he is with a more challenging and rewarding role than the hailed bit part in Garden State, and Maury Chaykin, with commanding presence in a short scene, resonates both his humor and gossip yet also his sense of community in a warped way. There were also a couple of truly great turns from Tom McCamus and Bruce Greenwood. McCamus plays Polley's father with a very intriguing interior makeup. Truly loving his daughter, too much in fact with regards to their presumed sexual relationship, he always has a smile mixed with apparent awkwardness, unsure of his role in her life. Complicated to the end, it is his performing without words in two later pivotal scenes that shine most. As for Greenwood, he is by far my favorite. After losing his wife to cancer, he will do anything for his twins, even following their school bus each morning to wave at them. That fact put him in firsthand view of the accident and the realization that sometimes life just deals you a bad hand. The most tragic and also the most realistic of them all, it is his resolve that ultimately saves this quiet town from complete implosion.What it all comes down to is a group of people grieving together and helping each other cope with a horrific event felt by all. Someone in the audience asked Shipman how Dolores could ever get a bus job again after Nicole lies, blaming her for the accident. What that person didn't understand is that the lie is what made it possible. By completely destroying any chance of a lawsuit against the bus makers, no one is held at fault. A new lawsuit would have to be brought up against Dolores to truly hold her accountable, so that lie then put her fate in the hands of community, who in turn absolved her of any guilt she most certainly already holds in her heart. As the overshadowing tale of "The Pied Piper" shows a hatred that only leads to more pain?using his magic for revenge rather than just getting what he wanted and leaving?only Greenwood's Billy Ansel and Polley's Nicole see the light in forgiveness and honoring those lost rather than treading over their graves with more and more hate. Sometimes doing nothing is the hardest and most difficult thing to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the excellent Exotica, Atom Egoyan misfired with this warped and uninvolving 'adaptation' of Russell Banks's novel. Using the same understated and unsentimental style he employed in Exotica, Egoyan tries to make the story of a bus tragedy in a remote snow-laden Canadian town an intellectual puzzle of sorts; yet this story of small town immorality is in dire need of a Lifetime TV movie makeover rather than a deconstruction of its own willfuly obscure narrative. This is where the film is a spectacular failure - the story is too human for Egoyan's dehumanizing narratives. Egoyan is at sea when it comes to dealing with conventional emotions; he would rather intellectualize as he did in Exotica and The Adjuster. That's why I feel the film feels forced. It's simply not deep enough for Egoyan. So what does he do, he constructs a simplistic analogy with the Pied Piper (not in the novel)that seeks to add depth to the original novel but feels too literary and self-conscious to be cinematic.Yet this is Egoyan's most critically acclaimed film and that is baffling. Ian Holm as the lawyer Mitchell Stevens is miscast. His accent veers from English to Canadian and back again. How do we take him seriously? Sarah Polley is also as understated as ever which seems to be her style. As for the rest, they all perform to expectation which means we have to endure silences and odd, offbeat yet contrived dialog. Egoyan's detached directorial stance which served him in so well in previous film, is exposed here as a ruse. Where pathos and empathy should be invoked by the tragic scenario, the director's own penchant for obscurantism clouds any human interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie aspires to be so much, but accomplishes nothing. This is more of a collection of vignettes than a movie. The filmmaker's attempt to tie it all together with the pied piper story seemed like a desperate ploy to add meaning to what was really a mish-mosh of almost random scenes, that are only loosely related. I had heard many great things about this movie, so my expectations were high. At times that movie seemed more like a two hour advertisement for the awful soundtrack that is pervasive throughout the film, and available for purchase according to the multitude of commercials that preceded the film. As I watched scene after scene of innuendo (secret affairs, drug use, personal demons) I kept hoping for all of this to add up. Well, it does not, at least in any significant way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See Exotica instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the truly excellent Exotica, I've kept an eye on Atom Egoyan.But unfortunately, Egoyan, so far, has proven to be one of those director's for whom everything clicks, once, and every other film tries to replicate the beauty of that one film, and fails.The Sweet Hereafter is not bad, which is already better than any of his other films besides Exotica. You can see how Egoyan tries again to create the multi-layered psychologies of a number of characters, interweave them, and place them all in a slightly twisted, burdensome environment, and show us how they all deal with it.But it just doesn't work.It starts out okay. We are introduced to several characters and each has something interesting going for them, and some twist to make them interesting. But it doesn't pan out. The personalities are never given the depth they need, and subsequently I never cared about their problems.Over the story is overlayed the tale of the Pied Piper, but this is done with Sarah Polley narrating bits of the story to us throughout the film. This might be okay, if it wasn't for the fact that she just can't act, and what we get is an amateurish reading, which almost makes me cringe. Such a bad voice-over could ruin even a good film.We get no revelations about any characters, unlike Exotica, where every character is a little mystery that slowly unfolds. Here, the characters are totally stagnant, and nothing new happens, and nothing new about them is revealed.In the end of Exotica, we are given a beautiful conclusion, where everything comes together on a narrative, psychological, and thematic level. There is nothing like that here. It just sort of ends. There is a slight hint as if we are supposed to find something profound in the reasons why Sarah Polley says what she says, the looks between her and her father imply this, as well as the voice-over. But it's too weak, and by this point I was too bored to bother to even think about it.But Egoyan has an eye, and there are a few great scenes. Ian Holm manages to turn mediocre (and even bad) dialogue into something great, and especially his dialogue with his daughter's childhood friend is excellent.Sadly, overall, the film is just a pale, pretentious, and amateurish replica of Exotica. If this had come before Exotica, I would understand , but sadly, as it comes after, I can only conclude that Egoyan is a director for whom everything magically clicked once, and will probably spend the rest of his career trying to re-attain that perfection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lately I've been seeing just about every movie that someone recommends to me, and "the Sweet Hereafter" has been on quite a few of my friends' lists. I was excited about finally seeing the movie.What I found was less compelling than I expected. None of the characters were really engaging, and perhaps that's the aim of the film. But I honestly can't understand how this movie could have made people cry. Who did they identify with? Ian Holm's character, whose grimacing and silence set my teeth on edge, and whose attitude toward the families of the accident victims was so entirely self-serving? Sarah Polley's character, who almost never displayed any spark of life? And even if I had begun to identify with one character or another, I would have been instantly put off by the trite lines that kept coming out of their mouths. "Let me direct your rage?" Give me a break.Not to imply too much of a connection between the films, but if you want to feel the terror and rage surrounding a tragedy as though you were there living through it, see "Boys Don't Cry." The words that go unsaid in that film are worth much more than those voiced-over or spoken all too clearly in "the Sweet Hereafter."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent and stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could never have been made in Hollywood. Hollywood simply does not produce works this intelligent. This movie is so intelligent, in fact, that it is remarkable that it was ever made at all, anywhere. It is not, however, unintelligible. The entire film is told in a language well accessible to all: the language of relationships.Besides the stunning cinematography, which transforms the very landscape into a character, there are five remarkable aspects of this film: the extraordinary storytelling technique, the use of sound, the exploration of relationships, the acting, and the way the whole film reaches in and grabs your heart, wrenches it about, and still leaves you feeling lightened and strangely refreshed at the end.The most remarkable of these aspects is the storytelling. The plot slips backward and forward in time, like memory -- a single image here, a conversation there, an absurdity, a pang -- just as a person would remember a sequence of events -- nonsequentially. Often when directors attempt this approach we are left confused or exhausted by too much arty-ness. Not here. The film builds patiently, but not slowly, and it is impossible to lose track of the actual course of events. Although there is a certain oblique quality to the views we are granted -- we don't really know these people, and it is clear that we are outsiders observing their lives through someone else's memory glass -- there is no confusion as to what happened to whom, when -- and why, when there is a "why."One of the reasons we do not lose track is the truly virtuoso handling of sound. All the sounds of the characters and their lives, their speech, their footsteps and other incidental sounds, as well as the strong and poignant soundtrack, weave complex scenes together with some very neat and complicated editing. A strain of speech or music overlapping from its scene of origin into another scene not only accomplishes the continuity but also increases this feeling of memory, that we are experiencing this entire period of time the way the people living in it would when looking back upon it, in random yet connected pieces, not as a single shot from beginning to end. It also underscores another strong element of the structure of the movie, the way we are made to feel the slippery, sliding aspect of the future coming up quickly and inexorably.More than anything else, the relationships in this film are the point -- relationships between parents and children, between lovers, between community members with each other, between humans and the landscape, between a community and an outsider. The film explores not only how these relationships are, in plain and simple fact, but how they change both due to fate and due to chosen courses of action.The relationships explored are shown in depth by several truly brilliant performances. Of particular note are the characters created by Ian Holm, Gabrielle Rose, Bruce Greenwood, Alberta Watson, and Arsinee Khanjian. Each of these characters is so real and natural and full, even put together as they are in a sort of patchwork, snippet-by-snippet fashion, it is hard to believe they are make-believe. I will never ever forget any of them, and I do hope to see a lot more of each of these actors -- especially the lesser known -- in the future. The Sweet Hereafter is a tragedy in that it hinges on a tragic event, a bus accident which kills a number of children in a small town. This is no spoiler; the viewer discovers it very soon. Because of this central event, many people have described this film as too depressing to watch. This is simply not true. As my friend Teri so rightly put it, The Sweet Hereafter is "curiously life affirming."Yes, the film affirms, there are things that happen to us from which we can never recover, as individuals and as a community. Yes, most lives, even some young lives, contain betrayal and disappointment and even horror. Nevertheless, the film also affirms that it is possible to survive and wish to. It also shows how it is possible to continue loving a person who has betrayed you or disappointed you, even more than once, just as it is possible to betray someone out of love without destroying the relationship. Sometimes betrayal is something you can't help, and sometimes it's something you have to do to save someone else. Now, why this exploration leaves a certain lightness behind is something I cannot explain without spoiling the film. I will say, however, that the experience of the movie left me smiling, albeit wistfully, that I watched it more than once, and that I will watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so great, really</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atom Egoyan proves again and again that he knows how to shoot and pace a movie, but the man is dead on his feet directing actors. The luminous praise herein for this movie is a real mystery - unbelievable (and unnecessary) plot embellishments (a toothless rural gas station owner with a cell phone in 1996? in the middle of Nowheresville, Canada?) and actors left stranded in mid-anguished howl. When you can get a bad performance out of Ian Holm you've really accomplished something. And yet another showcase for wet-lipped, doe-eyed young girls to be dangled suggestively across the plot. I must say though, the actual incident around which the story revolves was handled beautifully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely overrated...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie is absolutely overrated. First thing: the director wants to transmit grief, so he shows us a lot of characters crying, or saying grave sentences. Instead of making us identify with the characters through drama, he forces them to "say" all the time how sad and shocked they are. I find also the script extremely weak. For example, there's no motivation for the acts of the lawyer, why is he there, why is he so interested. The montage with the tale of the Pied Piper is poor and pretentious... To make it short, I've probably seen this movie in a wrong way, because most of the people liked it so much and I found it boring, pretentious and poor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hyper drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard great things about this movie from people who usually exercise good sense. with that in mind, I kept giving the movie more tolerance than it ultimately deserves. Ian Holm was atrocious (if you thing that is blasphemy, blasphemy can be virtuous) with his either/or confusion of under acting and overacting. Why he felt compelled to be so over-dramatic is beyond me. Russel banks is a slave to pseudo intellectual stereotypes (see short story Sarah Cole) to a point that makes me understand hes just not really that bright or creative. Why did they have to make the Indian boy so angelic? Because he was pandering. And why did they have to force feed us that the hippies were not pot smokers? Atom Egoyan is a hack. I couldn't tolerate the hyper-folksy casualness of the community. Typical byproduct of overeducated outsider trying to flaunt his faux omniscience. And I have yet to mention how feebly he tried to tie tin the tale of the pied piper. the metaphor was ridiculously porous and assisted the woeful movie none whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A depressing tale of death and corruption.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this story to be noxious and morbid, showing the very worst aspects of human nature. If I want to be saddened, sickened and depressed about what our species has become, I'll pay 50c and buy a newspaper, I don't need to go to the theater and pay six bucks to spend two hours being dragged through the misery and moral decay of mankind. In my opinion, this movie isn't entertainment, or even a good didactic mirror of the contemptible behavior in which some people engage, it's two hours of mind-numbing torture. However, if one's idea of an enjoyment is watching a film about children dying, horribly, in a bus crash, followed rapidly by the appearance of leech-like, ambulance-chasing lawyers, resulting in the reduction of every moral and ethical principle to a monetarily-based bottom line, then this is the movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another weak Canadian drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was mostly angry with this film. The portrayal of the incestuous relationship between father and daughter was downright dishonest, a betrayal of what is now known and understood about the nature of abuse. Sarah Polley's character is initially seen as desirous of sexual contact with her father, with no hint of the disgust, fear and shame that such a person feels throughout these encounters. Somehow Egoyan seems to think that all he has to do is show her turning on her father late in the film and we'll all understand how wretched she really felt. Instead, she simply comes across as a manipulator, not as a young woman whose life has been virtually ruined.Small things irritated me. Why would bush hippies in the 1990's be wearing clothes from the 70's? Same thing with the interiors of homes where we understand that people are poor. And why would the daughter of Bruce Greenwood's single parent, working-class character have Shirley Temple curls? Did he spend half and hour every morning doing her hair perfectly while forgetting to shave, clean his clothes or put in his false tooth? The correct answer is, of course, that seeing an unbearably cute child die in a bus accident is worse than seeing an ordinary one lose her life. It's so Toronto to sneer at Hollywood, then steal its worst traits.There's an excruciatingly bad performance by one of the lesser roles in the film, which makes you wonder how Ian Holm coped. He must have mustered every possible resource as an actor to compensate for some of the cringe-worthy material and performances around him. We're supposed to despise his manipulation of the victims, to see him as a predator of some sort, yet we're relieved every time he appears because we see in him someone more alive than the dull characters by which he is surrounded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dull Hereafter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to laugh or else I'd cry ? and not because a bus full of school children died. I honestly can't imagine anyone being moved by this film. It is too distant to be involving, too vague to be meaningful, too slow to be engaging and too cold to be emotional. But boy, oh boy, is it funny.The dialogue is so odd and unnatural that it becomes comical. Note the stagy way in which the detective's daughter talks. `Welcome to hard times, DADDY', `I like it when you don't believe me DADDY.' Come on, playing a drug addict is easy ? just watch Courtney Love and imitate. Zoe doesn't sound drugged out but she must be because she always calls from a payphone where police sirens blast in the background. And Zoe comes off well in comparison to the unintentionally hilarious stroke victim and the Otto's who put their heads together, dry-eyed and sniffle, expecting us to believe that they are crying over their long lost son named, Bear, of all things.Bravo to the generic and lifeless Sarah Polley who musters a tiny ounce of oomph to deliver `the big lie' at the end ? you know, the one she said she would NEVER tell. She even attempts to glare at her father and later; if you look really close, it's the beginnings of a grin.How ridiculous is the scene where Ian Holm recounts a spider bite story that goes absolutely NOWHERE? Why doesn't he remember Alison's father? Why does he get stuck in a CAR WASH? What is wrong with this guy? And why is creepy Billy a saint for trying to convince Nicole's father not to sue? This anti-sue-happy town sure is unrealistic. Oh, they're Canadian. Thank explains it. Sure Ian Holm's acting is bad but does he really deserve the town's wrath for trying to gain a buck?There is a really cheesy time transition scene, which illustrates how confused director Atom Egoyan is. He thinks the audience needs to be hand held in order to comprehend the passing of time and yet he fails to explain anything else in this perplexing tale with similar clarity.Would people really behave the way these people do and what does it all mean anyway? Detective Stephens says that our children are all lost to us. The Pied Piper story echoes similar sentiments. Some school kids are dead while others grow up to become drug addicts and are as good as gone. One strange girl lives and because she tells a lie she is now, apparently, more pure than anyone else in town and well, that's it.It is always wise to heed the immortal words of Radiohead ? don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel. The Sweet Hereafter doesn't even have enough power to illicit the feelings that sentimentality requires. It is the worst kind of drivel -the kind that attempts to be profound, fails and stumbles into pretension, leaving nothing worthy of redemption in its wake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece? Or Turgid Nonsense?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film twice now, and had the same reaction both times, so it's not out of gut reaction that I label "The Sweet Hereafer" an odious piece of simple-minded garbage. The central idea (a school bus crash) has such intrinsic emotional repercussions that I can see how most viewers are washed away in grief enough to not notice the emptiness of the conceit built around it.As an intruding lawyer, Ian Holm is asked to give a performance of staggeringly self-conscious falseness in which his every word, movement and breath is meant to project "SOMETHING IMPORTANT". His episodic encounters with the people of the community in which the accident took place only reveals Egoyan's total condescension toward life's "little people", presenting them as simpletons who, gosh darn it, love their children and each other and turn their noses up at anything so disgusting as a dollar bill. In a failed attempt to make at least one character two-dimensional, a subplot is slopped on about the lawyer losing touch with his own child, the most ridiculous drug-addicted banshee every put on film.Toss in heavy-handed allegories, heart-tugging muzak and trite conclusions, and what have you got? An award-winning "masterpiece", to hear most people talk. More likely they woke up the next morning, remembered something about angelic children heading for their final bus ride, and forgot the manipulative banality of the rest.View the first episode of Krzysztof Kieslowski's 1988 "Decalogue", which covers similar thematic ground and, in 50 short minutes, accomplishes worlds more. 3 out of 10 for nice work by actors Bruce Greenwood and Sarah Polley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is innocence lost, but it isn't just the children who lose their innocence: it's the whole town and all the adults. Nicole (Sarah Polley) dreams of being a rock star, and her father lovingly fosters the dream. He does everything for her including being her first lover. And then there is a bus accident and she ends up in a wheel chair and is told she is lucky, since many of the other children died. But she doesn't feel lucky. She turns her bitterness toward her father. She has read Robert Browning's 'The Pied Piper of Hamelin' to two of the children who died, and now sees her father as a piper who has failed her. The love they had, now in the light of the loss of her innocence, is seen as a fraud. And she hates him.Meanwhile, big city lawyer Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holms) comes to town with the promise of getting a big settlement for the parents of the dead and injured children. He has an axe to grind and that axe is all that is left of his life. His sadness is a daughter who is a drug addict who calls him only for money. He can never say no, and she can never stop using him.Billy Ansell lost his wife to cancer and is left with two young children. He finds sexual gratification from another man's wife. When his children are killed he loses his love for her. The lie that Nicole finally tells to hurt her father is for him, and symbolizes her turning from her father outward to another man.Director Atom Egoyan seems to be saying that people stop loving one another sometimes with reason, and sometimes without; and that the sadness of life is a failure of love, that the brutality of life can kill our love. This is the tragedy of innocence lost, of our expulsion from the Garden of Eden, forcing us to see ourselves as naked and morally corrupt. The cold white mountain slopes that surround the little northern town remind us of how cold it is in the world away from childhood.I have always objected to 'the loss of innocence' as a falsification of who we are. We were never innocent: it only seems so in retrospect. It is not the fathers who corrupt their daughters nor the daughters who betray their fathers: it is rather the species mechanism that drives them apart, sometimes with such brutal force that all are hurt. Our expulsion from the Garden of Eden symbolizes our loss of ignorance, the growth of our neocortex, and our assumption of consciousness. Again we were never innocent: we just didn't know what the hell we were doing or why. Now we know, except we kid ourselves a lot.Sarah Polley's performance is so natural, vivid and balanced that I felt that I knew her as someone in my own life. The entire cast does a good job, especially Ian Holm. Atom Egoyan has a deft touch that is focused and realistic, never extreme. He doesn't preach to us and he works hard to be fair to his characters. Ultimately, he's a cinematic artist, and a good one.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>The Sweet Hereafter of Bogus Film Criticism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Sweet Hereafter' concerns the tragic effect of a school bus crash on the townspeople in a rural town. Many critics were afraid to judge the film on its own merits and placed it on a pedestal where they declared such a film "off limits" to any kind of real criticism. Unconsciously the subject matter affected their judgments. Here was a film about a very delicate subject--the death of innocent children. The characters in the film (parents of the deceased children) were all shattered. It was as if criticizing the film was akin to criticizing these parents as well as any parent who had experienced such a tragic loss. But from the point of view of effective drama, the film is virtually a complete failure. Very little of it rings true at all.Except for some very nice cinematography and an affecting musical score, 'The Sweet Hereafter' plods along at a snail's pace. The director's intent is to display the range of emotions these parents felt in the aftermath of losing their children. But what is so profound about focusing on such grief? The main character, a negligence lawyer, goes around the town convincing the parents to join in a class action lawsuit against the unspecified person or situation which caused the terrible accident. Most of the parents he sees agree to join the lawsuit (a lot of these scenes with the parents are drawn out and could have been easily condensed). The lawyer finally encounters one man who gives him a hard time. This is perhaps the most dramatic conflict that comes up during the film. But this one towns person's opposition to joining the lawsuit is completely vague. Why is he so against joining the lawsuit? Why is so angry at the lawyer? Because he feels the lawyer is profiting at the expense of the townspeople? Even so, is it really believable that he doesn't want to get to the bottom of what happened as opposed to simply dropping the whole case? The ending of the film is even more unbelievable. The negligence lawyer never seems to have a definitive plan to try the case. He alludes to various factors that caused the accident, such as a faulty guard rail or a defective bolt inside the bus. A real negligence lawyer would never have taken such a huge case in the first place without feeling that he could be successful. It almost seems like he thinks that he uncover the 'truth' during the discovery process. A real lawyer would have already had some tangible evidence (already uncovered) that would have convinced him to go forward. Furthermore, when the young survivor lies in her deposition, stating that the bus driver was driving too fast, the seemingly smart lawyer folds up like a deck of cards and decides not to cross-examine her. A real lawyer could have made mince-meat of her but he chooses to quit the case and leave all his clients in the lurch. In real life he probably would have been hauled in front of an ethics board. And why does the young survivor decide to lie in the end? Why does she lie knowing that she is accusing the innocent bus driver? Why does she want to case to 'go away'? Is it that she's so traumatized by the accident that she simply wants to forget about it? Everything is left so open and vague in this film that we never understand any of the characters' motivations. Lastly, there's a lot of lame talk (mostly over the phone) between the lawyer and his drug-addicted, rebellious daughter. Seemingly there's supposed to be some kind of parallel between the lawyer's personal angst and the angst of the townspeople (this is the lawyer's defense when that one townspeople berates him before the climactic deposition scene). All this conflict between the lawyer and the daughter is gratuitous and simply does not work cinematically. We hardly ever see those two characters together and their conflict is basically a separate story which has no real place in this film. The Sweet Hereafter basically lacks substance. It congratulates itself for displaying the raw emotion of grief but lacks a central antagonist to engage us. An examination of grief in itself is not enough to sustain an entire story. Whenever conflicts do arise in this film, they are episodic, unclearly motivated and for the most part, lacking the ring of truth. If you're strictly into atmosphere and mood, this is the film for you. But if you're looking for a strong story arc with convincing conflicts, you will not find it in 'The Sweet Hereafter'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Green-Eyed Monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why would the loss of a small town's children to a school bus accident estrange neighbors and dilute a community's integrity? That is the concept behind this story in which Ian Holm plays an out-of-town lawyer wishing to bring a class-action lawsuit on the town's behalf. This film goes through a few flashbacks and flashforwards as Holm interviews residents and cajoles them into retaining his services. He wants to make someone pay for the great injustice committed in the death of the town's children. But there is no money in blaming the bus driver.The irony in this is that while the town has lost their children, Holm is losing his daughter. He seems full of nothing but rancor and bitterness after years of being called up by her for money. Her drug habits leave him suspicious and distrusting. And too many years of just going after a cash prize have left him insensitive to life. Unfortunately, these small-town folk aren't wise to the lawyer's deceit and own corruption as he gathers followers to lead his charge. You'll find the director employs a wonderful Pied Piper story to go along with this. And as to the children, there was a survivor to represent them as well, albeit her interests are muted by that of her parents and the rest of the town, who, as if they has sold their souls, have their green eyes set on riches instead of mourning.Excellent portrayal of a small-town community and how a tragedy transformed them for the worse. Riddled with ironies. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quiet film that explores loss and illusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Spoilers-While watching `The Sweet Hereafter', a film about a small town in Canada that suffers the loss of most of its children after a fatal school bus accident, I could not get over a profound feeling of dread. From the beginning, we find out what happened to the town, but it isn't until about halfway into the movie (or perhaps more) that we actually see the accident happen. When we do see that accident, despite already knowing the details, it is absolutely horrifying to witness. The film is shot in a non-linear style, but we jump from the different time frames very coherently, due to the excellent direction of Atom Egoyan.Ian Holm plays an attorney who goes to the town shortly after the accident to persuade the grieving families to file suit against the bus company (despite the fact there may not be a cause). While the town seems tiny and fairly idyllic, with an interesting cast of characters, it becomes quickly obvious that perceptions are completely different from the reality. Adultery, child molestation, these are secrets the audience learns; yet the rest of the town remain blissfully unaware.One recurring theme that runs throughout the film is the comparison of the accident to the children's story, `The Pied Piper of Haemlin', a theme that gets creepier as the film goes on until I literally had chills running down my spine. `The Sweet Hereafter' is a fairly simple, beautifully filmed and quiet movie that stayed with me for several days after its initial viewing. Being so used to traditional films that are produced that lay everything out with a neat beginning and conclusion, it was refreshing to watch a film that gnawed at me for a while, and force me to analyze what I saw and what I may not have seen. I recommend this film to anyone who doesn't expect tidy results from their cinema experience, and who perhaps look for a `little more' in their films than Hollywood generally gives them.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>thoughts on the sweet hereafter...the shots were beautiful, and most of the acting was skilled. however, the cuts drove me crazy. some of the elements were tied together well... at the beginning, you see an aspiring folk singer with a double-headed piece of art behind her. later in the film, you meet the character who produced that painting. little details like that are important. however, some of the editing was so off that the film was hard to follow. it was adapted from a novel which flips back and forth between flashbacks and present time.. but their way of adapting that to film was very confusing.they tried to make the transitions smoother by showing dates and times in the background of some of the shot.. (calendars on the walls, tv broadcasts, etc..) but it was done subtly, and wasn't present in all the flashback scenes. additional characters were invented in the film for the main character to talk to in order to explain some of the background history.. but they came in at weird times and their conversations seemed unnatural. at one point, the main character gets into a discussion with one of these "plot moving" characters (a childhood friend of his daughter). in order to make it plausible, he doesn't remember her and she has to go into detail about who she is and her connection to his daughter. it just comes off oddly - it makes him seem like he has altzheimer's or mental problems.i liked the complexity of the plot - no attempt to "dumb down" real issues was made.. nothing tied up neat &amp; tidy with a bow... but neither were main plot points explained clearly. i like seeing films again and watching the director's dvd commentary if i enjoyed them.. but you shouldn't *have* to do that to understand the main elements. there was even one point where the director said "i'm not really sure what this scene has to do with this movie. i'm not sure how true it is to who the character was. it reminded me of a scene from one of my other films, exotica. but i really like the scene all the same."that's cool and all, but think of your poor confused viewers! (said in a 'think of the children' voice =P)on the other hand, i was really tired and falling in and out of sleep when i watched it the first time, so i'm sure that didn't help. ;)the ending of the film also irked me.. *SPOILER AHEAD* one of the main characters lied, causing the court cases to be dismissed, and the film then ended. however, there would have been attempts made to verify the truth of her statement before the case ended.. there were technical tests performed on the bus and they can tell from the skid marks, etc. what speed the accident occured at. it seemed like they just wanted to get the film over with, so they picked a quick way to end it.. but it didn't make any sense. plot holes drive me crazy.. it wasn't bad, though. i'd much rather be confused than bored. heh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex and moving Canadian feature; best Egoyan effort to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit that I haven't been too impressed with Atom Egoyan cinema in the past. I just cannot understand why he doesn't give us a story without too many frills or excessive symbolism. Here, he tells a compelling and deeply moving story about grief, parenthood, death, and learning to live after tragedy. "The Sweet Hereafter" reminded me a lot of "Fargo" with its "ice-cap" cinematography and its eerie realism. Egoyan's film, however, is much more serious and absent in comedic relief. Ian Holm gives a powerful performance as a lawyer who hopes to offer relief to residents of a small Canadian town after many of their children are killed in a tragic bus accident. He promises to ask for no money until the case is won and those who are responsible pay for their suffering. Sarah Polley, known here in Canada for her recurring role on "Road to Avonlea," plays one of the few survivors of the crash, wanting to forget what happened and is therefore not too excited about the lawsuit. Holm also has personal reasons for wanting to defend the families, since his daughter, Zoe, is a desperate drug addict on the run. I'm truly glad that Ian Holm has finally gotten the opportunity to have a leading role in a film such as this. His acting is incomparable, subtle but affecting. I love how Egoyan is able to give us so much emotion and power in his direction, but also does not give us a great deal of info without confusing us. The film's events do jump around a bit, but there is a reason for it, which I wouldn't dare reveal. The best thing about "The Sweet Hereafter" is it knows its an art film, but restrains itself in its symbolism. It gives us a hard-cutting point, and gives it to us without faltering. The power of visual and contextual material combine to form a fascinating and thought-provoking film. Egoyan has finally found his niche. Rating: Three stars and a half.</fullReview>

Most Hollywood movies would have given you an inside shot with lots of screaming, blood, crashes and explosions. The third-person perspective and the quiet, yet dramatic, ending really affected me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very strange drama, the film has a few interesting questions about responsibility and Ian Holm and Sarah Polley do superb work with intriguing characters, however it is not a film that is likely to satisfy every taste. The ideas and performances are all undermined by the narrative structure - it juggles three (or more) different story lines, with different time periods each, all at once, which achieves no effect other than to make it harder to follow. The film also fails to resolve everything by the end. It finishes in a too open-ended manner in which it is hard to know what to feel at all, and some aspects (such as the mental condition of the protagonist) are never sufficiently explained. The film has quite a glowing reputation, and it certainly has the markings of a great film - wonderful camera movement, appropriately bleak setting, stellar cast, etc.. It is just a bit too awkward to be a film that could satisfy all tastes. Sure, it is worth checking out, but I would advise carefully before recommending it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a work of cinematic art with its haunting images bereft of color and movement. Having read the book prior to seeing the movie I was not expecting to be so taken aback, but this film will suck you in. From the first note, the despondency of the small town is evident and it will not get much better, because, unlike many Hollywood studios, director Atom Egoyan will not stray from the book to create a "happy" ending. Egoyan cements his reputation as a world class film-maker here with his desolate landscapes devoid of hope. Not a pretty film, but perhaps its very desperation, is what makes it so wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This resonant mood piece is close to perfect. People complaining about it being to slow should go watch 'Armageddon' and leave good film to people who can appreciate it. The nonlinear storytelling isn't a gimmick here but entirely apropos. The primary theme is the need for narrative in people's lives and how elusive and hopeless the attempt to impose an artificial sense of causality to something that defies such impositions (trying to find a reason for an accident) can be. This is a wondrously rare case of style and substance blending luminously well. The final test for all great Art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all this: there is no such thing as an easy Atom Egoyan movie. As was this one.The Sweet Hereafter handles the topic of loss, grief and consolation in such a delicate way that it almost hurts to watch a movie like this. The viewer is almost afraid to break the characters by watching them. In this story a lawyer (Ian Holm) goes to a little town where a schoolbus has had an accident in which all the children perish except for one child and the driver. He tries to convince the people in the town that they should take action to get what they owe somebody for the loss of their children. By taking this course the lawyer only arouses more problems for the parents who in fact only want to be alone with their grief and get over it not in a monetary way. The surviving girl thinks the same way, and in the end she is the one who thwarts the lawyer's plans and everybody can get on with their lives. During all this a problem in Holm's life comes back to haunt him, his daughter. She is a drug addict, and lives on the street, whether this is his fault or her fault is for the viewer to determine.The Sweet Hereafter was expertly written on three different levels. First what happened with the schoolbus on that fateful morning. Second Ian Holm trying to convince the parents that they should sue whoever is responsible and the problems that that arouses. Third there is the aftermath of this "adventure" the main character lives through. He meets an old schoolfriend of his daughter and is confronted with the fact that he might be the source of all his daughter's problems.These three timelines could have probably been filmed and printed in a chronological fashion, but Egoyan chose to interweave these lines and let the viewer figure out for himself what happens when and where. This is very dangerous way of editing a story, it has been before but it still isn't accepted. People who view this movie might be put off by the fact that it isn't the straightforward way of telling a story. But that is the only small problem I could find. I thought it was very skillful and beautifully executed.The acting was absolutely superb. Especially Sarah Polley, who plays the one surviving kid on the bus, who delivers a powerhouse performance. She is the calm of the town and just wants to get on with her life and not constantly be reminded of what happened earlier. She deals with her problems in the most basic way there is, just tell the truth. Ian Holm had the privilege to play a character so torn between his job and his private life. The way he talks into the parents of the victims is downright evil (as all lawyers are, I think) and trying to bribe Sarah Polley with a new computer stinks. But on the other hand he is so heartfelt troubled about what happens with his daughter that in the end he must try to find a way to get through the day. Not an easy task.This is a movie for the ages, although not entirely worthy of a 10. If I could award a 9.999999999999 to a movie, I would.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has so much atmosphere, I actually felt like I was in this small town reliving the tragedy with the survivng parents. Atom Egoyan has made one of the most perfect films I have ever seen. The style he uses for his direction is one of distance and mood. Egoyan sets the tempo right from the opening shots and it never lets up. Ian Holm plays his role in a very understated manner, but brings passion to the role as well. The music to this film, by Mychael Danna, is very atmospheric and haunting. This is as close as I have ever seen a director get to a Kubrickian film. Sarah Polley is also very good in her role, the film also has some twists I wasn't expecting at all. This is an absolutely great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film ever. So there :op</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, I love this film so, as a brief warning, I'm bound to accidently say something that might spoil the plot.I think Ian Holm is probably England's most underrated actor, so I stayed up to watch this film on tv at 1am purely on the basis that he was in it. Whether it was the film or me being tired, I don't know, but the images on the screen really hypnotised me: snowy vistas, log cabins, even a car wash. Sarah Polley is absolutely superb; indeed the cast as a whole is faultless. Atom Egoyan's direction is subtle but well played, and Ian Holm as Mitchel Stephens is one of the best characterisations of all time: a creeping, crawling lawyer, trying to maintain his outward appearance of solid, intelligent dependability while inwardly being torn apart by the downfall of his family life.I cannot praise this film enough, and I admit that maybe you need to be in the right mood to enjoy it, but I find it's like one of those songs you truly love: even if your house were on fire you'd stay to hear the end of it, and the same is true of this film. It is pitch perfect, with every note in exactly the right place.</fullReview>

I have read the novel by Russel Banks so maybe I'm biased, but the book just blows the film away. It contains a much better ending which was eliminated from the film for one thing. One thing Egoyan added in the film which I also did not like was that the relationship between Nichole and her father appears to be consensual, where in the book it was not. I also think moving the film from Upstate NY to Canada took away much of its personality. For one thing, Billy Ansel is no longer a Vietnam vet and his character is truly cutback a great deal. I admit its hard to be objective after reading the novel first, but I just can't say much for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, it reels in the viewer with the powerful emotion of the bus tragedy. Fine. Then, the grief and loss of the myriad of characters in their individual ways is shown. Fine. The characters are shown to have individual problems and idiosyncrasies. OK. AND THEN THAT IS IT. One character ends the movie with a flimsy lie (and provides a convenient closure to her emotional arc). The movie goes nowhere (many characters introduced, their psyche minimally examined and then boom, movie over) and has no purpose. The pretension and pride of the film is its examination of guilt. AND THAT IS IT. It just feels like a student filmmaker's excercise: 'look at me! look at my art!'. Unfinished, static, pretentions of depth, emotion, complexity.I'm angry that two hours of my life got robbed from me by watching this movie. Another viewer summed up this movie aptly and succinctly by describing it as having a 'veneer of depth'. I don't mind watching mediocre movies but it bothers me when the film thinks it is better than it really is and this films acts thus: it preens and fawns over each of its' scenes with its trite lines and grating flute music. The conceit of examining loss and grief is interesting but stretching it over two hours and going nowhere defeats whatever virtue it began with by dwelling in mediocrity and self-percieved depth.it began promisingly and then went nowhere. After watching this, I found myself wishing I were inside the schoolbus with the kids and gone over the railing with them. For those who suggested that anyone who doesn't enjoy this film because they are used to fast MTV-style movies and can't appreciate 'depth', I say that I feel sorry for people who are easily convinced a movie is art simply because of slow pacing, jarring music, unorthodox editing. Simply having a tragic subject/event does NOT = a good, substantial or 'deep' film.The kid playing 'Bear' was adorable but the film otherwise ..OVERRATED</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My lawyer. Why do I need a lawyer?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In most movies the use of nonlinear narrative is a gimmick. I can think of a few exceptions, like Pulp Fiction and Memento, where it feels elegant and organic; Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter is one of them.Although structure is complex, the premise is simple: a horrific tragedy shakes a small town when the school bus falls into a lake, killing fourteen children. City lawyer Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm) attempts to persuade the victims' families to file a class action; a key witness is fifteen-years-old survivor Nicole (Sarah Polley), paraplegic after the crash.Napoleon, Hobbit, android - you name the part, Holm can play it; this is my favorite performance of his. Stephens, a veteran ambulance chaser, pursues the case because he smells money, but he is also haunted by his own personal tragedy, a drug addict daughter spiraling into self-destruction. When he tells grieving father Ansel (Bruce Greenwood) "Something's happening that's taking our children away", he is not entirely sincere, but it's not completely a pose either.Polley is fine in the tricky role of Nicole, which runs the whole gamut of emotions from exploited frailty to calculating revenge.Thematically, the movie references the tale of the Pied Piper, which Nicole reads to the twins. There are multiple Piper-like figures: Dolores, the driver who literally leads the children to their doom (the long shot of the bus plunging into the frozen lake is uncanny); Stephens, who emotionally manipulates the families into a legal action; and the truly loathsome one, Nicole's incestuous father. Ansel is the foil to three Pipers (he impotently witnesses the accident, opposes the legal action and represents a positive father figure); Nicole is the "lame child" left behind, whose final choice marks her passage from passive victim to active agent.8,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sweet Hereafter-1997: Where time and grief just don't exist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a simple story ? simple in the sense described in the Storyline on the IMDb main page. But, it's from Russell Banks's novel that Atom Egoyan has written and directed one of the most complex plots ever put to film. For those interested, you'll find a complete analysis of this film's structure in Screen writing Updated by Linda Aronson, published in 2000. Incidentally, Russell Banks played the part of Dr Robeson.Avoiding the usual type of visual cues, Egoyan shows only two dates on screen to help orient the viewer to the time shifts (there are multiple shifts); instead, most are managed and revealed through the context of the scene and dialog. Which means the viewer must listen and watch carefully to stay on track. Some viewers might be annoyed.Adding to the complexity is the presentation of five different stories in the 112 minutes running time: the accident, the intrusive lawyer Mitchell (Ian Holm) and his daughter, Zoe (Caerthan Banks), the overly-motherly bus driver Dolores (Gabrielle Rose), the sex affair between Billy (Bruce Greenwood) and Risa (Alberta Watson) and, of course, the illicit and incestuous situation between Nicole (Sarah Polley) and her father, Sam (Tom McCamus).It takes a master film-maker to put all that together and achieve a work of art. On that basis, all serious film lovers should not miss this event, even if the story is unpalatable for many. Life, however, is full of such stories: read the daily tabloids.Ian Holm is the focus and catalyst of this narrative, for two reasons: first, he is, to some extent, the typical (or not so-typical) "ambulance chaser" after a buck, or too many; hence, much of the action involves his presence. Second, he is also after justice for the dead and lost children, spurred on because he lost Zoe to drugs, alcohol, AIDS etc ? so she is effectively dead to him also. By trying to help the town folk in their loss, he hopes to achieve some sense of closure for his own loss ? in other words, a self-serving attitude, much like the world in general.I think Holm gives the performance of his life in this film.For me, the greatest pleasure was listening to the voice-over of The Pied Piper of Hamelin, the narration of which is spoken by Nicole throughout the film. That poem serves to function as a metaphor of course for the fate that awaits her and her father: loneliness, sadness and despair in a cruel and indifferent world, while all the deceased children have moved on to the sweet hereafter.Not to be missed.November 27, 2011.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on Russell Banks's novel, "The Sweet Hereafter" focuses on the devastating effects on a Canadian town following a school bus crash that kills most of the children, and especially how it affects lawyer Mitchell Stephens's (Ian Holm) relationship with his family. Without a doubt, this is not an easy movie to watch - think "Schindler's List" - but Atom Egoyan knows how to set everything up perfectly. Not only does it wrench the viewer to see what happens to the children, but it's equally unpleasant to see Mitchell's life.Egoyan later depicted a gut-wrenching story in "Ararat", about the Armenian Genocide. Both movies are definitely hard to watch, but I wholeheartedly recommend both.Also starring Sarah Polley, Maury Chaykin and Bruce Greenwood (John Kennedy in "Thirteen Days").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no denying that "The Sweet Hereafter" is a deeply sad movie, but there's something a bit too overly formal and constricted about it that prevents it from being the devastating film it might have been if director Atom Egoyan had allowed it to breathe a little more.Ian Holm plays an attorney who coerces the residents of a small town to sue when a bus accident takes the lives of many of their young children. The film investigates an interesting topic: human beings' desperate refusal to believe that sometimes bad things just happen by accident and that there's not always someone or something to blame. But though the film is inspired by true events, it never feels like anything other than it is, which is a fictional creation full of actors playing roles.

		<shortDescription>A gem of Canadian film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This must be considered one of Canada's greatest movies. The story is so pure, that one can't help but be touched if you approach this film with an open mind. Russell Banks' novel was apparently set in New England, but director Atom Egoyan has moved it to Britich Columbia, and quite appropriately too, because the Rocky Mountain landscape is far more majestic. It is an ordinary day in winter day for a small rural community, until a school bus accident results in the deaths of a couple dozen kids, and the tragedy comes down on their parents like (for lack of a better phrase) a hammer. When such a tragedy happens to people, they look for scapegoats and explanations, but cannot accept that sometimes accidents happen. Atom Egoyan is known for deliberately making his characters strange and hard to interpret, but this movie does a brilliant job of showing us exactly what these people go through, and seeing it in ourselves.Hard work is required of the actors to make the story convincing, and the acting is superb. Most of the cast is Canadian except for Ian Holm who delivers a brilliant performance as a city lawyer who tries to get the mourning community involved in a lawsuit against the one responsible for this tragedy. He too has lost a child (his daughter is HIV positive) and cannot accept that sometimes accidents happen in life.Atom Egoyan is at his best with this one. The Sweet Hereafter is worthy to be a symbol of national pride in the Canadian film industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting and subtle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attempting to write about "The Sweet Hereafter" has resulted in dissatisfaction over and over again, even though a vast number of my IMDb comments are hardly great pieces of writing, they do get my thoughts across well enough. With certain favorites of mine, others include "Vertigo" and "Mulholland Dr." and before I got a good piece written on it "Rushmore", I find it exceptionally hard to cover everything. So I'll simply make some short comments in the form of a 'capsule review': Atom Egoyan's 1997 masterpiece still packs quite the emotional punch after five viewings. Egoyan's film is up there with Paul Schrader's "Affliction" (also adapted from a Russell Banks novel) and David Gordon Green's "Snow Angels" in the Small-Town Midwinter Tragedy subgenre, but beats those thanks to its remarkable dramatic subtlety. Every character is established quickly and has a satisfying arc, everyone plays an important part in the story, and the film has one of the all-time great endings, as well as terrific use of music, particularly both Sarah Polley's and The Tragically Hip's original version of "Courage (For Hugh MacLennan)". Like many of Egoyan's films this can be called deceptively simple, as there is a lot of complexity to this story and to the characters' actions, but one could watch it inattentively and see it as just another simple drama. The acting's superb from pretty much everyone, with Ian Holm, Polley, and Bruce Greenwood standing out. Egoyan is a terrific visual storyteller and overall the film has a rare sort of elegance, and has a strange ability to stay in your head after you watch it, keep you thinking about it and the emotions involved. Great, great film.</fullReview>

There is adultery and incest, just like everywhere else, and this affects the outcome in ways that are surprising.Sarah Polley was the most interesting actor in the film and she really brought home something I have always believed.

		<shortDescription>Great Canadian cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently bought this movie for $3 at a local video store that apparently couldn't rent this movie out any more. In a way, it's unfortunate that no one wanted to see it. The Sweet Hereafter is a great drama about a small town that loses some of its children in a bus accident, and a lawyer arrives from out of town looking for someone responsible. In a way, it's odd that we see him going so far in launching a law suit while still having no proof that someone was negligent; that may have been the point though.Ian Holm puts forth an excellent performance as the lawyer, a man who is also struggling with a daughter who's a drug addict; at one point Holm tells us a dramatic story about how he once nearly lost his daughter to a spider bite. As a person studying law, I find it interesting how Holm's story examines how law can be both noble and damaging. Sarah Polley, one of Canada's greatest actresses, also delivers an amazing performance. And, as a girl who wants to be a singer, Polley performs some songs which make for a good soundtrack; the cover of Courage by The Tragically Hip makes the song an artsy, sad tune. I think the only flaw in acting comes from the lawyer's daughter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sweet Hereafter is a competently made drama dealing with human loss and coping. It has good performances from pretty much the entire cast, good direction, writing, and interesting locations. It simultaneously looks at the life of the lead character as a failed father while showing his work (spoiler) as a manipulative ambulance chaser. His character is obviously deflated, and you feel some sympathy for him despite his claims. Ian Holm is melancholy, distressed, but effectively veils his moods to his small townmember clients. There are several supporting characters, some more well done than others, and the requisite bullyish insider - more to create conflict it seemed. I especially liked the bus-driver played by Gabrielle Rose. The small town/ big city tension is there throughout the whole movie and meant to be - how characters react to outsiders, and how they deal with loss and sorrow. The resolution may be anticlimactic but definitely is appropriate for the story. (Spoiler) One Glaring question - if the bus driver was observed (even if falsely) to be incompetent or at fault, how did she wind up getting another job as a driver later? Pretty good somber drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a satisfying movie this is. A small snowy town in the Canadian north is struck by a tragedy. A big-city lawyer (Ian Holm) visits the place shortly after a school bus trundles off an icy highway and drowns most of the kids aboard. Holm wants to sue somebody -- passionately, angrily. In the course of interviewing victims or surviving relatives he seems to disrupt the comfortable configuration of relationships that has kept the community rolling smoothly along its undistinguished path.Now, this, I know, suggests a film with a villain -- the lawyer. (Lawyers are always good heavies.) His avaricious entreaties turn the peaceful, god-fearing sons of the soil against one another. There are bitter arguments. Some of the parents are eager to get the money -- the ugly parents, the ones with beards and scars and tattoos and cigarettes. The better-looking parents oppose the law suit. Finally the lawyer is tarred, feathered, and ridden out of town on the rail -- scowling and shouting curses.But not at all. Maybe that's how it would turn out in a dumb Hollywood movie but not here. The lawyer is angry, yes, and he tries to rouse the anger of the community, but not for their benefit but for his own emotional payoff. His young, estranged daughter is a junkie and only seems to call him with lies, begging for cash. If he can mobilize the community, channel their grief into anger, it will help justify his conviction that "they're taking our children away from us." This is a film with a lot of layers and there isn't enough space to get into them to any extent. I'll just mention in passing that one of the surviving school kids (Sarah Polley), now bound to a wheelchair, is shown from time to time reading "The Pied Piper of Hamlin" to two sleepy kids, a story that seems to wrap up in fairy-tale form the tragic accident that deprived the town of its kids.I'll mention too that the town about which one resident says, "We used to be a community," is largely mythical in the sense he means it. Some "community." There is hidden bigotry, "They're Indians. I guess you'd call them . . . hippies." There's an adulterous couple rolling around in a motel bed like two macaques in heat. There is incest, with the father banging his cute teen-aged daughter in a barn surrounded by candles. This, however, is not the "community" that the residents finally decide to preserve. It's the myth of that community that's important. The road to satisfaction (or our very sanity) lies partly in being blind to certain things.And the tragedy of the bus sinking beneath the ice of the frozen lake? In a standard typical Hollywood film it would be saved and used as a grisly climax with tight shots of children screaming and underwater shots of their flailing around and glub blub noises on the sound track. Here we don't even find out what the events WAS until the movie is half over, and we don't see it until half an hour later, and then only in long shot.The lawyer is intent on pinning the blame on somebody, but the bus, driven by a caring, responsible, and experienced woman has traveled the same route for 15 years before hitting a sheet of ice that carries it off the country road. On which "somebody" does the blame lie? Well -- without getting into theology -- is rests on nobody. If you walk into a cybercafe, say, and sit down and find the keyboard is too high for you, is it your "fault" because you're short? No. Is it the keyboard's "fault" for being too high? Nope again. It's known as a "dysfunction" and if you can't fix it you have to eat it.The editor must have worked hard on putting this jigsaw puzzle together. There are so many intercuts that you can't be sure whether you're dealing with flashbacks or flashforwards. Not to fault the editing though. It's often strangely apt. A helicopter shot follows the school bus on its winding way then slowly drifts upward into an empty crystalline blue sky with a few wisps of cloud. Cut to the lawyer chatting with another passenger on an airplane back to his big-city home.The performances are first-rate all the way through, with Sarah Polley particularly memorable. She's radiantly beautiful, of course, but we can't hold that against her. (Half the people in Hollywood are outrageously gorgeous.) She has a little-girl voice that sounds untrained but she makes the most of it, as she does of her minimalized facial expressions. A viewer's first thought is that, "This is it. This is all she's got. She's playing herself." That would be a mistake. She was quite a different character, a mad repressed wife, in "The Weight of Water", and still another character, totally generic, in some dumb remake of a slasher movie.When I first saw this some years ago, I figured one viewing would be enough. But then I just watched it again and couldn't let go because I was able to pick up things that I'd missed first time around.If you have the patience required to watch this, your patience will probably be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard of this film, i heard that it would be moving and poignant without being manipulative or overtly sentimental. Sounds like my kind of movie. After viewing it, I place it in my top ten movies list. The acting is great, which is a necessity in a movie like this, and the direction is flawless. There are scenes of great emotional power, specifically Ian Holm's account of his daughter's spider bite incident. In this scene we see a man who saved his daughter once, and is losing her now. The negligence suit is simply a way of channeling his anger. Grief is a life-changing thing, and this movie shows this without making us feel like we were forced to be sad. The situation simply is sad. This movie will leave you speechless and thinking. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie ranks as possibly one of the most emotionally devastating films ever created. If you are simply looking for pure entertainment you will hate this movie because it is deep, beautiful, disturbing and complex. I saw it in the theater when it first came out and was literally weak when it ended. I have since closely examined this film many times as I think it is exquisitely crafted and genuine in it's execution. There are scenes of such powerful emotional intensity that you actually feel intrusive watching them unfold. The only fault, if that can be said, is that this film is unrelenting in it's starkly honest portrayal of the darkest corners of the human heart and the bitterness with which some people endure life. If there wasn't truth about the human condition movies like this wouldn't be as powerful as they are.I also applaud Atom Egoyan for not using Russell Banks ending from the book. Though I enjoyed the book as well and the movie is generally VERY faithful, I felt the ending of the book much to conciliatory and applaud Egoyan's courage for not taking the easy route.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A tragedy changes the lives of a small Canadian town when a school bus full of children plummets into a lake, leaving only the driver and Nicole(Sarah Polley), a teenager alive. Mitchell Stephens(Ian Holm) descends onto the town to rally the bereaved parents to file a suit against the school district and bus manufacturer while dealing with the tragedy in his own life. As Mitchell digs, the pure(as newly fallen snow)image of the small town is blanketed with the soot of deception, abuse, and infidelity, as is Mitchell himself. Atom Egoyan's directing skill is in its prime here, using a few classic shots and incorporating a few new ones. Ingeniously, the story of the aftermath of the accident is intertwined with the poem "The Pied Piper of Hamelin" by Robert Browning, which is used as a plot point and as a topic of discussion. Who is the piper? What did he(she) take away? Who did he(she) free? There are no easy answers, which is as it should be. As the trailer states, "The truth is only the beginning." Highly reccomended film with an intelligent script, excellent direction, perfect pacing, great "Early music" score by Mychael Danna, and powerful performances by Ian Holm, Sarah Polley, and Bruce Greenwood(Billy Ansel). The DVD includes a great commentary by Egoyan and the author of the original novel, Russell Banks, as well as two trailers, Q&amp;A with the cast, two documentaries, and the complete Robert Browning poem as an "ebook" extra. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sweet Hereafter draws several analogies to the Pied Piper of Hamelin, including one reverse parallel of a lawyer visiting a tragedy stricken town: Your kids have been taken from you, you deserve retribution, so now let's go after the rats. Ian Holm (the lawyer) and Sarah Polley (a kid left behind) provide great acting in this beautifully intriguing film, but there are a few dumb lines and one poorly conceived scene, the candles in the hayloft episode, which could have been easily left out or replaced with more subtle suggestion. Otherwise, this is a strong movie and I look forward to seeing more from Atom Egoyan.</fullReview>

The haunting music decorates still shots that are worthy of framing. Told as a fine novel, the movie wends its way through relationships, arriving at the "accident" only half way through the story, highlighting the centrality of the characters, each one redeemably tragic.</fullReview>

The time structure of circling the accident, portraying it and then the aftermath was wonderfully clear and cohesive.

		<shortDescription>"Exotica" and "The Sweet Hereafter"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a review of "The Sweet Hereafter" and "Exotica", two films by Atom Egoyan, both of which deal with tragedy and loss and both of which feature the same actors in similar roles.Like most of his films, Egoyan's "The Sweet Hereafter" is structured as a jigsaw possible assembled around a single traumatic event. As the film unfolds, and the cast's relationship to the central event grows in clarity, some moment of revelation is achieved. Virtually all of Egoyan's films adopt this narrative structure, which seems to blend a modernist search for truth with a decidedly postmodern admittance that truth requires the careful sorting of both vantage points and testimonials.The traumatic event in this case is an accident involving a school bus. The bus skids off a road and veers onto a frozen lake. The ice breaks, the bus sinks and 14 children die. Of course, everyone in the town then suffers the knock-on effect of this accident.Man, you might say, is a creature constantly in search of meaning (the brain itself is a pattern recognition machine). He creates myths, patterns and rhymes, trying desperately to assert some measure of order. He cannot accept the chaotic cruelty of the universe, preferring instead to create comfortable rituals and routines in the hope of insulating himself from pain.When the unexpected does occur, man lifts his head and cries "Why?". But God never answers. Into this vacuum steps Ian Holm, who in "The Sweet Hereafter" plays a lawyer trying desperately to assign meaning to the film's central bus crash. He wants the parents of the dead children to band together and file a law suit. A law suit against who? The guilty bus driver? Nope, the driver is broke. He wants to go after the company that made the bus. He wants to sue them for millions. It is their fault. Alone.At first Ian Holm comes across as a greedy pig. Here is a man milking suffering for money. But gradually we learn that he is himself a man intimately familiar with loss. His life has been one of misery, and the film is peppered with flashbacks detailing his relationship with his daughter, a drug addict who is dying of AIDS. Like the parents whom he hopes to represent, this lawyer is looking for the meaning of his own suffering. "Why me?" he cries. Lashing out against others and assigning blame is the only way he can rationalise things.Similarly, the small town in which the accident occurs seems at first to be a picturesque postcard village. But gradually this image is shattered, as promiscuity, infidelity, alcoholism and sexual abuse all raise their heads. Director Atom Egoyan, an outspoken fan of "The Shining", even uses the famous "Horse and Train" picture from Kubrick's film, a recognition that both films deal subliminally with the same buried, almost invisible horrors.On top of all this, Egoyan adds a layer of myth. He has one of the film's children narrate Robert Browning's "The Pied Piper of Hamelin". In a self referential moment, the child asks "Who took the children? Who was the piper? Why did the fabled portal in the mountain (the breaking ice) open up and swallow the kids?"In this way, Egoyan approaches his central the tragedy from at least 3 angles. Firstly, as a fateful moment of chance, secondly, as a mythical act of God (God smites the parent's for their sins) and thirdly as an event exploited by a vengeful pilgrim of pain. All three approaches seek to lay blame, targeting either the failures of parents, the actions of a punishing god or the laws of a wholly arbitrary cosmos."The Sweet Hereafter" is a very hopeless film, man never able to grasp absolute clarity (which of my behaviours, if any, caused this?). But there's also something very hopeful about Egoyan's ending. The sweet hereafter of the title is that zone of wisdom (found by the child who narrates the Piped Piper) where we ultimately come to accept the unacceptable and go on living.Similar in structure, Egoyan's "Exotica" approaches the same themes from a different angle. A man (Francis) loses his wife and daughter in a car crash. To cope with the pain he hires a young girl to come over to his house every day and babysit the daughter he lost. This babysitter simply plays a piano and lurks about his empty house, after which the bereaved father drives her home and pays her for babysitting nothingness. This ritual helps Francis assuage his pain. Every night Francis also visits a strip-club called "Exotica". There he watches a young woman (Christina), dressed in a schoolgirl's outfit, strip. But their relationship is an odd one. They seem to have a strange history. When she dances for him, it has nothing to do with sex and more to do with longing and loss. Of course both Francis and the stripper have a secret which is incrementally revealed, the truth peeled back like a stripper's clothes, leading to that revelatory final payoff that is typical of Egoyan's work. I won't spoil that moment. Suffice to say that this movie takes us into fairly interesting places. For Egoyan, man seems to live a life of cyclical substitution (we grow or are pushed out of everything and are forced to find substitutes). It's a bleak film, but unlike the work of Sam Mendes, to whom Egoyan is often wrongly compared, Egoyan eschews easy sensationalism and carnival freak-shows. 8.5/10 - Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply involving story with excellent performances and direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1997, most people were only talking about one film, and eventually it went on to sweep the board at the Oscars. Disappointing then, that the Academy, and many audiences, overlooked what was possibly the best film of that year. At first glance, 'The Sweet Hereafter' would appear to be an interesting, if somewhat slow-moving drama. However, on reflection, it is a truly remarkable piece of film-making.When a school bus tragically meets with an accident on an icy road near the town of Sam Dent, British Columbia, a small close-knit community is devastated by the sudden loss of many of their children. Focussing on the aftermath of this tragedy, writer/director Atom Egoyan slowly unravels the complex fabric of the town and its inhabitants; many of whom hide secrets buried deep beneath their immediate and overwhelming grief. The arrival of a lawyer, seeking to represent the families in a class action lawsuit, only threatens to shatter the delicate balance with his promises of retribution.Given the subject matter, 'The Sweet Hereafter' is understandably an extremely sad and tragic film; managing to stir powerful emotions without ever resorting to manipulation or sentimentality. Rather than dwelling on the events of the crash itself, the story instead concerns itself with those who survived, and those who must carry on with their lives despite suffering such a massive loss. By necessity, the structure of Russell Banks' novel - a series of monologues given by four of the central characters - had to be changed, and Egoyan's decision to interweave several different timelines undoubtedly helps in achieving this focus.The film opens with a peaceful shot of a sleeping family - a mother and father, with their young child lying between them. At this point there is no context to the image, and immediately the scene shifts to the arrival of Mitchell Stephens in San Dent, intent on persuading the families to sign up with him and pursue compensation. Essentially an ambulance-chaser, he seems to lack the energy required for such an undertaking, and at times it appears he is simply going through the motions. As he makes his rounds, we meet the families of some of the victims - the Walkers, who lost their only son in the accident; the Ottos, whose adopted son Bear also died; and the Burnells, whose daughter Nicole is now in a wheelchair. Mitchell also speaks with Delores Driscoll, the bus driver who once thought of the town's children as her own, and still can't quite come to terms with what has happened.Many of the families want to be left to their grief, but by playing on their emotions and their need to assign blame, Mitchell steadily gets more people on board. He also has a more personal reason for his involvement - a situation with his daughter, Zoë, which he believes aligns him with the people of Sam Dent. Zoë is addicted to drugs, and only calls her father when she needs more money... essentially, he has lost a child too.As we witness the lives of these people both before and after the accident, Egoyan patiently allows the narrative to circle around and around it, until when it finally does arrive, we are already well aware of its outcome. This though, does nothing to lessen the impact of the sequence, as we witness the horror and disbelief on the face of the helpless Billy Ansell as he watches the bus, carrying his two children, careen off the road and into an icy lake. The simplicity of the shot - the entire sequence is seen from a distant perspective - makes it all the more harrowing. Indeed, Egoyan keeps the audience at a distance throughout most of the film, but the sheer weight of the emotion cannot fail to pull you into the story.Of all the fascinating characters in 'The Sweet Hereafter', Mitchell is definitely the most intriguing. Ian Holm's central performance is quite brilliant, in particular his ability to bring so much to such a complex and troubled individual. There are many conflicting feelings and motivations beneath his exterior, and with just the slightest of facial expressions or changes in tone, he superbly lets the audience into his character. One scene, in which he tries to convince Wanda and Hartley Otto to pursue compensation, shows the duality of his situation - one moment he's desperate to direct their rage and prevent a similar accident in the future, the next he's barely able to contain his glee at winning a new client. This is the best acting performance I've seen in years, and in a later scene when Mitchell relates a story from his past in a heart-breaking monologue, I can almost guarantee you'll be moved to tears.Other key performances come from Bruce Greenwood and Sarah Polley, although in all honesty, the entire cast is worthy of high praise. Greenwood is subtle and understated as Billy Ansell, who lost his wife a few years before and has now lost his two children as well. Polley plays an extremely important role in Nicole Burnell, who survived the crash but pays a heavy price for doing so. Ultimately, the fate of the entire town rests on her deposition.This may well be one of the saddest films I've ever seen, but there is a life-affirming quality to the story that elevates it from depressing to something altogether more thought-provoking. I haven't yet mentioned the wonderful cinematography, or Mychael Danna's evocative musical score, but these are really elements you need to experience for yourself. Atom Egoyan has created a mesmerising and intriguing study of human relationships; rich with multiple layers that are slowly peeled back until the emotional core, and the climax of the movie, are revealed. 'The Sweet Hereafter' is not a film about a bus crash; it is about how such tragedies affect us, and how our lives must go on afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has Much the Same Theme as Exotica</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Sweet Hereafter" director Atom Egoyan expands on his view of the free will versus destiny argument. As in his earlier film "Exotica", exercise of free will is generally limited to the choice of substitutes. The process of living being simply a process of substitution. We grow out of things and find substitutes for them. We lose something precious but we carry on by finding a substitute. We need something we can't have so we find something that works as a substitute. Sometimes the substitutes are an improvement on the original, sometimes they are a better match with a new stage of life, sometimes they are an imperfect substitute but the best that we can manage, and sometimes (certainly in "The Sweet Hereafter") they are an addictive trap that keeps people in denial. Substitutes that signal an acceptance of the need/opportunity for change are generally positive. The Otto's substitute an adopted child for the son they can't have biologically, Billy's affair with Risa is a substitute for his dead wife and he is a substitute for her inattentive husband. Billy's children find Nicole a comforting stand-in for their absent mother. Dolores substitutes the children on her bus for the children she has been unable to have. Not so positive are substitutes that compensate for the unattainable. Mitchell Stephens serves as a victims' advocate as a substitute for his inability to influence his daughter's self-destructive behavior. But the most dysfunctional substitutes in "The Sweet Hereafter" are those chosen as a denial mechanism or as a way to "delay" acceptance of a change. Sam's incest is a way for him to delay confronting the fact that he is growing old-losing his vitality. The initiation of legal action over the accident is not just a way to release anger but a way to delay acceptance of the loss and of having to confront living without the children. Billy has already been through the grieving process and understands that delay is a bad idea.But Egoyan also wants us to understand that while we can freely choose our substitutes, we are subject to random events that are beyond our control. Some of these are accidents, with varying degrees of human complicity; some are just events that happen outside human control. Like those who die on the "Bridge of San Luis Rey", there was a randomness about the victims on the school bus. Some survived the accident itself, Jenny stayed home sick that day, and Danny begged to stay home but was placed on the bus by his mother. Stephens' story about rushing his three-year old daughter to the hospital is inserted for a reason. He recalls being willing to do whatever had to be done to save her life. He still feels that way but is powerless to change her downward spiral, and consumed by guilt over his real or imagined contributions to her mental state. He cannot help her so he helps other people. Symbolized by the broken car wash, Zoe's rejuvenation is impossible, as is his until he accepts what he cannot control and finds a constructive substitute. Like Stevens the town must accept what has occurred and learn to live in the strange new childless place that it has become. Look to the movie's title.Foreshadowing occurs when Risa comments to Billy that his following the school bus gives his children something to look forward to just as they look forward to their motel room hook-ups. Sam and Nicole look forward to their rock concert fantesy "kissy" sessions by candlelight in the barn. And a community's children are its looking forward factor.Robert Browning's "The Pied Piper of Hamlin" ? is inserted at various points in the story as a counterpoint for the town's three pipers. Well-meaning Mitchell Stephens has come to rain ruin on this town by seducing the townspeople with the prospect of delaying their acceptance of the tragedy. Sam has seduced his daughter with a fantasy that played upon her desire for his love. But the randomness that made her a "wheelchair girl" has also liberated her. She lies to put an end to the possibility of a successful lawsuit. Nicole is the third piper, at least in the sense that like the fairy tale piper she tells the lie because she is very angry at her father. Not so much because he took advantage of her (she accepts her complicity) but because of his failure to acknowledge it. In the final scene in her bedroom she prompts him to do so, in effect giving him one last chance but he cannot bring himself to confront it.Nicole's lie both implicates and liberates Dolores who otherwise would have continued to live in the town, believing that her neighbors did not hold her responsible for the accident while subjecting herself to the daily reminders of her absent children. Her new life and job in another town is a constructive change and the film's final substitution.</fullReview>

Later, a lawyer shows up in the small town and tries to convince the grieving parents to join in a class action law suit. You see him talk to the parents, you hear their stories and you learn about him. You find out secrets and feelings that maybe are best not found out. You experience the parents anger and loss of their children. And there are no happy endings, no satisfying answers. Maybe there's a small spark of hope at the end. It's a magnificent piece of work.

It will remind you all exactly why film is considered an artform and that films can rival any painting or musical piece.The movie is about a lawyer who goes into a very small town which just endured a horrible tragedy of a school bus suffereing a deadly crash killing nearly everyone on board. this lawyer is attempting to convince all of the town folks that they should all bring a lawsuit against the town or the bus manufacturer or anyone who can be held responsible. Much of the story is told via flash backs showing the days leading up to the bus crash... it is also about the life of the lawyer and it makes us all remember that...well....lawyers are people too with their own suffering and lives.As i said, not for everyone... a great drama, a bit slow, but very beautiful and almost hypnotic... the scene in which we actually see the bus crash was one of the most chilling and heart wrenching moments ive ever witness in a film. definately a hidden gem. 9-10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One example of why this film is so different and so good: As the story begins, an ambulance chaser is traveling to a small town where a school bus has crashed, killing all on board. Well into the film, we finally witness the crash, in flashback. Now, the modern Hollywood version would feature 100 different angles of the crash, mostly in close-up, lots of pyrotechnics, and lots and lots of terrible noises. In The Sweet Hereafter, a father is following the school bus in which his 2 children are riding. When the bus runs off the road and onto the frozen lake, we witness the whole thing from the roadway, in a long shot, just as the father does. Having the camera, and the viewer, stay with the father has much greater impact than the Hollywood version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was just surfing and saw The Sweet Hereafter playing again on Bravo. I was drawn into watching this beautiful movie once again.The Sweet Hereafter tells the story of a terrible school bus crash, and the impact it has on a small Canadian community.Although a simple tale, performances in The Sweet Hereafter are deep and profound, and emotions are taught. Atom Egoyan brings his vision to the screen with a simplicity and naturalness that is almost misleading. The simple story unfolds with a complexity and depth that becomes both gut-wrenching and profound.Bruce Greenwood and Alberta Watson are haunting. Sarah Polley is almost other-worldly. Ian Holm has one of his most complex and understated roles. Gabrielle Rose is heart-breaking. The bleak Canadian winter scenery is almost like another player.This is a movie that is moving in its first viewing but only becomes more poignant with time. It is a Canadian masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quiet and very haunting journey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a parent's worst nightmare.When a tragedy strikes any town, small or big, some of the townspeople get the thought that a class action lawsuit is the answer.That's the same feeling that I can recall while Atom Egoyan's "The Sweet Hereafter", a film that based on the novel by Russell Banks, whose works also include "Affliction".This film focuses its attention on Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm), a lawyer who is making a trip up to a small town in the northeast to find out who is responsible (if anyone really is) for a nasty bus accident that took fourteen lives (mostly young children). However, the bus driver and one teen, Nicole Burnell (Sarah Polley) survived the accident and a parent, Billy Ansell (Bruce Greenwood) who was following the bus when the dreadful event takes place.Despite that time, Stephens has another problem to deal with, his daughter is addicted to drugs and is constantly calling him, asking for money.Besides this film, which may be of his best, I haven't seen any of Egoyan's films. There's one thing that I did like about Egoyan is that he's careful in treating certain situations like this very well and doesn't make the saddest moments of the film too hard to watch.During the last half of the movie, Nicole says that she noticed that the bus was going faster that it normally does. Stephens is surprised at what the teen said and he tells her - "You make a great poker player, kid." In other words, Stephens knows that the lawsuit is dead.Ian Holm has been a reliable actor and here, he shows why with a great performance. Polley is good as well and especially in the scenes when she compares the accident to a poem about the Pied Pieper. Greenwood deserved at least a Best Supporting nomination for his solid portrayal of Ansell, a man who had suffered a great deal before losing his two kids to the accident.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, this film is not for the mainstream viewers. For there is something behind the camera this time, each movement of the cam means something, and there is a magnificent combination of pictures, acting, and music, which are hard to find all in a film. This film is clearly underrated, because nobody wants to hear sad stories, with sad ends confirming something about our lives. I have to note that, in the beginning, the village is clearly defined as a paradise. What paradise is: where everyone is happy even with all their idiosyncracies, deceptions, and earthed jealousies. And then something intereferes in our lives. An accident, death of a friend, a disaster. And then life changes. We are not the old tabula rasa's, we know something about life now, but there is a price for that. Simply, this film is the best film of the last two decades. It reminds me of the third symphony of Gorecki: simple, but sorrowful, and human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting a handle on unimaginable grief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was very interesting to see this one a few weeks after `Erin Brockovich'. Both movies are about the antics of ambulance-chasing lawyers but there is a vast difference in the treatment of the subject. `Erin Brockovich', a star vehicle for Julia Roberts, has the conventional legal David up against the corporate Goliath with the predictable happy ending. In `The Sweet Hereafter', Atom Egoyan gives us something slower paced, a lot bleaker, and a great deal deeper. Ian Holm plays Mitchell, a middle-aged lawyer, a master of his craft, nursing his own family tragedy, a daughter on heroin. He comes to a small town that has suffered a grievous loss. Most of the town's children have been lost in a freak school bus accident and Mitchell is anxious to focus the anger of the town on the deepest pockets available - preferably the manufacturers. He signs on some plaintiffs and starts collecting evidence. But some parents would rather try to forget than sue and a surviving victim has a score to settle with her father.Egoyan is concerned to show us the almost unimaginable sense of loss of those who have lost a child - something that can only really be felt, not described. He uses the story of the Pied Pier of Hamelin as a motif but the parallel is not exact. Here the townsfolk committed no collective wrong and there is no guilty party or convenient corporate villain. We have only a senseless tragedy that has deeply marked the survivors and the families of the victims, all from the one small town. The collective grief is overwhelming and Mitchell, ace manipulator that he is, doesn't realize until it's too late that the need to assuage that grief far outweighs the desire for money.The Canadian winter helps set the bleak tone, but Ian Holm's is a standout performance. His ability to convey in his face his character's inner pain is uncanny. We really do feel it. He becomes everyman journeying through a vale of tears, no longer just the smart city lawyer adept at persuasion. He is supported by a strong cast, several of whom have worked with Egoyan before. Sarah Polley is stunning as the teenage survivor whose relationship with her father is pivotal to the story.I can't really describe the movie as entertaining. Egoyan can entertain, as he did in `Exotica', where a tax inspector with a taste for lap-dancing gets dangerously involved with the owner of an exotic pet shop. There is not much light relief here and the pace is very slow ? a bit like a Canadian winter in fact. But it's worth staying with it. You won't walk out of the cinema smiling, but you will understand a bit more about what it's like to lose the most important thing in most people's lives, their children. And you won't feel manipulated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is the best film of 1997, and one of the best of the year.(spoilers) Ian Holm plays a lawyer, going to a small town where fourteen children have died in a bus accident. He tries to get the families to sue the makers of the bus. He, meanwhile, is going through his own personal tragedy. He can't speak to his daughter, who is a drug addict. In the town, he quickly convinces several people, not all, to sue. One of the main witnesses will be Nicole (Sarah Polley). She was left lame by the crash. This film is truly heartbreaking. The story is amazing, the cinematography accenuates the bleakness of the town, and performances are unanimously magnificent. Ian Holm gives a performance that is incredibly subtle. He vents his anger, but inside, he has a broken heart. Sarah Polley gives a star-making performance as well.  Oh, and there is incest. It motivates a startling plot point in the movie. In the end, it is not about death, but survival. A haunting film, one that I own, and will watch several more times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1997's best film is the Sweet Hereafter. Atom Egoyan hit pay-dirt with 1994's Exotica, but reached a new level of artistry with this adaption of Russell Bank's novel. Exploring the effects of a fatal school bus crash on a small Canadian town and the lawyer who uses the tragedy as a form of redemption for his own pitfalls, it is brutally powerful. Ian Holm gives the performance of his illustrious career as a man obsessed with finding solace from the loss of his own child from drugs and decadence. He seeks it through the transparent class action suit that has no one to accuse, all the while tearing an already wounded community apart. Besides Holm, Egoyan regulars Greenwood, Polley, Hemblen, Rose also appear and are all very good. A truly great film, one of the high points of 1990's cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Egoyan's film is a multi-textured masterpiece. The characters are fascinating, among them Ian Holm's lawyer, who wanders into a small Canadian town following a tragic bus accident which robs a community of its children. Thought to be purely motivated by greed, the viewer slowly discovers that he is plagued by his own demons.With a role that exhibits her as one of the most complex teen-agers I have ever seen on screen, Sarah Polley portrays Nicole, who survives the accident but is paralyzed. Polley is a star to watch in years ahead; she will definitely make her mark on the independent film scene (see Sundance Film Festival 1999's "Guinevere" and "Go").Polley sings on the soundtrack, which I highly recommend. The songs are chilling, perfectly capturing the spirit of the small town forever changed and struggling to go forward after losing their next generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sweet Hereafter is my choice for the best film of 1997. I consider it a five star film. Acting, writing, and directing are all Oscar winning caliber. 1997 was a terrific year for film compared to 1998 dismal films. If there is any justice, one day this film will inherit its triumph over the shallow Titanic. I have read the book by Russell Banks. The film is about a school bus disaster which effects a small town. The film director of this film is worth watching again and again. Sir Ian Holm is definitely one of the finest actors that we never heard about who is better known for his small role in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Canadian actress Sarah Polley is one to watch out for. She has a promising career ahead of her. The film will leave you speechless because this tragedy could happen. I think nothing is more tragic than the scene of the empty bus and the school bus driver who carries a burden. We never really know what caused the tragic accident that took so many lives of young children. This film is truly a disaster for mature adults. The film is close to real life with everyday and ordinary people in it. Please see it if you haven't already!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A subtle and captivating account of the human desire to explain the unexplainable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atom Egoyan has finally fulfilled his promise with this intense, intelligent and beautifully shot tale of the loss of innocence. On the heels of EXOTICA, this elegiac tale (based on Russell Bank's fine novel--the first film that the Canadian writer/director adapted) is subtle and daring yet passionate.With a storyline that would send the average moviegoer running from the theatre, Mr. Egoyan has fashioned a long and winding path to enlightenment. One that does not manipulate the audience. but instead shows them the horror from a distance and lets it sink in. This method might appear to some viewers as cold, but the film stays with you long after a screening.Ian Holm's performance as the protagonist is brilliant. (Donald Sutherland was originally signed for the role and it would have been curious to see what this underrated actor could do with a good role for once==although this is not to take away from Mr. Holm's understated and beautifully modulated performance.) In fact, the entire cast (many of them Egoyan regulars, including Bruce Greenwood) is excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sweet Hereafter is a film that is truly original and rightfully won the Grand Prix and International Film Critics Prize at Cannes, which is probably more important than the Director Oscar nomination, because of Cannes' non political approach to selecting it's winners . It's ideas of tragedy and loss are familiar, but the way in which Egoyan deals with the story is unlike any other.The film is about a tragedy (a school bus accident) that falls upon a small Canadian town in B.C. First of all, Egoyan manages to capture small town life perfectly. He shows the various community members as being individual people, rather than just painting a broad stroke of locals from the boonies.The story is taken from Russel Banks' novel, who also wrote Affliction. There are some significant changes to the book. Ian Holm, a lawyer, has been made into the center point of the story. Egoyan has integrated the story of the Pied Piper into the story as well. Sarah Polley, a survivor of the accident, whose character in the book is full of anger directed towards her sexually abusive father, has a different perspective in the film. Also, there is a very quick scene of incest between the two that seems to be consensual on both parties, an image that caused some controversy when the film was first released. The ending of the book also featured a sort of cathartic crash derby that has been completely removed - a welcome change seeing as how it would be difficult to keep it in the film without altering the overall feel.Ian Holm is a lawyer who isn't even an ambulance chaser because he doesnt have the energy. He comes to the town to try and represent families who have lost their children and try to bring any sort of suit that would award them damages. He, like the families also lost one of his children - his daughter. Except she isn't physically dead. Her brain may be because she's a drug addict, and Holm's relationship with her provides an interesting subplot that shows the anguish he must feel (although he keeps his emotions hidden from his face) dealing with a case so close to him.Holm's investigation focuses on Sarah Polley, a girl who was crippled by the crash, but not killed. He needs her to testify to bring more leverage to his case. Her father Tom McCamus seems to be a good man from the images we see of he and his daughter at a fair and helping her with her music, although the scene in the hayloft(?) suggests otherwise.Bruce Greenwood plays a man who has lost his two children. He allowed Polley to babysit them prior to their death. He is the man who is opposed to Holm' efforts and demonstrates this perfectly when he visits Polley's parents one evening, and when he confronts Holm at the site where the destroyed bus has been taken.Gabrielle Rose plays the bus driver and is very effective. We can see how much the kids meant to her, how she thought of them as her own, this also makes the concluding testimony particularly relevant to her. The entire film is summed up at the end when she and Holm meet eyes.Egoyan has kept the interwoven timelines of the book, that may be confusing for viewers who don't pay attention, and made them so that the story never loses its atmosphere. He also demonstrates his already obvious maturity, by not exploiting the crash itself. He doesn't have sounds of scraping metal or images of bloody children or close ups to shock the viewer. He placidly shows the bus disappear into the icy waters from a fair distance back, also from the point of view of the sole witness of the actual crash.The film is shot beautifully. It captures the wintry climate to a spectacular degree. There are aerial shots that show the openness of the white landscape. The music is sort of tribal with The Tragically Hip's song Courage the main theme.The film has a measured pace which allows us to fully feel a scene before it jumps to the next. The acting is superb and understated.</fullReview>

(Hollywood insists that if you're a white, blue collar worker then you're obviously a trailer trash, WWF watchin' Weekly World readin' buffoon).Egoyan captures the grittiness of what my personal experience has been like in rural Alaska (filmed in Ontario and Vancouver Canada, the experience cuts across international boundaries).It's funny to note that when it was released this movie was criticized as being to "cerebral". I see, if it makes the Hollywood scene look infantial by comparison then it's too intelligent for the average American viewer to comprehend. And that, I will have to agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few of my friends and I have recently discussed the quality of movies this year. There have been some good films, but we all agree that there were very few "wow" moments. Then, we all remembered "The Sweet Hereafter," from two short years ago, as being one on those types of movies.I highly recommend this film to everyone. It's all those cliche blurbs like must see and best film of the year. It's also a film that doesn't rely on false emotions to tell the poignant story of the aftermath of a crash of school bus into a lake."The Sweet Hereafter," is a simple film about the complicated emotions of people, and how they cope with tragedies in their life. It's interesting to see how the lawyer displaces his tragedy onto the parents, and how the person who lost the most, doesn't want to gain anything from the accident.The performances are all first-rate too. I wouldn't recognize Bruce Greenwood had I saw "Double Jeopardy," first, and I don't know how Ian Holm or Sarah Polley were overlooked in award races that year.So if you're feeling blue because a movie isn't as good as you had hoped, just rent this film to see that great movies can still be made in this day and age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hereafter easily placed at the top of my 1997 list, and rivals only a handful of other pieces as my favorite flick of all time. The most frequently lodged complaint about Egoyan's modern masterpiece turns on its extraneous (perhaps gratuitous) sequences. This was not a movie about a message. It was a film about human beings and their interactions under dire, but emphatically real circumstances. I don't think it could be argued that any scenes should have been left behind in the cutting room. Hereafter works as a film not just by way of its technical virtuosity, but also thanks to its astoundingly honest and distantly objective chronicle of human struggle. The distance Egoyan places between the viewer and the victim operates as one of the film's most effective tools. Arguably the most celebrated scene of the movie, the bus sequence emphasizes the uncontrollable nature of catastrophe, and the utter futility of mankind's resolve and recourse against it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gaspingly pretentious would-be tone poem is variably enacted and generally overrated...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lawyer with a troubled personal life reflects back two years on a case in which a school bus went off an icy road one morning, killing several of the children on-board; attempting to stir up interest in a negligence lawsuit within the circle of working-class residents involved, he runs into an emotional roadblock...and an outcome he didn't expect. Writer-director Atom Egoyan, working from a book by Russell Banks, uses location and mood to fuel his bitter story, yet he has no grip on the character-driven drama which takes the better part of an hour to become absorbing. Ian Holm manages an affecting performance in the lead, but there are occasions when he shows the indecisiveness of an actor unsure of his inspiration. The supporting performances are also uneven, with Egoyan going to some length to make these small-town Canadians as eccentric and off-putting as possible (particularly the bus driver who survives to tell her story). Opening the film with a pretentiously staged portrait of an unclothed man, woman, and child asleep in bed, the filmmaker keeps a dogged pace--coupled with the colorless cinematography, is it any wonder many viewers tend to give up on the picture before we even get to the hearing? Hoping for an elegiac tone, the ironic aftertaste of helpless poetry, Egoyan alienates audiences without the spark of keen, natural-sounding dialogue and people we can relate to. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that my passion for Atom Egoyan peaked when The Adjuster came out, then slumped when Calendar and Exotica came out, then hit the "I'm not really seeing anything else this guy does" with The Sweet Hereafter. Oh, damn, and that was cemented with Felicia's Journey. Now, you would NEVER get me to see THAT again.. But since this title became available for me to watch again, I decided to watch it again to see if I liked it any more the second time. And I do believe I had the same reaction as from the beginning. And that is.. What happened? I mean, there is some of the quirkiness so evident in all of his films,. And the acting is always great (Egoyan IS a actor's director for sure). The main problem is nothing really HAPPENS in the movie. Although people make a big production about how wonderful this is, and you know what? I can SEE their point, and it's really quite a clever script.I just didn't overly like it. There. So sue me. Put that 'no' in the "Was this review useful?" box. J</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this film twice now, and had the same reaction bothtimes, so I feel a little more secure in decrying this a vilepiece of garbage. The central idea (a school bus crash) hassuch monumental emotional repercussions that it's easy to bewashed away in grief enough to not notice the emptiness of theconceit built around it. As an intruding lawyer, Ian Holm isasked to give a performance of staggeringly self-consciousfalseness in which his every word, movement and breath is meantto project "SOMETHING IMPORTANT". His episodic encounters withthe people of the community in which the accident took placeonly reveals Egoyan's total condescension toward life's "littlepeople", presenting them as simpletons who, gosh darn it, lovetheir children and each other and turn their noses up atanything so disgusting as a dollar bill. In a failed attempt tomake the lawyer at least two-dimensional, a subplot is sloppedon about his losing touch with his own child, the mostridiculous drug-addicted banshee every put on film. Toss inheavy-handed allegories, heart-tugging music and triteconclusions, and what have you got? An award-winning "masterpiece", to hear most people talk. More than likely theywoke up the next morning, remembered something about angelicchildren heading for their final bus ride, and forgot the rest. There's no other explanation. Rent the first episode ofKieslowski's 1988 "Decalogue", which covers similar thematicground and, in 50 short minutes, accomplishes worlds more. 3out of 10 for the nice work by actors Bruce Greenwood and SarahPolley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Until EXOTICA, I was never a fan of Atom Egoyan's work, because it seemed overblown, pretentious, and too much of a drawing room exercise. But that film had real people interacting in a real way. This film, the best film I saw in 1997, is his most human film yet. It takes the tragedy of every parent's nightmare - losing your child - magnifies it, with a bus crash that kills 14 children and paralyzes another, and deals with it without being exploitative. The novel by Russell Banks is emotionally direct and while Egoyan tempers some of that to avoid sentiment, it's still direct and powerful.The way the narrative weaves from past to present before we see the crash (after which it's pretty straightforward) captures the unease the town feels after the crash, and how each of the characters is caught in some sort of flux. The way Egoyan handles the problem of narration (the novel is narrated in five chapters by four of the characters; Dolores (Gabrielle Rose) the bus driver, Billy Ansell (Bruce Greenwood), who witnessed the crash, Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm) the lawyer, and Nicole Burnell (Sarah Polley), the only survivor besides Dolores) by eliminating Billy's, instead depending on Greenwood to show on his face what Billy said in the novel, which he does, using Dolores' testimony as narration, using Mitchell's conversation with Alison, the friend of his daughter, as narration and subtext of his actions, and using Nicole's telling of the Pied Piper story as subtext to her actions. So we get what we need from the novel's narration without it feeling unnecessary.Egoyan is known primarily as an urban or suburban filmmaker, and most of the actors are known for work in urban or suburban films or TV shows, but they all fit into this small town, and you get a sense of the pallor hanging over the town even before you see the crash. And Holm is a perfect representation of not only the town's helpless rage, but also his own helpless rage (he fights not only for the town, but because he can't save his daughter). Polley is a revelation here, for she's the most idealized character, being the only survivor, and the voice of truth (ironic how she has to tell a lie to tell the truth), and yet she never plays on our sympathies, but earns them.Two other notes; it's a neat symmetry that in both EXOTICA and this film, Polley plays a babysitter for Greenwood, and after seeing this film in a theater in Toronto it had been playing in for several weeks, I left the theater, looked at some of the posters outside it, and who should I see but Egoyan walking past. I ran up to him and told him how much I loved the movie, and he shook my hand and said thank you. Thank you, Mr. Egoyan.</fullReview>

It's a gourmet film for people who wants to see (and feel) real emotions. A perfect, simple and moderated direction by a genius (Atom Egoyan) made this film a 10 movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plaintive memory from the ground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so Egoyan has faded from view it seems, but for a while as he really was something. Exotica was powerful in exemplifying his paradigm. A narrator trapped in hurt that he constantly relives as performance, the entrapment as memory, the narrative of vaguely dreamlike connections as self. More than just some drama out there, it was a coda penetrating into something of the very process that gives rise to the ruminating mind; self. He extends it here.Once more a narrator who remains trapped in impotent hurt - a lawyer whose daughter has strayed in drugs - who is now approaching people much like him, heartbroken by childloss, to convince them of the need to find someone to punish and hold responsible. A larger view through this man. About us, unable to come to terms with the fact that life is transient and will sometimes break down for no reason. And how this freezes love, makes rigid our ability to remain supple in the face of mishap - and I may have just stumbled on a great definition of love - and turns it into incessant ego.Egoyan is an intelligent mind in sketching his paradigm and again in how he pursues resolutions. Parents having been convinced by this bitter man (who is a storyteller working to construct a legal story that justifies) to throw their hurt outwards, turn it into recrimination, it's the surviving daughter who breaks the cycle of suffering for all involved. How she does it, again referencing narratives, is by fabricating a memory, fiction that requires a performance. It's not the truth of course, but it's what needs to be done so that fictions can be chucked away and simple acceptance can begin the work of mending. Yes, he can be obvious in spots and parallels, more so here than Exotica. He can be as simply lyrical as Kieslowski, as complexly layered as Medem. But seen overall, it's the larger awareness of life as flow that goes through many veils that makes this worthwhile. On these veils are seen the shapes of bygone life, mind itself as it wonders. He pursues this mind with an eye that is marvelously freed from the here and now to surge forward and back in search. This effort in film is far from novel, it goes back to Tarkovsky at least, but it's tuned to the same purpose; how to see with an eye that remains supple in the face of reality.And we can venture even further out to offer this view about the world that gives rise to this work. Egoyan can trace a past life for himself in a corner of that bygone world that centuries ago was overran by invaders from the steppe. He must be acutely aware of a past that is shrouded in ruin, the need to placate ghosts of memory. This is a world I happen to share with him, first Armenia, then Constantinople and all the way up to the Danube, that was wrecked in its physical reality, severed from it in so many ways, and a deep part of it has taken flight in dreams and memory, which is the subject of both this and his previous film.So is it any wonder that he draws fresh water from Tarkovsky's spring? It's a spring that both Parajanov, another Armenian, and Kusturica later would draw from, and it goes back in time in a deep way. Something to keep in mind while viewing him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting concept that is unevenly executed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tragedy and moral ambiguity are explored at a very elongated and deliberate pace in this tale of a small rural town coping with a colossal tragedy. This is one of those Art house films that will most likely test the patience of viewers in that it's about 45 minutes too long. At least 30 minutes could have been shaved off this film to deliver its intended purpose or message whatever it may have been. We have scenes where we have family discussions and the dialogue is delivered in a very slow, monotone and lethargic rhythm. I'm not certain if this was Egoyan's method of directing the actors or if this is an underlying problem in the actors themselves. If this movie intends to be a realistic portrayal of people's responses to personal tragedy then we have a crucial problem. If not, then this can only serve as a morose allegory of cinema. The poetic narrations performed by the teenage survivor of the crash add a layer of content to the theme, but fail to provide any substantial meaning to the plot. Therefore it is up to us to make sense of this. The story of Hamelin's Pied Piper may have a personal significance to the character of Nicole, but doesn't resonate too well with the viewer. The plot and directing style doesn't connect us with the characters on an empathetic level. We are alienated from their internalized grief and aren't given enough time with them to experience that which i believe is completely necessary in stories of tragedy.Ian Holm, as the morally questionable attorney, is misused as a key character here. As a morally bifurcated and broken man we may initially cast him as a villain, but later see him as a broken man trying to identify with parents of dead or degenerate children. Greed can turn into munificence if handled tactically and justly. His acting style here looks too lethargic and preachy. We wonder if he is the effective and prestigious lawyer he pretends to be. It's even questionable why he felt that turning this situation into a Civil Lawsuit was worthwhile. And a result, we are left to decide what his morality and intentions really were. What a pain. Sam Greenwood is a strong presence in the film. With his deep southern drawl and intimidating stare he can register moments of personal confrontation which inadvertently raise the motivations of the characters involved in the lawsuit. The strangest actress in this film would have to be Sarah Polley who is very monotone, deliberate and almost ghostly. Her lilting and melancholy voice seem oddly inappropriate for a girl who is dealing with what she is going through. By the twist ending we realize that she is actually more of a manipulator than a damaged girl trying to find her way through. The moment with her pallid father in the car has a comical note which grades against the seriousness of this story.My guess is that this movie is depicting human tragedy as a new and precarious beginning where we feel vulnerable and confused. It's poetic and lugubrious. We are fed a plethora of poetic narrations and moving montages that depress and sedate our senses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a nearly great film on parents, children, anger, grief and loss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Think Twin Peaks if you took away the surrealism and upped the super-tragic factor: it's not one young person but over 20 dead who die in a horrible bus accident on an icy road and leave a whole town scarred, with one man coming in to try and figure out what happened. Only in this case it's not the FBI, it's a lawyer, trying to file suit against the town for more damages as compensation for the parents. Considering the many characters and the various ways they feel throughout the film, an alternate title for the film could be called The Bitter Simmering Grief.This is one of those rare films where one scene, and a choice of a narration-device, mars for me what is otherwise an excellent drama, and generally one of the better films of 1997 (a year with many great films). But before I get to that, some praise for Ian Holm. My God is he phenomenal in this movie. He has to do, as this character of Mitchell Stevens, appealing to the anger and grief of these victims and channel that anger (more than the grief, if he can help it) to go along with him in the suit. At the same time this character is dealing with his daughter, addicted to drugs and spiraling out of control, and it's always in phone calls where he can barely speak to her in a rational way.One of the scenes that can shake you up as you watch this film involves Holm talking to his daughter on the phone (this after a nasty encounter with one of the locals, played by Bruce Greenwood, who doesn't want him in the town), and he finds out from her that she's HIV positive. This relies in part on a monologue he gives to an old friend of hers he meets on a plane as he tells a story involving when his daughter was near death from a spider bite in her throat and having to come close to doing what he had to for her. Just seeing him speaking this, and then this in mind as he finds out this news, the way that Egoyan shoots that scene with the wide shots of her on the phone at a booth, the close-ups on him, then in to her, with brief flashes to her as a baby... it's a gut-punch. And Holm sells it, every single second. It's a cliché to call something a powerhouse in a performance, but that's what he's giving here, and often in very subtle ways, sometimes with just a look or how he's listening to people, or subtly appealing to characters' emotions.Sarah Polly is also really terrific too as the teenager who was one of the only survivors (along with the driver) on the bus. My problem with the film doesn't come with her, but with a certain story choice that is made about a third to maybe mid-way through the film - it's difficult to spoil it, but it involves a scene that seems to me just dropped right into the thick of things, and it doesn't have very much lead up for these characters. While it does ultimately pay off in the climax of the story, it is still a jarring move; even at 112 minutes long, I wish the film had been longer to develop these characters and this conflict that is clearly there. It's meant to be accentuated by the narration of the Pied Piper, which Polly's character is reading to the children and then comes back up from time to time. It's too on-the-nose dramatically speaking, especially for a film that is loaded with enough drama and tragedy as it is.And yet I can't recommend the film enough, despite my caveats on a first viewing. The Sweet Hereafter, beautifully shot in snow-covered Canada, is meant to look on into that terrible moment when tragedy rocks not just one family but a whole town - and yet these people, individually, have to deal with the pains of losing their children in their own ways, with Stevens most of all as his daughter is dying, yet so far away from him, and yet there's also Greenwood's character, who is gruff and mustached and full of the sort of pain that he will keep inside of himself for the rest of his life. It's a near-masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sweet Hereafter (1997): Dir: Atom Egoyen / Cast: Ian Holm, Sarah Polley, Bruce Greenwood, Tom McCamus, Maury Chaykin: Terrific film about the promise of a better tomorrow. A community loses children in a tragic bus accident and Ian Holm plays a lawyer who arrives to represent the town in a lawsuit. Contact with his daughter brings memories of a time when she nearly died. Director Atom Egoyen who previously made Exotica employs symbolic images using the Pied Piper story. Holm is flawless as a lawyer bent on covering up his mistakes by solving others. His presence is not welcome amongst town folks, and his daughter calling only brings grief and regret. Great supporting work by Sarah Polley as a wheelchair victim whom Holm is trying to convince to assist in the lawsuit. She was seated at the front of the bus and as a result she became paralyzed from the waist down. Bruce Greenwood plays a father who witnessed the tragedy, and Tom McCamus plays Polley's father who molested her when she was young. Maury Chaykin provides great comic relief during a scene where he explains and basically points fingers in blunt fashion. Many of these people wish to continue onward as oppose to indulge in a lawsuit that can only result in more pain. Emotional film about dealing with loss and protecting children from the reality of fate. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

She never seems to have gotten the full respect she deserves, and in many circles is best known for the "Dawn of the Dead" remake. She is so much more than that.And Ian Holm is a powerful lead. Apparently Donald Sutherland was the first choice but it ended up in Holm's lap. Sutherland is one of my favorite actors, but I think Holm has a sense of gravitas that Sutherland does not.

Roger Ebert wrote: "This is one of the best films of the year, an unflinching lament for the human condition. Yes, it is told out of sequence, but not as a gimmick: In a way, Egoyan has constructed this film in the simplest possible way. It isn't about the beginning and end of the plot, but about the beginning and end of the emotions. In his first scene, the lawyer tells his daughter he doesn't know who he's talking to. In one of his closing scenes, he remembers a time when he did know her. But what did it get him?" The Sweet Hereafter is as tragic, sad and matter-of-fact as movies get, but it's still so very beautiful that it becomes a film that's virtually impossible to forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving on or: Walking the fine line between innocence and guilt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A single horrific accident that reaps away dozens of children jolts a small town out of its reverie. The damage done is irreparable, and it's up to the lawyers to find a culprit, because after all someone has to be made responsible, big time... - Atom Egoyan's "The Sweet Hereafter", based on Russell Banks' novel bearing the same title, is a writer's/filmmaker's take on events that actually took place in Alton, Texas, in 1989 where the disaster involving dozens of fatalities led to an array of lawsuits to reach settlements as compensation for the deaths of the children. In the process people who shared the same trauma and grief became even further estranged from each other, despite or especially because of the reparations that were paid. Maybe the price tags put on the children were varying, but it was only a symptom - things could never be the same again. Whole futures perished with the lives lost in an instance, and the animosities the lawsuits brought with them made it even harder to move on for everyone involved.Canadian filmmaker Egoyan does not tell that particular story, but a fictional version of it, thereby even upstaging Banks' source material e.g. by adding a recurring spot-on poetical reference that is prone to send shivers down your spine. Also in focus of the film: The tight-knit community and a lawyer trying to help people make a case, resulting in a stirring slice-of-life portrayal of loss and how to cope with it seen from different angles. Tragic figures abound, nobody is spared, among them the lawyer himself (the outstanding Ian Holm), who has to deal with his own unrelated personal loss, or the paralyzed 14-year old survivor of the incident (touchingly played by Sarah Polley) who has to make a serious decision that will affect the whole community. The theme of estrangement, melancholy and helplessness permeates every action, always dominated by the question: How could one possibly get over a tragedy like that? But while the film comes across as sincere and real through the subtle way it was shot, its bittersweet visual poetry will haunt you, and the picture is also bold enough to go for a very powerful, unexpected final statement. "The Sweet Hereafter" is a deeply involving, mature and a thought-provoking piece of cinema and along with "Exotica" among Egoyan's very best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** We know right from the start where the film " The Sweet Hereafter" is headed in ambulance or school bus chasing shyster lawyer Mitchell Stevens, Ian Holm, on his way to this snowy little town in British Columbia Canada. Stevens is trying to get the people involved in a fatal school bus accident to help him start a class action suite against the bus company the bus driver as well as the town, Sam Dent, in what happened there. We also see that Stevens has problems of his own in that his teenage daughter Zoe,Caerthan Banks, is heavily into the drug scene and is later in the film found to be HIV or AIDS positive because of her non-stop drug use. It soon becomes obvious that Stevens in having his life screwed up, his wife also walked out on him, wants to help others like the school bus survivors and their families more then making any money for his services. It doesn't take to long for Stevens to find out that his services are no longer needed in that by him suing everyone or every thing in sight he's in fact opening up wounds in the community that have just started to begin healing. Wounds far more hurtful then what the people in Sam Dent have already suffered which in fact they were compensated for by the school bus company and despite it not being found responsible, for any shabby work on the road and guardrail,town.At first we dislike Stevens in his obsessive attempt to get the people in town to help him with his class action suit that many don't want to pursue. But later he turns out to be a victim of his own self righteousness in seeing he's going to hurt a lot of Innocent people with his suite who suffered , by surviving, even more then the victims whom he's to represent. One of them is the school bus driver Dorloes Driscoll, Gabriella Rose, who did everything to avoid her bus from skidding into a frozen lake and now has to live with the 14 children who ended up drowning in it on her conscience. There's also 15 year old Nicole Burnell, Sarah Polley, who survived the accident but ended up like the little boy in the story of "The Pide Piper of Hamlin", a favorite of hers, crippled and prevented from entering the land of "Good &amp; Plenty" that the piper was taking the children of Hamlin to.***SPOILERS*** Slow moving but extremely heart wrenching film that has no happy ending which in fact makes it one cut above the usual Hollywood schmaltz were used to watching about the subject matter that it presents to us. A lot like the movie released the year before in 1996 "Before and After" the film "The Sweet Hereafter" shows us how one survives a tragedy like losing a child with both dignity as well as grace instead of vengeance and self-guilt. Besides Nicole the film centers around Billy Hansel, Bruce Greenwood, the mechanic who serviced the school bus and knew that there was nothing wrong with it. Billy also lost his two children who were on the school bus that he witnessed, by driving behind it, crashing into the lake drowning them and their dozen or so classmate. For all the suffering that Billy and the rest of the people in Sam Dent went through he didn't want some shyster lawyer to make, excuse the pun, a killing off it!***MAJOR SPOILER** In the end Stevens also lost a child, his daughter Zoe, through drug abuse and realized the only thing he can do now is try to put that tragic loss behind him like Billy as well as the crippled Nicole were doing and go on with his shattered life. It was Nicole who in her trying to put an end to the lawsuit that Stevens was pushing ended the whole affair by making up a preposterous story about the event,in Nicole being a star whiteness, that had it thrown out of court. Which allowed the healing process that Stevens tried to disrupt to continue and thus make things better for her as well as Mitchell Stevens and everyone else involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the director Atom Egoyan's misuse and overuse of flashbacks and flash forwards, this movie contained a great story.A terrible tragedy from which there was no emotional relief for the survivors except the chance for one to exact punishment for incest and child abuse.This story could have been told almost strictly chronologically from before the accident to after the accident without misusing the flashback technique and saving that technique for some of the background of the attorney which was still very well played by Ian Holm.Be patient with this movie and forgiving of the flash back misuse and you will have seen a gem of a story told about a tragic happening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do not read this if you have not seen the Sweet Hereafter: This film is a haunting representation of the secrets, lies, betrayals, and other sins within families, the resulting tragedy and the power of forgiveness. Incest is the underlying sin and the relationships between the Sarah Polly character and her father and Billy Ansel and his deceased wife (daughter). Even the relationship between the lawyer and the daughter who he never really betrayed is seen as fragile and what can happen even when a parent does nothing wrong.Was Nicole having an affair with the Bruce Greenwood character? When she left the baby sitting she was wearing a pink skirt she was also shown changing into earlier in the movie. However when the car headlights shined on her she was still wearing jeans. This is a great mystery movie also.Notable in this production are the slow pacing, the sound, the Armenian music, the cinematography, and the exceptional acting. All the characters are people you think you knew at some point and the films lack of sentimentality and gratuitous violence is unprecedented in a movie of this type. The spiritual ending with the girl smiling while watching the ferris wheel and the same girl spreading her arms like an angel facing the car headlights about to meet her fate are images you'll never forget. My second favorite movie to Nights of Cabiria. This movie is the real deal, one everyone needs to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Me This is Canada's Greatest Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredibly compelling and emotionally powerful story about a school bus accident in a small town in British Columbia which claims the lives of 14 children, and the ensuing aftermath of the tragedy for the parents, the survivors and the town.The story is told largely from the perspective of the lawyer (Ian Holm) an outsider who has come to launch a lawsuit on their behalf because as he says 'someone should pay for their grief'. The lawyer is not driven simply by greed, but by his own personal demons and this makes his character all the more ambiguous. The other leading characters are a girl who survives the crash but is paralyzed (Sarah Polley) and a widowed father who has lost both his young children (Bruce Greenwood), both give very good performances. The rest of the supporting cast is also strong and features a number of regulars from Egoyan's previous films.The film's solid production values along with the writing, direction and the aforementioned performances makes this one of the best and certainly my favorite Canadian film.The music is used very effectively and strongly impacts the atmosphere of the film, a number of the songs are played by a band fronted by Sarah Polley's character in the film, and in addition to her acting talents Polley seems to possess a very nice singing voice.The film brings considerable insight to the process of grief and how the characters each cope. The attention to detail contributes greatly to the feel of authenticity. The emotions of the characters though obviously strong are for the most part kept somewhat in check and thus the emotional impact of the film is somewhat subdued but no less powerful.The film is based on the novel by Russel Banks which was set in Upstate New York and was itself based on an actual School bus crash in Texas. Banks approved of the adaption by Egoyan and has a cameo on the film while also participating in the DVD commentary with Egoyan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The pinnacle of film-making...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to explain a film like THE SWEET HEREAFTER in words. To me, it is something you should experience for yourself, and on more than one occasion. Film-maker Atom Egoyan's masterpiece comes at the end of a string of relative and commercial 'failures' (with EXOTICA being the notable exception).Egoyan effectively examines a full range of complex human emotions in this 110-minute epic. Viewers will find themselves watching this movie more than once, and seeing/uncovering things they didn't notice before. Each main character exhibits a wide range of emotions from anger to grief to obsession to sadness to selfishness to greed, etc. The emotional layering in this film is second-to-none, and the complexity achieved in the less than 2-hour run-time is simply outstanding and perhaps unprecedented.The acting is spot-on, with memorable performances by Ian Holm and Sarah Polley. Each main character does his/her job adequately and superbly. The Screenplay is top-notch, as are the Score, the Scenery/Cinematography, and the Style. It is worth noting that Sarah Polley (alongside her band) also contributes to the Soundtrack with some well-sung tunes, including the one during the end credits that has a powerful and fitting message about courage. Note also that the narration by Polley in the final third or so of the film is superb, and the source material (which I will not mention here for the benefit of the potential viewer) is poetically and tragically fitting.Atom Egoyan, unlike many directors today, thankfully does nothing to insult the viewer's intelligence. Much of the film's intrigue and power is dependent on the viewer, as the open-ended nature of the film leaves much to his/her interpretation and judgment. Egoyan does not try to stuff this film with preachy over-the-top messages or unwarranted sentimentality, but simply examines the extent of human emotion in the wake of a tragedy (or multiple tragedies as the case may be). The movie does not follow a linear time-line nor does it solely focus on just one story. The fact that Egoyan managed to deal with the subject matter so brilliantly in less than two hours is mind-boggling, and as stated earlier, will have viewers coming back to this one.This film is not for everyone, however; those who are thrilled only by mindless action sequences and flashy ostentatious bombastic CGI effects will find this picture long, tedious, and, dare I say, boring. This film is for those who appreciate the Motion Picture as a work of Art, insomuch as Art imitates Life. I'm quite confident that as one matures, this film will become increasingly appealing to the viewer. It is most certainly a film that will not be easily forgotten This Motion Picture deserves a perfect rating of 10/10 but I find it difficult to give it 4 stars simply because it is not for everyone. This should enter my Top 100 at #84 or so but is expected to climb.Highly recommended. 10/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark, top notch art film with a first rate cast and script. Any great art has levels and you can go about as deeply as you want into "The Sweet Hereafter". Everyone in the film is living by their fingernails, hanging on the edge of falling into the cold water. The attorney, Holm, threatens to expose the facts behind that fragility, but ends up being trapped in his own limbo of expectations. Every moment in the movie has an undercurrent. We know what we are seeing is not simple life, there is a story behind it. That is tough to maintain for the length of a film but TSH manages it nicely. This is a film of people trapped by their expectations, limited vision and spiritual bankruptcy as much as tragedy. The tragedy is an onset, but lives were already ruined. How they were is something to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without getting into too much detail, this brilliant adaptation of the original novel by Russell Banks works so well because it allows the viewer to engage fully in piecing together events, characters, etc., slowly creating a tapestry of a town shattered by the death of its children. It moves in a quiet &amp; contemplative manner, lulling you. The tragedy of the story, the bus accident of which only 2 people survive, grounds the dreamlike story telling, allowing you the patience to take everything in out of sequence (moments happening pre and post accident come at you in no particular order). The story of the pied piper is weaved into the story telling in the most subtle way, becoming symbolic towards the end. The earnest, unassuming and powerful storytelling gets under your skin slowly, culminating in a sort of personal understanding. A beautifully poetic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not familiar with the book or the movie when it came out in 1997. I had no idea what I was in for. I wanted to hate Holm's character but ended up feeling a mix of revulsion and compassion for the lawyer/father. The incest between Nicole and her father caught me totally off guard. I thought she had an older boyfriend, it was only when she came home in the wheelchair did I realize that was her father. Nicole was such a complex character. Kind to the other children yet cold at other times. She along with Billy was the voice of reason in the lawsuit. Yet she seemed complicit in the affair with her father. The grief and anger in the films characters was palpable and real. This is a movie that will stay with me for some time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely heartwrenching and beautiful. The scenes of 3yo Zoe nursing were achingly innocent and sweet and made me cry. There are no similar moments on film anywhere as far as I know and I appreciate Egoyan's decision to include them. I watched Todd Solonz's Happiness for the first time yesterday and am struck by some things. I thought Happiness was well crafted, but am eager to forget it. It touched nothing, activating only disgust, anxiety, and dread. Sweet Hereafter, by contrast, (watched for the fourth time) touched me, moved me, and left me feeling love, loss, and gratitude for what I have and what I have had. Very different films, nothing in common, just leave me wondering what would be the highest best purpose of art, using these two equally well-conceived and well-crafted films as examples.</fullReview>

Ian Holm turns in yet another brilliant performance as a loathsome attorney who convinces grieving parents of some of the victims to file a class action suit against those responsible for the accident. He is also dealing with the tragic death of his own drug-addicted daughter. His bitterness toward her death leads him to pursue these mourning parents very aggressively, causing great conflict and divide amongst the townspeople. A shocking and thought-provoking film. I would have given this movie a 10 except for the last 10 minutes. Disappointing ending to a truly special movie. Still worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like his other films, Egoyan moves back and forth in time in telling his tragic tale of a school bus accident and its aftermath. He creates a haunting atmosphere, aided by fine cinematography and a moody score. Holm plays the ambulance chasing lawyer and the story he recounts of the time his daughter was bitten by a spider is pretty intense. Polley stands out in a good cast as a young survivor of the bus crash who is fighting other demons besides dealing with her injuries. The film does not dwell on the accident itself, but rather focuses on the different ways that affected family members cope with it. It is the kind of film that lingers in the memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Town a Silence,... for the grief of the parents id great, and the joyful screams and laughing of their children shall be never more.Those where the first words I cold think of after the movie's ending. This movie handles a hard theme, it is about the death of a child. Honestly not one, no director Atom Egoyan found a way to kill all of the children in 1 breath, taking it not into the absurd, but in fact with a touch of realism.Imagine a small town somewhere in the mountains of Canada, where yo have a lot of individual houses who stand in the mountains. Imagine it being winter, and having a dead wood covered in perfect white snow. Imagine 1 school bus, on it's way to deliver the small group of country kids to their normal school day. Imagine that the driver losses control, over the wheel on the icy and slippery road. Imagine that the bus falls of a low cliff onto the ice. Now imagine the bus going through the ice, where most kids (all but 1) meet a ice cold and wet grave.The ones who are left behind are the parents who can only grief in silence, until after all reporters are gone, a lawyer shows up, who tries a make a claim, to look for a guilty one, in this tragedy.But really WHO IS TO BLAME ? IS THERE SOMEONE TO BLAME ?Like I said before, a hard issue, since losing your child would be one of the worst thing for a loving and caring parent. The director made this movie with quiet some skill, not making it OVER dramatical, but in his directing and the acting, is quiet subtle. No really BIG or huge cries, no the parents you see are broken people silent grievers, who one's in while will shed a tear. No bursting out into tears and screaming hard asking WHY WHY ?, no happy end, etc etc. This is NOT a Hollywood mainstream movie, but a perfect clear and free from all sorts of overacted sentiment motion picture. It is subtle yet hard, has a beautiful cinematography, amazing settings, a moving score and fine acting work.If you not believe me go see for yourself, but keep in mind that this is not a happy or "sweet" picture it is a moving and a sad one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Be aforewarned: Spoilers, and persnickety legal griping ahead.I hate to throw cold water on such a finely crafted, deeply felt film, but it botches the legal side to the story, taking some of the bite out of the ending. The movies always get legal process wrong -- mostly because the law is actually too boring to make a decent story without embellishing. Here, Nicole (Sarah Polley) scotches the law suit by lying at her deposition. When the opposing lawyer asks her lawyer (Ian Holm) if he has any questions, he dumbfoundedly says no. Wrong. The line of questions that would have really followed would have "reminded" Nicole that Billy was following in the truck and had told the police Dolores was going 50 mph; if Billy was lying, as she is now alleging, he could be brought up on charges of impeding an investigation; does Nicole want that? And what about Dolores? Did she often drive 20 mph over the speed limit with children in the bus? Will Nicole testify against Dolores in her trial for reckless endangerment and negligent homicide? Does she want that? I doubt it. Rather, confronted with these ramifications, her story would crumble, and the case would go on. Only Nicole's role as a witness -- for either side -- would be ended by the lie. Do you really think a little white lie would be enough to make a real lawyer go away? If only...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that the first time I saw this film, I just didn't get it. It was my first Egoyan film experience and at the time I didn't care to ever see the movie again. Recently I caved and decided to give the film another try, and I can not put into words how moved I was.It makes you wonder what you would do if you were ever stuck in any of these peoples shoes. What if you were the bus driver of a crash that killed many of the town's children. What if you were one of the only survivors of a bus crash and every one of looking to you for answers? What if your only child(ren) died, how could you go on living? What if you were a laywer just looking for new clients, and had to deal with your own failing relationship with your only child?I don't think that I have ever seen a more talented cast. And I don't think that Sarah Polley, Bruce Greenwood, or Ian Holm's performances will ever be drilled out of my head. Because these three people make you feel their pain, and their sadness.Egoyan has given us a master piece,a film that keeps us thinking even days after we have watched it. I don't know why I didn't like it the first time, many a little tempory insanity. But I know now this movie has given me a deep respect for Canadian Cinema, and I hope one day I can make a film that is as moving and truthful as this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine study of grief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to predict what Sweet Hereafter will do to you. The outback video cover summary of the movie as a portrayal of a buss-crash and its judicial aftermath does the film little, if any, justice. Where Egoyan's masterpiece true strength lies is in its ingenuous portrayal of grief. People usually talk about something called `The Hollywood model moviemaking' (a term as vague and irrelevant as, for example, `The New Economy') where plot and character portrayal usually follows a set path. Without getting into a discussion of anomalies to this rule, what the Sweet Hereafter so masterfully accomplishes is to get beyond the usual portrayal of sorrow as something tangible and predictable. Nothing wrong with that, when you deal with one or two-dimensional film characters. But real people grieve in real ways. There are no ways to tell how people react to trauma, such as a bus crash or the death of a child. This is the element that Egoyan so beautifully takes advantage of in The Sweet Hereafter. The result is a film that may either bore you or leave you breathless depending on how much liberty you allow filmmakers in their portrayal of human emotions. Like sorrow, The Sweet Hereafter is at once fascinating, boring, painful, frustrating and peculiar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Architecture at the service of emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film has an almost musical structure in the way it interweaves themes so that they illustrate each other: the insurance lawyer's relationship with his daughter parallels the incestuous father-daughter relationship that drives the denouement, so much so that it's almost as if his own daughter has intervened in the current situation to punish him once again. The use of "The Pied Piper of Hamelin" to suggest both childhood and malevolence is another example, as is the whole technique of telling two stories at once: the insurance struggle and the original bus crash (which is drawn out through almost the whole film.)All these interwoven themes give the movie a quiet tensile strength, so that, even as it appears to wander from one time and incident to another, it is in fact so rigorously constructed that the viewer is being lead by multiple roads to one breathtaking climax - that in turn illuminates the various situations that have lead up to it. The incestuous father is punished; the unsatisfactory father is punished; even the echo of the Pied Piper story is 'resolved' with the image of the single crippled child who was left behind, and who here becomes the hero of the tale.All of this is subtle, and at the service of emotion and evocation. The apparent subject of the movie is inherently powerful and affecting, yet is simultaneously used to explore a more commonplace drama: the multiple ways in which fathers may fail their daughters. The insurance man's failure to reach his own daughter is as tragic in its way as the death of a busload of children.I haven't re-viewed it, but I presume it's one of those movies which replays multiple viewings, since so much of what seems trivial or fortuitous at the start has its purpose in the structure revealed later on. In this sense, it's like any coherent work of architecture, requiring you to view the whole before you can appreciate the balance of its parts.Jim Chevallier North Hollywood, CA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weirdly resonant (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface of it, I'd think the material was a bit too much for a film. That is typically, there's not much to watching people be sad on film. But, maybe, with the Columbine business, or the drugs or divorce or what have you, somehow, this film has just lodged in my brain. For me, I find it weirdly resonant.It pokes at an interesting transition. Somewhere at the point beyond depression, and beyond being just plain upset about how awful things are, and coming on to the muddling along the follows. I think it's maturity, though don't quote me on that.SpoilersIn a way, I'm not completely convinced that the daughter's trashing the lawsuit was anything more than just getting back at her father. The movie hints that she buys the little speech about how they were a community and all that. Still, seems like her motives aren't altogether pure here. Or, perhaps she is due some just revenge -- but that didn't seem to be the point of the thing.Anyway, just some thoughts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sombre classic; not for all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atom Egoyan did not fail to deliver another great film after Exotica with this film - The Sweet Hereafter. This movie is one of the most thought-provoking films I have ever seen and its main theme of going on with life after the death of loved ones has never been done so darkly, yet so real.Ian Holm surely stole the show in this film in a flawless performance as a lawyer still coming to terms with losing his own daughter. The only difference between his loss and the loss of the parents is the fact that his daughter is still living, although not very well being addicted to drugs. It is the loss of his one and only child that drives Holm's character to find answers for the parents who have lost their children forever as well. Sarah Polley also plays well as Nicole, a survivor of the accident who has lost the use of her legs. When asked to come to a deposition, she agrees only to lie in order to gain revenge on the incestuous advances her father has made towards her.This movie doesn't follow any particular order, and helps to draw upon the effect of disarray that those in the community must face after the loss of their children. One of the most riveting scenes I have ever seen takes place when we actually see the bus cascade down the hill on to the frozen lake and sink through the ice. Without the use of special effects or a camera to show the happenings inside the bus, this event plays almost too real and is quite terrifying.Egoyan certainly deserved the Oscar nod for Best Director, although Holm also should have been rewarded for his wonderful performance as well. A pure cinematic masterpiece.8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving, somewhat enigmatic story of tragedy and aftermath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The subject and events in the movie are relentlessly bleak, but so well done that it is more affecting than depressing.I haven't been able to come up with a pithy characterization of the movie, although I think that there is a fairly specific point that the film is trying to make. The Pied Piper of Hamlin is referenced throughout, but it isn't really a "remake" of that. It's more a character study of what tragedy does to people -- there are parallels between the Pied Piper and the lawyer who comes to town to represent the parents of children killed in the accident, but he is only one of the central characters, and ultimately not the most important one.I recommend the film, but it's not a date flick...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid work marred by one element</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am becoming more and more convinced that the Academy Award is irrelevant. Ian Holm's performance deserved at the very least a nomination (along with Al Pacino and Johnny Depp of DONNIE BRASCO). He is perfect. The direction from Egoyan is also perfect. In less capable hands, the film could have become a depressing, unwatchable mess. Nevertheless, Egoyan has two of the characters interact in a way which I found very gratuitous. I won't tell you what goes on, but watch and you'll see. It's the only thing wrong with this solid, otherwise sensitively handled picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>meandering sad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm) is a lawyer struggling with his drug addicted daughter. He's trying to convince various parents to sue the town. They lost their children when the school bus driven by Dolores Driscoll (Gabrielle Rose) gets into an accident on a snow covered road. The town is the only one with deep pockets and Mitchell will say anything to get them to sue. Nicole Burnell (Sarah Polley) is a survivor who was sexually corrupted by her father.This movie meanders a lot. There are long flashbacks of not only the bus ride and crash but also some of the life before that day. It has an ethereal dreamlike quality about it. It has the sad moody devastation. It doesn't make it a compelling watch unless seeing the saddest people in the world is fun for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>British actor Ian Holm gives a new meaning to a tale about selfishness directed by Atom Egoyan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After an attentive viewing session,most attentive viewers would not fail at all to notice that the most recognizable feature of "The Sweet Hereafter" is its candid portrayal of selfishness. It is precisely this feeling which helps us to understand how some selfish individuals want to derive advantage from other people's suffering.This has been depicted through British actor Ian Holm whose extraordinary performance suggests that selfish people are always armed with their own ingenious explanations about their acts which in the long run bring them their fair share of misery instead of happiness.Canadian auteur Atom Egoyan whose film is an adaptation of a best selling work by Russell Banks is hardly partial when it comes to describe how ordinary people deal with guilt especially when it concerns untimely death of loved ones.No viewer would like to side with the film's characters who are full of idiosyncrasies as nobody is innocent.It is no wonder that good photography and natural setting enhance this film's viewing experience for viewers at a time when its slow pace acts as a veritable spoilsport. Finally,The Sweet Hereafter is a film to be watched at all costs if you have not seen a film which has been praised excessively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pied Piper of Hamelin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summary will make sense once you have seen this.The Canadian film industry is one that I am now really getting into. This movie has a very disjointed structure and one that might be hard-to-follow for some people, which really is my only complaint though.The plot deals with 'tragedy', in particular losing your child. This occurs throughout the film and not just with the townsfolk that lost their kids in the bus crash, but Ian Holm's character has a drug-addicted daughter in this as well which also continues this theme outside of the townsfolk.If you want to watch a movie with good dialogue and characters with a lot of depth then I suggest watching, although to keep you in the right frame of mind then watch this movie expecting a dark, well-made period drama, that was what I was expecting and it was fulfilled in all aspects.No wonder this is considered Canada's best film, that title is deservingly so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Compassionate and reflective masterpiece..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Egptian-born Canadian screenwriter, producer and director Atom Egoyan's seventh feature film, an adaptation of American writer Russel Banks' novel from 1991 which was inspired by a true story concerning a school bus accident in Alton, Texas 1989, tells the story of middle-aged attorney Mitchell Stevens who arrives in a remote rural district of Canada in December 1995 to report the circumstances surrounding a tragic school bus accident and help the parents of the victims to file an insurance-case against the bus company. A task that becomes difficult when he learns that most of the parents have numerous dark secrets. As he gets closer to the inhabitants of the small community it becomes apparent that this case has a strong personal influence on him, but his devotion brings nothing good to the parents, who begins to question his motives when they see that the case has more meaning to him than to them.The great score, the mindful dialog and the lyrical cinematography by Paul Sarossy emphasizes the emphatic and mysterious atmosphere in this resonating and realistic psychological drama which is beautifully filmed by Atom Egoyan, who creates versatile perspectives with his nuanced and subtle camera movements. His detailed and introspective screenplay examines how a bus accident affects the people in a small community and the aftermath of sorrow in a profound way, and portrays an in-depth study of character about a grieving man who has a restrained relationship to a daughter he hardly ever sees and who finds comfort and identifies with the parents who lost their children in the accident. Ian Holm's interpretation of the lawyer is outstanding in a refined and understated performance.The overall acting is good and Sarah Polley delivers a remarkable acting performance in her breakthrough role as teenager Nicole Purnell. During this brilliantly directed Canadian film, a short poem from 1842 called "The Pied Piper of Hamelin" by English poet and playwright Robert Browning (1812-1889) is read through Sarah Polley's voice-over. This fairy-tale forms a fine parallel to the story about the lawyer and the parents. With it's underlying lyrical aura and captivating narrative, this independent film stands as a poetic, compassionate and reflective masterpiece from the late 1990s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Presented and So Sad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just chanced upon this film. Having watched a film called "Before and After" with Liam Neeson and Meryl Streep (a film that doesn't work well at all), I got to see how tragedy and loss can be portrayed in a sensitive, gut wrenching way. The idea that after a terrible incident (a school bus going through the ice in a far northern clime) we can't ever recover those lost sits atop this. The lawyer, who comes to town to try to earn money for himself and get the insurance companies to shell over a settlement, has his own ghosts, a drug using daughter who may be dying of AIDS, whom he has bailed out time after time. He is a beaten man, trying to do his job when his heart is not in it. We get to meet the families of the lost and survivors and their stories echo their confusion and sadness. The driver, herself, is a model citizen, and she is at the end of each chain. This is portrayed with such subtlety and such a delicate touch that it totally involves us. This is truly an outstanding movie.</fullReview>

The performances are great, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the tone is solid. The problem? There isn't much there."The Sweet Hereafter could have used a little more substance. Simplicity is not necessarily a bad thing, nor is little dialogue. But here, these two qualities are matched in a way that just doesn't work.Do I recommend it? Sure, if you wan't.

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and simply brilliant...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this film is brilliant on many levels and I re-viewed it several times so as to give readers a noteworthy and valuable view.On the surface, the story involves civil lawsuits, grief, tragedy, and how the fabric of communities falls apart. Love, faith, greed, hope, passion and redemption are all addressed. I honestly have to say this is one film from which I have felt so many different emotions, and director Atom Egoyan is to be highly commended.This is also not an "obvious" movie. There are no fist-fights, blood-spilling or gun swinging (Thank you Mr. Egoyan for giving US audiences credit for cerebral ability). Once I see guns pulled out, I refuse to stay at the movie. I am quite simply tired of it. The peripheral story involves "The Pied Piper of Hamlin" fairy tale and the Sarah Polley character who is physically molested by her father. She is caught in the middle of this story, and has a pivotal role.What is so incredible about this film (besides the photography, subtle and effective acting, and realistic portrayals) is that one really feels they are part of the story- we feel the pain of Bruce Greenwood's character, Billy, as he tells his friend to drop the lawsuit. His rage and disillusionment after the loss of his children is palpable.Ian Holm, as the attorney is also excellent. A man torn by despair (his daughter Zoe is a drug addict) he says to Greenwood, ..."something is wrong....or children are being taken away....they are killing each other in the street"....Another cameo role by Egoyans' wife (Aismee Khanjian) and her son, "Bear" (Simon Baker). It is a very heart rending loss and we feel for the family.Everyone must see this film. The story is well told and stark. Set in the cold environs of Canada, the mood is set for the possibilities. What is also amazing is that the drama and sheer magnitude of the accident are subtly conveyed. Mr. Egoyan is to be highly commended for reflecting the cerebral aspects of tragedy and death. This is truly a poetic film which transcends the norm. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the sweet hereafter is so meticulous you could set your watch to it...this is one of the best adaptations of a novel i've seen, despite deviating slightly from the source... instead of destroying the original work, atom egoyan works with the material to produce his own vision which expands or complements the russell banks novel...the events of the story are simple: a bus slides off the road, and kills the majority of a small town's schoolchildren... a slick lawyer appears hoping to manipulate the inhabitants of the town into a lawsuit to score a quick win against anyone with deep pockets...besides being a comment on a litigious and blame-based culture, the sweet hereafter is an examination of grief, secrecy, community, motivations and personal history...the music is the aural imprint of the visuals, dripping snow and cold with such aching beauty, played on primitive folk instruments to remind us of small town life...many have complained about the "simple" and "clumsy" pied piper reference... to them i say, explain what's clumsy about it?... my words to describe the metaphor would be fitting, complete, and solid...ian holm is brilliant... i can't speak for the accent (i've heard some criticism) but as a layered depiction of a man ruined by the loss of his daughter, he is superb... he plays the lawyer attempting to fleece money from anyone, for complex reasons... his daughter has become a drug addict, infected with AIDS, who uses her father as an easy score for money... holm cannot save her, so he exacts revenge on nameless entities... he has no-one to blame for his inexplicable loss, and thus, he must find sense by confronting an enemy somehow... a truly tragic character, as all his victories are hollow...the secret lives of the community are exposed, in the stark light of their children's absence... it does make you think about what role children play in a society... some characters side with holm's lawyer, angry and bitter... others reject the idea of revenge... all are forced to reflect on their past actions without the children to distract them, or keep them in check...the movie is not sentimental, the acting is reserved and heartfelt... the climax is superb, creating a contrast between the unfocused revenge of the town, and a more personal retribution...the images are beautiful, and the last shot is luminous... this movie is close to perfection...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without Holm, No Draw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ian Holm is the movie--what more can be said? He is the only moving part--without him the movie has no appeal, no unifying force. I mean who are these other characters--providing you can sort them all out. Each seems a typecast to further some imposed grand meaning. I think the same intent is cast on Holm but he is far too big to be managed in this way, so emerges as the one actor who can draw great sympathy and attention. The trouble is he is called upon to be disparate identities which don't work for him or the viewer--in the end, I mean. Are we with his judgements, his troubles, his emotions, his principles, his wonderful crankiness or are we supposed to view him as quite fraudulent? Given his mainstream position in society, one can only view him as very special, fascinating, full of character in a world without character... so how does a creep like Billy and the vacuous Sarah Polley char. serve as his foil? And WHY do none of the characters view this man the way the viewer does? Perhaps, as types, they have empty interiors--leaving Holm isolated and worse, meaningless.This movie is disturbing alright, but not in way we usually mean it. And please, could it be more viewer friendly--i mean these edits (could the director add one more blond girl to the cast) are often as disturbing as the movie itself. Very disappointed--quiet realism would have worked so much better.-------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sweet Hereafter took me forever to love. I remembered the first time I saw it, I hated it. Now, it has become one of my all time Top 10 favourite films. Agreeably, this film demands a lot of emotional investment from the audience. But IMHO, the returns will be ten-fold, if one is willing to give.(Spoilers ahead)I think a lot of people gave up on the show at the final point, where Sarah Polley (the crippled girl) refused to testify. That brought our conventional "Hollywoodised" expectation of a "good ending" to a grinding halt. Most audiences were just not prepared for that, especially after a prior film experience as harrowing as this one. Behaviourally speaking, we all seek closure in pain, grief, loss and suffering. So I don't really blame people who was not able to accept a film as wrenching as this one. Hell, I was one of them. But upon getting hold of the DVD by chance, all that changed.(End of spoilers)Like Magnolia, I enjoyed The Sweet Hereafter more in the intimate settings of home viewing. And so began my deeply personal, unbelievably evolving journey during those countless re-watching of The Sweet Hereafter (in fact this film has gotta be one of this masochistic poster's most watched film so far). Over the years, via my repeat viewings, I got to incrementally soak in (to the point of OD'ing on) TSW's tumultuous emotional complexity. I am hypnotised by its stark beauty and its harsh honest treatment of its subjects, its characters. I got sucked deeper and deeper into its empathetically realised fictional world, to the point that I completely lose track on why I originally/ initially dislike this film.And guess what? I slowly realised that those "minor spanners" thrown into its works was not meant to antagonise. It was necessary, it was logical, it was real. In actual fact, it was life.Chaos Theory dictated that the flutter of a butterfly's wings could lead to the forming of a hurricane sized storm. Transposing this theory onto this film(and life), so does our tiniest actions and non-action.All in, I realised many things in life are about as inter-connected as they are uncontrollable, as self-determined as they are divined. But ultimately, it boils down to you and you alone.The most important lesson in life, IMHO, is the ability to strike a balance. In our search for happiness, we should simultaneously plan/ chart the direction of our lives, while also learning to let go of our cradled misgivings, our bottled discontent. Such a provision serves to fortify our resolve, should the uncontrollable strikes. For wallowing in pain and all other negative forces is as much a debilitating addiction in itself (most people who have lost a loved one may empathise more with this statement).For once we have come to terms with the above, we may yet find that release. We may finally enter into that fabled state of self-actualisation, of grace.Of course, I am still searching for this psychological nirvana. But frankly, I would have still languished in the depths, had films like The Sweet Hereafter and Magnolia not come along and knocked some sense into self pitying me. In other words, they woke me up big time. Instead of holding on, I've learned to let go. And in so doing, I found closure.The inspirationally healing powers of cinema can thus never be underestimated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great but sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You should watch 'The Sweet Hereafter' only when you are too happy to feel unhappy due a film, or because you are quite sad already. Yes, this is a terrific film but it sure puts you in a bad mood.The story is about a lawyer. He comes to a little town which is torn apart. The reason is a crash with a school bus, which caused the death of 14 children. The lawyer himself has lost his daughter in a way. She is a drug-addict and we all know she will not become clean in this movie. The driver of the bus is one of the survivors. Some blame her, others want the lawyer to find another person or company to blame. The lawyer himself wants that the most. We understand he doesn't want this for the money he might get. Another survivor is a teenager named Nicole. She has lost the use of her legs and she tells her story by using another famous story. We see people who have lost their children, all telling their story in a way. Some secrets are revealed during the movie, I will not reveal them now.The story is a combination of events, told not chronological. We see the pain people can have and how they are trying to handle that. Some of them seek for some a form of revenge, some even kind of get that revenge. Other people seek for a way to get on with their lives. The town will never be the same again. The story is not the most important thing. The movie is about emotions, and in that way it is one of the best things I have ever seen.The performances in this film are good, the direction is great, the movie is filled with strong images, but everything in a very sad way. Again, don't watch it if you just want to have a good time, only if you feel like watching a serious but very good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizing, unrelenting, not pleasant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very dark film, hypnotic and disturbing. It has the feel of an uncomfortable yet compelling dream, with an ever-present sense of dread whose source can never quite be isolated and articulated. The experience of the viewer finds its analogy in the movie's central motif, the fated journey of the school bus, given to us in segments throughout as we learn more about the lawyer and his would-be clients, making its routine morning rounds along the curving, hilly, winter road that runs beside the river. We sense the awful destiny, but must continue to each next stop.On one level the film is about the search for answers in the face of tragedy where there may well be none, and about making peace with this fact by any means necessary. It is yet more about the ways we numb ourselves once one's own flawed existence is realized. All the main characters are addicted in one fashion or another: duty (the bus driver), blame, sex, drugs -- all situations where they can keep themselves safe from looking unblinkingly inward to the real problem. In the final frames the girl, who has been the one figure refusing to live in illusion, is backlit in a window by car headlights, arms raised and spread--as close to an angel of redemption as one can hope for in the fallen world of this film.Plan on half a day to recover from this movie, and don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An artistic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly do not say this very often, but I truly loved this film. It was sheer perfection. As of yet, I have seen this film six times, and every time, I appreciate it even more.If Atom Egoyan had not directed this piece, it would not have be brilliant. I was entralled by the intellectually manipulated parallelism and wonderful plot. Quite possibly the greatest aspect of this film was the parallelism between the children's fable of The Pied Piper of Hamelin with the plot. It allowed the viewer to more completely understand the character of Nicole, wonderfully played by Sarah Polley, who was the one of the only survivors of the bus accident. The fable paralleled her and the town in three ways: the control that her father had over her in order to pleasure himself, the fact that she was newly lame and the "bandwagon" control that lawyer Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm) had over the town. Another great aspect of this film was the simultaneous time changes. The film occured during three five periods: before the accident, during the accident, after the accident, years later with Stephens on a plane, and when Stephens was a young man. The different periods of time allowed the viewer to discover the reasons why other important parts of the film occured, and allowed the viewer to experience the character's grievences along with them. This was achieved subtly by zooming in on news dates or calendars, not cheesy date captions across the screen.Another great paralell was with Stephens' experience with his drug addicted daughter and why he wanted to bring some "salvation" to the town. I suppose that he wanted to help ease the town's grievences, because in a way, his daughter was dead to him too, and he knew what was going on inside of their heads. The music also influenced the film greatly. It made your feel the heartbreak of the town, especially Nicole, whose dreams of being a singer were ruined by the accident. Sarah Polley added her own haunting vocals to the songs on the soundtrack, as well as a heart breaking cover of The Tragically Hip's "Courage".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily my favorite film of 1997</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike 1996, and 1998, for that matter, I found it hard to pick a top ten list in 1997, but the two films far ahead of the others for me were "In The Company Of Men", and, well ahead of that, "The Sweet Hereafter". Both films really got under my skin, albeit in different ways. But what they brought with them to the screen was the assumption that those who were watching had their brains set on "attention".Atom Egoyan gives us an intelligent, thoughtful film that does not rush us through from start to finish. By the time he's done, the onion has been peeled to many layers and the depths of all the characters well plumbed. Ian Holm, whom I thought delivered the best acting job of 1997, and my favorite role for him since "Dance With A Stranger", does, indeed try to be the Pied Piper to a town that would rather try to put the tragedy behind them and proceed with "business as usual". The town can't, of course, because the accident has changed them far more deeply than they realize. The outsider comes in and lifts up some rocks with his sales pitch to the citizens and lets those deep feelings out into the open.Egoyan takes his time and gives us a well constructed picture of the town and its dynamics. As deeper explanation is called for, he gives us a view of the history or current "other" activities. This was a fine device for explaining the background of the major characters as well as for keeping the audience very much involved in the flow of the story. It's as though he tells the story in chapters sometimes titled with names and sometimes with events. I thought the pace of this film was right on target for this story, just as I thought all the other parts were on target, too. I can't wait for his new film, due out this year I understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Atom Egoyan's 'The Sweet Hereafter' centers on the motivations of two drastically different characters, Nicole Burnell (played consummately by Sarah Polley) and Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm). When a dozen children are killed in a bus accident, Stephens decides to represent the bereaved parents in a negligence case, pursuing his goal to punish the defendants with a merciless severity. Nicole, crippled by the accident, is his star witness and only hope of winning the case. While Stephens slowly tightens his authoritative grip on the town members, Nicole withdraws from him, seeing through the specious charms of the 'piped piper.' What's remarkable about this conceit is the way in which both characters' deeply buried trauma converges in a case that apparently metes out justice to the victims, but actually succeeds only in dredging up their agonizing emotional loss. As the film progresses, Egoyan presents vivid glimpses into the past through slow, gliding dolly shots and tableaux of the characters' psychological fixations. Juxtaposed with the events of the present, these images reverberate with a surreal power; the film doesn't move so much in a traditional linear narrative direction as inwardly, ever-approaching the fleeting instant of trauma without demystifying it.</fullReview>

Some of the parents at first are unwilling but they are persuaded by Mitchel Stevens that suing for damages is the right thing to do, some parents shows interest only because of the big settlement and some parents just want justice to be done.As most of the children are dead the case mainly depends only on 3 people that witnessed the accident, the bus driver Dolores Driscoll (Gabrielle Rose), Nicole Burnell (Sarah Polly) who was sitting at the front of the bus and who is now paralyzed below the waist because of the bus crashing accident and Billy (Bruce Greenwood) who was following the bus. Dolores Driscoll is willing to help to prove it wasn't her fault, Nicole Burnell is reluctant at first but agrees to help only on a condition that she wouldn't lie but Billy who lost 2 kids in the accident is against the lawsuit and tries to convince other parents to drop the lawsuit but nobody listens to him and tells him to stay out of it. In the pretrial deposition, Nicole Burnell lies and accuses the bus driver Dolores Driscoll of over speeding and thus causing the accident. After doing so all the hopes of suing the bus company with the possibility of big settlement disappears. The intention behind Nicole's lie is to punish her father who was sexually abusing her before the crash. Everybody that suffered from the accident or those who are involved in the case knows that Nicole is lying but nothing can be done and the trial never takes place.The story of the movie unfolds in non chronological order it jumps back and forth from one plot to another many times and loses the momentum. At first it was OK but after a while it was hard to watch because it never focused on the main story. In start we are introduced to several characters and each character has a story of its own. There are many different events besides the crash, which distracts the attention from the main plot. Mitchell Stevens daughter Zoe is a drug addict and she hates her father but its never explained what she hates him for also by the end of the movie Zoe tests positive for a blood test and its not explained what the test was for aids, pregnancy or something else. Also Zoe at first is shown as a homeless druggie but by the end she is well dressed. Billy has an affair with Risa (Alberta Watson) who is married to Windol (Maury Chaykin) but its never told why Risa is cheating on Windol or why can't she just leave him if she doesn't love him. Billy has also lost 2 kids in the accident but he is against the lawsuit because he knows it was just an accident and according to him it's wrong to sue for the damages but isn't it wrong to have an affair with a married woman? In the start of the movie its shown that Nicole loves her father (Sam MeCamus) and that they have a nice father daughter relationship but halfway its shown that Nicole is sexually abused by her father and by the end of the movie its shown that she hates him and therefor in order to punish him she lies and accuses an innocent person for the bus crash. Dolores Driscoll is held responsible for the accident because of over speeding but at the end of the movie she is back to driving some kind of airport passenger bus, how can she be hired just after two years for driving again when she is held responsible for the bus crash. Even the movie poster is taken from a scene that has nothing to do with the main plot of the movie.Ian Holm as Mitchel Stevens is a bit over dramatic at times but overall he plays the character nicely. Sarah Polly as Nicole Burnell does justice to her character and changes her facial expressions from a sweet to a serious bitter teen. Bruce Greenwood as Billy is convening, apart from Ion Holm, Sarah Polly and Bruce Greenwood all other actors are flat and plain and no one seems to be convincing enough in their respective characters.Atom Egoyon screenplay is too weak and confusing, he fails in directing The Sweet hereafter, he doesn't uses the right tone and right timing to introduce the characters and unfolds the story in non chronological order which only confuses the audience with all those subplots, The only good thing about his directing is choosing the beautiful locations for shoot. Cinematography is beautifully done by Paul Sarossy.Almost all of the main characters have a story, which is never explained, their personal stories are never given the depth they needed. I hardly see any place for those untold personal stories in the movie but they are introduced which drags the attention from the main plot and half way through the movie I didn't care for the accident and just wanted the movie to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great movie. A beautiful picture of how people deal with trajedy and sadness beyond imagining. It was only mildly disturbing. I've certainly seen worse, but only a few. The one scene I almost puked was*SPOILERS*when the dad of the girl who survived the crash started making out with her. I almost cried. And that's saying something, cause I never cry in movies. I cry after books sometimes, yes, but almost never movies.Anyway, this was a great movie and I would certainly reccomend it to anyone who doesn't mind incest and bus crashes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd seen parts of this film on Sundance and other channels before, but I finally went out and rented it the other night. I was completely amazed by this film and am still haunted by it a day after watching it. The visuals were stunning, the acting was subtle and brilliant, the story was incredible, and I really didn't know what to expect when the ending hit me and made me rethink everything I'd just seen. I noticed someone had compared this film's style to that of films by Stanley Kubrick, and I think the comparison is accurate. The film is distanced from the characters, but that distance gives the viewers a chance to see the entire picture as well as ourselves. Not only that, but the shots of the beautiful land were quite Kubrick-esque as well. I loved the film, and plan on watching it again soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful yet tragic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is only the second movie by Atom Egoyan that I have seen - the first being "Exotica". With this one he became definitely one of my favorites. Never before have I seen so tragic a story presented in such a beautiful manner. I knew to expect Egoyan's non-linear narration and whereas some people might be disturbed, in my opinion it was the only way to tell this story. Otherwise it would have lost a lot of aesthetic and narrational value.I won't reiterate the plot here, I'll rather express the sentiments I had after seeing this movie.It's a stroke of luck I had the chance to see this in a theater, only one would show it, and only for a week. And the theater having only two people watching besides myself, the experience was unforgettable. Slowly revolving, circling around the central theme of Loss and considering it from all angles, it is a very complete movie, having amazingly few elements that don't belong.The acting was very much in place, the versatile Ian Holm as the lawyer struggling with the gradual losing of his own daughter, Zoe. Sarah Polley portrays the surviving Nicole very delicately, seeming to be a fragile young girl but yet finding a way to get back at her father.In short I loved this movie very much and recommend it to everyone who doesn't want to watch movies "the easy way". And I'm definitely going to read the novel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sweet Hereafter is a study in subtlety. I am not surprised that a fair number of people here dismiss it as pretentious trash. It requires the viewer to pay attention and make connections that are not always stated explicitly. Not everyone will have the patience (or...dare I say it...intelligence?) to do so.The turning-point of the movie is a surprising action by one of the central characters late in the film. At first, it may not be entirely clear why she chooses to do what she does. Here too, one needs to consider previous scenes carefully and try to view other characters from her point of view.The DVD has a commentary track (in the "special features" section) by the director and the author of the book; it clarifies quite a few things that might remain hazy. This is, in any case, a movie that needs to be watched more than once.Haunting, poignant, sorrowful without resorting to tearjerking, perceptive, mesmerizing...for viewers who can handle that subtlety, a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a small town a school bus crash kills a large number of children. A lawyer travels to the town and begins to recruit families to start a lawsuit to claim compensation for the crash. However the different families all deal with their grief in different ways and he meets with many different approaches to the suit.This film looks at the grief of lost children and how it is dealt with. Stephens is a lawyer who tries to rally feelings of anger amongst the families so that he can generate a lawsuit against the bus company or anyone who has deep enough pockets to sue. This shows the different ways in which the grief comes out and how it is dealt with. It is well observed and beautifully put together.The director is faultless and is slow and patient. The set up is also great ? with three time lines woven together without creating confusion, rather each compliments the other. The low key nature is evident in the crash itself which manages to be both horrible and simple at the same time. However the story doesn't have too much to say ? but it's still very moving to listen to it anyway.I must admit not knowing the majority of the cast ? I really only knew 4 or 5 faces. However all were good and totally believable in their roles. Holm was especially good. He manages to hold our interest despite having quite an unlikable role as, essentially, an ambulance chaser.Overall this is very good but at times it seemed a little too distant. However this is a minor flaw in an otherwise well written, well directed and well observed film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stellar Egoyan adaptation of Russel Banks novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter is a shattering, heartbreaking study of the lives of people coping with a tragic school bus accident in a small, close-knit community. Dealing with a larger than usual number of fully developed characters, Egoyan opts for a cryptic, almost obscure approach to the timeline of events in the story. This understated style and its accompanying complexity demand patience and attention from the audience, but the benefits are worth the trouble. Gorgeous photography and haunting music (particularly the stunning version of "Courage" sung by Sarah Polley) complement the amazing performances. Ian Holm's troubled lawyer and Bruce Greenwood's wounded father are two of the many standouts. The Sweet Hereafter is a must for lovers of literate filmmaking.</fullReview>

This movie is filmed beautifully. Every actor played on an extremely high level and not a single miscast was to be found in this movie! Overall it was a great watch.For me that was only destructed by the story. To me it felt, that the original novel was not suited to become a movie. The whole movie lacked a red thread. Strings didn't seem to be connected, and i failed finding a bigger meaning. All I found have been starting points, ideas. Great ideas, but in the end, the movie didn't work for me.

		<shortDescription>Secrets and Lies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brings to mind the saying that it's not about the crime, it's about the cover-up. Wonderful, reflective account of the fall-out from a tragic school bus accident in which many children from one small town die. In attempting to file suit on behalf of some of the parents of the children who died in the crash, lawyer Mitchell Stephens (an astonishing Ian Holm) pries open the secrets and dualities that exist in any place, and perhaps particularly poignantly, in a small town. The pain and the falsehoods within the small town are perhaps more deeply felt because there is a higher risk of pain if secrets are revealed, given that relationships are so tightly wound. I have not seen any of Egoyans's films until now and I bought this film on videotape some years ago when I saw it offered very cheaply. It had sat quietly in my entertainment center for some time and having now seen it, I should have made the time to see it earlier. One needs to be a mature film viewer, to appreciate the hedges and the things unsaid, to appreciate this film. Bruce Greenwood as Billy, a mechanic around town who follows the bus every day in order to remain closer to his children since the death of their mother, has perhaps the most honest reaction to Stephens without fear of fall-out or unexpected consequences, although at the time, his opposition seems somewhat unreasonable and stubborn. Sam (Tom McCamus), an apparently upstanding family man would appear to be baffled by his daughter Nicole's (the very talented Sarah Polley) testimony in the investigation into the case, but in this town of thwarted goals and failed dreams, the viewer will understand her testimony and recognize Sam's apparently muted response. Gabrielle Rose as sincere bus driver Dolores also offers a powerful performance as a woman particularly heartbroken by the crash and Greenwood also delivers an Oscar-worthy performance and shows his versatility as an actor, that versatility that allows him to portray President Kennedy and this humble character with credibility and honesty. The cinematography and the high, slow-panning camera shots, particularly over the pristine Canadian landscape, evoke even more poignantly, the beautiful sadness of the drama happening in the town. Egoyan does not patronize his characters which would have been very easy to do for a lesser director. He recognizes the breadth and variety of their experiences and credits them with shaping and coloring the characters' lives. Also, Egoyan's use of the camera and a poignant but far from maudlin array of songs only go to strengthen the emotional heft of the story. In short, this wonderful film is a credit to its excellent cast and fabulous director and it deserved all the critical plaudits it received.</fullReview>

We have different narrators, whose voices are mixed and puzzled together: only at the end, the spectator is able to compose the puzzle and understand the whole story. Technically very well done, I like it so much because of the plot, yes, because of the director's technique and ability, but more than everything else because of the atmosphere, the music, the landscape, and because of the remarkable stories of the narrators, common people with uncommon lives, just like most of the common people. It must be seen, I cannot describe with words the atmosphere of the movie. All I can say is that times seems to stop when the accident happens: the town and the people involved seem to be suspended in time, until... the truth comes out at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skip book, see movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Books are almost never based on movies and so we have no way of judging whether they would be better or worse than the originals. Movies, on the other hand, are constantly being created out of other materials. Whether this is simply a historical accident due to their recent arrival on the scene we'll never know. But we do know that movies are almost universally inferior to the books they're based on, at least in how well they translate the book author's original vision.The Sweet Hereafter might be an exception to this. Based on Russell Banks' novel of the same name, Egoyan's Hereafter raises an at-times undistinguished novel to a different plane. Where the novel gives us first-person accounts that sound a bit phony and too much alike in places, the movie gives us well-cast characters whose differing points of view are as clear as the film's wintertime images.The novel takes place in upstate New York. Inevitably, Egoyan has moved the setting slightly north and made the story slightly more Canadian (how else to account for the presence of the ever-so-non-American Ian Holm). But in doing so he has also pared away some of the novel's fat. In particular he eliminated the goofy pseudo-mythical final section at the county fair dirt track, a chapter that feels like something out of Robert Coover's The Origin of the Brunists. It's almost as though Egoyan saw and understood this story more clearly than Banks did. I can't think of higher praise for a director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Atom Egoyan's "The sweet hereafter" puts you in a rapturous emotional daze. Adapted from a novel by Russell Banks, Egoyan fills the void of his earlier work and at the same time brings his puzzle structure trickery to spellbinding new levels of artistry. "The sweet hereafter" is a new kind of mystical fairy tale, one that seeks to uncover the forces holding the world together even as they tear it apart. Mitchelle Stevens (Ian Holm) a lonely attorney, journeys to a small town in the snowy wilds of British Columbia. The townspeople have suffered a cataclysmic tragedy and he has come to try to represent them legally in their grief. Egoyan, gliding between past and present, teases our curiosity, revealing the details of the disaster only gradually. By the time we witness, in a memorably chilling image what actually happened the event feels part of something larger, a disturbance in the universe. "The sweet hereafter" is a hymn to the agony of loss, yet it is also saturated with the radiance of parental love. The characters we see here cherished their children. Holm's lawyer has lost his own daughter, a drug addict who spiraled into the gutter and now phones him only for money. He interviews his fellow sufferers with a fascinating mix of motives: He's part ambulance chaster, pat empathetic guru. Egoyan has a Lynchian vision of innocence bound with evil. It's embodies in his brillant use of "The pied piper of Hamelin" as a siren song of erotic dread. This is a movie in which darkness emanates from without and without - form the choices made by a seductive parent, to the random threat of a nest of baby spiders. The film which begins in devestation and ends in grace, is about the birth of a new world, in which parents and children love can love each other helplessly without, ever feeling that they're fully connected. "The sweet hereafter" leaves you shaken and ecstatic as the same time, transported by the vision of a major film artist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immensely Subtly Strong Human Disaster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an immensely subtly strong film, with only one haut violent sentence, violence from the only bystander to the protagonist lawyer who is saved only by his cell phone. A view of how a small Canadian town survives with the omni-distasteful human disaster that is multiple child deaths.Polley's Nicole is fed up of the ongoing, physical sexual abuse from her father. The viewers are shown that this is accepted in their relationship, it is not physically forced nor psychologically forced but psychologically justified by the father to the extent that they appear as if they are in a contented father-daughter relationship. She stops it all, Casteneda-style.The entire film is a build up to the trial, the surviving parents and townfolk vs. those who are blamed, the alledgedly-faulty-bus manufacturers in a compensation law suit. Until you realise, when this young lady in an abused girl now wheelchair-bound post-accident, tells a strange and new statement in court that stops the case, that this is not the film. The film is the situation, in a more filmic Mike Leigh soaking-up-the-atmosphere style human and human interaction film.The abusive father is played frightfully well, by an Egoyan actor whom also starred in Exotica, with his disturbingly grimy hair that he bears. It's his relationship with her throughout the film that sickens the underlying ongoings in the town, he has such a hold over her that she willingly, in strong contrast to the razored and totally psychologically blocked abuse within the Palmer family in Twin Peaks, gets into bed with him, in the incident shown in the film, into a bed of hay lit powerfully by candles and accompanied by a guitar.Polley wrote and performed the lead vocals in the music.There is the air the Polley's character has stopped her abuse by her act, at least made an effort to get the town to look at her in their question of why, but the audience is not in any way told this and instead left with the fact that she is now far less capable of stopping her fathers incestuous abuse.The snow setting is apt and the snow repelling teepee-like house of the 'hippie' parents with an adopted child named bear is an interesting textured object.There is a lot to this film. It is a enticing and unusual journey best viewed.--- by Jerome, computer coder, author, and voter of 1,000 films.</fullReview>

Survivor Polley is left severely disabled. Into this cauldron of despair steps Holm as an ambulance-chasing lawyer who is losing his own daughter to drug addiction.He hopes to entice the parents of the victims into legal action against the authorities, and finds willing support from a number of them, including Polley's parents, McCamus and Johnson. But his case is vehemently opposed by Greenwood who, as fate would have it, witnessed his own two children die in the tragedy. Egoyan's drama, based on Banks' novel, concerns itself not so much with death as with the crippling guilt of the survivor. Chilling, pertinent and brave, its dislocated structure shuffles chronology, imagery and information to build towards a devastating climax. Holm's performance is a tour de force.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent themes but weak storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atom Egoyan deals with social themes and intelligent ideas in his movies, the best of which was Ararat. His subject matter is never run-of-the-mill or commercially focused. Ararat dealt with the Armenian holocaust by the Young Turks circa WW-I. Egoyan may have brought special passion to that project because he himself is of Armenian origin. The Sweet Hereafter, made five years before Ararat is clearly the work of the same director. He deals with social themes, human pain and suffering and has the same distant style of storytelling which is not geared to warm audiences. If you like art-house films and have the patience to sit through a slow-paced film, you may find The Sweet Hereafter a rewarding experience.The central "plot" revolves around a school bus crash in a small-town and the efforts of an out-of-town lawyer, played by Ian Holm, to cobble together a lawsuit for the survivors and families of victims. He is a man who is grappling with his own demons. Divorced from his wife, he has only one daughter who is a heroin junkie and he may be to blame for her alienation and wasted life. I won't comment more on the intricate ties between the lives of the people in the town, however, no one comes out looking good with perhaps the exception of Sarah Polley who was an aspiring singer now crippled by the accident. What is admirable about The Sweet Hereafter are the themes it explores. The major problem that I've had with Egoyan's other efforts including Ararat is that he takes his time making his point. True, he is dealing with complex subjects as opposed to plots. But, he doesn't know how to draw audience interest - the tricks of the trade that a Wilder used in The Lost Weekend or an Otto Preminger displayed in several movies. I also think that if Donald Sutherland had indeed been cast in the role of the lawyer instead of Ian Holm, he would have added a dimension to a character that is quite bland.</fullReview>

This film is as beautiful and moving as a great poem, and a poem fittingly brings the house down in the film's climax.

Listening to her read to the children is an unforgettable screen moment. You come to love her more and more as the true nature of her life reveals itself.  I have never seen such beautiful cinematography. Holm's performance is magnificent. The whole cast is great, including Greenwood. The sound track, like the entire film, affected me deeply. ***Spoiler*** As a lawyer, I understood why Holm decided to stop pursuing the case. It was a decision influenced as much by emotion and human understanding as legal process. Lawyers act like human beings some times, and Holm certainly had some feelings. **end of spoiler** This is Egoyan's best movie that I have seen, more complete than Exotica. It is a beautiful masterpiece, and once seen, will never be forgotten. It might even change your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die is the book I found out about this film, it sounded like and I confirmed it as an independent film, the title obviously had some association with death, but I didn't know anything about the plot, so it would be interesting for me to try whatever. Basically a small town has been devastated by a tragic event; a school bus driven by Dolores Driscoll (Gabrielle Rose) and loaded with most of the children of the town attending the local school was driving during the snowy winter morning, when it suddenly hit an icy patch, it skids off road down the hill until it reaches the lake an crashes through the ice and sinks, drowning most victims inside. Many of the isolated village community members are mourning the deaths of their children, including Billy (Bruce Greenwood), the Walkers who lost their mentally developed and challenged son Sean (Devon Finn), and the Ottos who lost their aboriginal son Bear (Simon Baker) who was adopted. Some did survive the accident, including now wheelchair bound aspiring songstress Nicole Burnell (Sarah Polley), and Dolores, we see the accident in flashbacks while lawyer Mitchell Stevens (Sir Ian Holm) has arrived in the Canadian town wanting to take some slight advantage of the situation and get the parents of the twenty dead children to sue whatever party may be guilty for causing the incident, he will obviously represent those who agree to it. He plans to target the big companies and organisations with big amounts of money and who have some involvement with the school, most of the parents he see accept his proposal and see it as some way to get over the grieving, others are simply interested in the potential for the money, and some like Billy want nothing to do with a lawsuit. Stevens himself has demons as he suffered the death of his son and still feels grief, so he knows how the victims feel, but his son's death has also resulted in his daughter Zoe (Caerthan Banks) turning to drugs, losing respect for her father and any real relationship with him, and he knows life in the town has never been the same since this terrible event. Also starring Tom McCamus as Sam Burnell, Arsinée Khanjian as Wanda Otto, Alberta Watson as Risa Walker, Mousehunt's Maury Chaykin as Wendell Walker, Brooke Johnson as Mary Burnell, David Hemblen as Abbott Driscoll and Peter Donaldson as Schwartz. Holm gives a pretty good glum performance as the ambulance-chasing who is trying to earn but also help those in the same grief-stricken situation he is in, Greenwood gets a reasonably good amount of time on screen, and I agree that from what I remember Polley is exceptional as the survivor paralysed by the accident. I will confess that I drifted in some of the story, particularly the parts involving a lawsuit and what have you, but it was certainly interesting to see a story about how one truly tragic incident can change the dynamics and personalities of a whole town community, it has got the right amount of intensity and atmosphere to keep you watching, a worthwhile psychological drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Director for Atom Egoyan (Felicia's Journey) and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The use of the non-linear structure fails for a primary reason, it ruins the whole dramatic structure of the tale. Since we know what happens early in the film (save for a few minor details), because of Stevens' reactions and body language, there is little drama in the girl's testimonial lie. Even worse, because we know of the crash, the scene of the actual bus crash has little impact- there is nothing that allows us to feel the terror of the moment because we know it's coming. And the whole focus on guilt and loss turns precious in a monologue Stevens tells his daughter's best friend, about how he nearly had to save his daughter's life by cutting her throat when she was bitten by spiders as a baby. The whole flashback within the flashforward does not work for the lighting and dreaminess is so gauzey, saccharine, and so, 'This is the big moment of the film,' that the viewer almost feels embarrassed at Egoyan's cluelessness at the inappropriateness of it all. What Egoyan does is fetishize guilt and loss, not examine it, as he claims in one of the DVD's bonus features. Whether this is because Egoyan is simply too immature to approach the subject, or thought he did and simply failed does not matter. The Sweet Hereafter simply is not that deep of a film, and had it gone a more standard route, it actually would have worked better. Overall, it is that rare film that 'gilds the lily' to the point of taking an interesting premise and killing it. Simply put, a tragic subject matter does not automatically make for a deep film. Yes, The Sweet Hereafter does not sink to the depths of Brokeback Mountain nor Crash, but it does not rise to the heights of a film by a master like Ingmar Bergman, Michelangelo Antonioni, nor Yasujiro Ozu.The DVD, put out by New Line Films shows the hour and fifty-six minute long film in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and has a pretty good commentary track by Egoyan and Banks, although Banks provides little insight, outside of cheering Egoyan on. Egoyan's comments are very hit and miss- praising the aforementioned car wash sequence, and actually telling the viewer that this represents a passage to light. Well, duh! Banks does, however, shine a bit more in a featurette where he and Egoyan discuss the book and film at a university. Then there is a strange feature where each cast member answers two questions, although the videos are part of the actors' filmography feature. There is a Charlie Rose interview segment with Egoyan, which is always well wrought, the poem The Pied Piper Of Hamelin in illustrated mode, Canadian and American film trailers, and an isolated musical score.The Sweet Hereafter is not a bad film- on a scale of 0-100 I'd rank it a passable 70, but that's still light years from being great cinema. Failure or not, there is enough skill in many aspects of this film, especially technically, to make me want to explore other works by Egoyan, however, if this film is any indication, Egoyan may be one of those filmmakers who'd do best to rely on the screen writing skills of others, for this film's greatest flaws lie in its screenplay (not just in ill wrought scenes but in well written scenes that are placed poorly in the linear structure of the film, and having read the fiction of Russell Banks, I doubt the screenplay's flaws originated with the novel. Long live the word!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My biggest peeve with this film is that its seeming transcendence into deeper human nature may be contrived or pretentious- possibly the biggest insult to any piece of art. I think so because the multiple narrative structure seem to be constructed with a very subjective flow. What I mean is that I don't think the form reflects the content. Which is a rule only the mostly godly of artists can break. There are many suggestive scenes along with scenes which are artsy in-themselves without clear contingency to anything else in the plot sequence- perhaps I'm functioning at a much too low level of comprehension. I find that the isolated segments of pseudo-artistic bravado gratuitous to the level of cheap American comedy. At least cheap American comedy is entertaining as long as I shut off my snob meter.That aside, the acting is pretty intense and the music reflects the scenery which is desolate, beautiful and haunting. However, I find that neither of these strong points are supported by the weak and pretentious plot structure and as such they draw attention to themselves and disrupts a basic coherence and harmony which makes a good film. This could have been a great film.-G.G. Jan.27.08</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie where a director tries to be Kieslowski without success. I almost falled asleep trying to catch what was going on during all this kitch pointless too much ordinary crying around. Moreover, what's bad about wanting to fight for your rights?The community could have stayed together in doing that.The acting of the girl on the wheel chair is the only thing that i save.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is too much! Overstated, overworked, and overacted; and those flute-like sounds finally become humorously annoying. I am going to stick my neck out a bit here and suggest that someone who liked this film would enjoy more the brilliant "Ulysses' Gaze." For where "Ulysses' Gaze" truly is a work of art, "The Sweet Hereafter" is a desperate doodle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, to enjoy this film you have to be very patient. It runs very slowly, nothing interesting happens, there are too many names and different people coming and going, you never know what's going on; More than that, you don't get to see the accident until 60 minutes. It's like you're watching a soap opera with good actors, but with a unsatisfying development. 70 minutes was enough for me to turn it off because of it's boring scenes and conversations. I really expected much more for "Sweet Hereafter"; you know, it didn't work for me personally, don't know how it'd work with other people. IMDb wants me to write more, so I'll just repeat that I didn't like that...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my kind of film. It's slow and not a lot happens. It's classy, atmospheric and oozes class. Not one for the MTV 'no attention' idiots who hang out at the multiplexes. Holm is excellent and siezes top billing. The supporting cast are equally good. Superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I`ve visited this page and can`t believe the critical acclaim THE SWEET HEREAFTER has received . An average rating of 7.9 and many glowing reviews from IMDB users . My own opinion is that this movie left me colder than the snow covered Canadian snowscapes that feature throughout the picturePerhaps I shouldn`t complain or even dare criticise this movie because within the opening ten minutes I knew it was going to be a frozen turkey and should have changed channels instead of watching it to the final credits . Ian Holm is one of the most overlooked British actors alive today but even his performance isn`t up to much . Did anyone else notice that his accent keeps slipping from English to a non specific North American accent all the way through the movie ? Was it just me or did anyone else think the actress playing his daughter was absolutely awful ? Watch the scene again where Mitchell is on the phone to his daughter and tell me it`s not a bad performance . I will confess I`m not a fan of art house cinema and unfortunately THE SWEET HEREAFTER is an art house movie devoid of any type of interest to a mainstream audience and I also got the feeling throughout that the original source novel is just too complicated , character driven and low concept to be filmable so perhaps anyone venturing onto this page before seeing the movie adaptation should bare that in mind</fullReview>
