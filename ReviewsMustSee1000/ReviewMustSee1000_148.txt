		<shortDescription>One of the BEST PIX for 2010</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say... I watched this movie twice. At first brush... I couldn't quite get past the pain and heaviness of the film... and at second screening, I really got to enjoy the (biutiful) visual metaphors that the director wanted to paint for us. It is indeed grim... and human. Like life, and perhaps a reflection of these days, not everything ends up happily ever after... we all are surviving each day in our own ways. This slice of family life, in a small quarter of Barcelona, is not glossed over and prettied up like most Hollywood films that we've slowly grown to despise (I know I don't speak for everyone). This is not the film that you go to to escape from reality... it's reality facing right back at you. It paints a perspective on the lives of those living on the frayed edges of our society, in every part of the world. For me, I think it is a pity that none of the Big Six picked it up for wider distribution. And that's the sad note for today's American cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biutiful (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biutiful is a rather complex and interesting film, one that I have to admit is still sinking in as I'm still piecing together the dots of a rather sprawling storyline. Biutiful is a film that exists within the margins of society, it's everywhere we don't want to live, it's everyone we don't want to meet; it's all the struggles we'd rather not face and then some. As a result, the film is loud, violent, crazy, shameful, desperate, dirty and all other manner of words that describe the run down storefronts and apartments of the worst lived areas. Intelligently and bravely the films central idea is lost in the crowd, as obscured as the desires of its inhabitants, it's a confusing and chaotic place to be, but it works here where it wouldn't elsewhere. I would really like to watch this one again in hopes of better connecting the dots of a life lived on the fringe of society, entrenched in wrong doing, but not without its struggle with sensible moral. I think the idea behind Biutiful is that life, no matter how destitute and forgotten can be beautiful, it all depends on how you except and claim it.Biutiful is the story of Uxbal, a shady man who's life is filled with turmoil, from admissions of an uncared for terminal illness, to unstable lovers, to unruly children, to spirits of which he can commune, to the lives of the underpaid migrant workers that he pimps out to whoever will employ them. It's easy for Uxbal to look back on his forty year existence and measure it in disappointments. But Uxbal is also a sensitive and caring man, who is able to make these admissions and in doing so take the steps to make his life it's own unique form of biutiful, but with a city more a crumbling metropolis and people who bar his progress with any step, can Uxbal truly bring some semblance of beauty to his life before it is painfully cut short, or will the darkness and depravity of the world around him swallow him and his desires whole, the answer is well worth discovering.So I just can't say a whole lot with one viewing, but there are some things that stand out immediately. The film is several things, sad, funny, scary, creepy, intense, and as obvious as it seems, beautiful. Definitely some of the nicest camera work this year, yes it's sometimes shaky but you must consider the imagery it captures; some scenes are purely blissful for a film fan to witness. The editing is so great here that even though you know where the film is going its still exciting to get there. Javier Bardem gives a brilliant performance here, and it will take awhile for the viewer to except that Uxbal is an undesirable, but once you allow yourself to slip into his shoes, you begin to really get a sense of the man and his life. The seediness of the streets, and the strife and struggle of the humans in them are written all over this man, and Bardem really gives himself over to this character, warts and all, and gives us a brilliantly flawed person worthy of our attention. The rest of the cast is also well played, their stories contain their own levels of thoughtfulness and intrigue that both separates and connects to and from our protagonist intelligently. The script feels very human, there are no major verses of dialogue, people talk, feel and behave very naturally in this film, despite all coming from abnormal situations. Virtually no exposition on why this film exists, its meaning is wonderfully felt but not fully explained. The direction is so subtly smart that I was surprised to miss some of the most inventive and thought provoking foreshadowing I've seen in a film. Really just an all out creative and arresting affair, I'm trying hard not to use the word beautiful, but its fits every gritty frame of this film. The cinematography is awesome, really blown away thinking back to the brilliance of some of these shots, great work with the actors and the environments. My only complaint is that sound editing got a little to jarring, I get it's supposed to be an ugly film, but high pitched beeps and boops are annoying anyway you cut it (the 2001 monolith can suck it, thanks Kubrick), it drives home the madness of the setting, but I actually covered my ears at one point to muffle the noise. Other than that, the film is wildly challenging and rewarding for the viewer, I am blown away by the artistry here, it took this film to great heights, it made ugly pretty, which is no easy feat. If you don't like your films themes to be cut and dried, you're going to want to check out, pick apart and decipher the themes and mysteries of Biutiful, as it is more than deserving of such treatment.So yes I liked this film quite a bit, but will hasten to rave until I've fully understood the motive of it. Thematically it's no straightforward story, there's something deep underneath all the grime, and I'm glad I dirtied my hands on it, and can't wait to do so again. A film for those who love long walks on the wild side and never choose the easy way out; a real decent thinking persons movie. A film in a class of it's own that breaks conventions in the best ways possible, and definitely among the years best films that I've seen thus far. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ugly Beauty of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Biutiful" is a sublime and intense epic - and possibly the best film of the year by a long way. Even though the setting is very different, the film shares themes with "American Beauty", and it succeeds in creating something close to a modern myth. It tells the story of Uxbal, who is a tough but loving single father of two young children, separated from his self-destructive bi-polar wife, Marambra. He scrapes a living in the backstreet black economy of Barcelona, where he operates as a middleman for those who exploit illegal immigrant labor. In addition to his dubious worldly talents, Uxbal possesses the psychic gift to convey messages from the recently deceased to their grieving relatives - and sometimes he compromises his principles by accepting payment for this service. Uxbal's discordant way of life reflects the essential human condition - trapped between the spiritual and material worlds - and when he learns that he is terminally ill with cancer, it seems as if his body must be manifesting his inner conflict. After his doctor informs him of his imminent death, Uxbal begins searching for a trustworthy person to raise his two children after he dies - and "Biutiful" tells of his struggle to put his affairs in order and accomplish this apparently impossible task while dark forces throw obstacles in his path. Those who have seen Inarritu's previous film "Amores Perros" will find themselves in familiar territory as Uxbal weaves his way through a labyrinth of mean streets and desperate people battling for survival. On the surface there is only the selfishness and brutality of a dog-eat-dog world, alleviated by brief moments of tenderness and self-sacrifice - but hidden amongst the chaos, one can perceive the age-old journey of the immortal hero towards liberation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificently grim but also slightly metaphysical picture that is able to reveal hope out of the depths of despair for its main character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Uxbal is a protagonist of the highest dramatical calibre not unlike Hamlet or Oedipus. This ailing father of two children and spouse of an unstable woman suffering from borderline syndrome and drug addiction, has departed on a calvary that seems to have no end. In ever more harsh and merciless ways Uxbal is undergoing every sort of torment and kickback thrown upon him by the demons of his gravely deseased Fortune. Indeed, Uxbal finds out that he is suffering from a terminal form of prostate cancer. Even though in essence Uxbal is a good man - fate seems to have chosen quite a different direction for him as where we usually believe our chance and luck to be. However, in this struggle from amidst the darkness of his daily existence in the messy streets of Barcelona Uxbal somehow is able to come to term with his fate without giving in to despair. In fact, through a gradual process of material disattachment he rises to a level of wise and unprecedented reconciliation with destiny as well as with the people he cares about and loves. After a long and painful journey of cancerous ordeals and unwanted horrors, at the end Uxbal is ready to make his last and necessary sacrifice before he can depart into the snowy landscape of his timetranscending visionary dream of a chanceful reunification with his grandfather killed by Franco's royalists during the Civil War. At the press conference in Cannes last May 2010 Alejandro González Inárittu declared in his vehimently articulate manner: "Even if darkness seems to be everywhere, Biutiful offers many touches of hope. I'd even say it's my most optimistic film. Uxbal's character is full of light. He puts a lot into organising his life, helping his children, loving other people." Biutiful is a truly emotional and even spiritual masterpiece of the most magnificent kind. For whomever is willing or able to follow the main characters throughout their dazzling daily struggles to survive on the shady side of life in Barcelona whilst persisting in their illusionary and mostly illegal follies that are the unfortunate demonstrations of their communal longing for some warmth and wealth and happiness, he or she will be rewarded with a discovery that might be as liberating and emotional for Uxbal as it will be for the viewer following his endeavours from so nearby it hurts. What Inárittu has tried throughout his ruthless, fastpaced, extremely honest, direct and intimate style of holding the camera as close to one's skin as possible, is to make us sense and realize that in the end their might indeed be something like a human soul after all. A discovery not unlike the one pursued by his tormented characters from that other masterpiece of his: 21 Grams. The viewer who is able to show sympathy for Uxbal, will be able to witness a most remarkable moral recovery in the inner self of our slowly but steadily vanishing hero. In a very humble but all the more remarkable way Uxbal somehow managed to keep some ray of light awake amidst the darkness that is closing in on him from the realms of his grim unfortunate reality. In the end, on the threshold of his toilet and bedroom and amidst the company of his daughter and a refugee he was so kind as to adopt in his house after her husband was deported back to Africa, Uxbal is able to finally reach the surface of his dignity again. This happens while he is literally dying and physially collapsing. But spiritually, his ascendance back upon the slippery slope of his generous but tested and tormented mind towards a state of peacefulness and grace, is a tour de force indeed. It is magical. Mysterious. Hopeful. Just like the entire encadrement of Inarritu's latest masterpiece. And just like Javier Bardem's amazing achievement to make us weep and at the same time feel happy for the faith that he was able to sustain out of the cold and unjust misery that chased him all along his final destiny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biutiful offers many touches of hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light" ? Dylan Thomas Nominated for an Oscar for both Best Foreign Film and Best Actor (Javier Bardem), Alejandro Inarritu's Biutiful is a story about those who live on the margins: Sengalese immigrants, Chinese sweatshop workers, small-time criminals, and corrupt cops who feed at the trough. Set in the seedy back streets of Barcelona, Spain, Biutiful (copying a child's spelling of the word) is not only about fear and degradation but also about faith in the possibility of redemption. The film not only explores the pain caused by globalization and human trafficking but also delves into the mystery and contradictions of life in which beauty and misery can exist side by side. It is not always pleasant to watch but it is an honest and often poetic film in which there are no stock characters. Even the worst of them are three-dimensional human beings caught in a tangled web of circumstances.Magnificently performed by Bardem, Uxbal works as a middle man, finding jobs on construction sites for undocumented aliens from China and Africa, and supplying goods to illegal street vendors. He must deal not only with the illegal activities he has chosen to be a part of, but with his own torments - a wife (Maricel Alvarez) who is a prostitute and suffers from bi-polar disease, his two small children, Ana and Mateo (Hanaa Bouchaib and Guillermo Estrella) who long for stability and love, and a diagnosis of cancer that gives him only a few months to live. Uxbal is a character of contradictions, caught between his willingness to do what it takes to survive, even if it means going outside the law, and his love for his family and concern for the immigrants. These contradictions do not always make sense but lend his character a lifelike reality. He is also a spiritual medium who speaks with the dead or dying who are crossing over and provides comforting messages to those left behind (characteristically for a fee).The film is shot by Rodrigo Prieto with a hand-held camera that enhances a feeling of intimacy. In the opening scene, Uxbal is seen in a snowy forest with his grandfather who left Spain for Mexico, another connection between Uxbal and the spirit world. This scene takes on more meaning by the end of the film. Inarritu throws many people and many situations into the mix, perhaps too many and the subplots do not always gel. There is Uxbal's brother Tito (Eduard Fernandez) who is involved with drugs and strip joints and sleeps with Uxbal's wife Marambra, a Sengalese family Ekweme and Ige (Cheijh Ndiave and Diaryatou Daff) living in Spain illegally, and the relationship of two gay Chinese criminals Hai and Liwei (Cheng Tai Shen and Luo Jin).When the police arrest his friend, Ekweme, Uxbal promises to look after his wife Ige and their infant son Samuel and Ige takes on the role of his nanny, much to the delight of the children. As Uxbal's health begins to fail, his ties to the crime bosses come asunder, and his relationship with his family reaches a breaking point, he turns to the shaman Bea (Ana Wagener) to seek guidance, ask for forgiveness, and strengthen his connection to the other side. While Uxbal is not the reincarnation of St. Francis of Assisi and has contributed to human suffering, he seeks redemption in the love that he provides for his children, his patience with his wife's condition, and his attempts to reach out and protect the exploited.As Inarritu has said, "Even if darkness seems to be everywhere, Biutiful offers many touches of hope. I'd even say it's my most optimistic film. Uxbal's character is full of light. He puts a lot into organizing his life, helping his children, loving other people." To paraphrase Walt Whitman, "If you have patience and indulgence towards people, reexamine all you have done, dismiss what insults your very soul, your flesh shall become a great poem." With whatever dignity he has left and after much resistance, Uxbal comes to terms with his own mortality, helping him to move beyond guilt and despair to confirm the beauty and preciousness of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's official, Javier Bardem is one of the greatest contemporary actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A father's love for his children amidst the everyday life of crime in Barcelona. This encapsulates pretty much the basic premise of this movie, and has said nothing about the content or merit.I'm sure quite a few reviews about this disturbing but nevertheless transcendent film will be written here. Next to the praise, a lot of people will be appalled, others indifferent, then there will be the ones who complain that Biutiful is nothing more than showing our bad world being bad. It may be that, but it is also full of promise and dare one say it, love. And it would be foolish to ignore the hope that can be seen amidst the pain and chaos. I?árritu shows us that we as human are able to care, for ourselves and each other.And if nothing else, "Biutiful" proves, now officially, that Javier Bardem is one of the greatest contemporary actors.Felicidades y gracias</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Biutiful" is devastating. Not only isn't it a comfortable and audience-pleasing film but in this case the story's really shocking, well acted and directed and, overall, terribly sad. The film is basically about good and evil, death and life and similar topics. These themes are very effectively expressed in its atmospheric and innovative photography. I?arritu's camera gets to detect images of fierce and brilliance in the squalor. Javier's face is painted with light and shadows, as well as with a sinister appearance suggesting strong contrition and redemption. Uxbal's efforts to make some generous deeds before his death are rendered in a terrific performance, which manages to elevate the bleak subject to a sublime level. "Biutiful" is a work of extraordinary vitality and humanity, with figures of untarnished quality (Uxbal's children and the Senegalese immigrant who'll raise them after his death). On a personal level Uxbal comes to terms with the close death but eventually shows a vision of reconciliation with the life he must leave behind. Watching the film is a really a must.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dare to Follow Uxbal's Many-Sided Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inarritu's three previous films---Amores Perros, 21 Grams and Babel---are classified together as the Death Trilogy, as they each depict the exponential impact of fatal or near-fatal occurrences in the interconnected existence of separate lives. They are each epic, punch-packing dramatic powerhouses. But now I see he still had much more to say on the literally infinite subject of death. And he says it with Biutiful, a purely experiential film that pierces through the heart with the acuity of a stingray barb.The narrative here is a rail tunnel of raw, sprawling intimacy set in an overpopulated, decaying Barcelona ghetto. We follow Uxbal, and we're not entirely sure what he does. Neither does anybody, or him really. Much of the things he does are criminal, mainly mitigating between corrupt police and illegal aliens, with often catastrophic results. He is also a dedicated father to two young children whose mother, his ex-wife, is a wreck of alcohol, bipolarity and promiscuity, and worse, knows her inability to control herself and is in a quicksand of bettering herself. Uxbal also has prostate cancer, which is rapidly spreading. Also, he is internally connected with the afterlife. He doesn't see visions, he doesn't clutch shoulders and see the manner of one's impending death. He purely senses a recently deceased spirit in the room with him. He can do nothing about their situation. He just senses them.Uxbal's ability to feel the presence of departed souls is portrayed like a sort of capacity to hear noise at the volume at which, say, a dog could only be expected to hear it. The film's setting and happenings are a jerky, spontaneous, lateral rush of urban business, like the sight, sound and fury made by the living to distract themselves from the silence of death. Each scene seems to be a concordance of extroverted behavior and internal behavior, both with equal fervor, yet both on either side of some two-way mirror. Only those characters, namely Uxbal, whose conflicts and dilemmas are constantly internalized, can hear that silence. Eventually, his daughter does as well, and becomes the closest to him, in what one might go as far as to consider the film's climax, a bear-like hug they both know is as fleeting as every other action in this desperate commotion of a life they lead.I?árritu intends to drain us. Physically, internally, emotionally. And he cleans out his total cinematic armory to do so. And like death, that is both a blessing and a curse. For however harrowing it is, Biutiful exalts us with the chance to see soul bare, through Javier Bardem's performance as Uxbal. Watching Bardem absorb, involve and ultimately possess a many-sided role like Uxbal's is a singular delicacy, and a complete wonder. His eyes speak agonizing tomes. He hauls from an unfathomably mysterious spring of passion, grief, and who knows what else.One might be able to delineate that Bardem renders a tragic individual as a fading Barcelona forager who deals in illegal immigrants and connects with the deceased. But every now and then, a story materializes, conveyed in a way that is so sprawling, so comprehensive, that no one premise or implication can classify it. Attempting to definitely describe it limits something that offers the utmost magnitude of whatever an actor's, a filmmaker's, and viewer's, understanding. That is what makes Biutiful so precious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought about giving it up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ordinarily I like these kinds of films about people struggling to overcome the odds of a bad deal.But in this film, Uxbal, the protagonist, has to struggle against every bad thing can ever happen to a person and all in a very short window of time. Death would be a welcome relief. Javier Bardem plays his role extremely well though; I felt his anguish over his children and the immigrants he "managed." His story gets weighed down, unfortunately, by the number of tragedies he must endure and the tasks he must execute. The director could have eliminated/edited a few of the off-point character traits and side stories to streamline the story for impact, which would have helped the film deliver more of a meaningful punch, not less. In addition, the summary of this movie says Uxbal must suffer a number of tragedies on the way to redemption. I'm not sure there is any redemption here. In Children of Men, the protagonist endures a lot and struggles through his own character defects to protect an black female fugee whose pregnancy provides hope for the human race. We feel joyful at the end of CofM because he has accomplished his task despite the odds. The ending of Biutiful, however, lacks a clear meaning and we're unsure of everyone's fate except for Uxbal's. The experience was depressing. I gave the movie an 8 because it was beautifully produced and well acted; the story was original, an uncommon view of Barcelona and the immigrants who go there for work under terrible conditions. But I doubt if anyone would want to see this film more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, but hardly biutiful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biutiful is a departure and a confirmation for Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu: on the one hand, it is another study of lives gone awry, with no punches pulled in regards to the misery experienced by the characters; on the other, it's the first film he's made he parted ways with screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga, who preferred to move on to other projects after Babel. Biutiful proves two things: firstly, Inarritu remains very good at constructing memorable images; secondly, these aren't worth quite as much without Arriaga's words.Set in Barcelona, the film ditches the filmmaker's traditional fragmented, multi-character narrative, focusing solely on one imposing figure: Uxbal (Javier Bardem), a man who has to deal with his own imminent death from cancer, a dire relationship with his family (wife, kids and brother), his ties to local criminal activities and, more generally, the ugliness he sees every day walking down the streets. Surely the (intentionally misspelled) title must be ironic.Working on the script himself, Inarritu goes for a simpler story, but doesn't renounce his penchant for harrowing material. In fact, Biutiful is undoubtedly the least cheerful film he's directed to this day, and that's saying something. His depiction of a gray, ugly Barcelona is faultless, exposing the city's seedy underbelly and disease (both physical and spiritual) with genuine, relentless storytelling passion. However, this is also detrimental to the film's impact: without Arriaga's more experienced take on the subject, the director doesn't know when to stop, throwing in one tragedy after another for the best part of the movie's 148 minutes, with no pause for breathing. It's almost too bleak, too tragic, to fully convince as a drama.Does this mean all the praise Inarritu has received in the past was premature? Not really. Even his detractors usually acknowledge his talent with actors, and in this case, perhaps being aware of the script's shortcomings, he has hit the jackpot: from start to finish, Bardem is a revelation, justly awarded with the Best Actor prize in Cannes. Sure, he's always been a gifted thespian, and no stranger to difficult parts (see The Sea Inside), but here he's really in a class of his own. Communicating with his sad, tired eyes rather than his broken voice, he carries the whole picture with a stoic dignity that is always gripping and heartbreaking.While easy to mock and criticize, Biutiful, for all its flaws, warrants at least one viewing on the grounds that it proves beyond doubt that sometimes a truly astounding performance can save an otherwise mediocre film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BIUTIFUL - a spiritual journey through the despair of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Biutiful last week at the International Film Festival of Kerala where it was greeted with a standing ovation after the screening. Some may feel Biutiful boring and depressing but it will be a transcendent experience of redemption for the rest. Alejandro González I?árritu has come up with a movie that could take you to deep trenches of despair and end up on the spiritual path with a glimpse of hope? Biutiful is one of the best movies of the year if not the best.. on par with I?árritu's Amores Peros. It is a meditation on the dark areas of urban life? It is rich with a true socio-political image (which some might consider as a bleak world view of I?árritu) by portraying the marginalized multi ethnic lives of Barcelona. Story is filled with bleak images of lives of Senegalese immigrants and Chinese sweatshop workers that will remain as unforgettable visuals in our minds.. Biutiful is the story of Uxbal, a terminally ill man who lives on crimes. Uxbal (played by Bardem) itself is a bridge between our world and the eternal, a man of contradictions.For example, he has a supernatural gift of speaking with the dead but ends up being purely human by charging money for it. Uxbal's wife Marambra who has bipolar disorder is a gem of a characterization. The movie has a linear narrative unlike I?árritu's previous works. But don't expect a spoon fed Hollywood drama. Movie is deliberately ambiguous at times and open to multiple interpretations. Good characterizations, smart script and wonderful performances along with artfully dense scenic strength of the problematic city lives, aided by great cinematography make Biutiful a brilliant experience. But the trump card of the movie is a stunning performance by Javier Bardem? Watch it for an improved version of I?árritu and masterful acting of Bardem</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biutiful is very guud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is beautiful, but misspelled... This is the premise: a backwards world in the eyes of a good man, with beautiful intentions yet too ignorant, and too overwhelmed by the world he lives in, to rearrange it all the way it is supposed to be? At some point, however, the clever premise falls through, and unfortunately, a true lack of creative work gives way to a lackluster ending with drawn-out scenes that bring no tension or intention, and make one feel that there is nothing there to say in the first place. It was a shame, at some level, to have such a stale climax for such a confusing body of a story. It made the completely chaotic development within the movie, that had a true purpose and that I comprehend and applaud, a waste of time, including the trite beginning/ending that could have very well been left in the cutting room floor (apart from the haunting dead owl over the white snow). I?arritu visibly lost track of his movie, giving half-assed importance to stories such as that of the gay Chinese couple or the fact that Bardem's character could speak with dead people, while ignoring others (such as the relationship with the "spiritual" guide, or with his boy and wife during his final days?), which could have really given him the key to open the window of this "enclosed room" of a movie; a possibility that at one point Bardem's spiritual guide enunciates (without much subtlety at all, mind you: "go fix things up"), keeping us expectant and eventually leading us to much disappointment when the movie fails to deliver. Yes, life is a complete mess, yet there is always that hint of hope? the theme gets old and I?arritu, at some point in his own mess, finds himself in the need of resolving without finding the right leads to do so, and is forced to simplify (i.e. with the Senegalese woman not stealing after all, or him passing on his ring/stone to his daughter? quite a lame example of a symbolic moment). There is something to this story, but? is it misspelled? In plain words, it should have been better? and when good things can be better, many times they are only overly ambitious, which is synonymous to mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing biutiful here....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never in my life have I been so relieved to see the protagonist of a film drop dead, but the death of Uxbal, _Biutiful_'s main character, still comes more than than an hour after I started looking forward to it. This relentless, pointlessly depressing, depravedly dismal two-and-a-half hours of human suffering might have had some redeeming social value if it were a documentary, but it isn't. Instead, it's meant to be art, which means it doesn't even have truth to recommend it. And that's where I?árritu's sadistic self-absorption and grim dedication to the pornography of squalor becomes the film's downfall. Yes, there's a feeling of "intimacy," as the NYT writes ? the intimacy of cleaning up someone else's vomit. Bardem's noble, expressive face is the only thing that makes many of the film's scenes watchable, but the message of _Biutiful_ is just this: we are lost, we are lost, we are lost. What would appear to be the film's only saving grace (Ige's decision to stay in Spain to care for Uxbal's orphaned children) comes at the cost of immense suffering: she's forced to remain in a country she hates and be separated from the man she loves, who is also her child's father, in order to dedicate herself to righting someone else's disaster of a life. You're trying to tell me that that's _Biutiful_?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If anybody should win the best actor this year it is certainly Javier Bardem. What a performance. What a face. What a man. A man, who looks like a man, not like an advertisement for some aftershave.( Yeah, but I still have not forgiven him for his participation in that stinker "Eat, Pray ,Love"). Sometimes I think that Europe is dealing in a much more open way with immigration problems than the States, where the mantra is always that we welcome everybody from everywhere and give them a chance to live the infamous "American Dream". That the dream is more like a nightmare for most first generation immigrants is conveniently ignored and swept under the carpet. And for American viewers this film should be an eye opener portraying the huge numbers of illegal immigrants most European countries have to deal with. The film dives into the underworld, visit's the back alleys of Barcelona and shines a light into sweatshops, at human trafficking and police corruption and mental illness. Does not sound like a very uplifting movie, especially as our hero Uxbal (Javier Bardem) is dying of cancer and pisses from time to time a red stream into the toilet bow.. But I left this movie much more uplifted than for example that slasher move "Black Swan" which nearly brought me to the point never to visit a movie theater again.The difference? Biutiful is a believable story ,even with the excursions into the paranormal and the acting is outstanding from everybody and especially Javier Bardem. Black Swan was unbelievable in every aspect and the acting forgettable and if N. Portman wins an Oscar for it, the studio must have bribed everybody..The location of Biutiful is Barcelona, but we see little of the spectacular touristy Barcelona, just the "Sagrada Famiglia" as a silhouette in the background, a symbol for the family of the hero, who is not holy or whole at all. I recommend this movie and do not think that this is dark movie, on the contrary I think it is a realistic movie dealing with problems most people have to face one way or the other in their lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Performance in Hard-Hitting Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biutiful (2010)*** 1/2 (out of 4) Depressing story about criminal Uxbal (Javier Bardem) who is told by his doctors that he has prostate cancer and only a few months to live. Uxbal works in the streets of Barcelona's ghetto where he sells Chinese people to sweatshops so that they have a place to work and tries to do the best he can in the situation. Before he faces death he tries to come to terms with the future of his young children and well as making sure he goes to the next life without any debts. BIUTIFUL is a rather interesting character study because we're given a sinful man who does a lot of bad things but at the same time the screenplay makes sure that we know that evil though he's bad deep down he is good. One of the most heartbreaking sections of the film deals with his relationship with one of the Chinese women and her young son. He sells them out for cheap labor because it's his job but at the same time this is putting money in their pockets. Uxbal wants to do something good for the Chinese folks so he goes to a store to buy them heaters so that they'll at least be a little more comfortable. The directions the screenplay takes this gesture is without question one of the most powerful and haunting images of any film this year. I found the screenplay to be extremely well-written and I really loved how they juggled this guys final few days on Earth. It certainly makes you think what you would do in the same situation and as the final moments get closer you can't help but be devastated because of everything that happens. Running 150-minutes the film doesn't take any sort cuts and instead it allows our main character to deal with everyone in his life and I enjoyed the extended running time because it makes you feel as if you really get to know Uxbal and those around him. It seems Bardem's Oscar-nomination really shocked people, myself included, but after you see the movie you'll see why he was honored and you'll also have a hard time coming up with a reason on why he shouldn't be one of the favorites to win. Bardem is in pretty much every second of this movie and it's impossible to take you eyes off of him. There are many times when you don't need words to tell you what's going on because the actor's face tells you everything. I'm really not sure how some actors use their eyes so well but the sadness and desperation that Bardem shows was rather amazing. He has quite a bit to do here as his relationships vary depending on who he is with. The way he deals with the children were incredibly touching. The Chinese people and their outcome. There's the stuff with the wife who is sleeping with his brother. There are a lot of situations that Bardem is put in but he handles all extremely well. As Roger Ebert pointed out in his review, Bardem can be beautiful, ugly, evil or a saint and he can do all of this on their own or wrapped up in one. The supporting players are all equally strong as is the terrific music score by Gustavo Santaolalla. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is another visual beauty as it perfectly captures the ugliness and bleakness of the streets and the overall visual look reminded me of Scorsese's MEAN STREETS. You could also say the beauty of some of the lighter moments will remind some of the work by Bunuel. BIUTIFUL isn't an easy film to sit through as it's certainly depressing and at times many will probably be looking away from the screen. Technically it's perfect and Bardem's performance makes it something truly special and worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A divorced man with two children learns he has terminal cancer with months to live, but makes no effort to plan for his children's future. It's hard to feel sympathy for such a selfish person. It is not clear what his job is, but it involves a funeral home, black drug dealers, illegal Chinese immigrants, and gay Chinese businessmen. The presentation is confusing and increasingly dreary. Little more than a collection of random scenes, it quickly becomes so tiresome that one roots for Bardem to die so that the film can end. However, it goes on and on for what seems like three hours. It is hard to believe that the man who made "Amores Perros" and "Babel" is responsible for this mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alejandro González I?árritu is one of the most powerful voices of 21st century cinema. Ever since 'Amores Perros', followed by '21 Grams', and "Babel", I?árritu has not stopped amazing us managing with each film to take our collective breath away. So imagine what he can do with immensely talented powerhouse Javier Bardem as the anti- hero of his new bone-chilling Greek tragedy. No wonder the Cannes jury gave Bardem the Palme d'Or for best Actor. Uxbal, a black-market dealer, learns he has terminal cancer. He must survive long enough to find somebody to take care of his children after he's gone. The clock is ticking. Death is coming. I?árritu's genius is to make us care deeply for such a man. In the urban jungle we barely recognize as Barcelona, Uxbal deals in human lives, supplying black market labor to employers who exploit the illegal immigrants cruelly and shamelessly. He also "sells" peace to bereaved relatives, having the power to communicate with the spirits of the recently deceased. With all his supernatural powers, Uxbal is helpless in the face of the terrible disease eating away at his body and...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste your 2.5 hours of your time! Just because it's "art" doesn't make it good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie and story are simply a long, SLOW collection of depressing scenes strung together that have NO deep meaning, and NO profound wisdom.It is very frustrating to me when the collective "art mentality" raves about such a film being of epic depth, or philosophically/intellectually stimulating. This film meanders aimlessly -- a wallowing journey of despair, misery, and hopelessness. Don't waste 2.5 hours waiting and wanting this film to improve or deliver a worthy denouement. It is absolutely horrible.I am a patron of the arts, and I believe in "ars gratia artis," however it is ostensibly lemming pretentiousness when people view a canvas on which an artist has vomited and call it "good art." Yes, it may be "art," but just because someone says it's art doesn't make it good. Beauty is definitely in the eye of the beholder, and such is the case with this film.Regarding Javier Bardem's "fine" acting in this film: His brooding persona appears the same as in the movie, "No Country For Old Men," sans the dark psychologically twisted murderer ingredient. This role could've been played just as well by a number of different actors. Bardem's swarthy appearance and throaty voice lend more of a grittiness to the role, but come on?he's perfectly typecast; review his filmography. It's not too much of a stretch to see him in this role. In my opinion, "good acting" is when an actor/actress can become the character (and I don't mean method acting) so as to dissociate as much of their own "self" as possible from the performance that the character, such as Marlon Brando in "The Godfather," Anthony Hopkins in "Silence of the Lambs," Tom Hanks in "Forrest Gump," or Al Pacino in "Scarface."For those supercilious reviewers who applaud this film's exceptional ability to depict the dismal characteristics of the grim and squalid parts of society: exploitation, meager existence, futility, juxtaposed with thinly veiled ephemeral moments of poignancy, I'm appalled to see that so many people rate this film highly in comparison with other films and docudramas which express and portray these elements more effectively. It's not significantly difficult to create a depressing film and to evoke a catharsis with the audience. Seriously, what do you find that is monumentally profound about this movie? Save yourself 2.5 hours of depression (unless you like that type of torture)of and watch something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just came from the theater with the sensation of wasting my money and my time here. Being an admirer of the early work of I?árritu I have to say that since "Babel" he is going down. This guy could be an excellent director, but he still has to demonstrate his skills as a scriptwriter. Maybe he needs Arriaga back. The script of this new movie is a complete fiasco; I still don't know what was the main idea of the movie. After the first 15 minutes I started to note that something was going wrong, half an hour later I was still waiting for something with substance, after an hour I gave up. The lack of focus on a central idea is the main feature of this story, and the characters are plain and uninteresting. The dialogues, by trying to follow the plot (or the lack of) are consequently vague and forgettable, even ridiculous. I think I?árritu had just an idea and he added up a context or a background, but missed the real thing. It's like a collage of non credible situations and subplots disconnected from a central theme. This script is at amateur level. Any college student majoring in film could write a better movie. I really hope this great director don't follow the path of Shyamalan, letting his ego to take control instead of getting advice from the millions of screenwriters around him that can help him out. (Actually, I hope both go back and start doing awesome movies again someday). The fact that this movie has been praised by many critics is an insult to the common sense.</fullReview>

I don't think I've ever encountered a movie that made me cry and feel something under my throat every 10 minutes of the movie. It's past 30 minutes and I'm still not over it. The only other recent movie that made me tear up only once was the Notebook. Alejandro González I?árritu opened my eyes about the world again. I feel that if I don't watch his point of view I might close my mind, I love when he and his crew open up my mind about the world. This world is so horrible yet its so "Biutiful." TRying to find a peace of contentness in this world. This movie is a must see, he makes me want to become an activist and help people in need and stop exploitation. But I have to focus on me right now, life is the survival of the fittest indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie full of moral dilemmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-This review may contain spoilers-After reading a couple of comments beforehand and knowing a couple of the old Inarritu movies I was pretty prepared that these will be very depressing 148 minutes. Maybe I was even too good prepared, because after the movie I was not shocked the same way as after "Amores Perros". There are some differences between this movie and the older I?árritu's movies. In the past he was always creating a couple of main parallel plots (multi-layers) that were independent at the beginning but somehow connected at the end. This time there was one main linear plot that was somehow divided into different stories (maybe too many different stories) that were connected through the character of Javier Bardem, who makes really an amazing role in this movie. At the end of the movie though I had the feeling that some of the stories were not really fully developed. I?árritu has succeeded to show the other face of Barcelona that remains pretty hidden for the tourists that drink their sangria in Barrio Gotico and lay on the beach in Barceloneta and feel themselves pretty good depicted in "Vicky, Christina, Barcelona". This is a face full of suffer, illegal immigrants, hidden slavery, poverty, corruption and misery. This is a face, where the lives of the group Asian workers does not have other value than moving them from business to business, in order to make more profits for their "owners". In this world there is nothing such a responsibility and loyalty. Everybody fights to survive in this jungle.Thus the Senegal woman chooses to take the money that the dying Uxbal ( Javier Bardem) is giving to her to look after his two children and she goes instead back to her family in Senegal leaving the Uxbal children without nothing, but their mother with bipolar syndrome and to be honest I was not able to blame her, because the movie was so full of moral and ethical dilemmas that at the end you really do not know what is good and what is bad. There was one more very impressive thing about this movie - its camera. The way the suffering of Uxbal has been filmed as well as the way Barcelona with its hidden people has been shown was so realistic that it had something of a documentary movie in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BIUTIFUL (2010) *** Javier Bardem gives a powerful tour-de-force turn in his latest collaboration with Spanish filmmaker Alejnadro Gonzalez Inarritu, as Uxbal, a Barcelona scrounger attempting to get his affairs ? foreign &amp; domestic ? in order before succumbing to the death sentence of cancer. A well-meaning father who loves his children (Hanaa Bouchaib and Guillermo Estrella) yet lives less than a presentable life and has his work cut out with their estranged mother (Maricel Alvarez), an addict and a hooker whose occasionally annoying presence threatens to take over the storyline (which frankly is overloaded with two other linear tales including illegal immigration and a sweatshop). One of the film's most breathtaking visuals: heaven imagined as a pristine snow blanketed burnt out forest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificently grim and metaphysical picture that is able to reveal hope out of the depths of despair for its main character as well as for its movie's viewers..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Uxbal is a protagonist of the highest dramatical calibre not unlike Hamlet or Oedipus. This ailing father of two children and spouse of an unstable woman suffering from borderline syndrome and drug addiction, has departed on a calvary that seems to have no end. In ever more harsh and merciless ways Uxbal is undergoing every sort of torment and kickback thrown upon him by the demons of his gravely deseased Fortune. Indeed, Uxbal finds out that he is suffering from a terminal form of prostate cancer. Even though in essence Uxbal is a good man - fate seems to have chosen quite a different direction for him as where we usually believe our chance and luck to be. However, in this struggle from amidst the darkness of his daily existence in the messy streets of Barcelona Uxbal somehow is able to come to term with his fate without giving in to despair. In fact, through a gradual process of material disattachment he rises to a level of wise and unprecedented reconciliation with destiny as well as with the people he cares about and loves. After a long and painful journey of cancerous ordeals and unwanted horrors, at the end Uxbal is ready to make his last and necessary sacrifice before he can depart into the snowy landscape of his timetranscending visionary dream of a chanceful reunification with his grandfather killed by Franco's royalists during the Civil War.At the press conference in Cannes last May 2010 Alejandro González Inárittu declared in his vehimently articulate manner: "Even if darkness seems to be everywhere, Biutiful offers many touches of hope. I'd even say it's my most optimistic film. Uxbal's character is full of light. He puts a lot into organising his life, helping his children, loving other people." Biutiful is a truly emotional and even spiritual masterpiece of the most magnificent kind. For whomever is willing or able to follow the main characters throughout their dazzling daily struggles to survive on the shady side of life in Barcelona whilst persisting in their illusionary and mostly illegal follies that are the unfortunate demonstrations of their communal longing for some warmth and wealth and happiness, he or she will be rewarded with a discovery that might be as liberating and emotional for Uxbal as it will be for the viewer following his endeavours from so nearby it hurts. What Inárittu has tried throughout his ruthless, fastpaced, extremely honest, direct and intimate style of holding the camera as close to one's skin as possible, is to make us sense and realize that in the end their might indeed be something like a human soul after all. A discovery not unlike the one pursued by his tormented characters from that other masterpiece of his: 21 Grams. The viewer who is able to show sympathy for Uxbal, will be able to witness a most remarkable moral recovery in the inner self of our slowly but steadily vanishing hero. In a very humble but all the more remarkable way Uxbal somehow managed to keep some ray of light awake amidst the darkness that is closing in on him from the realms of his grim unfortunate reality. In the end, on the threshold of his toilet and bedroom and amidst the company of his daughter and a refugee he was so kind as to adopt in his house after her husband was deported back to Africa, Uxbal is able to finally reach the surface of his dignity again. This happens while he is literally dying and physially collapsing. But spiritually, his ascendance back upon the slippery slope of his generous but tested and tormented mind towards a state of peacefulness and grace, is a tour de force indeed. It is magical. Mysterious. Hopeful. Just like the entire encadrement of Inarritu's latest masterpiece. And just like Javier Bardem's amazing achievement to make us weep and at the same time feel happy for the faith that he was able to sustain out of the cold and unjust misery that chased him all along his final destiny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always a special night when you move to watch the newest film of one of the best directors working at the moment. Not only will you see something you'd never seen by someone whose work affects your soul, but you're also seeing something that may be the newest improvement in the still recent tradition of cinema, as an art of visual narrative. I?arritu produces such a state in me. Some of his previous work changed me in ways i can't understand. I'll always want to see what he's got for me.Here we had an important thing going on. He departed from his long time collaborator, Arriaga. Apparently, their previous collaborations took the best out of their personal relationship. I imagine the heaviness and pain of pulling out such dense rich narratives like the trilogy that came before this film was draining and emptied their relation. Arriaga's absence gets noticed here. We get to be less aware of the structure, we get less engaged by how the film develops. There is no apparent higher structure to frame the lives we follow. Arriaga provided the films with a noir sense of fate, where every character sat. Well, i suppose we find it here, but in a more rough, less assumed way. No one doubts that every character in this film (even the Chinese bosses) lives in a world whose rules he or she don't understand, less even control. That's the first interesting thing here. We have the city as the defined board where the game is played. The sense of (urban) placement tells us the game is being played, but we never get to see anyone higher than a simple pawn. I think when you take the story as it is, you can place this along with Blindness, for the pessimism, for the hopeless view on the world. The city, Barcelona, is shown with a grittiness and darkness that actually is not in its superficial face, although some scenes (like the black people running from the police with fake purses) are actually a part of its routine. But nothing of what we see here is a told at a first level of observation, so we don't have the city of Gaudí here, we have a city of oppressed, manipulated by an unknown oppressor. (**spoilers here**) This world is complex and deceiving. Uxbal seems to control the Chinese boss, but we know he is manipulated by his man lover, whose homosexuality is not accepted by the other's family. Maramba drowns Uxbal's rejections on the bed of his brother, as her madness progressively moves her away from her children. But Uxbal will be dead and knows it, plus he also knows what's "on the other side". He is just as drowned in his own unavoidable destiny as the Chinese workers that he thinks he helps (until he kills them!). So is Ige, who knows somehow she can't leave Barcelona and have a future; she's drowned in her fate, and money can't change it. And so are Uxbal's children, whose fate depends on the luck and will of those who in turn are responsible for their upbringing: their father will die, their mother is unreliable, and we are only hinted that Ige will become their mother figure.But all this is only secondary, compared to the real reason why i think you should watch this film: the faces. All the darkness, all the pus that comes sickly out of the wounds of these people only really matters anything because it is mirrored in the "biutiful" faces of absolutely every character. That's what the incredible first scene gives us: the meeting between two faces, Bardem (what an actor he finally became!) and the one we come later to find out to be his late father. Notice how the close-ups of the faces are the key to every emotional response you give to the film. Notice how it's the broken smiles of Mateo, or Maramba's powerless looks that make your heart break. Notice how those faces are framed by I?arritu (and his incredible cinematographer!), always differently, according to the face of every actor. Bardem usually three quarters. But the face i'll always remember is that of Ana. According to IMDb this was her first film, and if it is her last, i still will have reasons to remember her. I'm betting she was chosen based on her smile, that of disillusioned innocence, of broken childhood. So beautiful, so sad. So much pain, in such a chaotic noir world. This is great film writing, great film making. I'm wondering how it will fit in my dreams.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biutiful is a rewarding film, and Bardem's emotional range is astonishing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his short career, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has already made 2 great films. Amores Perros is a masterpiece, 21 Grams is not far behind. His third film, Babel on the other hand, was patchy by his standards.So naturally, I couldn't wait to see his new film, Biutiful. Javier Bardem is the lead, an actor at the height of his powers and a personal favourite since I watched him in the outrageous 'Jamon Jamon'. Bardem is Uxbal, a middle-aged single father operating anonymously in Barcelona's underworld. Among many questionable practices, he buys fake handbags and trinkets from a Chinese-run sweatshop, and supplies the items to illegal African immigrants to sell to unsuspecting tourists.Uxbal also has an unusual sideline; earning money for his supernatural gift ? talking to the recently departed so they can pass on to the afterlife peacefully.So far, so little to like about Uxbal. But there is a real sensitivity to him. He is devoted to his two children, and has custody of them due to his ex-wife (played by Marciel Alvarez) habitually wreaking havoc due to her bipolar condition.Then Uxbal is diagnosed with terminal cancer, and given perhaps two months to live. He is forced to reflect on his life as he tries to make amends and prepare for his imminent death. But for all his efforts, his already grim existence just gets worse.Biutiful certainly is gritty, and you wouldn't believe this is the same Barcelona that Bardem recently acted in Woody Allen's exuberant 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona'. For Uxbal and everyone in this film, Barcelona is a hollow, depressing place to live. Socio-political comparisons can be drawn with Stephen Frears fine film 'Dirty Pretty Things', showing the side of London most filmgoers wouldn't imagine, not least the abuse of illegal immigrants.Javier Bardem is flawless, a deeply soulful, frail performance that carries the movie from the moment he appears on screen. Marciel Alvarez also excels as Uxbal's ex-wife, and stands out from a high quality cast. The ever dependable Gustavo Santaolalla's haunting music captures the essence of the film.Biutiful is at times manipulative and contrived, and certainly over-reaches by the end. Uxbal's last few days were too much to handle; you actually wished for a quick death in order to relieve himself of the sheer number of problems and issues he has to deal with, many of which i haven't mentioned in this review.Death has been a constant theme in all of Inarritu's films, Biutiful is no exception. By far his most intricate film, not least due to a mostly linear narrative compared to Inarritu's previous multi-layered outings. As uncomfortable viewing as it is, Biutiful is a rewarding film, and Bardem's emotional range is astonishing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrifying, Compelling, Devastating, and Extraordinary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How does one define BIUTIFUL? Alejandro González I?árritu has written and directed yet another work of cinematic art that is so multifaceted that it early defies explanation. From the first frame to the last (and even in the credits) this is a film of unusually powerful impact, dealing with the underbelly of the world and succeeding in sharing how mankind survives event the most strained of circumstances. Uxbal (the brilliant Javier Bardem) is connected to his grandfather who left Spain for Mexico - an adagio scene at film's opening shares his parting with his grandfather in a snowy forest, a connection between Uxbal and the afterlife that surfaces periodically throughout this otherwise world bound story. Uxbal is a facilitator in the crime scene of Barcelona, aiding illicit African street peddlers and human traffikers in Chinese laborers while trying to support his little family. He is married to a seemingly despicable bipolar Maramba (Maricel Álvarez) and they fight over the care of their two children Ana (Hanaa Bouchaib) and Mateo (Guillermo Estrella): Maramba when not controlled with meds drinks heavily and works the night streets, forcing Uxbal to be father and mother in their shambles of an apartment. Uxbal's brother Tito (Eduard Fernández) provides 'shelter' for Maramba when he is not involved with drugs and the grotesque night club life of stripper clubs. Uxbal is diagnosed with metastatic prostatic carcinoma and informed he only has a few months to live. He visits a bruja Bea (Ana Wagener) to communicate with the dead and gains guidance on how to bring some good to not only his children whom he adores but also to the victims of the human trafficking. When the police arrest his friend, Senegalese Ekweme (Cheikh Ndiaye) Uxbal promises to look after his wife Ige (Diaryatou Daff) and their infant son Samuel. When he discovers that the Chinese workers are living in a crowded basement in the cold he barters for gas heaters (buying the cheapest ones in order to pocket the excess money), but the heaters fail and an entire group of illegal immigrants die from the fumes. Uxbal's health fails, his family disintegrates, his working relations with both the Chinese and the Spanish crime bosses break and Uxbal is left at the end of his life attempting to leave the world a better place for his children. The supporting cast of this film is excellent - some of the stand out performances include those by Rubén Ochandiano, Karra Elejalde, Cheng Tai Shen, Luo Jin, and Lang Sofia Lin. But it is the impossibly difficult role of Uxbal that shows Javier Bardem's extraordinary talent to be that of one of the finest actors before the public today. His character is raw and dirty but Bardem finds the flickers of redemptive light in his character and makes them glow. The cinematography paints a grimy crime world of Barcelona thanks to the sensitive camera eye of Rodrigo Prieto and as always the composer Gustavo Santaolalla creates a score that enhances every frame. His choice to include the 'Adagio' from Ravel's 'Piano Concerto in G' (as performed by Zoltán Kocsis with the Budapest Festival Orchestra conducted by Iván Fischer) is radiantly encored in the end titles. Alejandro González I?árritu is clearly one of the geniuses of our time. This is a masterpiece of movie-making. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film Where Nothing is Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the dirty periphery of Barcelona, Uxbal (Javier Bardem) survives operating as middleman in business with illegal immigrant workers in the Chinese community, selling the slave labor and bribing the police and receiving a percentage of each business. Uxbal has also the ability to communicate with the dead and is the loving single father of the ten year-old Ana (Hanaa Bouchaib) and the little boy Mateo (Guillermo Estrella). Their mother Marambra (Maricel Álvarez) is a bipolar alcoholic prostitute with an unstable and self-destructive behavior.When Uxbal learns that he is terminal with an advanced prostate cancer and metastasis and has only a couple of months, he saves all the possible money and seeks out a person to raise Ana and Mateo. Uxbal buys the cheapest heaters to use in the warehouse whether the Chinese workers sleep and the equipment leak gas and kill the twenty-five illegal immigrants. When Uxbal meets the African illegal immigrant Ige (Diaryatou Daff), he brings her home and after a few days, he believes he has found the appropriate person to raise his two children.The first thing that calls the attention in "Beautiful" is the city of Barcelona, totally different from the post cards or the Internet messages of garbage collecting system and looking like a Third World city, with slums, dirtiness and outcast people. The characters are also ugly and only the love and dedication of Uxbal to his beloved children is beautiful.The unpleasant story is gloomy and shows the reality of illegal African and Chinese immigrant and their poor conditions; the corruption of the police; and how people fight to survive, like Marambra says in a certain moment. Javier Bardem has a great performance in an ambiguous character. However I expected more from "Biutiful" considering the hype around it. Last but not the least, the optimistic believe that Ige has returned to raise Ana and Mateo. But the end is open to interpretations. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Biutiful"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biutiful! (Albeit some plot holes)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike 21 Grams and Amores Perros, Inarritu deviates from the 4 lives - 1 story line - and completes his "Death Trilogy" with the story of one man, Uxbal, who touches many lives in some way shape or form, and appropriately is able to sense the dead and help them pass on safely to the after world. Uxbal is not perfect. Although you can tell he has a heart of gold, he makes a living helping illegal immigrants find work, always with his cut of the pay. Although for the most part, people trust him and turn to him for help, sometimes his good intention land him in trouble. Biutiful is all about paradoxes. The title is the Spanish phonetic spelling of "Beautiful" yet most of the film is set in the lower income, gritty neighbourhoods of Barcelona. Uxbal uses his ability to ease the dead of their debts in life and sort out their affairs, yet he struggles with settling his own affairs. Even his relationships with other people are paradoxes - he is obviously not completely okay with her promiscuity, yet he understands - he is harsh and strict with his son Mateo but does not stand for his wife's physical abuse of him - but his most important relationship is one with himself. He reconciles this by learning to let go, learning to let the universe take care of everything, as Bea, his healer confidante, had told him.Biutiful is a beautiful film, but it is not perfect. There are some plot holes that are left unanswered (for example, whether the Chinese immigrants receive justice for their death, whether Uxbal's grief is ever really atoned). I think these unanswered questions are left open to interpretation though, as that seems to be Inarritu's style in these type of films. A great watch, although dark and at times deeply depressing, there is a small glimmer of hope at the end of the film - and I think that's what important to take away from this. Despite everything, life is biutiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My rating: 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never before such a thrill seeing a movie. Maybe its because I have never seen such movie. I even might say that it was better than Almodovar's movies because it is provocative without being provocative, being sad without making you sad, mind blowing without blowing your mind, serious without being serious, scary but not frightening you, funny without making you feel happy. Probably because it was realistic.The amazing city scenes which were captured in unique moments are speaking about exploring these places where the film was shot. The intrigue and the thrill started instantly. they escalated slowly like a blown balloon which was burst at the end. The dedication also was extremely touching ? "To my beautiful old oak... my father".The movie shows a possible story (I only doubt that this man would have two children of his girl and would deserve such a life) which can happen everywhere around us. It shows where is hidden the real human thing, the biutiful, even not knowing how to spell it.In my opinion, amazing mixture of bounden duty, sent message, director's and actor's skills. And this is the reason why I rate it with the most possible stars.P.S. It is not for everyone's taste!http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another good picture by I?arritu. It describes a miserable Barcelona and the problems that poor people and emigrants have. The description, the photography and the pace of the movie are great, but in the end there are nothing you can hold on to, it's misery, misery, misery. Because of his raw portrait of slums in Barcelona, the movie looks pretty good, but in the end there are no catharsis to turn it into a great movie. As always, Javier Bardem is very good, it really convinces me of the character's suffering. The rest of the characters were pretty well cast, but they are overshadowed by the strong Bardem, a negative note for Hanaa Bouchaib, in any part of the movie she could transmit the feelings that were on the argument, in the other hand, I loved Guillermo Estrella and Maricel Álvarez, it's very hard to put a child acting as if doesn't look like it's acting, but Guillermo always look like very sincere doing the character, as for Maricel Álvarez I loved her bipolarity mood changes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak, Brutal Compelling Viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This powerful, dark, brutal, and unrelentingly stark movie is so compelling and so thoughtfully filmed, you soon find yourself thoroughly immersed in the squalid events and surroundings of the characters' lives; a challenging existence played out in the midst of filth and crumbling buildings in an impoverished part of Barcelona, the home of Uxbal - played brilliantly by Javier Bardem. The continual pall of the shadows that darken his features, mirror the grim environment and nearly every scene is a landscape of shadow and gloom; a claustrophobic and desperate existence that inexorably crushes Uxbal and his family. The endless rain and clouds perfectly reflect the bleakness that is Uxbal's life; entrenchment in an inescapable cycle of poverty, hardship, and/or exploitation. This dreary environment, coupled with his pitifully dysfunctional family life, contribute to Uxbal's despair and threaten to crush his spirit. Bardem portrays Uxbal's depression and hopelessness consummately; from his downcast, crushed demeanour to the inevitable exhaustion and pain he battles, as a terminal illness ravages him. Even the 'sexuality', depicted fitfully throughout Biutiful, is sad, ugly, sordid and completely devoid of any vestige of eroticism; tainted with despondency and exploitation, it evokes only pathos and disgust. Uxbal's life is nothing short of sheer chaos as he struggles to care for his two young children while his bi-polar, drug-addicted wife, Marambra, played hauntingly by Maricel Alvarez, flits in and out of their lives, leaving in her wake a trail of turmoil and anxiety. One brief scene of happiness and 'normalcy' where he and his wife enjoy a meal with their children, stands out in stark contrast to the numerous vignettes of abuse, neglect and sorrow that normally stalk their lives. However, despite all that he is up against, Uxbal's love for his children is clear and he strives to care for them as best he can; this is evident when his daughter demands to know what's wrong with him and, finally liberated from the burden of hiding his impending death, he is able to show her his love and urge her not to forget him. Despite his deteriorating health and miserable family situation, Uxbal must work and his involvement in several illegal money-making operations result in the exploitation of migrant workers. He tries his best to make their lives a little more tolerable, in contrast to his indifferent and often callous 'partners' but, ironically, it is one of his kind gestures that ultimately leads to a horrific catastrophe. Guilt, shame and horror at what he has been a party to haunt and consume him and he descends further into despondency and depression as his death approaches.Biutiful may be a dark, painful and brutal portrayal of life but at the end of the day, Uxbal's selflessness and desire to do the right thing by his children, his troubled wife, and those whose lives he has tainted or destroyed, pay homage to the inherent goodness and strength of the human spirit, making this movie so much more than the portrayal of a sad and futile existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ode to death by I?árritu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most impressive movies I've ever seen on the topic of death. It is profound and dramatic. Uxbal, Javier Bardem, is the father of two little kids, he is dying of cancer. The movie talks about his struggle to leave his daughter and son in good hands.It took me two times watching it to understand it for what it was, a work of art. I?árritu puts its very unique style into every narrative decision the film makes. The camera is hand-held and Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is impeccable.As usual in every Alejandro González I?árritu film there are three stories that unite. But instead of an accident or a terrible incident, what unites this story is Uxbal's desperate need to make ends meet, also his compassion towards others. Javier Bardem is the Marlon Brando of our generation, this is a bold statement but it's completely true. The big problem with acknowledging his talent is that most of his work is in Spanish and living in such an English based film era most of the world doesn't get the chance to see this genius perform.I've heard criticism towards the amount of stories that unite in this film because it dilutes Uxbal's tragedy. I don't believe that to be true. All of the stories support the central theme of the movie, death.If you want to see a work of art that makes you think and challenges us as audience with all it's bitterness, rawness but most of all heart on the subject of loosing the ones you love and not knowing what will happen to them once we die, watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic and Painfully Beautiful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is pretty sad. I'm not going to lie. And that takes a lot coming from me. ( I'm a pretty pessimistic guy) But what this films does, it does well and it is helped by one of the greatest foreign actors of our time, Javier Bardem. Uxbal is a low level criminal boss who lives with his 2 kids in a small apartment. He's divorced from his wife, who is an alcoholic and partially insane/ bipolar. He controls some of the darker parts of the Spanish underworld, like Chinese sweatshop workers and African American vendors who sell off the cheaply made goods. And oh yeah he can communicate with the dead. You would think the story would be about that last statement and it sort is but it's more of a plot point. Uxbal is recently diagnosed with Cancer and he is set to die within 6 months. So the movie is him trying to set up his kids and businesses to succeed when he's gone. The film paints a very realistic picture of what happens. It's not sugar coated and everything goes well.. He fails at doing at lot but what the film does is post a really great picture of a dying man in desperate attempts to give something back into life. Javier Bardem performance is also outstanding. He has the most range of human emotions of actors of our time. This performance like many people say is reminiscent of Marlon Brando's in Last Tango in Paris. The cinematography at the beginning and end scenes is great but most of the film is average in the category. The supporting cast is solid in their jobs but its really Javier Bardem's show. Music is kept to a minimum which works in this kind of realistic movie. Finally I love the style of the movie and Innarutu, one of the most consistent foreign directors of recent memory.Overall this film is depressing but biutiful (see what I did there) film which excellent,y showcases an acting talent of our generation. Incredibly touching 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a cousin who had a daughter who was killed by a rapist. Her son died in a motorcycle accident. When she was in her forties, she contracted brain cancer. Sometimes life in its random way picks out certain individuals for a bevy of pain. It was really hard to watch this film because despite the terrible decisions this man made, he still didn't deserve the circumstances that reveal themselves. The movie drags us through a cesspool from which there is no escape. The only thing one can feel some solace for is that despite the errors of his life, this man is loved. Even though it is in a small measure, he would gladly change his situation. The acting is superb and the direction captures us from the first scene. I can't recommend this film unless you are willing to be brought to the brink.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never before have I seen a film more aptly titled.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never before have I seen a film more aptly titled. Nor have i seen it more juxtaposed. The artistry befits the word; the cinematography, the editing, and the camera-work make me want to repeat the word over and over. I won't, I promise. However the story is tragedy personified. Worse than tragic, it's ugly. Biutiful is everything we don't want to think about and the heartache rarely relents; when it does it certainly doesn't allow your tears to run dry. Throughout all 147 minutes Alejandro González I?árritu has his audience bent over in both sadness and happiness.When it's sad it really is sad. Sadness I doubt many will ever encounter outside of this film. My favourite scene (and believe me that's some statement) was completely missed by the person I was watching the film with. Why? She was sobbing uncontrollably and completely unaware of the wonderful camera-work at play on screen. In one long, extraordinary shot we see the much-loathed lover of a Chinese boss as we had before, at the window of a dingy hotel room. Only this time it's different. It feels completely different. Perhaps it's the amateurish way the camera slips nervously from its position. Perhaps it's the glimpse of blood we see in the blurred background as the lens desperately tries to fix its gaze on something significant. One thing is for certain though and that's the sheer brutality of what has happened. When the murderer eventually leaves the camera follows him from the window to the door and back again capturing, in detail, the events of what had just taken place. The final static shot shows us his exit from the view he would've had just moments ago. We see the confident walk of a man complete.Happiness is hard to come by in a story so sad but when it appears it's so incredibly raw and true that the viewer would be forgiven for showing more emotion in these parts than in some of the sadder scenes. Happiness is more shocking than the other emotions conveyed by I?árritu as it's unexpected. Biutiful is desperate, lonely, spiteful, wretched and wonderful in about that ratio. For every moment of joy there's 4 times that in misery. This only makes those moments more poignant. Javier Bardem's character Uxbal is deeply troubled, the mother of his children is bipolar and he has little patience for her mood swings that we can only assume have plagued him forever. Amongst the many moments of chaos we are indulged in a blissful exhilaration that can only be present in such environments. When Uxbal is urged to recall how he proposed to his wife his children listen with delight and their pleasure is quite remarkable. As, I imagine is the audience's.Uxbal is a man. He's heroic in every way and a success in none. Emotionally wreck-less yet exceptionally driven. He desperately wants to provide for his children and will let nothing stand in his way. His torment is everywhere. He doesn't want to die but there's nothing he can do about it, the cancer is terminal. All he can do is make his peace and provide for his family after he's gone. And he'll stop at nothing to do so. What makes his story so compelling is that he cares. His conscious constantly gets in his way.I?árritu is ambiguous. We've seen so before in Babel and it's even more evident here in Biutiful. The film begins and ends with an owl metaphor where Uxbal is told that when an owl dies it coughs up hairballs. The meaning behind this is unclear although unsurprising given that I?árritu litters his films with unanswered questions. What we do know is that the guy who tells Uxbal this metaphor is in fact Uxbal's father who died young. There's no way of knowing this when we see him at the start but mercifully I?árritu shows us a photograph of the man in the the middle so we're in no doubt the second time around. Again the significance of this is vague; does Uxbal simply want his children to remember him when they're adults? Or is it more about the relationship between him and his own father?Ultimately Biutiful is a story of hope. Uxbal's haunted by his past but works tirelessly to make the future better. We go deep inside his subconscious throughout the film. On two occasions we see a dead Chinaman glued to the ceiling with Uxbal in the foreground. Is I?árritu trying to show us they weren't ready to go? The third and final time we simply see the indentation of a body. Is this a sign that Uxbal is? His torment is over and he can pass knowing his children are provided for. Ige, who Uxbal allows to live with him and whom he entrusts his family to almost flees but she doesn't. She comes back. She provides hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ladies and Gentlemen- Hats down, we are in the presence of greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I found it necessary to write a review for this film. I never wrote reviews to anything and probably will never write again. I saw the score for this movie on IMDb and it was a 7.4, I as well remember when the movie played it did not cause a particular stir beside the Oscar nomination it received. In order to evaluate this film one has to consider the purpose of films and art in general. It is my belief that the best art causes us to feel, to have an emotional experience. So often I went to films, concerts, and art exhibits better or worse and came out of them with an empty feeling. Nothing happened to me. "What did I just pay for" echoes in my mind. I will go further and say that a film that does not cause this emotional response is not art. It may have been created artfully but it is not art. This film is art! It is probably one of the best films that were ever made. It is not perfect but it does not matter. The story, the acting and the directing have the guts of a Shostakovich symphony. This movie deals with the reality of existence. With real death and not the generic Hollywood version of it. It deals with the love for your children and trying to protect them as much as one can from a monstrous world. It as well found a way to show the mystery and mystic of existing in times we so often take it for granted. There are a handful of movies that even dare to deal with these ideas and none that I recall are as successful. IMDb reviewers can give it a 7.4 or a 2.4 but this film will eventually find its place as a monumental artistic achievement in the history of movie making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bunuelian Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing Alejandro Inarritu's Biutiful, you might want to watch Luis Bunuel's Milky Way.What you might see first as a similarity between these two films is a depth in their subject choices from religion to death. Second thing might be a similarity in the way their themes are posed as questions in regards to religion and death. Last similarity, which also constitutes its' contrast is the way it handles their approach to answering such questions.Where Bunuel's theme of religious question is answered by comedic, symbolic and surrealistic imagery alone, Inarritu's exploration of death is handled by more a less of the same, but with a little something extra.In one of Biutiful's first scenes we have Javier Bardem as Uxbal sitting across from the ghost of a young boy, asking what exactly is disabling him from moving on into the next life.The scene cuts before this question is answered by the ghost, but the answer should be obvious and if it's not, then this scene is something to think about, even long after you've watched Biutiful. Ironic, yet essential, even as one of many small symbolic details written into Uxbal's character description is his ability to communicate with death immediately after it's happened because the first question coming from Uxbal in that funeral home is a foreshadowing of what he will be in about ten minutes asking himself for the next two hours.Besides the images of ghosts and moths he sees in the ceiling, a lot of surrealistic symbolism can be found in the details written into Uxbal's story. Every detail of Uxbal's existence that critics may see as pointless are actually symbols, essential to Biutiful's theme of death and how we should live before it happens.Before he can move on into the next life he's got things to settle from the company getting ready to build over their past father's burial, to his own two children, along with finally the two immigrant groups he aims to protect from exploitation. With all of this to handle and with only so much time left Uxbal doesn't even have time to tell anybody he is leaving so nobody knows.All of these ironic details can be seen as another form of symbolism being implemented by Inarritu's style of film and I think it is the closest anybody has come in a long time to a Bunuelian odyssey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For better and for worse, Biutiful is Beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Uxbal (Played by Javier Bardem) is a man in Spain, and to provide for his two children, has resorted to crime, but underneath, he's emotionally torn apart. He is struggling to come to grips with his mortality, and he's hindered by personal roadblocks, including his abusive, bipolar wife. Not only that, but he is diagnosed with terminal cancer, given only months to live, and is barely able to keep it a secret from his children.The movie is not always easy to watch. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu paints a grim portrait on love and spirituality, but the uncompromising route he took with this movie was probably a beneficial trait. He doesn't shy away from giving the themes presented in the film an intimate look, and he also crafts the movie incredibly, especially thanks to DP Rodrigo Prieto.The only complaint I'd have to throw at him is that the film is too long. I've got nothing against long movies, but it just felt like the pace of the film needed to pick up. I think it could have been trimmed a bit, and still retained the emotional resonance.But even if (And this is hypothetical. I still loved the movie) everything else about this movie was pure crap, I would still say go see it just to behold Javier Bardem's performance. He carries the film, and the role beautifully through his understatement. In any of his scenes, one emotion on his face can explain as much as a whole minute of dialogue. It's by far and away one of the best male performances of 2010.I give Biutiful ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

No wonder that nowadays musicians are complaining about author rights... But going back to the movie: Its immensely long, enormously black, fantastically depressing. I lived during many years in Barcelona and even walking down the streets in the Raval neighborhood (I assume that's the quarter used in this film for the street locations) I never saw the ugliness they show in this movie. How could they manage to show Barcelona so awful is beyond my comprehension. Honestly, nowadays most (most, not all) movies are made correctly in all departments, acting, wardrobe, period reenactment, music, etc. So, once we take that for granted, set it aside and look at the entertainment value of a film, having to deal with all these penuries is asking too much from the spectator point of view. What can we do about horrible working conditions for the illegal and exploited Senegalese, for the illegal and exploited Chinese, for our thrashed by life protagonist, about the future of his children, of his wife (all and everyone living a hellish life and already thumbed down by destiny), what about those nightmarish stinky hell holes euphemistically called apartments, with unspeakable wall paper patterns on all the walls (no wonder their inhabitants suffer severe migraines and are continually depressed, taking to the bottle and other substances...). I don't know, I don't want to see these super depressing movies ever again. I can do nothing about the conditions of these poor illegal immigrants (and neither can you) so, what is this, a masochistic depressed viewers show time? If I want to see these kind of social or political issues I go to see a documentary dealing on those issues. Again, the movie is extremely well done (is this director the same that directed the Mexican "Vidas de perros"?! I remember --I was still living in Valencia when I saw this movie-- that coming out of the theater I was looking for a dark corner where I could discretely commit suicide... what a horribly depressing movie, what hideous and horrid characters!!!

		<fullReview>Biutiful is a film that shows us the deep connection between a father and their children. He has no money and he finds out that he has no time to fix the mistakes in his life. The film is an excellent portrayal of this factor. Although if it weren't for the talented acting of Javier Bardem and the pristine direction. This movie would have been a very slow and painful film. But the whole picture of the film is to show the slow demise of a human being and the effect it has on his surroundings. This is not a film for the light hearted nor the easily distracted. But if you want a film that will touch your heart and squeeze it dry than this is the film for you. It will not please or entertain you.

		<shortDescription>Bardem and Innaritu make fireworks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu directed three films before "Biutiful", and all three of them had essentially the same positives and negatives. On one hand, the man really knows how to create a scene. From the intensity that surrounded "Amores Perros" to the unique, riveting and eye-opening night club scene in "Babel", each of his films were filled with incredibly memorable moments. He also brings a lot of emotional heft to each work. Albeit sometimes in cheap, manipulative ways, the man has never failed at bringing some tears to my eyes in each of his pictures. "Biutiful" is no different in either of these aspects. However, it also succeeds where Innaritu's previous films had failed. His other films are far too bogged down with these silly, contrived stories of one event having a drastic impact on a slew of characters. "Biutiful" is his first film without Guillermo Arriaga writing the script and, as a result, there's none of those silly gimmicks that Arriaga flooded his previous pictures with. He keeps all of his strengths as a director and got rid of the flaws that hit his films from a screen writing standpoint.What we end up with is a powerful picture that centers on one character, played phenomenally by Javier Bardem. Bardem's performance here is one of grace, bravery and pure authenticity. It's rare for a portrayal to not have a single false note in it, but this is one of those rarities in cinema. From the moment we are introduced to him, Bardem feels absolutely real. The entire film truly feels as though we are just experiencing this man's life with him and while sometimes that can be slightly dull, it never feels artificial. Along with this powerful driving performance at it's core, the film has some of the most beautiful images of the year, emotionally hitting relationships between Bardem's character and his two children and another stirring performance by non-actor Maricel Alvarez. Innaritu has created a film that is heartfelt and real, keeping the power and grittiness of his previous pictures and erasing those things that dragged them down.</fullReview>

It's a performance that is haunting, challenging &amp; devastating.As a film, 'Biutiful' is hard-hitting and depressing. It's lead character goes through a rough time, and the goings-on are sometimes tough to stomach. But, Filmmaker Alejandro González I?árritu, handles the subject with intensity, and is blessed to have an actor like Bardem to back him.'Biutiful' is the story of Uxbal, played by Bardem, ? a single father who struggles to reconcile fatherhood, love, spirituality, crime, guilt and mortality amid the dangerous underworld of modern Barcelona -- all before his time is up.Uxbal is a rough person. He isn't a bad person, but he isn't the best person you'd meet on celluloid. I?árritu, Armando Bo &amp; Nicolás Giacobone's Screenplay is hard-hitting, at times, gripping and depressing. The Screenplay offers a lot of scope to it's lead character, so much, that he gets to talk with himself all through. I?árritu's direction is perfect. Cinematography is consistent. Editing is sharp.Bardem is the greatest thing about 'Biutiful'. He becomes Uxbal from the very first scene, and leaves you spell-bound. An Oscar-Nominated Performance, that deserves distinction marks. Bardem, who also managed to leave his fans awe-struck with his performances in 'The Sea Inside &amp; his Oscar-Winning performance in 'No Country For Old Man', proves his range yet again! On the whole, A Well-Made, Hard-Hitting film, with Bardem delivering a performance, that can go down as an actor-study in the coming time. Watch It!</fullReview>

Javier Bardem's character, Uxbal, is portrayed as an upstanding citizen and a caring father doing the best for his two young children despite the fact that he is supporting the hiring of illegal immigrants. The film has fabulous cinematography and the timing of the scene changes is impeccable. I loved how the film started at the end and then ended with the same scene shown from a different angle. The movie draws you in and you can almost feel when he is going to see the ghosts. This movie is complex, dark and heavy but there is still a flicker of hope throughout the film. I think this is my favourite movie by Inarritu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Biutiful" is Beautiful in Many Ways, Full of Lyrical Elements, from the First Scene to the Last</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mexican director Alejandro González I?árritu is known for his signature multi-protagonist plots introduced in his death trilogy, which included "Amores Perros," "21 Grams," and "Babel." In "Biutiful," however, he zooms in on one character, Uxbal, a single father from Barcelona, facing terminal cancer.Uxbal is a fascinating character with many good intentions that don't always translate into good deeds. While he truly cares for people (his brother even calls him the Dalai Lama), he actually makes a living from an operation where illegal Senegalese immigrants sell on the streets the counterfeited bags and pirated CDs produced in a sweatshop by a group of frightened Chinese who sleep on the floor of a locked basement.So yes, Uxbal is a complicated hero, not perfect by any means, but because of Bardem's earnest performance you feel Uxbal's pain, and he also wins you over with the love he so tenderly expresses for his soon-to-be fatherless children, and for the father he never met. And that's what the movie is truly about: parenthood, how people, no matter their nationality, are always concerned with giving their kids a better life. You'll find that most of the characters (from Uxbal, to the police officer, to the sweatshop owner, to the main Senegalese immigrant) are trying to do what's best for their kids. But are their choices moral or even legal? Morality is a big theme here, and the movie will leave you questioning even your own.To appreciate this film you need to understand I?árritu's style--bold and bleak and confrontational. He wants to shock you, make you angry, remove you from your comfortable place so you can experience some of the realities millions of people face everyday. Allow him to."Biutiful" is worth watching because of the many layers of the story, the stellar performances by Javier Bardem and Maricel Álvarez, and the eye-opening social commentary.Although it's hard to watch, "Biutiful" is beautiful in many ways, full of lyrical elements, from the first scene to the last.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard quite a lot of raves for Bardem since this film came out, and to this day his performance is seen by many as the rightful winner. I didn't have high expectations for the film, but I still wanted it to be a lot better than it was. It's such a grim and dull affair at times. Sure, it's not without its merits, of those being Bardem who does his best to elevate the material. He's definitely pretty great here, but the material sort of lets him down. It could have been a truly interesting tale of coming to terms with your own mortality and the inevitable, but there's nothing here that is truly "good" or "bad", aside from the central performances. As it is, mixed on it completely</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Acted Gritty Film Accomplishes Little in 145 Minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally watched this highly acclaimed art-house movie filmed in Barcelona which was Oscar and Golden Globe nominated in 2010. Having liked "Babel", I expected to enjoy this film at least equally, based on critical praise and reviews on this website. But unfortunately, this film never seems to feel like it is going anywhere. Javier Bardem is excellent, but the script is dull, and the pacing is languid. Almost nothing good happens, and the lives of virtually everyone involved is depressing. As a documentary, it might have been excusable, but as an entertainment, at least for me and my lady friend, it was an overlong depressing slog which tries for some metaphysical moments, but never achieves the emotional clout that it seeks. I am sure glad that "In A Better World" won both awards, as it was a far better and more focused film which led to a powerful climax. While "Biutiful" is not an awful film, it was a disappointment. A 5 at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a lot more to Biutiful than you may see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, Bardem was robbed of Oscar! Here, Javier Bardem's character, Uxbal is so intense and deep that only Bardem could have pull it out. The raw emotions he brings to the screen is to die for. Uxbal is not a righteous man but still we sympathize him. That's only because of Bardem's power house performance. I'm glad that he at least won at Cannes.This is a complete different piece than Inarritu's previous creations, which all dealt with multiple narratives. Here, he tries to dig up at basic level. I won't go much into plot to avoid spoilers.The best part of the movie is its metaphors. Cinematographer, Rodrigo Prieto has worked as a genius here. He succeeds portraying Uxbal, his thoughts, emotions visually to the screen. That was achieved by grainy saturated images, changing aspect ratio and a lot more. I'm sure I would find many new things on second watch. It was fascinating that how Prieto and Inarritu decided to make 'Metaphysical' element of the movie to be presented in 'realistic or 'believable' way because that's Uxbal's reality. That's the way he sees the world around him. The title name also shares a 'biutiful' metaphor in the movie.I have always been fan of Inarritu's movies. He manages to portray his characters in gray shades and the way he deals with interactions between many characters in a movie is just fascinating. Visual appeal has always been a great deal in his movies thanks to Prieto.Definitely one of the bests of last year and I say this again, Bardem was the best of the lot in Best Actor nods.It's not the best work of Inarritu but I can sense that it's the most 'passionate' work by Inarritu.9.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tremendously Good Film, But It'll Rip Your Heart Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biutiful (2:28, R) ? 8 ? other: drama, 3rd string, originalMy movie reviews are aimed at an intended audience of adult fans of science fiction and fantasy. Those movies where the genre element is subordinated to another form, however, get categorized as "other". This one is mainly drama; the fantasy element ? the ability of Uxbal (Javier Bardem) to see the spirits and hear a few parting comments from the recently deceased ? is only about the 4th subplot.But the fact that there ARE 4 subplots should give you an idea of what a rich, detailed, intricate, and intimate story this is. The screenplay (by Nicolás Giacobone, Armando Bo, and director Alejandro González I?árritu) fills pretty much every one of the film's 148 minutes with something interesting; even the silences and shadows are compelling. The care and attention to detail lavished on this Spanish-language film is evidenced by one simple technique that apparently nobody has ever thot of before: The subtitles are rendered in a different color for each language being spoken.The very first scene is of a pair of hands caressing in the air, and a diamond ring goes from a larger hand to a smaller one accompanied by the words "my love". Lovers, we think. But we shall see. Not everything is as it 1st appears.That's certainly true of Uxbal. It's clear from the outset that he runs on the thin edge of outlawry in his native Barcelona, and he appears gruff and stern with his children, 9-year-old Ana and 5ish Mateo. He also drives hard bargains with both the Senegalese and Chinese immigrants he supplies with trading goods and employment opportunities and with his own suppliers and contractors. But, as we get deeper into the story, we discover that this is a shell, perhaps formed in self-defense against a hard, uncaring world, and that Uxbal is at base a truly decent man, usually trying to do the right thing but not always succeeding.It quickly becomes apparent that he truly loves his children and is devoted to them, tho their mother is not in the picture. A bit later we learn why, as his estranged wife Marambra (Maricel Álvarez) shows up all chatty, bouncy, and ebullient in the manic phase of her bipolar disorder. We soon infer that, even tho they still love each other, they've agreed that it's best for the children that she not be around them, since she can't be relied upon to be the same person in the afternoon that she was when she packed them off to school in the morning.And that's only about the 2nd subplot. I told you it was a rich story.The tragedy of Camelot was not the triumph of evil over good, it's that everybody was really TRYING to do the right thing, but it just didn't work out, and things fell apart. Something like that happens to Uxbal, and the weight of the backfiring of his good intentions almost crushes him. Yet, like a heroine in an Octavia Butler novel, he and the other miserables in this tale of modern urban life just endure, they keep going, they survive, they find a way.I've just compared this film to Camelot, Octavia Butler, and Victor Hugo, which should give you some idea of the effect it had on me. Even now, several hours after leaving the theater, I'm wiping away the tears.This is a tremendously good film, well worth seeing, but be forewarned: It'll rip your heart out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch out for Bardem's acting and the way the script unfolds itself!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't uncommon to see misery and human suffering attracting attention of critics and the jury. Alejandro González I?árritu's earlier film 'Babel' addressed the same theme across borders and this time it is someone's downhill journey. While I felt 'Babel' was a pointless tale of pain, Biutiful gets it right by his character a motive and putting hurdles along his way.Titled as the way the Spanish spell Beautiful, it is a two and a half hour drama on the last days of Uxbal as he seeks to tie up a few loose ends before his cancer kills him. Swimming in the filth of Barcelona's underbelly, Uxbal is a middleman for employing illegal immigrants, helps them sell their wares and goes out of his way to help some of them. In brief, he is a thug but a good man at heart. But, does he do so because he knows he is dying?Uxbal takes up most of the screen-time. But there is not a moment when you feel that Javier Bardem (seen in 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona') is not Uxbal. In what is a first Oscar nomination for a character in an entirely Spanish film, Bardem brings out the character's anguish and helplessness as a single father seeking some closure. That includes arranging care for his kids, bridging ties with his estranged wife and helping people amidst a life of crime. The film has reportedly taken more than 3 years to make from when it started being penned. Probably the best thing about its script is that its characters and situations emerge out of dialog and visuals rather than relying on narrative. Be it his cancer, or his wife prostituting for drugs, lives of illegal immigrants, corrupt cops and what drives Uxbal. The setting, bereft of glamor or anything cheerful is carefully chosen to reflect the mid of its central character, its tiresome length and overdose of visuals wear you down. Also, a few scenes showing Uxbal speaking to the dead were completely avoidable. If you can assure yourself that you would watch the film without being affected by its misery, the film is worth watching. Never mind the empty seats around; this isn't a commercial flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much character, little beauty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title, Biutiful, expresses the bastardized world of convoluted misery lived in daily by Uxbal (Javier Bardem) and his family in Barcelona. The illegal immigrant activity he is involved in gives no respite and a great tragedy hurls him further into the abyss of poverty.But most distressing is the cancer diagnosis that puts him on the fast track to death. As he tries to make peace with his family, including a dead father he never knew, and keep his life together, it seems to be slipping away in every way, from his junkie, partying wife, Marambra (Maricel Alvarez), who is an abusive mother to his children, to his failure to provide for the children. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a master of the gritty reality (Amores Perros and 21 grams for instance), especially as his close-up camera tracks Uxbal's decline in Bardem's deteriorating face and claustrophobic apartments and alleys of Barcelona's barrio.If Uxbal were a more interesting character, Biutiful would have been a more interesting film, notwithstanding the magical realism possibilities in calling back his father. The snowy forest scene framing the film with his young father is a cinematic tour de force.As it is, the days are filled with rambling from one disaster to another, including Uxbal's erratic, drugged up wife. We are left with a Cannes-winning performance by Bardem and some deeper possibilities left on the surface. The character exposition is first rate; the character is less so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director on the verge of a nervous breakdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biutiful contains a masterful performance by Bardem but it truly is an absolute overload on terrible events; so much so that in the end I just could not care anymore and this surely is not what the director wants. Oh no, he wants you to care very very very much. He puts everything into his films and Biutiful is no exception - every aspect of a rotten society that bothers Inaritu the director is in this film. From the illegal immigrants, to the way they are abused and taken advantage of, to corrupt police, to abusive parenting, to sexual exploitation, to drug dealing, to scenes of death in sordid detail, to everything other than the kitchen sink and IT IS TOO MUCH for one movie. It defeats the purpose. Inaritu did the same thing in Babel and it ended up a mess of a film. There are SO many sub plots that it is confusing and too diluted. If the director focused on just 3 of these main themes instead of 20, more depth would be achieved and ultimately more meaning and connection to the story being told. We get a very sick protagonist with an exceptionally dysfunctional family background, with a mentally ill wife, a sub plot with Senegalese immigrants and that is complicated enough. Then we get another sub plot of Chinese immigrants and then a gay relationship with Chinese actors which is so out of the blue it seems almost contrived. Not to mention a brother who is sex addicted, a dead father who was once some kind of political runaway who has a body that is magically mummified so we can see his corpse 50 years later, and so it goes on and on and on. the messages are distorted and we all run out of steam to even get to the end of this endless torture. Bardem keeps you there (just). I am sure that this director has some kind of psychological problems that he gets out in his films - he needs a therapist before he can win an Oscar in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's movies are either deep, insightful, moving works of art (eg Amores Perros, Babel) or dull and pretentious (21 Grams). Biutiful, unfortunately, falls in the latter category. It had potential (as did 21 Grams) but it soon becomes apparent that getting through it is going to be an ordeal, especially when you note that the running time is 148 minutes!The central plot could have been condensed into a tighter, more interesting, quicker-paced 90-100 minute movie. Instead it is drawn out to its maximum extent. Has its moments though, but they are few and far between.Solid performances but everyone seems to be acting in slow-motion, in keeping with the slow pace of the movie.Overall, a good cure for insomnia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An alchemy of beauty, love and grim despair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It sounds like a cliché, but films like Biutiful can be life changing, if you let them be. A film that magnifies the blurriness of life, the delicate mixture between everyday duties and death, while bringing a startling yet clarifying realization of mortality. You want to grab onto the moments; when Uxbal hugs his daughter in a final embrace and she listens to her Father's heartbeat breathing the last of his life into her. But it's already gone. The moment is transfixing in its vanishing. An alchemy of beauty, love and grim despair paints the resonant shades of this film. Alejandro Inarritu's direction emotionally assails the viewer in poetic imagery and pure visual intricacies. The vivid, textural soundtrack by Gustavo Santaolalla highlights the richness of the frame. The worldly instrumentation swirls in the tangible, multicultural landscape depicted on screen. The music complements Inarritu's gritty realism: an exhibition of local Barcelona haunts, the foods, the alleyways, the pores in various shades of skin, the sounds of the underworld, etc. The synergy between composer and director forms a worldly and complete portrait. But without the lived-in authenticity of Javier Bardem's creation of Uxbal, you would only be left dumbfounded, gawking at captivating images. The actor blends into the character effortlessly, yet the internal effort is quite palpable to the viewer. You are not meant to awe at this "performance," celebrate, or even admire, you are left to feel. However this feeling stays or leaves with you. The story of this character leaves you drained, or on the contrary, uplifted by his plight and more empathetic. As Uxbal nears his end, Bardem channels vulnerability disguised as (the wise know) exceptional strength. Without Bardem, a full heart and pathos would be missing. He disarms you with his well traveled eyes and a relentless sense of humanity. Uxbal dissipates into the white mist, a character jostling between the burden of his imaginary world and the harsh reality of this one's trivial but profound beauty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>below Barcelona's surface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro González I?árritu's "Biutiful" looks at a world of contradictions, and how people try to live their lives in such a world. Javier Bardem plays Uxbal, a man in Barcelona who procures illegal immigrants: Chinese people who work in a factory and Senegalese people who sell the wares. Diagnosed with prostate cancer, Uxbal's world begins to crumble.Watching the movie, I was reminded of González I?árritu's earlier movies "Amores perros", "21 Grams" and "Babel". This combined focus on desperation, grief and globalization-induced connections with the rest of the world creates one of the most harrowing movies. Barcelona comes across as a gritty polity. The naturalistic camera-work made me feel as if I was spying on the characters. Uxbal's grim existence, his shabby apartment, his bipolar wife, and his efforts to raise his children amidst this are like a kick in the gut.I recommend the movie. Bardem puts on a stellar performance, as does the rest of the cast. González I?árritu returned to a focus on grim topics - with naturalistic camera-work - in "Birdman" and "The Revenant". This movie is definitely worth your time, and I hope that Alejandro González I?árritu's work has disproved the claim that Mexico only sends its worst people to the United States.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated piece of art!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So it seems that this title hasn't been received all too well by critics or the general public alike, but for the life of me I can't see why.From the tremendous use of framing and shot composition, to the outstanding acting and pacing, Biutiful is one of the most underrated films I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.Javier Bardem was fantastic as usual and Maricel Álvarez really brought home the show. She was able to bring such character to an otherwise lifeless prop. All of the child acting was pretty good which is rather hard to come by in this day and age. (Unless you're Haneke, then it's easy.)The cinematography was also pretty solid with some excellently crafted and well coordinated one-take shots which takes a genius to perfect, and Inárritu has pretty much done that by this time in his career (Birdman really solidifies that fact). For this exact reason I can't figure out why the Metascore is so very low, (same with the Rotten Tomatoes score, but apparently they see some pretension in Inárritu's art, because different = pretentious).However, I do have a few issues with the film: .Some of the character logic was consistently annoying and progressively got more unbearable as the run time continued. .There were at least a few scenes with some poorly dubbed dialogue which was hard to unnotice on repeated watches. So it may not have been the most immersive film ever but it's pro's most definitely make up for its flaws.I would highly recommend this film as one of the better films from 2010 and I would also recommend picking it up on Blu-Ray like me, for it is one film that deserves to be experienced to it's highest potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biutiful: Melodramatic Overload Edition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biutiful is director Alejandro González I?árritu's attempt at recapturing the sense of drama his Death trilogy (Amores Perros, 21 Grams and Babel) had. Expectations were high not only because of the success of the aforementioned films, but because it had been four years since Babel first graced the big screen. Unfortunately Biutiful doesn't fully recapture the magic of I?árritu's previous efforts and this may simply be because of Melodramatic Overload. I?árritu always had a knack for compelling drama, but his films never became melodramatic to the point that it turned me off. Biutiful pretty much reached that point. If you thought Detachment was depressing, wait until you revel in the quagmire that is Biutiful.We follow Uxbal (played by Javier Bardem) as he tries to make a living for himself and his kids in Barcelona. He has separated from his wife due to her bipolarity and alcoholism, so his kids have no mother; his only immediate family is his brother who works in construction; he earns money by finding work illegal immigrants and managing a group of people who sell fake designer goods; he's diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer and he can talk to the dead (with which he earns some money on the side when taking to the recently deceased on behalf of others). To provide further plot info would be to enter spoiler territory, but the above should give you a clear indication of what you can expect: tragedy.What works is Bardem's magnetic performance which is what convinced me to watch the film from beginning to end and the cinematography which capture Barcelona in a way not seen on postcards, in all its depressive beauty and dreariness. Those who were enamored by the nighttime Tokyo imagery in Babel, will find a lot to like. Also interesting is some of the camera-work during scenes involving the afterlife. The first time Uxbal walks into a room and the camera slowly pans to reveal a man clasping onto pipes on the ceiling with what can be described as an intense look on his face? I?árritu should try his hand at horror, that's all I'm saying. Perhaps the film's highlight is the subplot involving his ex-wife. Despite her bipolarity and alcoholism, she and Uxbal try to repair their relationship and take care of the kids, until Uxbal realizes (again) she cannot be entrusted with this task, despite what she says.Overall, I think I?árritu reached the limit of what the audience could take in terms of melodrama. Though reception was positive, in no way did it equal his previous efforts. With Babel, there was an overarching point and a sense of dramatic beauty that this film's title fails to deliver. Although I?árritu's films deal with themes of death (hence the supernatural element in Biutiful) and mortality, Babel had more to offer (the theme of communication overcoming cultural barriers). Crucially, Biutiful lacks this 'positive element'. It feels more like a melodramatic downward spiral, as opposed to Babel which ? despite all the drama ? still offered a positive world-view, because it showed human suffering is universal and it is the point where cultural barriers fade away. It's unsurprising that I?árritu's next film, Birdman, will be part drama and part comedy, which will be interesting to say the least.</fullReview>

The film is set in the more run down parts of Barcelona, which is beautifully captured. Bardem is captivating and brings out all of the complexities and minutiae of his character. Also, it is interesting that composer Gustavo Santaolalla's score for Babel received much more attention than this one, as there is a lot more music and I would argue that it is at least just as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More interesting than I?árritu's tragic protagonist is the world he inhabits, conveyed in an unflinching and efficacious manner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro González I?árritu's 'Biutiful' received a slew of mixed reviews upon its release in 2010. The naysayers found the grim tale of a doomed underworld 'fixer' Uxbal (played with a quiet intensity by Javier Barden) to be either too long, heavy-handed or grim for their tastes. In my view, while 'Biutiful' may not rise to the level of true tragedy, there are many worthwhile elements in it that may lead one to conclude that this is a rather well-put together melodrama.The world that I?árritu has created rings true. For starters, his protagonist, Uxbal, moves about in a hard-edged section of Barcelona, peopled with immigrants, many engaged in illegal activities to support themselves. Indeed, Uxbal is a middleman for a group of Chinese immigrants who manufacture knockoff handbags. Uxbal also oversees another group of immigrants from Senegal, who are entrusted with selling the knockoffs; but when they turn to selling drugs, and the police move in to bust them, he must find another line of work for the Chinese.It just so happens that Uxbal and his low-life brother, Tito, are able to make a deal with a construction contractor, after they agree to allow developers to raise a cemetery where their father is buried. The foreman at the construction site agrees to hire the Chinese, even though they have no experience in construction. The beleaguered group are housed in a cold, dank warehouse, where they are soon to meet a most tragic fate.Two turns in the plot keep the action moving forward. Uxbal is first diagnosed with cancer and he must get his affairs in order so that arrangements are made so that someone will end up taking care of his two young children after he's gone. Uxbal cannot count on his estranged wife, Marambra, who suffers from bipolar disorder and their reconciliation fails, when she leaves their young son home alone (to punish him) after going on a short vacation. Marambra is a great character, played very convincingly by Maricel Álvarez. In a sense, she is the true antagonist in the narrative and thwarts Uxbal in making a stable home for the children.Another great character is Uxbal's brother, Tito, who represents Uxbal's dark side. Not only does he tempt Uxbal into using drugs at a moment that he is most vulnerable, but Uxbal ultimately discovers that Tito has also been fooling around with Marambra. The pulsating, dark scene in the nightclub highlights the brother's descent into depravity.The second turn in the plot occurs when Uxbal, thinking of the brutal conditions the Chinese workers are toiling under, decides to buy a bunch of cheap heaters so they can be somewhat warm at the warehouse (he buys only cheap heaters because his financial condition is in dire straits). Tragically, the heaters malfunction and all the workers die of carbon monoxide poisoning.Consumed with grief, Uxbal consults with a friend, a holistic healer, who tells him not to blame himself, since the event was an "accident." Later, he gives money to Ige, wife of one of Uxbal's Senegalese workers who is about to be deported, to take care of his children. Ige is about to leave with the money, but changes her mind, and ends up deciding to stay in Barcelona, and help take care of the children.Uxbal's decline is sad, particularly because underneath he's not such a bad guy after all (we can see that in his concern for his kids). Also quite tragic is Uxbal's longing for a father he never knew; we see him in flashbacks at the beginning and end of the film. The father also died tragically after fleeing to Mexico, as a fugitive from the Franco regime, before Uxbal was born.I?árritu's focus on Uxbal as a tragic figure, may have gone on for a little too long. What's much more interesting is the world he inhabits, which I?árritu conveys in an unflinching and efficacious manner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A painful story of a father, it's a great film but not an entertaining one so just beware of tears.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A painful story of a father, it's a great film but not an entertaining one so just beware of tears. There are a kind of painful movies that show the pain in face. This is a kind of movie that does not show pain and yet brings pain to those who witness it. The greatness of this movie goes to Javier Bardem, the actor who gives us an "into the skin" performance. He knows that he has to leave and he has to make preparations for his kids, and along with that he has to deal with so many issues. It's not an easy ride, this life it's of various challenges but we have to fight, overcome the obstacles, do what we want to do and then lay in peace. Though shot very finely there a raw appeal to the film. We can smell those Barcelona streets or the gas from that warehouse and even that pub that is there for some few minutes only. We can feel as being there alive in those places than mere spectators and thanks to the cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and the director Alejandro Inarritu for giving us a sublime piece of melancholy poetry. Each frame is detailed with emotions or the social condition of the characters and it just grows on by the end. It's a kind of film where may be half an hour into the film we keep our hankies handy to wipe out the tears or at least have the fists under the chin, coz it's not something we would like to see and yet we are made to see a few tragic realities. For this film, which is a rarity in terms of acting, I would give more credit to Javier Bardem for bringing life into the character and makes us feel. I am not sure if there is anyone who see this film and feels nothing for this father who is trapped with guilt of various crimes, fatherhood and a single parent who has to leave his wife. It's one of the least entertaining film though, coz there is no guns, no drugs, no nothing that causes pain except for deteriorating health that is terminal and invisible. I am thankful coz I got an opportunity to see it in a theatre while in Mexico, I did not get anything then, but still I did feel very sad. When I watched it today with those subtitles, I am happier for having understood a lot many details and yet the melancholy feeling gets back. But, what I get from this, is that we have to do our thing before being laid in peace, it's not just about getting married, raising family and dying off, it's more than that. We have our life, but we need to create a grave for ourselves in the world so that when we are gone there are a few who shall be proud for what we have done to them. A 4/5 for one of the finest acting displays by Bardem and a good movie. It may seem long at 150 minutes, but wait patiently coz every frame has something about it. Good editing I must say.Just to mention, was wondering if the director saw the telugu film "Matru Devo Bhava".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biutiful: a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biutiful is simply amazing. The performance of Javier Bardem is indescribably: you empathize in him as Uxbal; a criminal intermediary who tries to make the best of his life in his last months, and it doesn't feel like Javier Bardem plays as Uxbal: it feels like he really is Uxbal. When Uxbal is crying, you cry at least as hard as him. It's a mystery to me that Javier Bardem not the winner was for the Oscar for best actor...Beside the excellent performance of Javier Bardem, I also have a great compliment to the crew. The director, Inarritu, shows that he is an absolute top film director. The camera work is truly 'beautiful' and everything is well-structured. Everything about this film is great!But the most important reason that this is such a good film, is because it play in the 'real' Barcelona. You get a better look of the poor district in the city. It shows that Barcelona also consist of poor neighborhoods. And the way how they give you a look to the poor districts is unknown good. This film is a real drama film, one of the most depressive films I have ever seen, maybe the most depressive. It makes you think about everything and this film is 'a gift to the whole world of film'.In this masterpiece, convinces every scene, from the first minute until the last minute. I can't think of anything bad about this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A personal tale from Alejandro González I?árritu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been an advocate of I?árritu's works continuously, AMORES PERROS (2000, 8/10), 21 GRAMS (2003, 9/10) and BABEL (2006, 8/10), but his fourth feature length BIUTIFUL has been evading my watchlist hitherto, maybe it is its dour outlook intimidates me, although Bardem grabbed a precious BEST LEADING ACTOR nomination in a foreign language picture. But today, I'm in an indomitable mood (thanks to my sanguine nature) so I dare to take the challenge. BIUTIFUL, the intentional spelling error rings a bell of THE PURSUIT OF Happiness (2006, 7/10), under the same default of a divorced father struggles to maintain the subsistence with his kid(s), the latter is a bullish and aspiring fairytale while the former treads the muddy water in the underground Barcelona, with an impending terminal cancer lurks on. Uxbal (Bardem) lives a double life, he is a medium who earns money from eliciting the last words from the deceased, also he is involved in a furtive illegal immigrant labor business with a Chinese boss Hai (Chen). With two children to foster, as a single father, when he realizes his days are numbered, it is a clarion call to urge him to be prepared and don't leave anything unfinished, which is also why the cancer sub-genre has its unique allure since it sets a date, motivates or even coerces the protagonists to take a look at theirs lives from a different angle, to slow down the pace and engage in an introspection like in TIME TO LEAVE (2005, 7/10) or to fulfill the bucket list like in MY LIFE WITHOUT ME (2003, 8/10), but here, Uxbal faces a much grimmer reality, everything will collapse, sometimes even in the most horrid way (an accidental carbon monoxide poisoning results in the casualties of two dozens Chinese immigrants all because he bought the cheapest heaters), his tentative attempt to leave two kids to his bipolar ex-wife Marambra (Álvarez) leads up to a blind alley and his brother Tito (Fernández) is a giant sleaze ball. With no other option, he leaves all his savings to an African immigrant Ige (Daff), who lives with them with her own infant boy, in dire hope he wishes she can take care of his offspring, but will she? Life cannot be more harder, so death could be his deliverance. Bardem is so emotive as the jaded father, with his perpetual greasy hair, utterly riveting in meting out the plight around him, particularly scenes with his two young-lings, a dramatic turn from the deadpan and ruthless killer in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007, 9/10); theatrical actress Álvarez stuns in her film debut, a far more afflicted persona beyond redemption. Being a Chinese, it does pique my curiosity to see how a foreign director does with the Chinese gay characters in their films, but as a much diluted subplot here, shamefully it has been passed over with a vilifying perspective.BIUTIFUL is a Stygian recount of a very personal story, its often wobbly, frantic camera movements linger persistently in the seedy and cramped environs, attended by the otherworldly score from Gustavo Santaolalla, sometimes resorts to fright flick with the spectra materialize out of nowhere. Apparently my least favored I?árritu film so far, its brooding nature and the one- sided linear narrative does deter the general audiences from emerging oneself to a sadcore once more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not among the greatest in 2010, but is a decent runner up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biutiful is a weird film. It presents the story of a man dying by cancer that tries to solve his life and of his children as well, before his inevitable death. But things really start to get out of the control for him, his life is indeed dirty and chaotic, and perhaps there is no way to solve all his problems at all. A very depressive and dark film.It tries to be realistic to a point, tries to show all the troubles that someone with problems and willing to solve them problems at once may pass. But any conclusions about this film may be or not right; because the truth is that 'the message' in it is way too obscure for a deeper discussion.It seems to me that the ending, with the snow and all that weird stuff with his father means that he finally find cleanness in his 'spirit'. It is totally the opposite of the real life presented in the film, which is over the top dirty. It probably is an allegory to the heaven in a personalized way. It is really beautiful in the end...or not. It stays in the air a lot of questions, one of them being about Ige's return to the house. The film don't makes clear in the end if she returns or not, but following the film logic, it was probably the latter option that happened. A thing that bothered me was the fact that i don't understood the purpose of the Chinese gangster back-story, honestly it sounds like a useless and meaningless sub plot and should have been cut.The cinematography is pretty good, the blue lightning always contrasting the dirtiest points in the film was a smart choice in that case. The multi-nominated performance by Bardem looked a bit overrated, but he does a good job and is very convincing anyways. A film not for everyone, but still worth a watch. 6.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but IMDb description is very misleading</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biutiful is a film that very accurately portrays life as it really is and not as Hollywood wants it to be. It shows how depressing and unpleasant life can be for the average person whose problems outweigh his happy moments, with a small metaphysical twist. However, this small metaphysical twist is exactly where my concern lays. The description IMDb offers of "a man living in this world, but able to see his death, which guides his every move" is very misleading. I was expecting a film with supernatural elements which would mostly deal with metaphysical and para-psychological matters. Instead, this film is bluntly realistic and down to earth, with a tiny hint of surrealism in the form of a paranormal gift owned by the protagonist, which plays a very minor role in the film. That being said, although I did enjoy the film, it was not what I expected to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, and stark...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has many aspects to it and requires more than one viewing. It has several layers, including a theme of redemption through Uxbal's children, Ana and Mateo.Uxbal basically earns a living through the underground of Barcelona, and provides cheap labor and street merchants.He is also diagnosed with prostate cancer, in late stage.His estranged wife Mirambra is bipolar and works as a sometime massage girl, her lifestyle is disjointed and confused.The streets of the city are frenetic and colorful, appalling yet beautiful. The contrasts here are shown through his caring for the children . Mateo a 6 year old and his sister Ana, the actress portraying Ana deserves mention, she is especially sad and effective, played by Hanaa Boachio.Overall, the photography bespeaks of a lost world, lost people trying to do the best they can to survive. Uxbal tries to help Chineses illegals by purchasing heaters for the warehouse, but a tragedy occurs. His soul is besieged with guilt, also knowing as he tells his fortune teller friend that he will leave is children behind in a hostile world, he does not expect the universe to "take care" of them.The photography of the city at night especially is beautiful, flocks of birds taking off from the bridge, the steel and cold of the city, a mother walking her newborn in a carriage. There are also some redemptive scenes wherein he helps Ige, the wife of a Senegalese merchant who was arrested, to stay in his apartment with her newborn baby.There is a good story here, excellent performance by Javier Bardem who manages to get empathy although his character is unsavory in this film. The city and its environs as a backdrop add to the narrative, plus evocative and disturbing photography. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the story of Uxbal (Javier Bardem), a man living in this world, but able to see his death, which guides his every move.Let us just get down to brass tacks: this film is a showcase for Bardem's talents, and he rightly was the film Spanish-speaking actor to be nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award.Betsy Sharkey wrote, "Bardem gives a performance of staggering depth, unquestionably one of the year's best." And Roger Ebert says he is "a vastly human actor." Kirk Honeycutt called his performance "a knockout" and Steve Pond says it is a "towering achievement". So how did he lose the Oscar to Colin Firth? Beats me, especially after losing to Russell Crowe ten years prior. But he was still honored by both the British Academy Film Awards and the Cannes Film Festival, which is more than most people can claim. And he got to be James Bond's antagonist, and married Penelope Cruz. Bardem just keeps moving up in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Will Reach The Viewer's Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biutiful is a drama starring Javier Bardem together with Maricel Álvarez,Hanaa Bouchaib,Guillermo Estrella,Diaryatou Daff,Cheng Tai Shen and Nasser Saleh.The title Biutiful refers to the phonological spelling in Spanish of the English word beautiful.It was written and directed by Alejandro González I?árritu.This movie is a love story between a father and his children. It is the journey of Uxbal, a conflicted man who struggles to reconcile fatherhood, love, spirituality, crime, guilt and mortality amidst the dangerous underworld of modern Barcelona. His livelihood is earned out of bounds, his sacrifices for his children know no bounds. Like life itself, this is a circular tale that ends where it begins. As fate encircles him and thresholds are crossed, a dim, redemptive road brightens, illuminating the inheritances bestowed from father to child, and the paternal guiding hand that navigates life's corridors, whether bright, bad - or beautiful or better yet "biutiful".This is an intermittently striking film that can be characterized by a few immensely effecting moments of catharsis, stretched out over an unnecessarily long running time desperate to hammer home every last twitch of agony.Also,it is worth noting that Javier Bardem's searing performance helps to elevate Biutiful, as does Alejandro González I?árritu's craftsmanship despite the fact that it often lapses into contrivance and grimness.But overall,it will definitely contains positive values that would have to reach the hearts of its audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not everyone in the gutter is looking up at the stars. For Uxbal (Javier Bardem), that's folly he can't afford to entertain. His priority is to make enough money to ensure his wife and two kids can eat ? that and tying up a few matters of honour before prostate cancer permanently settles all debts for him.We're not told how Uxbal came to be in his pitiful state. He sustains a number of illegal rackets, including human trafficking, with several of Barcelona's immigrant communities ? but we have clues. His father died when he was young, he had a benighted upbringing (believing he is clairvoyant), and the mother of his kids suffers from bipolar disorder, the difficulties of which are superbly examined. I'm not sure whether director Alejandro González I?árritu ('Babel', '21 Grams', 'Amores Perros') was aiming for a political film, but that's how I read it. His film looks uncompromisingly at Spain's immigration situation. We're shown a sad but familiar portrait of how immigrant communities struggle when they assimilate into a country that needs their work but not necessarily their citizenship. Often, these communities have to look after themselves, as this film shows. Filming is largely hand-held, which frenetically and viscerally conveys the confusion and urgency under which Uxbal lives his diminishing life. I don't recall the camera ever being far away; action is shoved in our faces, so that we are forced to live vicariously alongside Uxbal. For my money Javier Bardem is one of the best actors working today. Not only remarkably handsome, he brings a menacing intensity to his roles. This is a long film (2 ? hours) and feels it. But there's a lot happening, and many characters are developed. It's daring filmmaking, unpleasant in parts ? depressing too. But then, the best art often is. www.moseleyb13.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Babel at least.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inarritu, in the last two films of his that I have seen, is clearly fascinated by two things: intercontinental relationships, and tragedy, though perhaps a bit too much so. Both films are in my opinion flawed pieces of work saved mainly because of their haunting images and strong performances. I actually prefer the more recent Biutiful over the Oscar nominated Babel because it seems to have a stronger center, or should I say it's at least less all over the place.In Biutiful Bardem gives maybe his second best performance to date as a suffering hustler in Spain who deals with immigrant populations trying to provide for his family, and whose decisions aren't aways the best for others. Other performances are strong as well, and it's because of all this fine acting work that it's a shame the story and pacing isn't at the same level. It's an uneven films to say the least, and probably a good 20 minutes too long, but it is one worth watching at least once because individual scenes that are terrific raises the potential of a director who can get back the more impressive work of his past like 21 Grams with clearer narratives and more engaging plot lines. Biutiful is a fine film, powerful at times, but ultimately kind of forgettable.</fullReview>

But it ends with two scenes of such calm, serene resolution (real resolution - not the treacly Hollywood kind) that the end effect is down-right exhilarating.Innaritu is a great film maker. And this film increases my respect for him. It is impressive that after making such a 'big' movie as Babel, he could let himself scale down - do something smaller, quieter, more personal.If you read the credits closely, it becomes clear that Innaritu was trying to make his own 'Ikiru', possibly reflecting on the death of his own father (?) The result is tender, touching...and yes, hopeful.And let it be said, this is one of the very few films I've seen that looks hard at globalization...and reminds us of how thoroughly it is shaping our world.</fullReview>

He earns a living by putting together illegal immigrants to do manufacturing work for a group of Chinese marketing knock off goods which are then sold by African vendors who are frequently arrested by the police despite the bribes they receive. One of those jailed is a friend, so Uxbal offer his wife a place to stay with her baby. His other side job is communicating with the dead, mostly at wakes and funerals. This guy is truly the jack of all trades.In between talking to the deceased, a doctor gives him the bad news of prostate cancer with only a few months to live. I believe the trial of Job apply here, and it gets worse. The sweatshop for the illegal workers is also used to house them, and it catches fire due to a defective heater provided by, guess who? As death approaches, Uxbal begs the African woman living in his apartment with her child, to watch his children, as their mother is unable to even take care of herself. Tough choices must be made and Bardem's performance alone makes this a must see film.</fullReview>

That's why I rated it a 7/10 as apposed to 8 or 9 if it wouldn't have been somewhat complex. All in all for how depressing the film maybe was at times it became almost so real to me. Bardem's films can be slow but actors are good for these roles and he's perfect so the movie was enjoyable. You had to feel so bad for him with all the struggling issues he was facing. That's why it felt so real. Bardem also did such a good job of carrying himself as if almost nothing was wrong especially with the circumstances he was in.

		<shortDescription>An Important Portrait of Underground Barcelona</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a movie that is all of grimy, dark, tragic, virulent, sad, quietly loud, and yet transcendently hopeful. Directed by Alejandro Inarrito, Biutiful follows the life of the protagonist Uxbal, a complex character who breathes life into the misery of underground Barcelona.Raised with no parents and a middleman of human trafficking of Barcelona's immigrant population, Uxbal is portrayed as a scarred and broken character. Inarritu hides no details as to the struggles of the man he has become ? in the beginning of the movie we are presented with a metaphor: "have you ever been down to the bottom of the ocean? It's scary down here." He is increasingly at odds with his bipolar wife, especially over raising the kids.However, there are gems beneath the surface level of Uxbal's life. Here we find a man who is searching for liberation amongst the reality of his situation. Though he sustains the practice of human trafficking, we can glimpse a sense of shame in his dealings, and even a sense of compassion he has towards the immigrants. Uxbal's brother cannot comprehend his actions as he became incarcerated trying to protect one of the least: "you did all of this for a black man?". Uxbal gives no facade at his despair when he becomes partly responsible for the deaths of several immigrant factory workers.Without being facetious, Inarritu carries us along on Uxbal's spiritual quest to tie up all of the loose ends before his death. The cinematography is fabulous here, and the portraits Inarritu paints are artistically powerful. We explore the secret depths of Uxbal's struggles mostly through facial expressions; there is not much action in this movie. Javier Bardem breathes life into this role and gives us a character worth believing. The other supporting actors did a fine job, particularly Maricel Alvarez as Maramba. I was haunted by the juxtaposition of my life in Barcelona as a student and tourist with the underground of the immigrants in Barcelona (i.e. modern day slaves). I feel that I understand the lives of the immigrants on a less superficial level, and in that sense this movie proved educational. Through it all, I have stumbled out a better person. This movie is not for the faint of heart, and demands your complete attention to the details. If you are not afraid to walk alongside and learn from the marginalized, then this is for you. Recommended. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It delivers itself perfectly as pure cinema with a very powerful story, what else did you expect it to be?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard that Biutiful got some negative reactions when it was released and obviously this can be seen, I mean that the film hasn't been appreciated and applauded much, it did not win the best foreign film of the year Oscar, it's rating is not much high here etc. Some people said that the film was overly melodramatic, some said that it was an emotional exploitation movie, so it exploits audiences, some said boring inevitably and I will try to explain why I totally disagree and why I loved it. This is very important, I want to emphasize something, I am neither a professional critic nor an amateur critic, I am just an audience. Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu is a great filmmaker, he tells great stories and he makes great art, great cinema. Personally, I love character studies, in other words, character-driven movies like Darren Aranofsky's The Wrestler. I think that Biutiful and The Wrestler are pretty similar films, one reminds another. Both are "character study" films with a great artistic touch. Both movies show views from a man's life. Mickey Rourke's performance was a great performance, so Javier Bardem was. And both characters are ill. Biutiful has become one of my favorite movies like The Wrestler. I disagree that the movie exploits people by over emotional scenes or something or it is a melodrama. However, like some critics, if you don't care about impressiveness, emotional impact or if you don't expect movies to have heart and soul in the delivery, then yes you may not like Biutiful. However, like me, if you see cinema as an art first and if pure cinema or powerful stories with powerful story telling is something you love, then Biutiful will be your masterpiece! I can't mention a specific scene or moment which I was especially affected, because I was affected and impressed by the whole movie, but of course there are some unforgettable parts in the movie like the sea scene or the chase scene for example, but I really don't want to mention any specific scene for this movie, because it was an experience as a whole! I believe that Inarritu is an editing genius and this movie is not different. Like Amores Perros or Babel, Biutiful has a crazy editing style! Other than these, I loved the movie, because it had heart and soul in the delivery throughout which is very very important for me and having heart and soul doesn't mean emotionally exploitative! This is not a cheap family drama with messages, Biutiful is pure cinema and pure art, but that doesn't mean style over substance too. It has a powerful story with deep characters. Visually, as said it is simply art! What else would you want from such a movie? It is not pseudo intellectual, it is not pretentious, so? Inarritu is like a well-intentioned peace envoy or culture envoy. He likes cultural diversity! We see different cultures, ethnic cultures in his movies, he puts his finger on those people's problems and the most important, but the most important thing, this is not through a "white man's eye." And I know that some people underestimate Inarritu, even dislike him, but simply I like him and love most of his works. Amores Perros is one of my all time favorite movies, his greatest work in my opinion. Babel was almost great. A cinematic and cultural journey. Unfortunately I didn't like 21 Grams, because I found it a bit pretentious, dull and far fetched. Therefore, Biutiful is his second best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inarritu reinvents himself by doing the same differently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inarritu ventures to Spain for his newest movie, the first without Guillermo Arriaga as the scriptwriter. Nonetheless Inarritu keeps very much in tone with his socially adventurous motives, however the focus of the story strongly lies on the ordeals of one man. Uxbal (the exquisite Javier Bardal with the role of his life) earns his bread by fronting for illegal immigrants - organising street sales of sweat-shop goods or low-paid construction work for Chinese. At home he has to provide and take care of his two children Mateo and Ana after become their sole custodian. His ex-wife is a former drug and medicine addict and manic-depressive. Drenched in the greys of the underworld Uxbal comes to find out that he is irreversibly dying of cancer with just a few months to live. Uxbal attempts to end his days by becoming a slightly better person and does all he can to provide the best possible future for his children. His actions however are often misguided (doing bad in order to fulfil his intent of being good) and full of half-hearted clear intentions, which constantly fail to bring any real resolution...Oh... and did I mention Uxbal sees dead people...In all intent Inarritu's feature is a good-hearted well-meant drama, which at the same time is brutally dirty and decrepit in its presentation. At the same time howeverhe struggles to bring a single focus of the story and although it focuses mainly on Uxbal this is by all means more of the same. Several plots intermingle, but unfortunately in a way that all too often derides attention from the main story - the inevitable mundanity of death. The divided focus on illegal immigration make add some shock value, but the subject matter it so lightly tread upon that it remains of little consequence to the movie (although it adds significant weight to Uxbal's experiences and fatal path). Inarritu fails to find himself a new language to tell stories and the unfocused outlook subtracts significantly from the end product.For what's its worth Maricel Álvarez (as Marambra, Uxbal's wife) and Javier Bardel are absolutely breathtaking. Especially the latter deserves all the accolades for his role in the movie, despite any deficiencies the movie itself has. Despite everything "Biutiful" is bound to stick in you memory much more strongly than "Babel" or "21 Grams", mainly due to the captivating presence of Bardel, its gritty unrelenting realism, the harrowing final act and several memorable visual metaphors (including the opening sequence, which is repeated later in the movie, but its worth trying to understand the change of focus during the second showing).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was disappointed by the lack of contrast. The essence of death remained clearly illustrated in beautiful cinematography but the few scenes of fleeting joy throughout were not sufficient in balancing the film's philosophical composition. It left me feeling empty and that the enigmatic nature of death and life had been slighted by weakness of inquisition. And truly, this film seemed to be more of an unanswered question than a theatrical piece of work. Also, my opinion of these types of macabre dramas is usually swayed greatly by the contribution of the musical score, which I found to be a wanting companion to the superb visuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most "beautiful" films of 2010</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought there were several very impressive movies, The King's Speech, Toy Story 3 and The Social Network being just three of them. Although Bardem and the idea appealed to me, I actually wasn't expecting Biutiful to be this good. In my opinion, it is one of the best and most beautiful movies of 2010. The scenery and cinematography are stunning, and the direction is exemplary, taking risks and not holding back and the script is both harrowing and poignant. Biutiful isn't always a very easy film to watch, due to the grim subject matter. However, the story is presented in a moving and thoughtful manner. And I thought the pace was fine, it is not a fast-paced movie but you can tell by what Biutiful is about that it is not that kind of movie. While languid, the pace adds to the grim, moving atmosphere, rather than detracting from it. Javier Bardem is superb, it is an altogether understated performance but his character is written in such a way you connect to him. I have no real criticism, apart from one or two scenes in the middle that went on a little too long, other than that it is a great film. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Down and out in the seedy part of Barcelona.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is Spanish with English subtitles so it takes a bit of work to see it and read the English because Spanish talk so quickly, and they really do here! The main character is Uxbal and I was able to figure out it is pronounced "oosh-bahl" or something very close to that. Uxbal is separated or divorced, and has custody of the two children, a boy of about 7 and a girl of about 11. The daughter was doing an assignment and asked dad how to spell "beautiful", and he said "biutiful" so that is where the title comes from.Javier Bardem is simply superb as Uxbal, making a living as best he can. It involves petty illegal activities, like getting illegal Asians to work in the production of big-name fakes, purses and so forth, and then separately with a different group of illegals selling the goods on the street. That also involves getting payola from the Asians and giving it to a Barcelona cop as "protection."Uxbal is not a bed person, he wants to give his two children a chance at a good life, and part of that is to keep them away from their bipolar mother who also works at times as a prostitute, sometimes sleeps with Uxbal's brother. Maricel Álvarez is the mother, Marambra.|Many of the actors are inexperienced, including some who even work the streets of Barcelona. This is the seedy Barcelona, and the living arrangements are not very nice at all. In many ways it is a hard movie to watch, there is so much misery and suffering, both adults and children. But overall a very good movie, it held my interest all the way.SPOILERS: Uxbal is having some medical issues and when he finally gets to a doctor finds out he has prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of his body. There is no cure, maybe chemo can give him a few more weeks. So his dilemma is what to do for his two children, since their mom is not a good option. He ends up giving all his money to a Senegalese woman with a baby, and asking her to care for his kids. When he dies, he has a vision of meeting up with his dad, who he never knew, who went to Mexico as a 20-yr-old, got sick, and died right before Uxbal was born.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film mainly because of Javier Bardem and was not surprised that his performance delivered. Kudos goes to Maricel Álvarez and Guillermo Estrella as well, who gave an incredibly convincing performance considering his young age.I loved Babel and Biutiful is just as engaging though somewhat heavier. The scenes were beautifully shot and very deliberate and precise. The film showed a Barcelona I had not seen in films and I almost nearly thought it was shot in Mexico until I sighted a Pharmacia. The colours of the interiors were rich and varied and this contrasted with the external surroundings which was usually grey and dark.Notwithstanding, I was not really drawn into the storyline which was unrealistically grim. In fact, I found the 2 gay Chinese characters comical. I do not know what message, if any, I?árritu intended to get across through the portrayal of the gay Chinese.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you had a few months to live what would you do? A man named Uxbal (Bardem) is in a tough spot. He has to deal with his black market business falling apart, his bipolar wife (Alvarez) not being a good mother to their kids, and being diagnosed with terminal cancer. This movie is both heart-wrenching and amazing. This movie will affect you on so many levels that it is actually hard to watch in some parts. The fact that this movie is in Spanish and subtitled means many people will not watch. That is a terrible thing to think about. This is easily one of the best movies to be released, not only this year, but also in the last few years. I really like Colin Firth and "The King's Speech" was fantastic, but Javier Bardem not winning Best Actor at the Oscars this year in my opinion is one of the biggest oversights in recent years. This is a absolute must see movie, and in a week with very poor to horrible releases this one far and away stands out as the best. I just hope people give it the chance that it deserves. Watch it, then tell your friends about it. An absolutely tremendous film. I easily give it an A.Would I watch again? - It is excellent, but very hard to watch in some parts.

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Biutiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biutiful is a beautiful film. Beautifully aching, beautifully bleak and beautifully crafted by director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, bringing his signature styles as seen in 21 Grams and Babel, weaving a rich tapestry of a father's love for his children into a powerful narrative of survival and that painful succession, of responsibility and guilt careening toward the inevitable finale with the rush against time before one succumbs to the illness that fate had dealt.In essence this is almost a one man show and Javier Bardem is in absolutely fine form as Uxbal, a man stricken with cancer and knows his time is up. But that only compounds his problems as he has two young children to take care and fend for, given that his estranged wife Marambra (Maricel Alvarez), who suffers from bipolar disorder and is cheating behind his back with his brother, is none quite fit to raise the two kids on her own. Without regular work - moonlighting as a medium of sorts and mostly earning his keeps from the underworld through trade involving illegal workers, he treads the fine line of survival in mixing with the black hats as well as those on the side of the law who prefer to have their palms greased.If you have followed Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's filmography and career thus far with four features including this one under his belt, you'd come to appreciate his preference in taking time to tell a story, and weaving in no less than three distinct narrative threads here that converge somewhat toward the end, dealing with the lives of a down and out, dysfunctional Spanish family, that of a Chinese businessman and his gay lover whose business acumen is quite suspect, and of a Senegalese family with close ties to Uxbal, whose breadwinner fail to heed Uxbal's advice to stay off the drug trade. These three pronged stories provide for an exploration of a spectrum of emotionsBesides Bardem's excellent performance which snagged him the Palme d'Or for Best Actor in Cannes last year, both Hanaa Bouchaib and Guillermo Estrella also owned the film as the children of Uxbal, being very natural in front of the camera to endear their characters to the audience, making it easily understandable why a father would fight tooth and nail and meticulously plan for the day that he would no longer be around, that there are good people around to assist in raising his kids, that there would be some money available to be expensed for livelihood.While the film sprawls in its narrative, it's the little touches that hammer home the poignancy and emotions. I could have sworn that it was a sound gaffe when father and daughter embrace in a moment of extreme affection and the sound of hearts pounding came through because the wireless mikes underneath their garments come into close contact with their bodies, but letting it remain in the film allowed for that very deeply felt feelings to ring right through, allowing us to hear those heart beats that made it all seem so keenly felt, and moving.Then there are the opening scenes involving two hands and a ring, and one involving Uxbal and a mysterious man in a snow filled landscape talking over a dead owl, and these only made sense to those patient and brings the entire film full circle. Even the scene with Uxbal in a room of coffins also brought home the point of melancholy of the dearly departed, which dealt with spirituality in a deft fashion. It is precisely these moments that Inarritu's film becomes the gem that it is, making you feel for each and every one of the characters involved and the options available and chosen, that you clamour for reprieve even for just a little while, such as the making do and contentment around the dinner table with what little they have.Despite its grim and bleak outlook, the sensitive treatment by the filmmakers and cast makes Biutiful an engrossing, wicked even, view in witnessing a man's spiral into despair, and the touching moments that come when the inevitable is just at the horizon. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still not sure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro González I?árritu has created yet another brilliant and beautiful film. "Biutiful" starring Javier Bardem tells the tale of Uxbal, a father of two living in Spain. He is diagnosed with a terminal illness and becomes very well acquainted with death and suffering. The movie contains a racially diverse group of characters that are all connected through Uxbal. The things he is involved in are far from admirable but throughout the movie you come to discover that he has a good heart and is really just trying to help other people. The movie is full of unexpected twists and strange scenes ? which is what has come to be expected from I?árritu. I'm still not sure that I understand the film or even whether or not I enjoyed it. I came out of the theatre not wanting to even attempt to understand what I had just seen. There are so many issues and emotions that make the movie overwhelming. It is brilliantly filmed and the plot line is impressive. It's not my favorite film from I?árritu, but I didn't dislike it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Biutiful represents the new face of Alejandro Inarritu, while simultaneously charting the path back to elements that characterized his earlier works. The skillful Mexican director teams up with Spanish Oscar-winning actor Javier Bardem (The Sea Inside, 2004; No Country for Old Men, 2007), delivering a triumph of a motion picture drama that is both rewarding and meaningful. His frequent collaborators Rodrigo Prieto (for cinematography), Stephen Mirrione (for film editing), and Gustavo Santaolalla (for film score) combine their talents once again to give the film a style and feel that uniquely belong to Inarritu.Shot largely from the perspective of Uxbal (Bardem), who plays a cancer- stricken father of a dysfunctional family, Biutiful is a story about one man's relationship with his community, family, and his existential self. Uxbal earns side money by providing illegal Chinese with labour jobs in a construction site and protecting drug-selling Africans from police exposure. He has a bipolar wife and two children who are psychologically restrained by his frequent volatile relations with their mother. Uxbal learns that he is dying soon, and despite suffering from physical pain, and the pain of seeing the people around him self-destruct, he summons the strength to live out his remaining weeks through love, forgiveness, and redemption.Like his works before Biutiful, Inarritu gives it a cosmopolitan touch, shooting the film in at least three different languages, though he does not explicitly indulge in the sort of multiple narrative threads that structured his previous films such as 21 Grams (2003) and Babel (2006). Bardem gives a tremendous performance that is deserving of his Best Actor win at Cannes. While never deliberately showy, he communicates a strong sense of loneliness and accepts his life's path with resignation. Although he continues to live on with dignity, there is a kind of fated inevitability that exudes from his behavior and actions.Biutiful takes some time to settle itself into the viewer's mind, and when it does, it engages not only with his or her emotions, but also spiritually as the film meditates on the existential meaning of "struggling to live". Inarritu paints his picture with the occasional tint of blue ? a cold, unforgiving color that channels desolateness and grimness. One of the best scenes in the film sees a tracking shot over blue waters. As the camera tracks back onto the beach, we see dead bodies that have been washed ashore. Accompanied by the transcendent music of Santaolalla, Biutiful is not only a soul-searching cinematic experience, but a film that reminds us of Inarritu's incredible talent as a filmmaker.GRADE: A- (8.5/10 or 4 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alejandro González I?árritu has successfully produced yet another heart wrenching and provocative film that will stay with me for a long time to come. I still do not think I understand the film from a thematic standpoint, because it brings so many different themes together along an emotional roller coaster. Javier Bardem is stunning in his portrayal of Uxbal, a man not only fighting a terminal illness, but also struggling to keep his dysfunctional family afloat and aid the migrant workers that provide him with a shady income. However, despite all of the violence, desperation, and grim this film present us with, it reveals to us that life truly can be "beautiful" if we decide to look at it as such. Moreover, the intertwining of cultures and languages in the film is very well done and gives a very realistic perspective to the difficulties of living a poor, migrant life. I also found the film to reach a very humanistic level, as the situations and dialogs were very naturally portrayed. Although I was far from uplifted after watching Biutiful, in fact quite the opposite, it effectively grasped all of my attention and forced me to ponder about its intensely emotional consequences and the stark reality it presents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different side of beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title being "beautiful" spelled in a, well, different way suits the film in the way that the plot reveals beauty in a different sense than what is commonly considered beautiful. Telling the story of a man living in Barcelona with his two young children and unreliable wife in a small apartment. Uxbal introduces spectators to an unconventional and ethically unsound profession consisting of finding jobs for illegal immigrants and skimming just enough money off the top to provide for his family. The images, emotions and themes in this movie are unfiltered and raw; anything but beautiful. The beauty in Uxbal's life did not become apparent to me until the movie was over and I re-examined the characters. Just as, at first glance, the title is a misspelled word, Uxbal's world was "misspelled," consisting domestic violence, dark secrets, catastrophic deaths, and disease. However, with closer examination and understanding of the title, one realizes that from one person's perspective, beautiful looks like B-I-U-T-I-F-U-L when written, just as the seemingly horrid life o Uxbal may look beautiful to just one person. Overall the film was excellent. Directing, acting and cinematography were all superb. "Biutiful" was definitely worthy of its Oscar nominations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do you do when everything is falling apart?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biutiful (2010) is a Spanish film co-written and directed by Alejandro González I?árritu.In the film, Barcelona is the equivalent of Dublin in James Joyce's "Ulysses." Although not encompassing just one day, the movie follows a few days in the life of the protagonist, Uxbal, as he tries to sort out overwhelming personal, legal, and physical problems on the streets of Barcelona.Javier Bardem plays Uxbal, and, from this film, it's clear that--as another IMDb reviewer has written--he's one of our greatest contemporary actors. Almost all of Uxbal's activities are illegal. He's involved with bribing the police to overlook the stalls set up by undocumented African street vendors, and he arranges factory work and construction jobs for undocumented Asian workers.Uxbal also has a connection with the afterlife. In this film, that connection is accepted as real. (Not magical realism--realism.) People pay him to communicate with their relatives who have recently died, and sometimes he can do this. However, others scorn this ability, and he is criticized as a charlatan as often as he is thanked.He loves his children, and tries to provide a stable life for them, but his estranged wife has serious mental health and alcohol problems. (In a reversal of a standard plot element, it's his wife who is irresponsible and sometimes cruel to the children.) Nothing is ever certain in Uxbal's life--everything is in flux, and everything is going down in a vortex of despair.Uxbal is a shrewd, tough, and resourceful individual, but the problems and dangers swirling around him are too formidable, even for him. Watching him struggle against the troubles besetting him is painful, Still, it makes for a fascinating, if grim, film experience.We saw the movie in a theater, but it will work well on DVD. It is definitely worth seeking out and viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting: The Biuty of Fatherhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three names come to mind when thinking about the best actor category for this year's Oscar race; Colin Firth ("The King's Speech"), James Franco ("127 Hours") and Javier Bardem for "Biutiful". "Biutiful" was robbed of a Best Picture Oscar nomination instead only receiving a nomination for Best Foreign Film ontop of Best Actor. This nomination and the unlucky miss at a best picture nom can be attributed to Director Alejandro Gonzales I?arritu ("21 Grams", "Babel") exploitation of Bardem's powerful performance. The movie takes place in Barcelona, Spain concerning the relationship between Bardem's character Uxbol and his children. Uxbol is diagnosed with cancer and is told that he only has a couple months left to live. Uxbol would do anything for his children to insure their safety and well being, but knows that he needs to find someway or someone to care for them once he has passed away. Uxbol deals with great adversity in his life because of his poor living condition leading him to take care of his financial affairs any way that he can. However, this leads him to the crime underworld of the city mixing him up with the accidental death of 25 people including women and children. This along with receiving no help from his unstable prostitute ex-wife, Marambra (Maricel Alvarez), his journey for safety and security for his kids seems impossible. However, nothing is more genuine and special than a father's love for his children leading him to find that the answers to all of his problems are closer than he thinks.Javier Bardem arguably has the greatest acting performance of the year. He exemplifies the intense reality of the role flawlessly in his native tongue fighting not for his own life, but for the lives and futures of his son and daughter. In this way, Bardem is able to embody the harsh realities and "biuty" of the most complicated and multidimensional character of the year. Bardem almost singlehandedly has created a performance that has lead to the film's Best Foreign Film Oscar Nomination. Will he win best actor at the Oscars? Probably not, but he deserves it as much or more than his two greatest competitors. In the end Bardem has helped director I?narritu finally create his masterpiece; a film that viewers can connect to and enjoy.While the plot time is very short entailing no more than a couple months, the film is very long winded with a run time of approximately two hours and twenty minutes. However, this isn't much of a problem while one scene concerning a strip club has some very interesting images to say the least, may turn a lot of viewers off. One last thing to note is the fact that the film is told in three different languages, none of which happens to be English.There is no performance or journey more moving than Javier Bardem's this year in "Biutiful". The Cannes Film Festival sure thought so, but how are is the Academy going to react?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm glad I went into "Biutiful" blind, which if you're reading this review may mean I'm robbing you the opportunity of. I'll try to give away as little as possible, suffice it to say the film isn't just your garden-variety drama. In fact, variety is the name of the game. If there is a criticism to be had of Alejandro González I?árritu's new film, it's that the Mexican writer-director of "Amores Perros" and "Babel" is simultaneously juggling enough content for two or more films ?at two and a half hours, "Biutiful" could almost be two films.Here comes the spoiler warning. Of course, it may only be a spoiler if you knew as little about the film as I did going in. "Biutiful" contains elements of the supernatural; Javier Bardem plays a terminally ill psychic medium, but it's no tired rehash of "The Sixth Sense" or Clint Eastwood's recent melodrama, "Hereafter." We glimpse these otherworldly moments seldom and fleetingly. Some may find the stark contrast between them and an otherwise very grounded reality jarring, but I applaud the choice. That Bardem sees dead people is just one of the many facets of his character, no more important than his strained relationship with his children or his shady business dealings.The creative impulse is so often to cater to extremes. "Biutiful" could have scrapped its allusions to the afterlife and been one among many well-made but virtually indistinguishable dramas. Or, it might have squelched its heart in favor of a tried-and-true ghost story. What I?árritu attempts is so much meatier than those alternatives. He forces us into the unique world of the film, utilizing genre conventions as the story dictates rather than vice versa.That's not to say there isn't extraneous content. Cinéma vérité is the modus operandi, and I?árritu explores moments that "Biutiful" could truthfully live without. Nevertheless, the portrait he and Bardem paint of protagonist Uxbal is vivid and empathetic. Watching the character work, think, stumble, and succeed rarely bores, but that it does even occasionally is admittedly a problem. The pacing is aided by the brilliant cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto, who adds as much visual variety to the film as it has thematic.And it would all be for naught if Bardem didn't deliver in the lead role. The actor has elsewhere proved himself in Woody Allen's "Vicky Christina Barcelona" and the Coens' "No Country for Old Men," but his performance in "Biutiful" is flawless. He doesn't have a shot at the Oscar he's nominated for alongside favorite Colin Firth, though in my opinion he's more deserving. The emotional gradient he undergoes is genuine and impressive. Uxbal is neither entirely good or all bad, and Bardem breathes life into an uncommonly realistic tragic hero.Like it's protagonist, "Biutiful" is not perfect, but it has the ever-important spark of originality ?a blaze by comparison to mainstream (and curiously beloved) dramas like "The Blindside." Alejandro González I?árritu takes risks that will surely alienate some audiences; he toys with the rigidity of his reality without devotion to structure?those looking to stick to the typical two-hour itinerary will be wading through some deep waters. Viewers blessed with a modicum of patience will be rewarded with one of best-acted, most visually accomplished, and appreciably atypical films of the last year. Maybe my perspective skews high from lack of expectation, but one thing is certain: the less you know up front, the more opportunity I?árritu has to surprise you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a morality play?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those were the days, when in morality plays people were wearing black hats and white hats, then came Sergio Leone and put the Ugly into the center, the human nature, unstable, treacherous, weak, until black and white faded and only gray remained in Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. Biutiful, the latest Alejandro González I?árritu movie is in the above context an anti-morality play, set to the bleakest possible world, or better underworld, of street crime, drugs, disease, illegal immigrants, sweat shops and lowering costs, but where the costs have distinctive human faces. The creatures that dwell at the bottom of the sea. A search for empathy, solidarity, kindness, love, seems futile in this world in which Inarritu searches for beauty.And we have a perfect anti-hero Uxbal, a middle aged man, a former street kid, who did not move far away from where the circumstances have thrown him and also seemingly failing in everything he tries to do. He has problems connecting to his son, tries to keep his wife away from his children, he fails to protect his "client" street-peddler of counterfeit goods, a Chinese young turk is trying to replace him in his business of connecting cost-lowering sweatshop owners with people who have no better options in life and the police with its overt brutality (to which no-one objects) and covert insatiable greed. Ironically he earns additional money with (again seemingly earnestly) trying to help people (for a small fee of course) to pass into afterlife, but having problems accepting his own pending death from a prostate cancer. He is surrounded with a support cast of closet homosexual sweat-shop owner, bipolar wife, non-violent asshole brother and of course crews of illegal immigrants (if they still count as human, as for example in Children of men).We have to give Uxbal credit for trying hard to do the right thing. He tries to help everyone the best way he can, he is trying to support his family, he is being loyal to his business partners and he treats them like partners, not like faceless numbers, he tries to help those for who we usually do not care about (even if for a commission), but he fails in practically everything.The black street peddlers are being deported to their home countries, chines workers are dead because of cheap heaters Uxbal has bought to keep them warm in a cold cement basement. His children risk to become street kids (his own fate, he really does not want them to experience). His wife ends up in a hospital. But he manages to gather some money, to provide for his kids, all of which he leaves in hands of a woman, illegal immigrant, a wife of a deported street-peddler, no relation to him.And there we find finally some hope, some grace, skewed beauty in this movie. Walking past the green shark composed of (pictures of) 500 ? bills, Ige returns to take care for Uxbal's children, passing the opportunity to return to her homeland, reunite with her man, perhaps start a business with money Uxbal has left her and most probably live a better life than the one in the portrayed Barcelona barrio.So this cough-ball of dirt of a movie, after all the wisdom, reflection seems to be dead (I cannot find any other metaphor for a dead owl) is a morality play under all its complexity after all, the only possible for today. There were times, when there was something to fight for (or to flee from, just to die alone in a foreign country shortly afterwards, as in case of Uxbal's father) and these are times of sharks composed of 500 ? notes, whose bite is not apparent, but no less deadly. And here we can compare the youthful enthusiasm, hope of a better life (even elsewhere) of our fathers, with the disillusionment of today. At the end of the movie Uxbal is heading towards abyss with his young father (Smoke anyone?). So are we.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bard rules!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cause you are "biutiful" no matter what they say, words can't bring you down! Well, maybe they can a little bit, because Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's gripping "Biutiful" takes the cake as "the bad feel" movie of the year. Nevertheless, it is still biutifully directed by Inarritu and courageously acted by the great Javier Bardem. The J &amp; B Spanish actor man (bardem the pun) stars as Uxbal, a single father of two in Barcelona who has been recently diagnosed with terminal cancer. Uxbal helps illegal immigrants obtain employment and also is a graduate of the "Haley Joel Osment School of Sixth Senseism" by also having that "common" talent of communicating with the dead. OK, so in the latter end of that last phrase I laid the Joel sarcasm real thick. Throughout "Biutiful", ugly things do happen to Uxbal one after the other in relentless fashion; just a bit too many to be a truly authentic narrative. Things can get bad, but this is unbiutifully ridiculous! However, it is Bardem's tour-de-force performance that keeps the atrocious occurrences that happen to his character not fall to ridicule proportions. I also liked the supporting performances of Maricel Alvarez as Marambra, Uxbal's caramba bipolar ex-wife; and also of Hanaa Bouchaib as Uxbal's simpleton daughter Ana. Inarritu's sadistic but very stylish direction is accentuated by Rodrigo Prieto's thematic cinematography and Gustavo Santaolalla's poignant score. Inarritu and his screen writing partners ghosted the "biutiful" story with a bit too much supernaturalism. I realize it factored in the film's finale, but too much "supernature" provides a movie with unnecessary and unnatural faux ingredients. But at the same time, the screenplay did not deaden the film entirely. "Biutiful" has its own distinct beauty in the most unexpected places; but what was expected was realized, and that is another grand performance by Oscar-winner Javier Bardem. **** Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biutiful Layers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inarritu rebounds in a big way from his babbling "Babel" with this compelling, emotionally draining, haunting and wholly enthralling "Biutiful". This is his most pointedly focused film to date as it tells the story of Uxbal's last days (Javier Bardem - Oscar-worthy) in Barcelona trying to atone for his corrupt life while leaving something meaningful behind for his young children.It's a harrowing play on the "man-on-a-mission" saga, and Innaritu weaves in many powerful themes on family, legacies, ghosts, curses, corruption and redemption. At times the film feels overstuffed by some side stories involving the exploitation of illegal immigrants (a common Inarritu theme) but these don't take away from Bardem's tour-de-force and the film's heart.Inarritu constructs his films like a great novelist: revealing visual themes and motifs, utilizing dialogue with double meanings, creating character foils, and developing layers upon layers of interpretation. His films are not for every taste, but well worth it for those looking for something complex, gritty and heartfelt to savor.Check out full reviews at theschleicherspin.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is full of metaphores and hidden bits that are not easily to catch at first sight. So if you don't have a deep mind to read within lines you probabily would not enjoy the movie.This is about the life of a human hero that tracends from his illness, and keep fighting until the end for what he loves most, his children.The movie also shows a social problem that is being ignored but that we all know exist in Europe. There is another dark world behind many of the tourist cities,and not because many people don't see it does not mean does not exist. Dirty but bright real realism.This movie would shock some people but for some others its a reminder of what is really important in a superflual world.If you see the movie and feels miserable, then you did not understand its real meaning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never before have I seen a film more aptly titled.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never before have I seen a film more aptly titled. Nor have i seen it more juxtaposed. The artistry befits the word; the cinematography, the editing and camera-work make me want to repeat the word over and over. I won't, I promise. However the story is tragedy personified. Worse than tragic, it's ugly. Bietiful is everything we don't want to think about. The heartache rarely relents but when it does it certainly doesn't allow your tears to run dry. Throughout the 147 minutes Alejandro González I?árritu has his audience crying through both sadness and happiness.When it's sad it really is sad. Sadness I doubt many will ever encounter outside of this film. My favourite scene (and believe me that's some statement) was completely missed by the person I was watching the film with. Why? She was sobbing uncontrollably and completely unaware of the wonderful camera-work at play on screen. In one long, extraordinary shot we see the much-loathed lover of a Chinese boss as we had before, at the window of a dingy hotel room. Only this time it's different. It feels completely different. Perhaps it's the amateurish way the camera slips nervously from its position. Perhaps it's the glimpse of blood we see in the blurred background as the lens desperately tries to fix its gaze on something significant. One thing is for certain though and that's the sheer brutality of what has happened. When the murderer eventually leaves the camera follows him from the window to the door and back again capturing, in detail, the events of what had just taken place. The final static shot shows us his exit from the view he would've had just moments ago. We see the confident walk of a man complete.Happiness is hard to come by in a story so sad but when it appears it's so incredibly raw and true that the viewer would be forgiven for showing more emotion in these parts than in some of the sadder scenes. Happiness is more shocking than the other emotions conveyed by I?árritu as it's unexpected. Biutiful is desperate, lonely, spiteful, wretched and wonderful in about that ratio. For every moment of joy there's 4 times that in misery. This only makes those moments more poignant. Javier Bardem's character Uxbal is deeply troubled, the mother of his children is bipolar and he has little patience for her mood swings that we can only assume have plagued him forever. Amongst the many moments of chaos we are indulged in a blissful exhilaration that can only be present in such environments. When Uxbal is urged to recall how he proposed to his wife his children listen with delight and their pleasure is quite remarkable. As, I imagine is the audience's.Uxbal is a man. He's heroic in every way and a success in none. Emotionally wreck-less yet exceptionally driven. He desperately wants to provide for his children and will let nothing stand in his way. His torment is everywhere. He doesn't want to die but there's nothing he can do about it, the cancer is terminal. All he can do is make his peace and provide for his family after he's gone. And he'll stop at nothing to do so. What makes his story so compelling is that he cares. His conscious constantly gets in his way.I?árritu is ambiguous. We've seen so before in Babel and it's even more evident here in Biutiful. The film begins and ends with an owl metaphor where Uxbal is told that when an owl dies it coughs up hairballs. The meaning behind this is unclear although unsurprising given that I?árritu litters his films with unanswered questions. What we do know is that the guy who tells Uxbal this metaphor is in fact Uxbal's father who died young. There's no way of knowing this when we see him at the start but mercifully I?árritu shows us a photograph of the man in the the middle so we're in no doubt the second time around. Again the significance of this is vague; does Uxbal simply want his children to remember him when they're adults? Or is it more about the relationship between him and his own father?Ultimately Biutiful is a story of hope. Uxbal's haunted by his past but works tirelessly to make the future better. We go deep inside his subconscious throughout the film. On two occasions we see a dead Chinaman glued to the ceiling with Uxbal in the foreground. Is I?árritu trying to show us they weren't ready to go? The third and final time we simply see the indentation of a body. Is this a sign that Uxbal is? His torment is over and he can pass knowing his children are provided for. Ige, who Uxbal allows to live with him and whom he entrusts his family to almost flees but she doesn't. She comes back. She provides hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak but urgent depiction of urban breakdown and personal despair...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer for Alejandro I?árritu's fourth film doesn't give much away. Opening with a machine-gun montage of images set to a keening note of tension, it seems to promise a frenetic, event-driven narrative, heady with passion and with threat. There's just three lines of dialogue, hinting at the protagonist's limited lifespan, and then a second montage, shifting the tone to melancholy with lonely landscapes and scenes of grief. It's a slightly jarring watch, a build up that turns not to release but to a lengthened, protracted decay.As trailers go, it's uncharacteristically honest. Biutiful is a film about decay, about the decline of both its main character and the society around him. Javier Bardem plays Uxbal, a man diagnosed with prostate cancer and given two months to live. Even before this knowledge, though, he was living on the fringes of life, acting as a broker between illegal immigrants subsisting in squalor and those seeking to exploit their labour for profit. In addition, Uxbal can commune with the recently-dead, his 'gift' a bridge between the world he's in and the one he's soon to join.This is not an easy film, nor a conventional one. In the hands of another director the supernatural conceit would likely have taken over, the familiar Sixth Sense narrative of a man struggling to cope with a dubious ability suffocating any other plot strands with lazy horror and predictable story arcs. Not here. It's some way into the film before Uxbal's skill is introduced, and it's never dwelled upon, lamented nor questioned. This is simply something he can do - presented to us through disquieting shots of bodies pressed into the corners of ceilings or shadows haunting the edges of the frame - and never the thing that defines him.It's the cancer that does that. We see Uxbal go through the standard cycle, from denial to anger to final, grim acceptance, attempting to get his life in order before it falls apart. But far from a tale of self-pity, Biutiful is about carrying on in spite of the circumstances, making plans and helping others in whatever way possible. Only twice does Uxbal discuss his cancer openly, first with a fellow medium and then with a stranger, a girl he meets in a club. But he wears the weight of it upon his face, his features taut with resignation and regret.Bardem does more than just play this character: he inhabits him, giving an immaculate, sustained performance as a man grinding down as he sees his own end, confronting his own mortality as he's seen that of so many around him. As with Benicio Del Toro's tortured patriarch in I?árritu's 2003 film 21 Grams, Uxbal's home life is difficult, his estranged wife disintegrating under bi-polar disorder and her own promiscuous impulses and their young son becoming increasingly wayward (scenes of familial discord, particularly set within a mealtime context, will be familiar to fans of I?árritu's previous work).These personal traumas are written against a wider backdrop of contemporary Barcelona, a city ordinarily drenched in golden hues of Catalonian sun and lazy recourse to Gaudi and the Sagrada Familia. And sure, those shots are here, fleetingly. For the main though I?árritu shoots it as a cluttered sprawl, industrial chimneys pockmarking streets that run with perennial rain, its inhabitants either desperate or indifferent.This is a Barcelona of corrupt police and human traffickers, of deportations and deprivation. Women stitch together counterfeit goods in airless sweatshops for little reward, their husbands working jobs in construction that they aren't trained how to do. At night they sleep on concrete floors, their lives a constant fog of flu and fear and ultimately tragedy. This is a film comprised of tragic lives, every character broken in a society that lacks in empathy or care.With some exceptions. Uxbal feels for these people, spending his last days doing what he can, even if his actions are unwittingly damaging. And it's clear that I?árritu cares too, ultimately directing our sympathy not at Bardem's character but at the invisible, marginalised communities that are forced to the fringes. The plight of the Senegalese and Chinese immigrants is drawn with candour and restraint, never falling to sentimentalism but remaining tremendously affecting throughout. In a film not light on miseries it's theirs that leaves the scar, a moving counterpoint to the increasingly heartless xenophobia of much of our press.It's certainly not an easy film. At 138 minutes of near-relentless hopelessness it's a fair challenge to endure, and there are few lighter scenes to leaven the tone. The performances are tremendous, though, lending a humanity to roles which could easily have become mere archetype (such as Uxbal's sleazy brother, seemingly bereft of any moral anchor). Maricel Alvarez deserves particular mention for her turn as Uxbal's wife Marambra, her downward spiral inescapable despite frantic attempts to keep herself together.And if at times the sheer abundance of personal dilemma - repressed homosexuality! marital infidelity! - threatens to turn the film to soap opera, the beauty of its cinematography steers it back to safety. This is urban decline shot with a documentary maker's eye for detail, and if nothing else it stands as an essential antidote to the tourist snapshot of Woody Allen's Vicky Christina Barcelona. Whilst Biutiful might not be making it into Spanish holiday brochures anytime soon, it's certainly more than worthy of our time, and it would be a foolish Oscar panel that overlooks Bardem's performance come February 27th.Christian Cottingham</fullReview>

The acting, the camera work, the direction, the script, the environments, the sound design are all loud, obvious, shaky and blatant as if designed to make the viewer uncomfortable. There are rare, wonderful moments here but they disappear beneath the noise. There's not much subtlety. It's stodgy and at the same time edgy, but not in a good way. A touch of humour or a lighter moment here or there would go a long way to making this an enriching experience. Granted, the film does pick up speed and smooth out the rough spots but only after the patience of the viewer has been tested. A real shame the wonderful Incendies lost to this poorly-realized bit of pretension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I?árritu's Least Impressive Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of Amores Perros, 21 Grams &amp; Babel, Biutiful is Alejandro Gonzáles I?árritu's fourth feature film that has a poignant story, is intimately crafted &amp; magnificently performed and yet, the film as a whole remains a largely underwhelming affair that's stuck on one level from start to finish &amp; if it wasn't for Javier Bardem's remarkable performance, it'd have been long forgotten.Set in the underbelly of Barcelona, Biutiful tells the story of Uxbal; a deeply conflicted man who's struggling in every facet of life. Barely making enough money to take care of his two children &amp; separated from his wife who suffers from bipolar disorder, Uxbal's life falls apart when he learns that he is diagnosed with terminal cancer which leads him to get his affairs in order before he's gone.Directed by I?árritu, Biutiful is the least impressive effort of his film career. There are moments which exhibit excellence in bits n pieces but the manner in which its entire story is narrated is very dull. The 2.5 hours of runtime is deeply felt, supporting characters are not at all interesting &amp; apart from Javier Bardem's emotionally devastating performance, there isn't much to like about it.On an overall scale, Biutiful explores the themes of fatherhood, guilt, love, spirituality &amp; mortality and has a raw, evocative feel to it but its story nevertheless feels much contrived &amp; isn't helped by its tedious direction, unrefined script, bleak ambiance, stagnant pace or dull editing. Bardem is absolutely flawless in his role but the same level of commitment is severely lacking from the rest of its cast &amp; crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond a film, rather an experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually love to express myself, others could say, have said, to hear myself talk. Yeah, guilty, I guess, I like to think that I'm entertaining people, maybe stimulating their perceptions.I finished seeing Biutiful less than a half hour ago at our local college foreign language department where I was there with two people I had breakfast with just before, but as the film was getting near the end, I had no words to say at the after film discussion, and I couldn't even talk to them. This film had brought me into a different world, and I didn't want to break the spell, the time I felt being among these people, who were just as real as any that I do know.How could I use the words that we have to describe film, as what, as an art form. No, my friend Uxbal was my friend, and we do not judge our friends, only have compassion for them. And his wife, was someone who I wished that I could help, but could no more than others who I have known like her, who try to handle their demons, and to have some joy in life in spite of the suffering. And the two children that they both loved dearly, suffering all the more because they could not bring their love for each other to offer them the safety that the so dearly needed.The young Senegalese men who somehow made it to Barcelona, and had to scratch out a living by selling on the streets, living a life of desperation that was what they knew from their first moments of childhood consciousness. And the Chinese, who from a different world of the Senegalese were equally desperate to escape their birthplace of deadening poverty. The past three hours in that auditorium, was as different as the setting of my life, in a suburb of Southern California, where crime is virtually non-existent. Yet, those people whom I shared this time with I knew.Oxbals suffering, anticipation of his own death from cancer, watching his wife suffer from her mental illness without being able to save her, knowing that his children will soon share his own fate of not having a father. I fear this review will not be one that looks at how this magic of transportation into another world was achieved, but rather one that revels in the achievement.I want to continue being with these people for just a bit longer. This is one time I don't want to hear my own voice, that would break the spell.I'll close with a return to irony, to my own world where all I have is pomposity, occasional erudition, and sometimes a bit of humor. So, for those who may read this on some future time and just want to decide whether to go and watch this flick, let me say it's not the stuff for a first date. Or even something to take the kids to see. And as far as watching with a lover/wife that's a tough one. It could be a test of your relationship, whether this is a rare experience to savor, or as I heard one person say on the way out, "....the most depressing movie I've ever seen. Why would someone even make such a film."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barcelona is a city of two halves. This film is set entirely in the squalid half. The characters inhabit a world that they neither know how to escape nor how to exist without. Bardem plays his part with complete integrity - although, of course, for the purposes of this film even the 'gift' he's given he uses to earn a crust. Some might claim this is the reason why he meets an early end? I'd say this is really a very beautiful film. It says there is life after death just as there is death in life. Its a tear jerker and a thought provoking visual odyssey all at once. Marciel Alvarez in her supporting role as Marambra conveys with absolute precision the chaotic, frustrated, direction-less mess that a drug induced mentally ill person experiences. You understand her pain and the pain of all those who live around her. It was pleasing too that a racial prejudice was not acted out and that Ige rose to be the heroine she truly was.

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. If anyone tells you this film is a bit of a downer, never trust them again. It may be the bleakest, most dismal film I have ever seen (and that's saying a lot!). A bit of downer does not do it justice. Still, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Javier Bardem is captivating and truly encompasses the character of Uxbal - a father of two, who has a connection to the dead, and is headed there himself (quickly).Already I am sure many are turned off by the subject matter and the fact that it's not an inspirational, feel-good movie. I would make the point that despite the despair, it does show the journey of a man seeking redemption and trying with everything he has to do right by his kids.Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a master filmmaker as evidenced by his work in "21 Grams" and "Babel". He gives us a real feel for the grungy and claustrophobic world that these people inhabit. We absolutely feel their pain and resolve and desperation and panic. We feel it for the entire 2 and a half hours running time.If you can take the filmed depression, the pay off is watching Bardem work. I have maintained that his best work was in "The Sea Inside", but as much as it pains me to agree with Julia Roberts, his performance here is somehow better. It's no wonder why he felt the need to escape with "Eat Pray Love" after filming this one. It should be noted that Bardem is the first ever Lead Actor nominee for a full Spanish speaking role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some thoughts about Biutiful's social portrait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Biutiful, even if it is a dark experience, depressing and sad. It feels bad, but somehow it is worth it, because to feel is to live. Well, it is a drama, but Biutiful also offers a point of view about Barcelona, Catalan society and its social services, and I would like to comment on that, because I live here, and as a public servant I know them quite well. Of course anybody can have a bad experience living in the poorest social layers (socioeconomically speaking) in any European country, but the film presents brutal police forces that either beat people to death, or accept bribes and then betray them; a health system that does not even look a patient in the eye to take some tests or to give bad news, and also nonexistent (or unreliable?) social services to help minors in difficult situations. I think anybody can have bad experiences with any of these parts of the administration or social welfare, but with all of them, and with such brutality, it is not realistic. The system that takes care of kids in difficult family situations is effective and efficient (I know first hand, I work with them), saving and rescuing hundreds of children that have been abandoned or mistreated by their parents, and giving them proper care and education; the police sometimes are hard and unfair, and sometimes corrupt (thare has been a case just now about a corrupt mosso) but it is not what characterize them, rather the opposite, and the public health care system is having now financial problems with the international crisis, but it is one of the best in the world, attending patients from anywhere without discrimination. Again, you can have a bad experience in any of theses fields, but in general, the portrayal of the Catalan social system in Biutiful in untrue an unfair. We receive a high number of European citizens who come to live or to receive medical treatment in Catalonia every day, to put but an example. The film is well informed regarding popular culture like for example football, or social problems like improper contracts in construction or housing precariousness in some areas of the city, but regarding the public system, sorry to say, the film is not correct, and in that sense looses some of its value. Bardem, as usual, magnifico.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hopeless Life of a Man Without Options</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biutiful takes place in Barcelona but, in spite of a few twilit shots of Gaudí's Sagrada Familia, the action takes place far away from the tourist attractions, guiding the viewer through life on the margins of respectable society: illegal immigrants, greedy businessmen, corrupt cops, shady street merchandise peddlers. The life that occurs in back alleys, basements, overcrowded apartments and sweatshops.Uxbal (Javier Bardem) is a man involved with illegal immigrants and those exploiting them: he supplies peddlers with bootlegged CDs and poorly-made purses; he gets jobs for illegal immigrants for a fee; he bribes cops for protection. It's a dog-eat-dog world and Uxbal, who alone takes care of his children, Ana (Hanaa Bouchaib) and Mateo (Guillermo Estrella), makes no apologies and seeks no pity.Uxbal is a man of many faces. His children don't know of course of his illegal business. Nor do they know that he's dying from prostate cancer. His domestic life isn't blissful, but he tries to shield them from the world's darkness. For that reason he spends his last months of life secretly trying to save money to give them a stable future.If navigating through Barcelona's underworld, wrestling wit his impeding death and trying to take care of his children weren't enough material for a dozen movies, Uxbal also has the power to contact dead spirits, which adds to the protagonist's downtrodden personality but doesn't go anywhere else as far as I can see it. The director crammed too many dispersed story lines and the result was a mess, albeit a beautiful mess.This is an emotional journey with a sense of urgency, in which Uxbal tries to correct everything in his life with little time left. Now a mainstream movie would use this as the springboard for an inspirational story, but in I?árritu's world there aren't easy solutions. Uxbal has no family to rely on. His parents are dead. His brother, Tito (Eduard Fernández), is involved in shady businesses too and sleeps with Uxbal's separated wife, Marambra (Maricel Álvarez), a bipolar, irresponsible, promiscuous woman. He wants her to become a mother for their children again, but her unstable personality gets in the way. Álvarez delivers a solid performance, managing to effortlessly alternate between pitiful, vulnerable and detached. Although Bardem could carry this movie alone, her presence always enhances their scenes, especially when they're throwing recriminations at each other.The movie also takes its time to how show the environment influences Uxbal's life and determines his options. I get the impression Uxbal has sunk into this life and become numbed to it, living without ambition or purpose. We want his impeding death to wrest him out of his inertia but this isn't that type of movie. Mainstream cinema loves to promote the elegant lie that everyone is the same, that the world around us is inconsequential to our development, that we aren't defined by our social, economical, cultural conditions. Biutiful is brutally blunt: if you live in a marginal world, involved in illegal activities, with children to feed and no one to help you, chances are you will die the same way you lived and your children's future, for all your efforts, will be uncertain. Decisions, bad ones especially, carry moral weight and their repercussions will haunt you like ghosts.Although I liked Biutiful, I however found it hard to get past its tone. I?árritu is the Cormac McCarthy of cinema. This isn't a compliment, by the way ? I consider McCarthy a mediocre novelist who's been put on a pedestal by people who've mistaken solemnity for quality. What the two have in common is a biblical style, the impression that, like Moses on Mount Sinai, they're transmitting not truths but The Truth, in a thunderous, preachy tone, to the masses. Without irony or humour they go about explaining to us what the real world really is like.Now I remain unconverted to this gospel of hopelessness. Biutiful is a fine movie about a dying man's last days, but it's as truthful a depiction of Life as Life is Beautiful is of the Holocaust. Oh the director certainly tries, by all means available to cinema, to break down all the barriers between fiction and reality: his repertoire includes showing Bardem urinate blood, Bardem pee in his pants ? because Midnight Cowboy didn't take it as far as it could -, his squalid, moth-ridden apartment, lingering shots of greasy steaks cooking ? because in this movie people are real and they eat -, and the two most annoying and overused tropes of the loathsome documentary style of filmmaking: the teal and orange cinematography ? nothing screams realism like green skin ? and its poor sister, the washed out colours; and ? what else? ? shaky camera ? because everyone knows that in the real world people don't have steady vision but move their eyes as if a pang of sharp pain in their brain is perpetually preventing them from focusing on things.Biutiful portrays a world cinema seldom acknowledges it exists. Bardem's masterful performance, one of those rare occasions when an actor becomes the character, makes the journey much easier to cope. He looks so pained, as if all joy has been sucked out of him, that you start worrying if Bardem himself isn't terminally ill. He smiles so rarely that any display of happiness becomes a special event. Of all the movies released in 2010 no other protagonist affected me so much. For all I?árritu's heavy-handed style, there is something truthful about Uxbal, that springs from the depths of our human condition, that speaks about our vulnerability and inability to be prepared for death. These aren't pop truths to inspire; they're relentless truths to provoke reflection. But someone should have reminded I?árritu that just because we're all going to die, life can sometimes also be beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First ? I want to send a warning, I am very mixed feelings on this movie.I actually bought this movie meaning to watch it for the last year ? finally after 8 months, I watched it.Let me preface what I am about to say, that I believe just because a movie makes little sense, is ambiguous, and can be interpreted many different ways, doesn't make it a great movie (good maybe, but not great)First ? let's start with the good.1) The acting was well done, Xavier as definitely solidified himself as an A list actor. 2) This movie most certainly defines the human condition, not just for poverty stricken people, but choices for us all.The so-so1) The subtitles made the movie hard to enjoy ? I know its Spanish but I'm just being honestThe not-so-good1) This movie made no sense at all ? I went on the message boards to get a better understanding of this movie ? here is what I found: most people interpreted this movie in a completely different way. There were more questions at the end of the movie, than in the beginning. No one, including myself had any clue what was going on. 2) If a commenter has to say, "Yes, this was hard to sit through, due to length and tediousness, then seriously, why would you say you liked this movie, and thus grade it high? If the academy had said Transformers 2 was a best picture nominee, people would flock to see it, and justify liking the movie. 3) Strip clubs, crack and boob headed women in the middle of the movie, accidentally killing Chinese immigrant works, dead people floating on the ceiling, no answers to anything in any way, and a death/heaven scene at the beginning and end the seemed more like a murder mystery than the afterlife. Apparently, you can smoke cigarettes in Heaven. 4) It's one of those movies where when it's about to get interesting, then it starts to fade to black, and you say "If this is it, I will be so let down" If you have to research a movie after seeing it, just to try and understand what the heck happened, it's difficult to enjoy.This movie was about the human condition, changing ones' life, and making things right while you can, and making peace ? while the gruesome reality that his children will be left behind with no Father, and battling to find someone to take custody of his children. A great premise ? but why so flipping long? Way, way too long ? at the end, I didn't care much anymore.This movie will be good if you like foreign films with subtitles, experiencing the reality of hardships in life. You will not like this movie if you don't like, long, drawn out movies that leave you asking questions that can't be answered at the end.You will also not like this movie if you don't like getting poked in the eye with a stick, wasting time, or agreeing with the general public that this is a good movie, just to agree.That's it ? read the internet summary at Wikipedia, and save yourself some time. Sorry Xavier, good job though??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BIUTIFUL; Poetry of human suffering and redemption.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Mr. I?árritu went to 3 continents to film the great story of BABEL, his latest film, BIUTIFUL is bringing people from 3 continents to one amazing place; the underworld of Barcelona. I saw this well crafted art film a few days ago in Los Angeles (Mr.I?árritu and Bradem were present) and wanted to share with you my take on this important, agonizing and remarkable picture. It will take you to places seldom explored by others, it will set in motion untapped feelings, it will make you hate or love it, it will make you talk about it.Mr. Bardem is masterfully playing Uxbal and with him we slowly and painfully descend into Hades, human misery and his personal hell. The complex character of Uxbal is central for the film and through his journey we meet some of the most unusual characters, places and situations. There is an action/high energy scene of police chasing drug dealers in center of Barcelona, remarkably filmed by the very talented Rodrigo Prieto; it will stay with me for a long time. Many call BIUTIFUL "a love story between a father and his children", but it is much much more than that. Maybe this line will sell a few extra tickets, but it is more about a extremely dysfunctional modern "accidental" family. The mother, Marambra is superbly played by newcomer Maricel Álvarez, and the children are ever so patient, innocent and understanding. Kindness, hope, goodwill and humanity is not missing in Biutiful, it is ever-present in the daily dealings of Uxbal who's psyche we enter from the very beautiful and poetic beginning of the film. See BIUTIFUL with an open heart and mind, let yourself go places you never wanted to go, places you only watch on the evening news.My tag line for BIUTIFUL: "You don't choose your family. We all belong to somebody, but to belong to Uxbal and Marambra, is both a blessing and a curse."Adam S. Williams</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feeling the pinch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An oppressive sense of gloom pervades everything about Alejandro González I?árritu's fourth directorial feature, as if filters of grey or brown have been slipped over the lens. The central idea - a man of dubious morals finds redemption by virtue of the love he feels for his children - is a familiar recipe for melodrama and sentimentality, both of which are admirably resisted.Also admirable is the fact that I?árritu hasn't opted for the triple-collision narrative that defined his work with Guillermo Arriaga, and began creaking with 2006's Babel. Unfortunately there are still elements which seem to draw the film's focus away from the heart of the drama for long periods -for example, a pair of Chinese sweatshop owners who provide a subplot that only serves to offer respite from the horror of impoverished, cancer-suffering Uxbal's domestic nightmare with the bipolar mother of his children, Marambra (Maricel Alvarez). (It's that kind of movie.) Like an artist who can't help but add shading to a sketch, I?árritu's intention to explore every last nook and cranny of Uxbal's misery somewhat undermines the film's power: after 150 minutes one is at risk of becoming at ease with the cycles of grief. Perhaps this intelligent Mexican auteur is testing our humanist aspirations by offering us a protagonist both pitiful and questionable. Given Uxbal's line of work, the flogging of his grandfather's coffin, and the hypocrisy with which he treats his mentally ill wife, redemption is never going to be black and white.And what should we make of the promise of the afterlife - Uxbal's supernatural "gift"? This consolingly orthodox, anti-life, pro-afterlife concept could be a manifestation of Uxbal's desire to ascend to a place less thankless. Humanism is sometimes frustratingly paradoxical, and often hard work - so it follows, one could argue, that the audience should share the burden. (This was a point made slightly more effectively in Christi Puiu's gruelling The Death of Mr. Lazarescu.) As Uxbal, Bardem has been rightly nominated for an Oscar. It's a selfless, unshowy, half-closed performance; yet another mind-boggling transformation from one of cinema's more courageous big names.There are some lovely touches from I?árritu, including near-subliminal glimpses of the walking dead, or the key scenes where he clips a microphone to the actors' clothes so that we can hear their hearts beat together. There is also a powerful scene in which a grief-stricken Uxbal blunders through a kinky nightclub to the pounding throb of Underworld's "King of Snake". But, like too many sequences, it is memorable yet unnecessary, resulting in an experience which feels more like a slow, tortuous pinch than a killing punch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over indulgent greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot to praise in I?árritu's new movie. The acting, as expected is out of this world, not just in Bardem who is as brilliant as expected but in the scene stealing performance of Maricel Álvarez - who is incredible in her complex performance of a bipolar mother. In fact, there's not a bad actor here. From the bit parts of a cop on the take to the more central parts of the children (amazing complex performances by the child stars), I?árritu knows how to get the best out of his actors. The realism is stunning.However, the plot itself is less so. Bardem is dieing, sees dead people, is a criminal, a possible bad father - at least at the start - and poverty stricken. Any one of these would make a worthwhile movie but all three smacks of a writer unsure if he has the talent to pull it off.There are also subplots explored but not required. The relationship between Bardem's character and his brother is an important and interesting one but as the movie - and the crucial ending - is about his relationship with children and their mother the time spent on it (a good 30 mins) seems pointless. The Chinese racketeer with the gay lover is again worthy of it's own film but it's resolution bears no effect on the rest of the film and leaves us to wonder why the hell it happened like that (what was he paying Uxbal for? to kill his brother and the construction boss?)All these points, and more, are both beautifully dealt with and lovingly crafted but the hour we spend on them we, the audience, would most readily take back as they advance... nothing. And tell us... nothing we're not already getting from the life of the main characters.The message of the film seems to be that Bardem's Uxbal is a beautiful soul in the worst of situations and that while peoples lives may be a horror show, both he and the fantastically adroit Ige - wonderfully under-played by Diaryatou Daff - are beautiful people who do beautiful things for others.The problem with this is that to get the point across, the writers do their best to paint Uxbal in the best of all lights. His sins are sins of Naivety not malice. He is to be pitied. Leaving us wishing they'd cut all the other things and made his character that little less black and white and a little more interesting rather than... sad.Like Babel before it.I?árritu proves himself a master craftsman capable of getting the best out of unknown actors. Like Babel, he needs a better editor, especially at the script draft stage.PS - Can anyone tell me; - Why do the dead people suddenly go all 'Ring' on us halfway through the movie? At the beginning they're siting and acting like normal people but suddenly they're all on the ceiling with twisted 'exorcism' limbs??? What's that about?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biutiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Alejandro González I?árritu (Babel) I only heard of this film when the upcoming Oscar nominations were announced, and seeing how I'd seen most of the other films nominated, I had to watch. Basically this is all about Uxbal (Oscar BAFTA Javier Bardem), a single father to two children and involved in some forms of crime and a lot of the drugs trade and criminal underworld, but he seems a good man at heart. Recently he has been feeling strange, not just from helping illegal immigrants not get deported, and dealing with his threatening bi-polar separated wife, but he senses that death might be coming sooner than he thought. There is something to do with the afterlife, and then he receives devastating news and is diagnosed with terminal cancer, but he hides this from his children, and tries to make up for all his wrong doings and decisions in life. Also starring Maricel Álvarez as Marambra, Hanaa Bouchaib as Ana, Guillermo Estrella as Mateo, Eduard Fernández as Tito, Cheikh Ndiaye as Ekweme, Diaryatou Daff as Ige, Taisheng Cheng as Hai, George Chibuikwem Chukwuma as Samuel, Lang Sofia Lin as Li and Luo Jin as Liwei. Okay, I'm going to be honest, I didn't really understand everything going on and I had to read descriptions to add one, I even fell asleep because it seemed slightly boring, but the tiny moments of emotion and good acting from Bardem, it's not a terrible Spanish/Mexican drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Okay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BiutifulThe worst thing about people communicating via text messages is that they now spell words any way they see fit.Oops! Apparently, the title of this drama is not the result of the e-transmogrification of the King's English, but the Spanish tongue butchering the Western pronunciation of "beautiful".Informed by his doctor that he only has 6 months left to live, Barcelonan criminal/single- father Uxbal (Javier Bardem) decides to keep his diagnosis a secret from his children.Compounding his condition is his erratic ex-wife and the recent death of his estranged father.Straddling the line between life and death, Uxbal struggles during his remaining days to make amends and keep hundreds of illegal immigrants from losing their jobs and being deported.While Bardem embodies the emotional restraint required for the role, the film's subject matter is dark and its pacing is too slow.Which is surprising, since everyone is speaking Spanish.

		<shortDescription>Pity on the back streets of Barcelona</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite Alejandro González I?árritu's professed wish to pare his style down into a single, linear plot, he can't help but start with scenarios which clearly need the subsequent film to explain them. This is no bad thing though. The first scene is beautiful, intriguing and though unsettling, strangely warm. This is indeed the character of the film which, though filled with poverty, confrontation and dread exhales the clear air of compassion.This is largely down to the hang dog but intense performance of Javier Bardem. Bardem is a large man and, with high-profile roles as a bloodless assassin (No Country For Old Men) and a quick-tempered lover (Vicki Christina Barcelona) in recent memory the impression is of a reservoir of energy just below the surface. This penumbra of danger makes for great sweetness in his dealings with both his children and the proud immigrant underclass of Barcelona. It's a performance that exudes the purpose of I?árritu's project - compassion and pathos in a globalised world overburdened with iniquity.I think the film strikes the right balance between storytelling and political proselytising. It's still a pretty grim watch (for all of its two and a half hours) though. Luckily the rest of the cast - particularly Maricel Álvarez's beautiful, pitifully self-aware Maramba - are also very good, and the photography is crisp. I?árritu also has some nice, surreal ideas to bind the prosaic and the supernatural, although these are unevenly distributed. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual, intriguing, and emotional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At times, it's difficult to summarize your thoughts about a specific film. It isn't because the film is necessarily so good or bad that it's beyond words, but because you're unsure how to feel about said film until the credits finally roll. Biutiful is such a film.Biutiful, its spelling having a simple yet somewhat brilliant explanation, features a lot of symbolism that will go over viewers heads. It also is incredibly similar to I?árritu's previous works such as 21 Grams and Babel in both style and tone. The drama is beyond bleak and practically hopeless. The out of tune soundtrack, the rocks Uxbal gives to his children, and people clutching to the ceiling will leave many scratching their heads. Many ideas seem to be hinted at, but are never fully fleshed out like reflections and shadows moving out of sync from their source. However, the film is driven by Bardem's emotionally draining, physical, and all around powerful performance.The scene that really makes the entire film worthwhile is the scene in the Chinese warehouse right before Uxbal visits his brother's strip club. It's the most effective, long-lasting, and memorable scene in the film. In the same breath though, what was up with the sound? It was like it was purposely terrible at certain points in the film. At times, it seemed significant to showcase the sound of the characters' heartbeats, but just felt sloppy the one or two other times it occurred. There were also quite a few memorable quotes in the film including, "It's dangerous to trust a man who's hungry." Biutiful is an unusual drama that is both confusing at times and ridiculously intriguing at others. A vigorously passionate performance by Javier Bardem may not be enough to save what is otherwise a sometimes mindboggling and hellacious journey through the eyes of what seems like the most unlucky man in the world. Even in comparison to his other works, Biutiful seems even more bleak and dreary than I?árritu's other works. What's bizarre is that the film does give you a strange sense of hope. No matter how bad you think your life currently is or was, this film proves that it can always be worse even if the presentation is more than a little mentally and emotionally exhausting. It's also interesting to note that even though the film leans more to the bizarre side while being downright depressing, it does make a long-lasting impression and sticks with you as you contemplate scenes and occurrences in the film days after you've seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and subtitled: Not a good combination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the obvious care of the director, the performance by the wonderful Javier Bardem and the ambitious reach of the script, "Biutiful" never rises from its pedestrian takeoff point. I watched this movie with great anticipation, since it had gotten such rave reviews. Simply put, it was boring. Bardem plays a low-level criminal who organizes illegal workers in modern-day Barcelona. His life is complicated. His estranged wife is a bipolar alcoholic who earns extra cash prostituting herself with her husband's brother, among others. Bardem's character is diagnosed with terminal cancer and chooses not to tell anyone, including the children who are in his care. That's a combination that could make a good movie. But it falters because there is no action. Personally, I can enjoy a movie devoid of car chases, extreme violence or gratuitous sex scenes. But I have a difficult time getting into a movie when nothing much happens. And that's the case with "Biutiful." Many viewers choosing to sit through its 147-minute length may be left scratching their heads, wondering what it's all about. The film obviously struck a chord with some reviewers, but succeeded only in boring me to tears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BIUTIFUL has received major award nominations from the Academy Awards, BAFTA, etc., which is why I went to see this film. However, I just did not care for it. It ran for 2 1/2 hours and it felt longer! I think the problem I had was that I just didn't care for any of the characters, including the Javier Bardem character. None of them were well developed. They all seemed pretty much two-dimensional or caricatures of what we've seen before. For example, the wife of the Javier Bardem character just seemed like "white trash" to me. I realize she was bi-polar and all that, but she still seemed unfit for a mother, and I have no idea what the Javier Bardem character saw in her as a potential wife--especially with her psychological disorder. None of this was explained. Now let's talk about the Javier Bardem character's brother. He was the typical sleezy brother who ran a nightclub and had no regard for his brother. (I could see why the Javier Bardem character didn't tell him that he had cancer nor ask him to watch his kids after he died.) Finally, let's talk about the Javier Bardem character. Who raised him and his brother? How did he wind up getting involved in illegal immigration? What did he see in his slutty ex-wife or whoever she was (because I'm still not clear on her marital status). I think the problem with a lot of films is that they don't explain that much so it leaves the moviegoer with no emotion connection. That's what happened to me.</fullReview>

It is meant to be sad but it is so poorly made that I don't care about the characters. Why is the man helping illegal immigrants come into the country? If it's against the law, how can we sympathize with him? The whole "dying" angle seemed forced so we have another "reason" to sympathize with the character...Finally, how is this film nominated in the Oscars?

		<fullReview>the 4th film of Gonzalez I?arritu is a very strange film. It cant be said that this is a bad movie for it has superb acting by Javier Bardem, good cinematography and a story line that finally takes a somewhat different way than the previous films. Nevertheless I need to say that the director needs to be a little more optimistic, I like depressing movies but I think that I?arritu is obsessed with the dark side of human nature and yes it sounds contradictory but all he does is to film tragic situations in a beautiful way which sounds okay for one film or two but at this point it seems that the director needs to get a new source of inspiration. But at the end of the day I enjoy his work, the guy has talent and probably the best of his work is yet to come. Its a good movie but it could have been better with a 30 minutes edition. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much misery, not entertaining, but very sad and painful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Should have been labeled for people who want to suffer all the time during three hours.If you want to feel nauseated, please see the movie, I am sorry to say I was.By far the worst movie I have seen in my life. In fact I left 40 minutes before the end.I believe going to the movies should be entertaining or instructional.This movie deserves a different classification that has not been invented yet. Extremely Morbid. Bring your brown bag, you may need it.I have no idea how somebody could have written a story like this and be near normal. The worst is that it was nominated in Cannes and even won prizes. So the judges are in psychiatric treatment for sure.But if you like morbidity, sadness, the feeling of nausea, in addition, to adultery, graphic drug use, depression, multiple long time decomposed dead bodies scenes, well go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dark and depressing film, if you want to feel bad without getting anything in return I recommend you see it. I admire the previous work of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu: "Amores Perros, 21 Grams and Babel's get into the list of my favorite movies, but I have to say i think this time he crossed the line. I found no reason in Biutiful, no real argument and not valuable message. It seems like the movie was made for the only purpose of upsetting the public. I want to make a highlight on the excellent performance of Bardem, he contributed to the realism of the film. If Gonzalez Inarritu wanted to ruin the day of his public, he definitely achieved it.</fullReview>
